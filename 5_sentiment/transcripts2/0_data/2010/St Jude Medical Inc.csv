Sales for the quarter totaled $1.203 billion favorable foreign currency translations versus last years fourth quarter increased this quarter sales by about $50 million. We will turned to currency in a momentum, but the actual average rate",2181," Thank you, Dan. Sales for the quarter totaled $1.203 billion favorable foreign currency translations versus last years fourth quarter increased this quarter sales by about $50 million. We will turned to currency in a momentum, but the actual average rates during the fourth quarter where with in our previous guidance range.
 For the full year 2009, net sales were $4.681 billion, up about 7% over 2008. Unfavorable foreign currency translations versus those in 2008 decreased 2009 net sales by approximately $99 million resulting in constant currency sales growth for the year of approximately 10%.
 During the fourth quarter we recorded $6 million of in process research and development expenses related to the acquisition of certain predevelopment technology assets and $44 million of after tax special charges consisting of $33 million of employee termination and other cost related to restructuring actions announced in the third quarter and $11 million of inventory write-offs related to discontinued products.
 Also during the fourth quarter, we recorded a $24 million after tax benefit related to certain annual discretionary compensation accruals that were reversed in the fourth quarter due to the fact that we do not intend to payout these awards. Comments during this call referencing fourth quarter and full year 2009 results, including EPS amounts will be exclusive of these items.
 Earnings per share were $0.64 for the fourth quarter of 2009, a 10% increase over adjusted EPS of $0.58 in the fourth quarter of 2008 and above our guidance range of $0.61 to $0.63. For the full year 2009, adjusted earnings per share were $2.43, a 9% increase over adjusted EPS of $2.22 for the full year 2008. On a currency neutral basis we estimate our earnings per share growth for the full year was approximately 15%.
 Before we discuss our financial results and offer our sales and earnings guidance for 2010. Let me provide a few comments about currency exchange rates and the assumptions we are using in our outlook for this year. The two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical’s operations are the euro and the yen.
 On our conference call one quarter ago, we stated that guidance assumed that for the fourth quarter of 2009, each euro would translate into about $1.45 to $1.50, and that each 88 to 93 yen would translate into US $1. For the fourth quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen versus these assumptions did not result in a material difference in reported sales.
 In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2010, we assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.40 to $1.45 and for the yen each 88 to 93 yen will translate into US $1. Additionally, as you analyze our results please note that due to our 52, 53 week convention, we had one less week in 2009 fiscal fourth quarter compared to our 2008 fiscal fourth quarter.
 I will now turn our discussion to the sales by product category. For the fourth quarter, total Cardiac Rhythm Management sales which include revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines were $698 million, up 3% from last year’s fourth quarter including $28 million of favorable currency translations.
 Total CRM product sales for the full year 2009 were $2.769 billion representing at 3% increase over 2008. Unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased 2009 CRM sales by approximately $64 million. On a constant currency basis, total CRM product sales for the full year 2009 increased 5%. For the fourth quarter, ICD sales were $395 million, up 2% from last year’s fourth quarter.
 US ICD sales were $237 million; international ICD sales were $158 million, a 14% increase over the fourth quarter of 2008 including $13 million of favorable foreign currency translations. For the full year 2009 ICD sales were $1.578 billion, up 3% versus 2008. Unfavorable foreign currency translations versus those in 2008 decreased 2009 ICD sales by approximately $38 million. On a constant currency basis, total ICD product sales for the full year 2009 increased 5%.
 For low-voltage devices, sales for the fourth quarter totaled $303 million, up 3% from last year’s fourth quarter. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $122 million, in our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $181 million, up 13% from the fourth quarter of 2008, including $15 million of favorable foreign currency translations.
 For the year 2009 pacemaker sales were $1.191 billion, up 2% over 2008. Unfavorable foreign currency translations versus those in 2008 decreased 2009 pacemakers’ sales by approximately $26 million. On a constant currency basis total pacemaker product sales for the full year 2009 increased 4%.
 For the first quarter of 2010, we expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $700 million to $730 million and for the full year 2010, we expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.0 billion. Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the third quarter totaled $171 million, up 10% over the fourth quarter of last year, including $8 million of favorable foreign currency translations.
 For the full year 2009, AF product sales were $628 million and increase of 15% over 2008, including a $13 million decrease due to unfavorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, AF product sales increased 17% in 2009. For the first quarter of 2010, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $155 million to $170 million. We expect full year 2010 AF product sales to be in the range of $705 million to $735 million.
 Total sales of cardiovascular products for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $240 million, up 10% over the fourth quarter of 2008, including $12 million of favorable foreign currency translations. Total cardiovascular product sales for full year 2009 were $953 million, up 11% over 2008, including a $19 million decrease due to unfavorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, cardiovascular product sales increased 13% in 2009.
 Within this category of products, sales of vascular closure products in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $94 million. Total vascular closure product sales for 2009 were $381 million. Sales of heart valve products in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $79 million and total sales of heart valve products for calendar year 2009 were $323 million. For the first quarter of 2010, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $235 million to $250 million and we expect full year 2010 cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.65 billion.
 Total sales of neuromodulation products in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $94 million up 21% from the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year 2009, neuromodulation product sales were $331 million, up 32% on a constant currency basis over 2008. For the first quarter of 2010, we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be in the range $85 million to $90 million and we expect full year 2010 neuromodulation sales of $375 million to $395 million.
 Let me pause at this point and recap our 2010 sales guidance. For cardiac rhythm management devices, we expect sales for 2010 in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.0 billion. Sales of our AF products for 2010 are expected to reach $705 million to $735 million. For cardiovascular products, we expect 2010 sales in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.65 billion and we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be $375 million to $395 million.
 If you add up the sales across of growth platforms, total sales in 2010 are expected to be $5.15 billion to $5.195 billion. This guidance range assumes consolidated sales growth in the range of 7% to 11%. The geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales in the fourth quarter 2009 is now part of our press release. We would refer you to this detail. In total, 50% of St. Jude Medical sales in the fourth quarter came from the U.S. market, while 50% came from international markets.
 The gross profit margin in this quarter was 73.2%, representing 100 basis point sequential decreases from the third quarter of 2009. Approximately, 70 basis points of the 100 basis points decline was the result of providing disposition of certain obsolete or slow moving inventory items.
 For the full year 2009, the gross profit margin was 73.9%. For the full year 2010, we expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.2% to 73.8%. On factor influencing our gross profit margin this quarter and our 2010 gross profit margin guidance is the impact of absorbing the first full year of cost associated with the new remote monitoring and wireless telemetry capabilities in our pacemaker product line.
 These costs include providing patients a free of charge wireless transmitter as well as a higher unit cost for pacemaker devices incorporating the wireless telemetry components. We first introduced our wireless functionality in the U.S. pacemaker product line during the third quarter of 2009. There was a significant increase in the mix of these products in the fourth quarter. We estimate that the increased mix of wireless ICDs and pacemaker products in 2010 will account for a 60 basis point reduction in gross profit margin in 2010 versus 2009.
 We expect of the higher unit cost of these pacemakers to moderate as we gain production efficiencies and achieve planned cost reduction. We also expect the 2010 impact of remote monitoring to be partially offset by an increasing our gross profit margin related to our continuous improvement initiatives targeting other manufacturing cost reductions.
 In addition during 2011 and 2012 we expect our gross profit margin to benefit from increasing manufacturing operations in Costa Rica and Malaysia. Our fourth quarter SG&A expenses were 35.3% of net sales representing a 150 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year 2009 SG&A expenses were 36.3% of net sales compared with 36.7% in 2008.
 For the full year 2010 we expect SG&A as a percent of net sales to be in the range of 35.2% to 35.8%. Research and development expense in the fourth quarter of 2009 were 12.1% of net sales consistent with the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year 2009, R&D expenses were 12.2% of net sales consistent with 2008.
 For the full year 2010 we expect R&D expenses to be in the range of 12.0% to 12.6% of net sales as we continue to balance delivering short term results with the right investment in long term growth drivers. Other expense was $20 million in the fourth quarter. For the first quarter of 2010, we expect the other income and expense line item will be a net expense of approximately $17 million.
 For the full year 2010 we expect other expense of approximately $68 to $73 million primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt. For 2009 our effective income tax rate was 26.5% for 2010 we expect to be effective tax rate to be in the range of 24.5% to 25%.
 This rate assumes that the R&D tax credit is extended for 2010. The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2010 reflects the expansion of manufacturing operations in more favorable tax jurisdictions. We expect this trend to continue as our new manufacturing facilities and Costa Rica and Malaysia come online.
 Moving on to the balance sheet, at the end of the fourth quarter we had $393 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.922 billion in total outstanding debt and $1 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The debt on our balance sheet consists of the $1.2 billion public offering of senior debt issued in the third quarter of 2009 with $700 million due in 2014 and $500 million due in 2019.
 In addition to the senior notes the outstanding debt primarily represents $432 million of borrowings under our domestic credit facilities, which mature in 2011 and $297 million of notes issued in Japan, which mature in 2010 and 2011.
 Next I want to offer some comments regarding our EPS outlook for the first quarter and full year 2010. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the first quarter of 2010, the share account used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 326 million to 328 million shares with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2010 estimated at 328 million to 330 million.
 This guidance on outstanding shares takes into account that during the fourth quarter of 2009, we completed our $500 million share repurchase program that was announced that October, resulting in a reduction of 14.1 million shares of common stock. The company expects consolidated EPS for the first quarter of 2010 to be in the range of $0.66 to $0.68. For the full year 2010, we expect consolidated EPS to be in the range of $2.71 to $2.76. This expectation represents EPS growth of approximately 12% to 14% over the 2009 adjusted EPS of $2.43.
 I would now like to turn it back to Dan Starks.

I’m pleased to confirm that here at St. Jude Medical, we did what we said; we would do during the fourth quarter of 2009. We delivered quarterly results that meet or exceed our guidance. We completed numerous organizational, leadership",867," Thank you, John. I’m pleased to confirm that here at St. Jude Medical, we did what we said; we would do during the fourth quarter of 2009. We delivered quarterly results that meet or exceed our guidance. We completed numerous organizational, leadership and program changes designed to improve operating discipline in overall organizational effectiveness leaving into 2010.
 This included restructuring and flattening our marketing organization, strengthening our forecasting methodology, redirecting spending priorities where appropriate, and holding accountability for cost effective results. As a result of the restructuring, we started in the third quarter of 2009 and completed in the fourth quarter. We have now reduced our total global workforce by almost 5%.
 SG&A spending as 1% of sales dropped a full 150 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the same quarter one year ago. We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter moving forward, but for full year 2010, we expect SG&A to stay below 36% of sales, while we implement programs in 2010 that are designed to further improve productivity of SG&A spending in future years.
 This includes investment to complete the implementation of our SAP enterprise software system and investment to bring online by the end of 2010, new manufacturing facilities in Brazil, Costa Rica and Malaysia to compliment the new manufacturing facilities we recently brought online in South Carolina and in Puerto Rico.
 It is important to note that, although we have a strong commitment to optimizing our cost structure and generating operating leverage, we invested more in research and development on an absolute dollar basis during the fourth quarter than in any other single quarter in the history of our company.
 We plan to continue to invest at least 12% of sales in R&D moving forward with a strong focus on continued investment in clinical trials to the benefit of our customers and the patients they serve. The benefits of our sustained commitment to R&D should be highly visible during 2010. We expect to launch over 15 new products within our Cardiac Rhythm Management franchise.
 We will expand our entry into the deep brain stimulation market in Europe, the spinal cord stimulation market in Japan, and the pericardial segment of the tissue valve market as we continue to invest long term in transcatheter valve therapies, applications for MediGuide Technology, heart failure diagnostics, ischemia detection, our Atrial Fibrillation program, depression, and other long term growth programs.
 We look forward to giving you an overview at our investor conference next week of our entire line up of new products scheduled for release in 2010 along with additional insides into a selection of our longer term growth drivers.
 Next, I’d like to offer an update on the overall growth dynamics we see for our global Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM franchise in 2010. We continued to expect the global CRM market to grow at a mid single digit rate, which we define as approximately 4% to 6% growth on a constant currency basis.
 We estimate that St. Jude Medical’s international CRM business grew faster than the market in 2009 and is on track to do so again in 2010. The sales from St. Jude Medical’s U.S. CRM business were virtually flat in 2009, but we expect the return to growth in 2010 and our optimistic that the U.S. portion of our CRM business will get back on track to grow faster than the market in 2010.
 Our optimism is based on ongoing improvements in sales force effectiveness, customer inventory destocking that occurred in the second half of 2009 that is not expected to recur 2010, replacement market dynamics that favorably impact St. Jude Medical’s position in this segment in the market and the strength of our flow of new products that we will review in more detail at our investor conference next week.
 The mid point of our CRM sales guidance range for 2010 reflects growth of approximately 6.5% for CRM sales. We fully expect to meet or exceed this guidance range. In summary this morning, we place a high priority on meeting or exceeding our expectations with respect to St. Jude Medical as a whole, we expect to deliver high single digit or low double digit organic sales growth for full year 2010.
 We are committed to and I am focused on St. Jude Medical maintaining strong operating discipline and delivering meaningful EPS leverage while we continue to invest in our diverse portfolio of long term growth drivers. In short, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sales and earnings growth toward the top end of our peer group.
 At our annual investor conference next week, we look forward to providing all of you with extensive information on our assessment of market dynamics, new product introductions, clinical trial programs, and our comprehensive growth program for 2010. We will be happy to touch on these topics briefly in this mornings call, but we would like to defer more complete discussion to our forum next week we look forward to seeing many of you there.
 With that, I’d like to turn it back to the moderator and open it up for questions, Celez would you please host the questions?

We had a higher percent of sales that were international in the fourth quarter and that’s continued to expand as a growth driver in our business so there’s a little bit of impact there. There’s some product mix impact victory, so it’s a number of factors, but and the key point is that although we expect to see some softness in gross margin during 2010.
 We expect to bridge over and recover that in 2011 and 2012 partly as a function of volume increase in the low voltage RF telemetry portion of our product line and partly as a function of getting through the startup challenges of the RF telemetry and the low voltage portion of our product line and as well as just a number of other dynamics.
 We expect to see some additional contribution from the U.S. portion of our ICD business moving forward as well, so there’s a number of factors it going to impact gross margin and continue to strengthen the gross margin longer term.
 With respect to average selling prices, we found ASPs to be really we saw nothing unusual in ASP trends during the fourth quarter, so we indicate that we regularly see ASP pressure, that on an apples-to-apples basis overtime we expect to see ASP reductions somewhere in the range we generally say in the range of about 2% to 3% a year. In the fourth quarter itself, there was no special event or observations that we made regarding ASPs. The ASPs generally behaved as expected and as historically anticipated.

In the third quarter of 2009 on the same basis in the United States there were 64 selling days and in the fourth quarter a year ago calculated on the same basis there were 64 selling days.
 So that’s something that definitely has an impact as you look at the sequential quarter trends and as you look at the year-over-year trends, 60 days in Q4 of 2009 versus 64 days in both of the prior comparative periods. Then a second point on the CRM side of things in particular, we did see continued customer destocking of inventory in the fourth quarter.
 One quarter ago, we were surprised by the level of customer destocking of inventory that we saw when we gave our guidance for the fourth quarter one quarter ago, we indicated that our guidance was taking into account the opportunity for inventory destocking to continue through the fourth quarter, and we did see more customer destocking of inventory in the fourth quarter. So that’s another factor that one ought to take into account in working to understand the impact of fourth quarter results and what it implies for our sales growth in 2010.

A couple of the dynamics that typically are going on include managing new product introductions and that’s definitely a dynamic that we’re constantly dealing with, and the other thing that happened is we turned on part of our SAP implementation.
 We’ve talked about that activity that’s going on and we turned that on in a number of geographies and we really preloaded some inventory into our own sites to be prepared for that cutover and now that was very successful and is behind us here as we start the New Year. So we have a plan internally to really work down our inventory as we go through 2010 and it really will have a smooth effect on our costs as we absorb them in the manufacturing process and it is really not all that significant in the scheme of things.
 So what we really tried to call out is the one item that we are absorbing in 2010 related to some of the higher costs associated with the wireless functionality in our pacemaker product line, but we have some other things going the other way and we’ve really factored all of that into our thinking as we’ve provided guidance this morning.

 So that will start to impact 2011 we’ll start to see it in 2011.

I don’t think our range is really wider to tell you the truth and you maybe able to correct me in an offline discussion, but I think this is the kind of range that we typically started out with for full year and the quarterly, the guidance we’ve given for Q1 are really very consistent with the scope of range that we’ve given previously.
 So we start out the year with a little bit wider range traditionally, we tighten the range as we move through the year. So I think this is really very normal, but a couple of things that I could observe. If you thought about 2009 sales on an organic constant currency basis, 2009 sales growth was in round numbers about 8%. So our total constant currency sales growth in 2009 was 10%.
 We had factored in there probably about $80 million of acquired sales from our acquisition of Radi Medical and about $10 million of acquired sales from our prior acquisition of EP MedSystems. So if you back out that $90 million of acquired sales and do the growth calculation and state it in constant currency you show about an 8% sales growth for our top line constant currency organic in 2009.
 Another little tweak that just kind of for completeness a little tweak there’s that sales growth in 2009 versus prior year, they had another week, so just the math on that prior week is about a 1.9% impact. It’s not really that much impact given the interaction with the holiday, but it’s still about a point of impact on our percentage growth.
 So if you kind of said normalized apples-to-apples organic constant currency growth 2009, what we deliver is probably closer to 9% than to 8%. So that’s the business as is and that’s the business with our U.S. pacer and ICD component comprising about 32% of our total sales mix and generating virtually no growth contribution in 2009 and so that’s our starting point looking forward into 2010.
 The guidance we’ve given with that kind of base growth profile, the guidance we’ve given is a range of 7% to 11%. We are determined to be sure that we meet or exceed the guidance range that we have and so you might start to read between the lines and see that we have quite a bit of confidence in the top line growth range that we’ve articulated this morning.
 To the extent that raises more questions, I’ll work to offer a good presentation on this topic next week at the investor conference. That will be one of the themes of my introductory overview to review; what are the markets that we’re in; what are the kind of the natural growth rates of the markets we’re in; what about the impact of some modest reasonable, credible continued share gain in portions of our business; what about the impact of continuing to enter new segments of markets. For example our entry into the pericardial stented tissue valve segment of the heart valve market the second half of 2010.
 So I’ll put all of that together next week and work to give a good view of our optimism and confidence with respect to top line growth. I’m not going to impeach the guidance that we’ve given this morning. Our guidance is 7% to 11%. Our goal though is to accelerate top line growth in 2010, so we’re always working and if we can’t exceed the guidance that we give.

So take that as the starting point and you’ll see that the guidance we’ve given for SG&A for 2010 versus the SG&A that we delivered in 2009, gives us some room to continue to expand SG&A investment as a percentage of sales you want it in a modest level.
 So we’re not suggesting that we’re going to maintain 35.3% of sales SG&A level through 2010. We continue to be very focused on growth in the same way that you see our continued expanded investment in R&D in the fourth quarter of 2009 and we expect to continue that in 2010. We also will invest and expand our investment as appropriate in SG&A to support our growth programs.
 So our goal isn’t to squeeze out as much as we can. Our goal is just to have measured continuous improvement in SG&A productivity as we bring SG&A investment more in line to best competitive benchmarks that’s one thing, but on the other hand, where we are going to continue to expand SG&A investment to support our continued long term growth program in 2010, so we’re really trying to strike a balance and that’s about the best I could say to you.

To look at the current trends in the business and then the reason we’re talking about it at all, is just to calibrate growth expectations for 2010 and our growth expectation for 2010, really are not based on our assessment of impact of selling day difference Q4 ‘09 versus Q4 ‘08.

We’re still in the relative infancy of the development of the AF opportunity.
 We’ve gone past the point where it’s really controversial about whether the AF opportunity in fact is real and whether it’s going to develop. I think we now have a consensus that this growth opportunity is real and developing and on track. So I think if we looked at how long did it take for the ICD market to really go from first clinical experience and first successes to coming into its prime. That was probably about it was 15 or 20 year development program.
 So we have to be patient and our expectations are really calibrated to the idea that this takes time, but we’re now at the level where there is a lot of clinical data coming from a lot of centers in the United States and outside the United States. To me, the most interesting new event in the AF space is the initiation of this CABANA trial. We’ve indicated in the past that, we think of the CABANA trial as being analogues scud have for the ICD market.
 So we are looking forward to Dr. Packers’ presentation of the feasibility data from the CABANA trial. My understanding is that those data have been submitted for late breaking clinical trial at presentation at the ACC. I don’t know if the data will be part of the late breaking clinical trials, if it’s not it will subsequently be published elsewhere, but so that would be one thing to look for is the feasibility data the CABANA trial and in the CABANA trial, enrollment is now either under way or about to start.
 So the trial is, there have been several meetings of the investigators for the CABANA trial and it’s all systems go and I’m not close enough to the details of it to talk about exactly what the state of enrollment is although it’s either about to get underway or it’s just gotten under way. So that’s what I think of as being the biggest deal. Now it will take obviously the thinking there it’s 3,000 patients, the thinking is that maybe about a three year enrollment period.
 It’s a two year follow-up period and it will be just pristine great data everybody on the real world of Atrial Fibrillation ablation, and what the economic impact of it is, what the cost effectiveness of it is, and what the clinical effectiveness of it is? So in between here and there, I expect to see the market just continue to develop in the way that these markets do and we’re gratified that it seems like it’s all systems go.

The point I made a couple weeks ago was that, although in the past we’ve organized",543," For those who didn’t hear my complete remarks a couple weeks ago, people are to be awfully careful about just taking a SoundBite or two away from my complete remarks. The point I made a couple weeks ago was that, although in the past we’ve organized our business to deliver a minimum 15% growth in EPS.
 Two things, one is that there are new factors and I particularly said that there’s a new factor of medical device fee, which can impact EPS growth somewhere in the range of four to five points and there are other factors as well, but there are new factors that we need to be realistic about number one.
 Number two, in view of these new factors while we seek clarification, I indicated these are new factors that are revolving and as they continue to evolve, we’re just going to be more flexible about minimum EPS growth. That was my point and you’ll see that in the transcript and you’ll see it in the slides that I presented that takeaway was that we’re not going to be locked into 15% growth no matter, what on EPS that we’re going to be more flexible.
 We’re always balancing, how committed the are we to what level of short term EPS result versus what level of continued investment in our long term growth and success, and so we’re not going to be backed in a corner of saying well, in the past we said 15%. So we just need to make whatever cuts in long term investment, we have to deliver 15% growth. That’s an option.
 I know a CEO’s of our peer companies indicated that if the medical device fee came in that his organization was going to be making severe cuts and my point was that’s not what we’re going to do. We’re here for the long term. If we need to be more flexible about short term results from time-to-time in favor of continuing to maintain robust investment in long term growth and success, we’ll do it, so that was my point.
 I’ll stand by that and you see too then that the guidance we’ve given here for 2010 is EPS growth, if you bring it down to the decimal point it’s about 11.5% to 13.6%, we’ve rounded it to 12% to14%, so we just offered guidance this morning of 12% to 14% growth, and as we completed our operating plan here since the last call and got ourselves comfortable with just what’s our expectation here for 2010, what’s the level of guidance we’re going to give in 2010.
 You’re not going to find me, speaking out of both sides of my mouth saying we’re going to organize ourselves to a minimum 15% growth and by the way our guidance is 12% to 14%, so it’s easy to take SoundBites and jump to the wrong conclusion and start to extrapolate things I didn’t say at all.
 But in context, my point was that there maybe lumpiness, there’s new stresses, we’re going to be flexible, we’re going to have an appropriate balance of focus on short term results and continued investment in our long term success and you’ll see it reflected in the guidance that we’ve given for 2010.

We will turn to currency in a moment but the actual average rates during the fourth quarter were within our previous guidance range. For the full year 2009, net sales were $4,681,000,000, up about 7% over 2008. Unfavorable foreign currency translations versus those in 2008 decreased 2009's net sales by approximately $99 million resulting in constant currency sales growth for the year of approximately 10%.During the fourth quarter, we recorded $6 million of in-process research and development expenses related to the acquisition of certain pre-development technology assets and $44 million of after-tax special charges, consisting of $33 million of employee termination and other costs related to restructuring actions announced in the third quarter, and the $11 million of inventory write-offs related to discontinued products.Also during the fourth quarter, we recorded a $24 million after-tax benefit related to certain annual discretionary compensation accruals that were reversed in the fourth quarter due to the fact that we do not intend to pay out these awards. Comments during this call referencing fourth quarter and full year 2009 results including EPS amounts will be exclusive of these items.Earnings per share were $0.64 for the fourth quarter of 2009, a 10% increase over adjusted EPS of $0.58 in the fourth quarter of 2008 and above our guidance range of $0.61 to $0.63. For the full year 2009, adjusted earnings per share were $2.43, a 9% increase over adjusted EPS of $2.22 for the full year 2008.  On a currency neutral basis, we estimate our earnings per share growth for the full year was approximately 15%.Before we discuss our financial results and offer our sales and earnings guidance for 2010, let me provide a few comments about currency exchange rates and the assumptions we are using in our outlook for this year. The two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. On our conference call one quarter ago, we stated that our guidance assumed that for the fourth quarter of 2009, each euro would translate into about $1.45 to $1.50 and that each 88 yen to 93 yen would translate into USD $1. For the fourth quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen versus these assumptions did not result in a material difference in reported sales.In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2010, we are assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.40 to $1.45. And for the yen, each 88 yen to 93 yen will translate into USD $1. Additionally, as you analyze our results, please note that due to our 52, 53 week convention, we had one less week in our 2009 fiscal fourth quarter compared to our 2008 fiscal fourth quarter.I will now turn our discussion to the sales by product category. For the fourth quarter, total Cardiac Rhythm Management sales which include revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines were $698 million, up 3% from last year's fourth quarter, including $28 million of favorable foreign currency translations. Total CRM product sales for the full year 2009 were $2,769,000,000 representing a 3% increase over 2008. Unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased 2009 CRM sales by approximately $64 million. On a constant currency basis, total CRM product sales for the full year 2009 increased 5%. For the fourth quarter, ICD sales were $395 million, up 2% from last year's fourth quarter. U.S. ICD sales were $237 million, international ICD sales were $158 million, a 14% increase over the fourth quarter of 2008, including $13 million of favorable foreign currency translations.For the full year 2009, ICD sales were $1,578,000,000, up 3% versus 2008. Unfavorable foreign currency translations versus those in 2008 decreased 2009 ICD sales by approximately $38 million. On a constant currency basis, total ICD product sales for the full year 2009 increased 5%.For low voltage devices, sales for the fourth quarter totaled $303 million, up 3% from last year's fourth quarter. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $122 million. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $181 million, up 13% from the fourth quarter of 2008, including $15 million of favorable foreign currency translations.For the year 2009, pacemaker sales were $1,191,000,000, up 2% over 2008. Unfavorable foreign currency translations versus those in 2008 decreased 2009's pacemaker sales by approximately $26 million. On a constant currency basis, total pacemaker product sales for the full year 2009 increased 4%.For the first quarter of 2010, we expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $700 million to  $730 million. And for the full year 2010, we expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.0 billion.Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the fourth quarter totaled $171 million, up 10% over the fourth quarter of last year, including $8 million of favorable foreign currency translations. For the full year 2009, AF product sales were $628 million, an increase of 15% over 2008, including a $13 million decrease due to unfavorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, AF product sales increased 17% in 2009.For the first quarter of 2010, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $155 million to $170 million. We expect full year 2010 AF product sales to be in the range of $705 million to $735 million. Total sales of cardiovascular products for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $240 million, up 10% over the fourth quarter of 2008, including $12 million of favorable foreign currency translations. Total cardiovascular product sales for full year 2009 were $953 million, up 11% over 2008, including a $19 million decrease due to unfavorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, cardiovascular product sales increased 13% in 2009.Within this category of products, sales of vascular closure products in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $94 million. Total vascular closure products sales for 2009 were $381 million. Sales of heart valve products in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $79 million and total sales of heart valve products for calendar year 2009 were $323 million. For the first quarter of 2010, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $235 million to $250 million. And we expect full year 2010 cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $1,035,000,000 to $1,065,000,000. Total sales of neuromodulation products in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $94 million, up 21% from the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year 2009, neuromodulation products sales were $331 million, up 32% on a constant currency basis over 2008. For the first quarter of 2010, we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million, and we expect full year 2010 neuromodulation sales of $375 million to $395 million. Let me pause at this point and recap our 2010 sales guidance.For Cardiac Rhythm Management devices, we expect sales for 2010 in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.0 billion. Sales of our AF products for 2010 are expected to reach $705 million to $735 million. For cardiovascular products, we expect 2010 sales in the range of $1,035,000,000 to $1,065,000,000 and we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be $375 million to $395 million.If you add up the sales across all growth platforms, total sales in 2010 are expected to be $5,050,000,000 to $5,195,000,000. This guidance range assumes consolidated sales growth in the range of 7% to 11%.The geographic breakdown of Saint Jude Medical sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 is now part of our press release. We would refer you to this detail. In total, 50% of St. Jude Medical sales in the fourth quarter came from the U.S. market while 50% came from international markets.The gross profit margin this quarter was 73.2%, representing a 100 basis points sequential decrease from the third quarter of 2009. Approximately 70 basis points of the 100 basis point decline was the result of providing for the disposition of certain obsolete or slow-moving inventory items.For the full year 2009, the gross profit margin was 73.9%. For the full year 2010, we expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.2% to 73.8%. One factor influencing our gross profit margin this quarter and our 2010 gross profit margin guidance is the impact of absorbing the first full year of costs, associated with the new remote monitoring and wireless telemetry capabilities in our pacemaker product line. These costs include providing patients a free of charge wireless transmitter, as well as a higher unit cost for pacemaker devices incorporating the wireless telemetry components.We first introduced our wireless functionality in the U.S. pacemaker product line during the third quarter of 2009. There was a significant increase in the mix of these products in the fourth quarter. We estimate that the increased mix of wireless ICDs and pacemaker products in 2010 will account for a 60 basis point reduction in gross profit margin in 2010 versus 2009.We expect the higher unit cost of these pacemakers to moderate as we gain production efficiencies and achieve planned cost reductions. We also expect the 2010 impact of remote monitoring to be partially offset by an increase in our gross profit margin related to our continuous improvement initiatives targeting other manufacturing cost reductions. In addition during 2011 and 2012, we expect our gross profit margin to benefit from increasing manufacturing operations in Costa Rica and Malaysia.Our fourth quarter SG&A expenses were 35.3% of net sales, representing a 150 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year 2009, SG&A expenses were 36.3% of net sales compared with 36.7% in 2008. For the full year 2010, we expect SG&A as a percent of net sales to be in the range of 35.2% to 35.8%. Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 were 12.1% of net sales consistent with the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year 2009, R&D expenses were 12.2% of net sales consistent with 2008.For the full year 2010, we expect R&D expenses to be in the range of 12.0% to 12.6% of net sales as we continue to balance delivering short-term results with the right investments in long-term growth drivers. Other expense was $20 million in the fourth quarter. For the first quarter of 2010, we expect the other income and expense line item will be a net expense of approximately $17 million. For the full year 2010, we expect other expense of approximately $68 million to $73 million primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt.For 2009, our effective income tax rate was 26.5%. For 2010, we expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 24.5% to 25%. This rate assumes that the R&D tax credit is extended for 2010. The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2010 reflects the expansion of manufacturing operations in more favorable tax jurisdictions. We expect this trend to continue as our new manufacturing facilities in Costa Rica and Malaysia come online.Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $393 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,922,000,000 in total outstanding debt and $1 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The debt on our balance sheet consist of the $1.2 billion public offering of senior debt issued in the third quarter of 2009 with $700 million due in 2014 and $500 million due in 2019. In addition to the senior notes, the outstanding debt, primarily represents $432 million of borrowings under our domestic credit facilities, which mature in 2011 and $297 million of notes issued in Japan, which mature in 2010 and 2011.Next I want to offer some comments regarding our EPS outlook for the first quarter and full year 2010. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the first quarter of 2010, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about $326 million to $328 million shares with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2010 estimated at $328 million to $330 million. This guidance on outstanding shares takes into account that during the fourth quarter of 2009, we completed our $500 million share repurchase program that was announced last October, resulting in a reduction of 14.1 million shares of common stock.The company expects consolidated EPS for the first quarter of 2010 to be in the range of $0.66 to $0.68. For the full year 2010, we expect consolidated EPS to be in the range of $2.71 to $2.76. This expectation represents EPS growth of approximately 12% to 14% over the 2009 adjusted EPS of $2.43. I would now like to turn it back to Dan Starks."

We delivered quarterly results that met or exceeded our guidance. We completed numerous organizational, leadership and program changes designed to improve operating discipline and overall organizational effectiveness leading into 2010. This included restructuring and flattening our marketing organization, strengthening our forecasting methodology, redirecting spending priorities where appropriate and holding accountability for cost-effective results. As a result of the restructuring we started in the third quarter of 2009 and completed in the fourth quarter, we have now reduced our total global workforce by almost 5%. SG&A spending as a percent of sales dropped the full 150 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the same quarter one year ago. We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to fluctuate from quarter to quarter moving forward but for full year 2010, we expect SG&A to stay below 36% of sales while we implement programs in 2010 that are designed to further improve productivity of SG&A spending in future years. This includes investment to complete the implementation of our SAP enterprise software system and investment to bring online by the end 2010, new manufacturing facilities in Brazil, Costa Rica and Malaysia to complement the new manufacturing facilities we recently brought online in South Carolina and in Puerto Rico.It is important to note that although we have a strong commitment to optimizing our cost structure and generating operating leverage, we invested more in research and development on an absolute dollar basis during the fourth quarter than in any other single quarter in the history of our company. We plan to continue to invest at least 12% of sales in R&D moving forward with a strong focus on continued investment in clinical trials to the benefit of our customers and the patients they serve.The benefits of our sustained commitment to R&D should be highly visible during 2010. We expect to launch over 15 new products within our Cardiac Rhythm Management franchise. We will expand our entry into the deep brain stimulation market in Europe, the spinal cord stimulation market in Japan and the pericardial segment of the stented tissue valve market as we continue to invest longer term in transcatheter valve therapies, applications for our MediGuide technology, heart failure diagnostics, ischemia detection, our Atrial Fibrillation program, depression and other long-term growth programs.We look forward to giving you an overview at our Investor Conference next week of our entire lineup of new products scheduled for release in 2010, along with additional insights into a selection of our longer term growth drivers.Next I'd like to offer an update on the overall growth dynamics we see for our global Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM franchise in 2010. We continue to expect the global CRM market to grow at a mid single-digit rate which we define as approximately 4% to 6% growth on a constant currency basis. We estimate that St. Jude Medical's international CRM business grew faster than the market in 2009 and is on track to do so again in 2010.Sales from St. Jude Medical's U.S. CRM business were virtually flat in 2009 but we expect the return to growth in 2010, and are optimistic that the U.S. portion of our CRM business will get back on track to grow faster than the market in 2010. Our optimism is based on ongoing improvements in sales force effectiveness, customer inventory destocking that occurred in the second half of 2009 that is not expected to recur in 2010, replacement market dynamics that favorably impacts St. Jude Medical's position in this segment of the market and the strength of our flow of new products that we will review in more detail at our Investor Conference next week. The midpoint of our CRM sales guidance range for 2010 reflects growth of approximately 6.5% for CRM sales. We fully expect to meet or exceed this guidance range.In summary this morning, we placed a high priority on meeting or exceeding our expectations. With respect to St. Jude Medical as a whole, we expect to deliver high single-digit or low double-digit organic sales growth for full year 2010. We are committed to and I am focused on St. Jude Medical maintaining strong operating discipline and delivering meaningful EPS leverage while we continue to invest in our diverse portfolio of long-term growth drivers. In short, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sales and earnings growth toward the top end of our peer group.At our Annual Investor Conference next week, we look forward to providing all of you with extensive information on our assessment of market dynamics, new product introductions, clinical trial programs and our comprehensive growth program for 2010. We will be happy to touch on these topics briefly in this morning's call, but we would like to defer more complete discussion to our forum next week. We look forward to seeing many of you there. With that, I'd like to turn it back to the moderator and open it up for questions. Celeste, would you please host the questions."

We had a higher percent of sales that were international in the fourth Quarter. That's continued to expand as a growth driver on our business. So there's a little bit of impact there. There's some product mix impact. So it's a number of factors. And the key point is that although we expect to see some softness in gross margin during 2010, we expect to bridge over and recover that in 2011 and 2012 partly as a function of volume increase in the low voltage RF telemetry portion of our product line, and partly as a function of getting through the start up challenges of the RF telemetry in the low voltage portion of our product line and as well as just a number of other dynamics. We expect to see some additional contribution from the U.S. portion of our ICD business moving forward as well. So there's a number of factors that's going to impact gross margin and continue to strengthen the gross margin longer term. With respect to average selling prices, we found ASPs to be really within -- we saw nothing unusual in ASP trends during the fourth quarter. So we indicate that we regularly see ASP pressure. That on an apples-to-apples basis over time, we expect to see ASP reductions somewhere in the range we generally say, in the range of about 2% to 3% a year. In the fourth quarter itself, there was no special event or observations that we've made regarding ASPs. ASPs generally behaved as expected and as historically anticipated."

So that's something that's definitely has an impact as you look at the sequential quarter trends and as you look at year-over-year and, 60 days in Q4 of 2009 versus 64 days in both of the prior comparative period. And then a second point on the CRM side of things in particular, we did see continued customer destocking of inventory in the fourth quarter. So we -- one quarter ago, we were surprised by the level of customer destocking inventory that we saw when we gave our guidance for the fourth quarter, one quarter ago. We indicated that our guidance was taking into account the opportunity for inventory destocking to continue through the fourth quarter, and we did see more customer destocking of inventory in the fourth quarter.

And the other thing that happened is we turned on part of our SAP implementation, we've talked about that activity that's going on. And we turned that on in a number of geographies, and we really preloaded some inventory into our own sites to be prepared for that cut over. Now, that was very successful and is behind us here as we start the new year. So we have a plan internally to really work down our inventory as we go through 2010. And it really will have a smooth effect on our costs as we absorb them in the manufacturing process. And it is really not all that significant in the scheme of things. So what we really tried to call out is the one item that we are absorbing in 2010 related to some of the higher costs associated with the wireless functionality in our pacemaker product line.

And you may be able to correct me in an offline discussion, but I think this is the kind of range that we typically started out with for full year. And the quarterly -- the guidance we've given here for Q1 are really very consistent with the scope of range that we've given previously. So we start out the year with a little bit wider range. Traditionally, we tighten the range as we move through the year. So I think this is really very normal. But a couple of things that I could observe, if you thought about 2009 sales on an organic constant currency basis, 2009 sales growth was in round numbers, about 8%. So total constant currency sales growth in 2009 was 10%. We had factored in there probably about $80 million of acquired sales from our acquisition of Radi Medical and about $10 million of acquired sales from our prior acquisition of EP MedSystems. So if you back out that $90 million of acquired sales and do the growth calculation and state it in constant currency, you show about 8% sales growth for our top line constant currency organic in 2009. Another little tweak that just kind of for completeness, another little tweak there is that, that sales growth in 2009 versus prior year that had another week. Just the math on that prior week is about 1.9% impact. It's not really that much impact, given the interaction with the holidays, but it's probably still about a point of impact on our percentage growth. So if you kind of said a normalized apples-to-apples organic constant currency growth 2009, when we deliver is probably closer to 9% than to 8%. So that's the business as is and that's the business with our U.S. Pacer and ICD component, comprising about 32% of our total sales mix and generating virtually no growth contribution in 2009. And so that's our starting point looking forward into 2010. The guidance we've given, with that kind of base growth profile, the guidance we've given is a range of 7% to 11%. We are determined to be sure that we meet or exceed the guidance range that we have. And so you might start to read between the lines and see that we have quite a bit of confidence in the top line growth range that we've articulated this morning. And to the extent that, that raises more questions, I'll work to offer a good presentation on this topic next week at the Investor conference. That'll be one of the themes of my introductory overview, will be to review one of the markets that we're in, what are the kind of a natural growth rates of the markets we're in, what about the impact of some modest reasonable, credible continued share gain and portions of our business and what about the impact of continuing to enter new segments of markets. For example, our entry into the pericardial stented tissue valve segment of the heart valve market the second half of 2010. And so I'll put all that together next week and work to give a good view of our optimism and confidence with respect to top line growth.

So we're not suggesting that we're going to maintain a 35.3% of sales SG&A level through 2010. We continue to be very focused on growth, in the same way that you see our continue to expand it in investment in R&D in the fourth quarter of 2009, and we expect to continue that in 2010. We also will invest and expand our investment as appropriate in SG&A to support our growth programs. And so our goal isn't to squeeze out as much as we can, our goal is just to have measured continuous improvement in SG&A productivity as we bring SG&A investment more in line to best competitive benchmarks, that's one thing.

It's probably more helpful to look at 64 selling days in Q3 of 2009 and 60 selling days here in the U.S. in Q4 of 2009 to look at the kind of the current trends in the business. And then the reason we're talking about it at all is just to calibrate growth expectations for 2010.

I think as a group here, we're gratified at the trends and continued development of the technology and of clinical practice relating to patients with atrial fibrillation. So our expectations have been that the market has of, obviously, a huge potential of relatively under penetrated. And we expect that it takes time, that it takes landmark clinical trials, that it takes reimbursement of changes that tie to landmark clinical trials, that it takes continued advancement of the state-of-the-art on a clinical basis as well as on a technology basis to really get this growth opportunity to prime time. And we're nowhere near being in prime time. We're still in relative infancy of the development of the AF opportunity. We've gone past the point where it's really controversial about whether the AF opportunity in fact is real and whether it's going to develop. I think we now have a consensus that this growth opportunity is real and developing and on track. And so I think if we look at how long that it take for the ICD market to really go from first clinical experience and first successes to coming into its prime, that was probably about -- it was a 15-to-20 year development program. And so we have to be patient and our expectations are really calibrated to the idea that this takes time, but we're now at the level where there is a lot of clinical data coming from a lot of centers in the United States and outside the United States. To me, the most interesting new event of the AF space is the initiation of this CABANA trial. We've indicated in the past that we think of the CABANA trial as being analogous to it's good enough [ph] for the ICD market. And so we are looking forward to Dr. Packer's presentation of the feasibility data from the CABANA trial. My understanding is those data have been submitted for late-breaking clinical trial presentation at the ACC [American College of Cardiology]. I don't know if the data will be part of the late-breaking clinical trials. If it's not, it'll subsequently be published elsewhere. So that would be one thing to look for is the feasibility data for the CABANA trial. And in the CABANA trial, enrollment is now either underway or about to start. So the trial is -- there've been several meetings of the investigators for the CABANA trial, and it's all systems go. I'm not close enough to the details of it to talk about exactly what the state of enrollment is. Although, it's either about to get underway or has just gotten underway. So that's what I think of as being the biggest deal. Now that'll take -- obviously, it's the thinking there, it's 3,000 patients, the thinking is that maybe a three-year enrollment period, it's a two-year follow-up period. And it'll just be pristine great data for everybody on the real world of atrial fibrillation ablation and what the economic impact of it is, what the cost effectiveness of it is and what the clinical effectiveness of it is. So in between here and there, I expect to see the market just continue to develop in the way that these markets do. And we're gratified that it seems like it's all systems go."

For those who didn't hear my complete remarks a couple of weeks ago, that people ought to be awfully careful about just taking a sound bite or to the way [ph] of my complete remarks. The point that I made a couple of weeks ago was that although in the past, we've organized our business to deliver a minimum 15% growth in EPS, that two things. One is that there are new factors, and I particularly said that there's a new factor of medical device fee which can impact EPS growth somewhere in the range of four to five points. And there are other factors as well, but there a new factors that we need to be realistic about, number one. And number two, in view of these new factors, what we see clarification, I indicated these are new factors that are evolving and as they continue to evolve, we're just going to be more flexible about minimum EPS growth, that was my point. And you'll see that in the transcript and you'll see it in the slides that I presented that the takeaway was that we're not going to be locked into 15% growth no matter what, on EPS, that we're going to be more flexible. And that we're always balancing how committed are we to what level of short-term EPS result versus what level of continued investment in our long-term growth and success. And so we're not going to be backed in the corner of saying, ""Well, in past we said 15%. So we just need to make whatever cuts and long-term investment we have to, to deliver 15% growth."" That's an option. I know a CEO, of one of our peer companies, indicated that if the medical device fee came in [ph] at his  organization, it was going to be making severe cuts. And my point was that's not what we're going to do. We're here for the long-term. If we need to be more flexible about short-term results from time to time, in favor of continuing to maintain robust investment and long-term growth and success, we'll do it. So that was my point. And I'll stand by that. And then you see, too, the guidance we've given here for 2010 is EPS growth of, if you bring it down to a decimal point, it's about 11.5% to 13.6%. We've rounded it to 12% to 14%. So we just offered guidance this morning of 12% to 14% growth. And as we completed our operating plan here since the last call and got ourselves comfortable just with our expectation here for 2010, what's the level of guidance that we're going to give in 2010? You're not going to find me speaking out of both sides of my mouth saying, ""We're going to organize ourselves to a minimum of 15% growth. I know, by the way, our guidance is 12% to 14%."" So it's easy to take a sound bites and jump to the wrong conclusion, and start to extrapolate things I didn't say at all. But in context, my point was that there may be lumpiness, there's new stressors. We're going to be flexible. We're going to have an appropriate balance of focus on short-term results and continued investment in our long-term success and you see it reflected in the guidance that we've given for 2010."

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,203,000,000, favorable foreign currency translations versus last year's fourth quarter increased this quarter's sales by about $50 million. We will turn to currency in a moment but the actual average rates during the fourth quarter were within our previous guidance range. For the full year 2009, net sales were $4,681,000,000, up about 7% over 2008. Unfavorable foreign currency translations versus those in 2008 decreased 2009's net sales by approximately $99 million resulting in constant currency sales growth for the year of approximately 10%.During the fourth quarter, we recorded $6 million of in-process research and development expenses related to the acquisition of certain pre-development technology assets and $44 million of after-tax special charges, consisting of $33 million of employee termination and other costs related to restructuring actions announced in the third quarter, and the $11 million of inventory write-offs related to discontinued products.Also during the fourth quarter, we recorded a $24 million after-tax benefit related to certain annual discretionary compensation accruals that were reversed in the fourth quarter due to the fact that we do not intend to pay out these awards. Comments during this call referencing fourth quarter and full year 2009 results including EPS amounts will be exclusive of these items.Earnings per share were $0.64 for the fourth quarter of 2009, a 10% increase over adjusted EPS of $0.58 in the fourth quarter of 2008 and above our guidance range of $0.61 to $0.63. For the full year 2009, adjusted earnings per share were $2.43, a 9% increase over adjusted EPS of $2.22 for the full year 2008.  On a currency neutral basis, we estimate our earnings per share growth for the full year was approximately 15%.Before we discuss our financial results and offer our sales and earnings guidance for 2010, let me provide a few comments about currency exchange rates and the assumptions we are using in our outlook for this year. The two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. On our conference call one quarter ago, we stated that our guidance assumed that for the fourth quarter of 2009, each euro would translate into about $1.45 to $1.50 and that each 88 yen to 93 yen would translate into USD $1. For the fourth quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen versus these assumptions did not result in a material difference in reported sales.In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2010, we are assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.40 to $1.45. And for the yen, each 88 yen to 93 yen will translate into USD $1. Additionally, as you analyze our results, please note that due to our 52, 53 week convention, we had one less week in our 2009 fiscal fourth quarter compared to our 2008 fiscal fourth quarter.I will now turn our discussion to the sales by product category. For the fourth quarter, total Cardiac Rhythm Management sales which include revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines were $698 million, up 3% from last year's fourth quarter, including $28 million of favorable foreign currency translations. Total CRM product sales for the full year 2009 were $2,769,000,000 representing a 3% increase over 2008. Unfavorable foreign currency translations decreased 2009 CRM sales by approximately $64 million. On a constant currency basis, total CRM product sales for the full year 2009 increased 5%. For the fourth quarter, ICD sales were $395 million, up 2% from last year's fourth quarter. U.S. ICD sales were $237 million, international ICD sales were $158 million, a 14% increase over the fourth quarter of 2008, including $13 million of favorable foreign currency translations.For the full year 2009, ICD sales were $1,578,000,000, up 3% versus 2008. Unfavorable foreign currency translations versus those in 2008 decreased 2009 ICD sales by approximately $38 million. On a constant currency basis, total ICD product sales for the full year 2009 increased 5%.For low voltage devices, sales for the fourth quarter totaled $303 million, up 3% from last year's fourth quarter. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $122 million. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $181 million, up 13% from the fourth quarter of 2008, including $15 million of favorable foreign currency translations.For the year 2009, pacemaker sales were $1,191,000,000, up 2% over 2008. Unfavorable foreign currency translations versus those in 2008 decreased 2009's pacemaker sales by approximately $26 million. On a constant currency basis, total pacemaker product sales for the full year 2009 increased 4%.For the first quarter of 2010, we expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $700 million to  $730 million. And for the full year 2010, we expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.0 billion.Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the fourth quarter totaled $171 million, up 10% over the fourth quarter of last year, including $8 million of favorable foreign currency translations. For the full year 2009, AF product sales were $628 million, an increase of 15% over 2008, including a $13 million decrease due to unfavorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, AF product sales increased 17% in 2009.For the first quarter of 2010, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $155 million to $170 million. We expect full year 2010 AF product sales to be in the range of $705 million to $735 million. Total sales of cardiovascular products for the fourth quarter of 2009 were $240 million, up 10% over the fourth quarter of 2008, including $12 million of favorable foreign currency translations. Total cardiovascular product sales for full year 2009 were $953 million, up 11% over 2008, including a $19 million decrease due to unfavorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, cardiovascular product sales increased 13% in 2009.Within this category of products, sales of vascular closure products in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $94 million. Total vascular closure product sales for 2009 were $381 million. Sales of heart valve products in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $79 million and total sales of heart valve products for calendar year 2009 were $323 million. For the first quarter of 2010, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $235 million to $250 million. And we expect full year 2010 cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $1,035,000,000 to $1,065,000,000. Total sales of neuromodulation products in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $94 million, up 21% from the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year 2009, neuromodulation products sales were $331 million, up 32% on a constant currency basis over 2008. For the first quarter of 2010, we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be in the range of $85 million to $90 million, and we expect full year 2010 neuromodulation sales of $375 million to $395 million. Let me pause at this point and recap our 2010 sales guidance.For Cardiac Rhythm Management devices, we expect sales for 2010 in the range of $2.9 billion to $3.0 billion. Sales of our AF products for 2010 are expected to reach $705 million to $735 million. For cardiovascular products, we expect 2010 sales in the range of $1,035,000,000 to $1,065,000,000, and we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be $375 million to $395 million.If you add up the sales across all growth platforms, total sales in 2010 are expected to be $5,050,000,000 to $5,195,000,000. This guidance range assumes consolidated sales growth in the range of 7% to 11%.The geographic breakdown of Saint Jude Medical sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 is now part of our press release. We would refer you to this detail. In total, 50% of St. Jude Medical sales in the fourth quarter came from the U.S. market while 50% came from international markets.The gross profit margin in this quarter was 73.2%, representing a 100 basis points sequential decrease from the third quarter of 2009. Approximately 70 basis points of the 100 basis point decline was the result of providing for the disposition of certain obsolete or slow-moving inventory items.For the full year 2009, the gross profit margin was 73.9%. For the full year 2010, we expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.2% to 73.8%. One factor influencing our gross profit margin this quarter and our 2010 gross profit margin guidance is the impact of absorbing the first full year of costs, associated with the new remote monitoring and wireless telemetry capabilities in our pacemaker product line. These costs include providing patients a free of charge wireless transmitter, as well as a higher unit cost for pacemaker devices incorporating the wireless telemetry components.We first introduced our wireless functionality in the U.S. pacemaker product line during the third quarter of 2009. There was a significant increase in the mix of these products in the fourth quarter. We estimate that the increased mix of wireless ICDs and pacemaker products in 2010 will account for a 60 basis point reduction in gross profit margin in 2010 versus 2009.We expect the higher unit cost of these pacemakers to moderate as we gain production efficiencies and achieve planned cost reductions. We also expect the 2010 impact of remote monitoring to be partially offset by an increase in our gross profit margin related to our continuous improvement initiatives targeting other manufacturing cost reductions. In addition, during 2011 and 2012, we expect our gross profit margin to benefit from increasing manufacturing operations in Costa Rica and Malaysia.Our fourth quarter SG&A expenses were 35.3% of net sales, representing a 150 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year 2009, SG&A expenses were 36.3% of net sales compared with 36.7% in 2008. For the full year 2010, we expect SG&A as a percent of net sales to be in the range of 35.2% to 35.8%. Research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009 were 12.1% of net sales consistent with the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year 2009, R&D expenses were 12.2% of net sales, consistent with 2008. For the full year 2010, we expect R&D expenses to be in the range of 12.0% to 12.6% of net sales as we continue to balance delivering short-term results with the right investments in long-term growth drivers. Other expense was $20 million in the fourth quarter. For the first quarter of 2010, we expect the other income and expense line item will be a net expense of approximately $17 million. For the full year 2010, we expect other expense of approximately $68 million to $73 million, primarily driven by interest expense on our outstanding debt.For 2009, our effective income tax rate was 26.5%. For 2010, we expect the effective tax rate to be in the range of 24.5% to 25%. This rate assumes that the R&D tax credit is extended for 2010. The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2010 reflects the expansion of manufacturing operations in more favorable tax jurisdictions. We expect this trend to continue as our new manufacturing facilities in Costa Rica and Malaysia come online.Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $393 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,922,000,000 in total outstanding debt and $1 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The debt on our balance sheet consist of the $1.2 billion public offering of senior debt issued in the third quarter of 2009, with $700 million due in 2014 and $500 million due in 2019. In addition to the senior notes, the outstanding debt primarily represents $432 million of borrowings under our domestic credit facilities, which mature in 2011 and $297 million of notes issued in Japan, which mature in 2010 and 2011.Next I want to offer some comments regarding our EPS outlook for the first quarter and full year 2010. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the first quarter of 2010, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about $326 million to $328 million shares with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2010 estimated at $328 million to $330 million. This guidance on outstanding shares takes into account that during the fourth quarter of 2009, we completed our $500 million share repurchase program that was announced last October, resulting in a reduction of 14.1 million shares of common stock.The company expects consolidated EPS for the first quarter of 2010 to be in the range of $0.66 to $0.68. For the full year 2010, we expect consolidated EPS to be in the range of $2.71 to $2.76. This expectation represents EPS growth of approximately 12% to 14% over the 2009 adjusted EPS of $2.43. I would now like to turn it back to Dan Starks."

We delivered quarterly results that met or exceeded our guidance. We completed numerous organizational, leadership and program changes designed to improve operating discipline and overall organizational effectiveness leading into 2010. This included restructuring and flattening our marketing organization, strengthening our forecasting methodology, redirecting spending priorities where appropriate and holding accountability for cost-effective results. As a result of the restructuring we started in the third quarter of 2009 and completed in the fourth quarter, we have now reduced our total global workforce by almost 5%. SG&A spending as a percent of sales dropped the full 150 basis points in the fourth quarter versus the same quarter one year ago. We expect SG&A as a percent of sales to fluctuate from quarter to quarter moving forward but for full year 2010, we expect SG&A to stay below 36% of sales while we implement programs in 2010 that are designed to further improve productivity of SG&A spending in future years. This includes investment to complete the implementation of our SAP enterprise software system and investment to bring online by the end 2010, new manufacturing facilities in Brazil, Costa Rica and Malaysia to complement the new manufacturing facilities we recently brought online in South Carolina and in Puerto Rico.It is important to note that although we have a strong commitment to optimizing our cost structure and generating operating leverage, we invested more in research and development on an absolute dollar basis during the fourth quarter than in any other single quarter in the history of our company. We plan to continue to invest at least 12% of sales in R&D moving forward with a strong focus on continued investment in clinical trials to the benefit of our customers and the patients they serve.The benefits of our sustained commitment to R&D should be highly visible during 2010. We expect to launch over 15 new products within our Cardiac Rhythm Management franchise. We will expand our entry into the deep brain stimulation market in Europe, the spinal cord stimulation market in Japan and the pericardial segment of the stented tissue valve market as we continue to invest longer term in transcatheter valve therapies, applications for our MediGuide technology, heart failure diagnostics, ischemia detection, our Atrial Fibrillation program, depression and other long-term growth programs.We look forward to giving you an overview at our Investor Conference next week of our entire lineup of new products scheduled for release in 2010, along with additional insights into a selection of our longer term growth drivers.Next I'd like to offer an update on the overall growth dynamics we see for our global Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM franchise in 2010. We continue to expect the global CRM market to grow at a mid single-digit rate which we define as approximately 4% to 6% growth on a constant currency basis. We estimate that St. Jude Medical's international CRM business grew faster than the market in 2009 and is on track to do so again in 2010.Sales from St. Jude Medical's U.S. CRM business were virtually flat in 2009 but we expect the return to growth in 2010, and are optimistic that the U.S. portion of our CRM business will get back on track to grow faster than the market in 2010. Our optimism is based on ongoing improvements in sales force effectiveness, customer inventory destocking that occurred in the second half of 2009 that is not expected to recur in 2010, replacement market dynamics that favorably impacts St. Jude Medical's position in this segment of the market and the strength of our flow of new products that we will review in more detail at our Investor Conference next week. The midpoint of our CRM sales guidance range for 2010 reflects growth of approximately 6.5% for CRM sales. We fully expect to meet or exceed this guidance range.In summary this morning, we placed a high priority on meeting or exceeding our expectations. With respect to St. Jude Medical as a whole, we expect to deliver high single-digit or low double-digit organic sales growth for full year 2010. We are committed to and I am focused on St. Jude Medical maintaining strong operating discipline and delivering meaningful EPS leverage while we continue to invest in our diverse portfolio of long-term growth drivers. In short, we believe we are well positioned to continue to deliver sales and earnings growth toward the top end of our peer group.At our Annual Investor Conference next week, we look forward to providing all of you with extensive information on our assessment of market dynamics, new product introductions, clinical trial programs and our comprehensive growth program for 2010. We will be happy to touch on these topics briefly in this morning's call, but we would like to defer more complete discussion to our forum next week. We look forward to seeing many of you there. With that, I'd like to turn it back to the moderator and open it up for questions. Celeste, would you please host the questions."

We had a higher percent of sales that were international in the fourth Quarter. That's continued to expand as a growth driver on our business. So there's a little bit of impact there. There's some product mix impact. So it's a number of factors. And the key point is that although we expect to see some softness in gross margin during 2010, we expect to bridge over and recover that in 2011 and 2012 partly as a function of volume increase in the low voltage RF telemetry portion of our product line, and partly as a function of getting through the start up challenges of the RF telemetry in the low voltage portion of our product line and as well as just a number of other dynamics. We expect to see some additional contribution from the U.S. portion of our ICD business moving forward as well. So there's a number of factors that's going to impact gross margin and continue to strengthen the gross margin longer term. With respect to average selling prices, we found ASPs to be really within -- we saw nothing unusual in ASP trends during the fourth quarter. So we indicate that we regularly see ASP pressure. That on an apples-to-apples basis over time, we expect to see ASP reductions somewhere in the range we generally say, in the range of about 2% to 3% a year. In the fourth quarter itself, there was no special event or observations that we've made regarding ASPs. ASPs generally behaved as expected and as historically anticipated."

So that's something that's definitely has an impact as you look at the sequential quarter trends and as you look at year-over-year and, 60 days in Q4 of 2009 versus 64 days in both of the prior comparative period. And then a second point on the CRM side of things in particular, we did see continued customer destocking of inventory in the fourth quarter. So we -- one quarter ago, we were surprised by the level of customer destocking inventory that we saw when we gave our guidance for the fourth quarter, one quarter ago. We indicated that our guidance was taking into account the opportunity for inventory destocking to continue through the fourth quarter, and we did see more customer destocking of inventory in the fourth quarter.

And the other thing that happened is we turned on part of our SAP implementation, we've talked about that activity that's going on. And we turned that on in a number of geographies, and we really preloaded some inventory into our own sites to be prepared for that cut over. Now, that was very successful and is behind us here as we start the new year. So we have a plan internally to really work down our inventory as we go through 2010. And it really will have a smooth effect on our costs as we absorb them in the manufacturing process. And it is really not all that significant in the scheme of things. So what we really tried to call out is the one item that we are absorbing in 2010 related to some of the higher costs associated with the wireless functionality in our pacemaker product line.

And you may be able to correct me in an offline discussion, but I think this is the kind of range that we typically started out with for full year. And the quarterly -- the guidance we've given here for Q1 are really very consistent with the scope of range that we've given previously. So we start out the year with a little bit wider range. Traditionally, we tighten the range as we move through the year. So I think this is really very normal. But a couple of things that I could observe, if you thought about 2009 sales on an organic constant currency basis, 2009 sales growth was in round numbers, about 8%. So total constant currency sales growth in 2009 was 10%. We had factored in there probably about $80 million of acquired sales from our acquisition of Radi Medical and about $10 million of acquired sales from our prior acquisition of EP MedSystems. So if you back out that $90 million of acquired sales and do the growth calculation and state it in constant currency, you show about 8% sales growth for our top line constant currency organic in 2009. Another little tweak that just kind of for completeness, another little tweak there is that, that sales growth in 2009 versus prior year that had another week. Just the math on that prior week is about 1.9% impact. It's not really that much impact, given the interaction with the holidays, but it's probably still about a point of impact on our percentage growth. So if you kind of said a normalized apples-to-apples organic constant currency growth 2009, when we deliver is probably closer to 9% than to 8%. So that's the business as is and that's the business with our U.S. Pacer and ICD component, comprising about 32% of our total sales mix and generating virtually no growth contribution in 2009. And so that's our starting point looking forward into 2010. The guidance we've given, with that kind of base growth profile, the guidance we've given is a range of 7% to 11%. We are determined to be sure that we meet or exceed the guidance range that we have. And so you might start to read between the lines and see that we have quite a bit of confidence in the top line growth range that we've articulated this morning. And to the extent that, that raises more questions, I'll work to offer a good presentation on this topic next week at the Investor conference. That'll be one of the themes of my introductory overview, will be to review one of the markets that we're in, what are the kind of a natural growth rates of the markets we're in, what about the impact of some modest reasonable, credible continued share gain and portions of our business and what about the impact of continuing to enter new segments of markets. For example, our entry into the pericardial stented tissue valve segment of the heart valve market the second half of 2010. And so I'll put all that together next week and work to give a good view of our optimism and confidence with respect to top line growth. I'm not going to impeach the guidance that we've given this morning. Our guidance is 7% to 11%. Our goal, though, is to accelerate top line growth in 2010. So we're always work to need them [ph] if we can exceed the guidance that we give."

So we're not suggesting that we're going to maintain a 35.3% of sales SG&A level through 2010. We continue to be very focused on growth, in the same way that you see our continue to expand it in investment in R&D in the fourth quarter of 2009, and we expect to continue that in 2010. We also will invest and expand our investment as appropriate in SG&A to support our growth programs. And so our goal isn't to squeeze out as much as we can, our goal is just to have measured continuous improvement in SG&A productivity as we bring SG&A investment more in line to best competitive benchmarks, that's one thing.

I think as a group here, we're gratified at the trends and continued development of the technology and of clinical practice relating to patients with atrial fibrillation. So our expectations have been that the market has, obviously, a huge potential of relatively under penetrated. And we expect that it takes time, that it takes landmark clinical trials, that it takes reimbursement changes that tie to landmark clinical trials, that it takes continued advancement of the state-of-the-art on a clinical basis as well as on a technology basis to really get this growth opportunity to prime time. And we're nowhere near being in prime time. We're still in the relative infancy of the development of the AF opportunity. We've gone past the point where it's really controversial about whether the AF opportunity in fact is real and whether it's going to develop. I think we now have a consensus that this growth opportunity is real and developing and on track. And so I think if we looked at how long that it take for the ICD market to really go from first clinical experience and first successes to coming into its prime, that was probably about -- it was a 15-to-20 year development program. And so we have to be patient and our expectations are really calibrated to the idea that this takes time, but we're now at the level where there is a lot of clinical data coming from a lot of centers in the United States and outside the United States. To me, the most interesting new event of the AF space is the initiation of this CABANA trial. We've indicated in the past that we think of the CABANA trial as being analogous to it's good enough [ph] for the ICD market. And so we are looking forward to Dr. Packer's presentation of the feasibility data from the CABANA trial. My understanding is those data have been submitted for late-breaking clinical trial presentation at the ACC [American College of Cardiology]. I don't know if the data will be part of the late-breaking clinical trials. If it's not, it'll subsequently be published elsewhere. So that would be one thing to look for is the feasibility data for the CABANA trial. And in the CABANA trial, enrollment is now either underway or about to start. So the trial is -- there've been several meetings of the investigators for the CABANA trial, and it's all systems go. I'm not close enough to the details of it to talk about exactly what the state of enrollment is. Although, it's either about to get underway or it's just gotten underway. So that's what I think of as being the biggest deal. Now that'll take -- obviously, it's the thinking there, it's 3,000 patients, the thinking is that maybe about a three-year enrollment period, it's a two-year follow-up period. And it'll just be pristine great data for everybody on the real world of atrial fibrillation ablation and what the economic impact of it is, what the cost effectiveness of it is and what the clinical effectiveness of it is. So in between here and there, I expect to see the market just continue to develop in the way that these markets do. And we're gratified that it seems like it's all systems go."

The point that I made a couple of weeks ago was that although in t",558,"Yes. For those who didn't hear my complete remarks a couple of weeks ago, that people ought to be awfully careful about just taking a sound bite or to the way [ph] for my complete remarks. The point that I made a couple of weeks ago was that although in the past, we've organized our business to deliver a minimum 15% growth in EPS, that two things. One is that there are new factors, and I particularly said that there's a new factor of medical device fee which can impact EPS growth somewhere in the range of four to five points. And there are other factors as well, but there a new factors that we need to be realistic about, number one. And number two, in view of these new factors, what we see clarification, I indicated these are new factors that are evolving and as they continue to evolve, we're just going to be more flexible about minimum EPS growth, that was my point. And you'll see that in the transcript and you'll see it in the slides that I presented that the takeaway was that we're not going to be locked into 15% growth no matter what, on EPS, that we're going to be more flexible. And that we're always balancing how committed are we to what level of short-term EPS result versus what level of continued investment in our long-term growth and success. And so we're not going to be backed in the corner of saying, ""Well, in the past we said 15%. So we just need to make whatever cuts and long-term investment we have to, to deliver 15% growth."" That's an option. I know a CEO of one of our peer companies indicated that if the medical device fee came in at his organization, he was going to be making severe cuts. And my point was that's not what we're going to do. We're here for the long-term. If we need to be more flexible about short-term results from time to time in favor of continuing to maintain robust investment and long-term growth and success, we'll do it. So that was my point. And I'll stand by that. And then you see, too, the guidance we've given here for 2010 is EPS growth of, if you bring it down to the decimal point, it's about 11.5% to 13.6%. We've rounded it to 12% to 14%. So we just offered guidance this morning of 12% to 14% growth. And as we completed our operating plan here since the last call and got ourselves comfortable just with our expectation here for 2010, what's the level of guidance that we're going to give in 2010, you're not going to find me speaking out of both sides of my mouth saying, ""We're going to organize ourselves to a minimum of 15% growth. I know, by the way, our guidance is 12% to 14%."" So it's easy to take sound bites and jump to the wrong conclusion, and start to extrapolate things I didn't say at all. But in context, my point was that there may be lumpiness, there's new stressors. We're going to be flexible. We're going to have an appropriate balance of focus on short-term results and continued investment in our long-term success and you see it reflected in the guidance that we've given for 2010."

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,262,000,000, up approximately 11% over the $1,134,000,000 reported in the first quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year's first quarter increased this quarter's sales",1961,"Thank you, Dan. Sales for the quarter totaled $1,262,000,000, up approximately 11% over the $1,134,000,000 reported in the first quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year's first quarter increased this quarter's sales by about $43 million. We will update our currency assumptions in a moment. But the actual average exchange rates during the first quarter were within our previous guidance range. 
On a constant-currency basis, first quarter sales increased approximately 8% versus last year. At the end of 2009, the federal research and development tax credit expired, and it has not yet been extended for 2010. In this circumstance, GAAP requires us to estimate and record our effective income tax rate, assuming that the R&D credit is not extended. For purposes of this conference call and our calculation of adjusted net earnings, however, we are assuming that the tax credit will be extended for 2010 as in past years. As a result, comments referencing first quarter results and our guidance for 2010, including EPS amounts, are presented based on an effective income tax rate that contemplates the extension of the tax credit retroactive to January 1, 2010. To the extent that the federal research and development tax credit is not renewed, our effective income tax rate for 2010 would be higher than what is being presented during this call. 
Earnings per share were $0.75 for the first quarter of 2010, a 29% increase over EPS of $0.58 in the first quarter of 2009 and above our guidance range of $0.66 to $0.68 for the quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, we estimate our earnings per share growth for the first quarter was approximately 20%. 
As you know, three selling weeks prior to the end of the first quarter of 2010, a competitor announced the suspension of all sales of their ICD products in the United States. We estimate that this dynamic benefited our first quarter U.S. ICD sales by approximately $20 million to $25 million. In preparing our second quarter and full year 2010 guidance, we have taken into account the period in April that this competitor remained out of the U.S. ICD market. 
Before we discuss our first quarter 2010 sales results by product category with guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2010, let me comment on foreign currency. As discussed on prior calls, the two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2010, we had used exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.40 to $1.45. And for the yen, each 88 yen to 93 yen would translate to USD $1. For the first quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen versus these assumptions did not result in a material difference in reported sales. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2010, we are assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.33 to $1.38; and that for the yen, each 90 yen to 95 yen will translate into USD $1. This change in assumption regarding currency exchange rates has the impact of decreasing total forecasted sales for the remainder of 2010 by about $40 million to $50 million, which we estimate will reduce EPS by approximately $0.04 to $0.05 over the remainder of the year.
Now for the sales by product category discussion for the quarter. Total Cardiac Rhythm Management sales, which includes revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines were $752 million, up 11% from last year's first quarter, including $24 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant-currency basis, first quarter CRM sales increased 8% versus a strong first quarter from last year. For the first quarter, ICD sales were $452 million, up 15% from last year's first quarter. On a constant-currency basis, first quarter ICD sales increased 12% versus last year. U.S. ICD sales were $281 million, up 9% from last year's first quarter. International ICD sales were $171 million, a 26% increase over the first quarter of 2009, including $12 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For our low-voltage devices, sales for the first quarter totaled $300 million, up 6% from last year's first quarter. On a constant-currency basis, first quarter low-voltage device sales increased 2% versus last year. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $128 million, flat with last year's first quarter. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $172 million, up 12% from the first quarter of 2009, including $12 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For the second quarter of 2010, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $745 million to $775 million. And for the full year 2010, we now expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $2,965,000,000 to $3,040,000,000. Atrial fibrillation or AF product sales for the first quarter totaled $170 million, up 17% over the first quarter of last year, including $7 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, first quarter AF product sales increased 12% versus last year. For the second quarter of 2010, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $165 million to $180 million. We expect our full year 2010 AF product sales to be in the range of $695 million to $725 million. This 2010 outlook range is a slightly less than the full year 2010 guidance range we provided last quarter, which primarily reflects the stronger U.S. dollar versus the euro. 
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the first quarter of 2010 were $256 million, up 7% over the first quarter of 2009, including $10 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant-currency basis, first quarter cardiovascular product sales increased 3% versus last year. 
Within this category of products, sales of vascular closure products in the first quarter of 2010 were $98 million, consistent with the first quarter of 2009. Sales of heart valve products in the first quarter of 2010 were $86 million, a 6% increase over the first quarter of 2009. 
For the second quarter of 2010, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $245 million to $260 million. We expect full year 2010 cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $1,015,000,000 to $1,045,000,000. This 2010 outlook range is a slightly less than the full year 2010 guidance range we provided last quarter, which primarily reflects the stronger U.S. dollar versus the euro. 
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the first quarter of 2010 were $84 million, up 15% from the first quarter of 2009, including $2 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For the second quarter of 2010, we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be the range of $90 million to $95 million, and we continue expect full year 2010 in neuromodulation sales in the range of $375 million to $395 million.
Looking to revenue by geography, in total, 51% of St. Jude Medical sales in the first quarter of 2010 came from the United States, while 49% came from international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales for the first quarter of 2010 is available in our press release. The gross profit margin this quarter was 74.5%, representing a 50 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2009. 
For the full year 2010, we expect gross profit margins to be the range of 73.2% to 73.8%. Our full year 2010 gross profit margin guidance continues to incorporate the impact of absorbing the costs associated with the remote monitoring and wireless telemetry capabilities in our pacemaker product lines. We are providing for this impact to be slightly higher in the second half of this year. In addition, our gross profit margin guidance also reflects the revised currency assumptions for the remainder of 2010.
Our first quarter SG&A expenses were 35.1% of net sales, a 170 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, we continue to forecast SG&A as a percentage of net sales in the range of 35.2% to 35.8%. Research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2010 was 12% of net sales. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect R&D expense to stay in the range of 12.0% to 12.6% of net sales as we continue to balance delivering short-term results with the right investments in long-term growth drivers. 
Net other expense was $20 million in the first quarter. And for the second quarter of 2010, we expect the other income and expense line item will be a net expense of approximately $16 million. For the full year 2010, we expect other expense of approximately $65 million to $70 million. 
For the first quarter, the company's effective income tax rate was 24.8%. And for 2010, we continue to expect tax rate to be in the range of 24.5% to 25.0%. As a reminder, these effective income tax rates contemplate the extension of the R&D credit in 2010 retroactive to the beginning of the year. To the extent it is not extended, our overall effective income tax rate would increase. We have also assumed the extension of the federal research and development credit in the EPS guidance for 2010.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter 2010, we had $530 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,936,000,000 in total debt, along with $1 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The debt on our balance sheet includes $1,641,000,000 of senior notes with maturities in 2013, 2014 and 2019. In addition to the senior notes, the outstanding debt on our balance sheet includes $295 million of notes issued in Japan, which mature in May 2010 and December 2011. We are currently in the final stages of refinancing the $225 million portion of the Japan notes that mature in May 2010 with a new fixed rate yen-based debt having maturities ranging from seven to 10 years.
Next I want to offer comments regarding our EPS outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2010. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the second quarter of 2010, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 330 million to 332 million shares, with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2010 at 331 million to 333 million. The company expects consolidated earnings per share for the second quarter to be the range of $0.73 to $0.75. And for the full year 2010, we now expect consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $2.80 to $2.85, a $0.09 increase from the full year 2010 guidance we gave during our fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. This updated expectation represents EPS growth of approximately 15% to 17% over the 2009 adjusted EPS of $2.43. 
To provide some insight into the basis for the increase in our annual EPS guidance, we start out with the results for the first quarter and note that we exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance for the first quarter by approximately $0.08. As previously discussed, we estimate that the change in our assumptions regarding currency exchange rates will reduce our EPS for the remainder of the year by approximately $0.04 to $0.05, and we are factoring this negative change into our updated full year guidance. However, we expect the strength of our business to continue, and we believe that we will more than offset this negative currency impact during the remainder of the year. 
I would now like to turn it back to Dan."

Yes, we did benefit during the last three months of our first quarter from problems another company was having. But we just delivered a 29% increase in earnings per share and beat the high end of our guidance by $0.07 per share. These results were driven primarily by the strength and success of our own growth program. The problems one of our competitors had the last three weeks of our quarter had only a small impact. With this in mind, the first topic I want to emphasize is the benefit our restructuring had on our first quarter results. 
Our operating profit margin improved to 27.4% for this quarter. This is a full 250 basis point improvement over Q1 2009 and a 160 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2009. Our operating profit margin during the first quarter of 2010 did benefit from ICD sales that were higher than expected the last three weeks of our quarter. But even without this benefit, St. Jude Medical would have delivered on operating profit margin gain for the quarter that exceeded the expectations that were incorporated into our prior guidance for earnings per share. 
The second topic I want to emphasize is the strength of our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM sales results during the first quarter. Prior to the announcement on March 15 that one competitor was suspending sales of its ICD's in the United States, we already were on track to deliver global CRM sales that were at the upper end of our guidance. This confirmed to us that we made the right changes in our U.S. sales organization during the second half of 2009. This also put us in good shape to provide seamless and timely ICD coverage to customers who turn to St. Jude Medical as a result of competitor issues.
We now expect to gain CRM market share for full year 2010, both in the United States and on a total global basis. We expect to launch over 10 new CRM products during the second quarter alone. I will refer you to the information we presented last quarter at our Annual Investor Conference for the features and benefits of these new products. But on this morning's call, I at least want to remind you how strong our pipeline of new products is.
In the United States during the second quarter, we expect to launch our new Fortify and Unify lines of high-voltage devices. We also are launching our new 4 French Quickflex Left-Heart Lead, a new Left-Heart Lead delivery system and a cell phone-enabled option for our Merlin@home remote monitoring system. Keep in mind that this is in addition to our 7 French high voltage leads, our SJ4 connector system and our Accent and Anthem lines of low voltage devices with RF telemetry and remote monitoring capability. 
In Europe during the second quarter, we are offering all of the same technologies I just listed for the United States. But in addition, we also are launching our Fortify ST line of high-voltage devices, our CorVue pulmonary edema monitoring technology and our Promote Quadra ICD systems with the Quartet quadripolar left ventricular pacing lead to facilitate both electronic repositioning and Multi-Site Left Ventricular Pacing.
In Japan, we already have received regulatory approval for our AnalyST line of ICDs. We are in the process of obtaining reimbursement and expect to launch this product line before the end of the second quarter. Our AnalyST line of ICDs will introduce ST segment monitoring technology into the Japanese market for the first time. In addition, we have received regulatory approval in Japan for our Current Plus ICDs and Promote Plus CRTD devices, along with our Durata 7 French high voltage lead, all with DF-4 connectors, the first devices in the world labeled as complying with the newly published ISO connector standard. 
If I were asked to summarize the competitive advantage of St. Jude Medical's CRM program for the remainder of 2010, I would say this, we have a clear competitive advantage in our product line. We have a strong inventory position and significant additional manufacturing capacity. We have a stable, trained and experienced field organization in place to provide complete coverage to customers in all major global markets. The dynamics of the replacement market are changing from a headwind that has slowed our growth to a tailwind that we expect to accelerate our growth. We believe we are ahead of all of our competitors in establishing a strong Atrial Fibrillation program. And as a result, we have also strengthened our ability to gain share in pacemakers and ICDs. Last but not least, we have good continuity of leadership and program strategy. Especially in these times, the value of this continuity, the impact it has on product and program quality and the overall competitive advantage of this continuity should not be underestimated. We fully expect to gain additional CRM market share in 2010.
Before I open it up for questions, I would like to touch briefly on each of our other major growth platforms. Within our Cardiovascular business, I am pleased to confirm that a limited launch of our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve already is underway in Europe. As a reminder, the pericardial segment of the tissue valve market is approximately $500 million on a global basis. Our entry into this market in Europe is a significant milestone in our program to continue to reinvigorate the long-term growth of our cardiovascular business. 
With respect to the business of our Atrial Fibrillation or AF division, we now have CE Mark for four new families of ablation catheters, including catheters with our Contact technology and catheters with our Cool Flex technology. We recently received approval in Japan for our NavX technology on our EnSite advanced mapping systems platform. We continue to make good progress, integrating our EP-Workmate and our MediGuide technology with our EnSite Velocity platform. All of this reinforces our optimism that we are on track to sustain the long term growth of our AF business. 
With respect to our in neuromodulation business, although first quarter sales came in at $84 million versus our guidance range of $85 million to $90 million, we attribute this minor variance to timing. We expect a rebound of neuromodulation sales during the second quarter. 
In conclusion, our first quarter was highly successful by every major measure. We exceeded the high end of our sales guidance. We improved our operating margin on a year-over-year basis by 250 basis points. We delivered a 29% increase in earnings per share. We entered the second quarter with good momentum and with major new product launches scheduled for the remainder of the year. 
With that, I'd like to open it up for questions and turn it back to you to moderate, Regina."

That's the first major component. So that was the market growth assumption that we had at the beginning of the year, and nothing that happened during the first quarter changed our assessment of total global market growth, point one. 
Point two, if you look at the range of our full year CRM sales guidance, you can see that although there's some range in there, we're estimating approximately one full point of global CRM share gain for full year 2010. So that would be the best way for me to answer your question rather than offer more specificity quarter-by-quarter. Generally, as you ask about the impact of the circumstances at Boston Scientific, it's really too soon for us to know what that impact is going to be. We think about it in several buckets. We think about it first, in terms of what's the impact on the CRM market in its entirety. And our assessment is that the problems at Boston Scientific long term are not going to have any material impact on the health and growth of the global CRM market. That's the first point. 
On the topic of impact on market share shifts, it really is too soon for us to assess that. We'll have a better idea after we've finished the second quarter. But for now, we're kind of holding back. We're going to wait and see. We don't really know how to model that. We haven't been through exactly these circumstances before. So if we're going to err, we're going to err on the side of being conservative for the purpose of our guidance this morning."

And so we do worry about that for the rest of the year. But ultimately, our experience has been that when a competitor engages on a low-price strategy that's generally an admission of competitive weakness. I think that customers generally see it the same way. And if you kind of imagine a company that has a product line with very little that’s new in it, you imagine that same company having a product line that has had numerous advisories here in the recent past, as well as in the multi-year past, but even in recent past, multiple advisories. We kind of refer to the whole set of circumstances -- internally here, we refer to the circumstances at the competitive company as the “Boston Debacle”. And so if you think about a company going through all the circumstances of “Boston Debacle” coming out of that, they've indicated that they're going to change their traditional level of investment to develop the market. 
So you've got an increasingly uncompetitive product line, one that already has been the target of multiple advisories from a company that has announced that as a growth strategy, they're going to lower the traditional amount of investment they've made in developing the CRM market. They've got quite a bit of instability in their field organization, and we can only imagine all of the circumstances of that and all of the impact that has on the ability to service customer requirements in a high-quality way. And if on top of all of that, the company says, yes, but we’ll lower our price, I think the perception customers will get on average is you get what you pay for. And we would see that as a strategy that is a concern, but not a strategy that would have a long-term success for that competitive program."

It won't surprise us if -- when everyone has reported their Q1 numbers, it won't surprise us if the numbers are anomalous for reported sales and the appearance that gives for CRM growth in the first quarter. 
I think the first quarter sales results will be a poster child for the importance of not taking the results in any one quarter and extrapolating from them. I think it will be important for us all to wait for second quarter results to get reported and then kind of combine the -- when we’re looking at market growth, combine the results of the first quarter and the results of the second quarter. I think that will really be the first indicator to all of us from reported sales on the continued growth of the global CRM market.

But in the second half of this year, I would expect to be able to make those data visible. But to kind of set expectations, what we're expecting is we're expecting the data from the Parkinson's study to be positive. There's nothing that would lead us to expect anything else. 
On the migraine side, the results really I’d say we are still -- I'm blinded to the data. I don't know if we're still entirely blinded to the data. But that's speculative. The outcome, I'd say, is speculative. In our own modeling, we do model that we will continue to get benefit from the Parkinson's indication in our neuromodulation program. As everyone in the call knows, we are still in the early phases of launching that technology for that indication in Europe. In future years, we remain confident and optimistic that we'll launch our Deep Brain Stimulation technology for our Parkinson's indication in the United States as well. 
On the migraine side, we model absolutely nothing for the possibility of upside on migraine. And we think it's prudent for everyone to have very low expectations and not model any contribution from migraine. If we have a positive outcome to the clinical data, that will only mark another milestone in what will still be a very lengthy multi-year process of adding to the clinical data, working to get reimbursement, working to establish credibility in the referral stream. And so a person ought to think about that as a very long-term growth opportunity and model nothing in the next few years."

So we aren’t thinking of it in terms of acceleration in the first quarter, although I'm sure to the extent your numbers reflect that, your numbers are accurate. But we kind of step back and think about this as a 10% to 15% growth market on a sustainable basis over an additional multi-year period. And so now that we've got another quarter behind us, our takeaway is, yes, this continues to be a good 10% to 15% growth market. We have what we consider to be the leading program in the space. Our sales results of 17% growth in a market growing in the range of 10% to 15% indicates that we're at least holding share and we may be gaining share. Other companies don’t report their numbers with enough granularity for us to know for sure. Everything is on track. There were no surprises to us even on the upside or on the downside in AF market development or a market opportunity in the first quarter. 
We continue to look at this as one of the best growth opportunities in all of medical device technology. We think it's a winner on cost-effectiveness. We think that the accumulation of clinical trial data will show it's a winner on clinical effectiveness. We've got -- we see consensus continuing to build in the global cardiology community on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of catheter-based curative approach to atrial fibrillation. This just saves a lot of money for the healthcare system, as well as alleviates significant human misery. That's our takeaways from the first quarter."

In the first quarter, I think what you're seeing is just the base strength of our current product line. But also, we had our limited launch of our new Unify, Fortify, and Fortify ST products that really have been met with very, very high degree of enthusiasm. That's allowed us to really get focus on the organization and our customers thinking about us as being truly innovators in this space. It’s also allowed us to get into competitive accounts where we haven't been before. 
We’re just starting off now in the beginning of this month with our full launch for Unify and Fortify. And people are really appreciating the full package of those devices with not only the small size but the 40 joules output, the fast charge times, the no compromise in longevity and all the additional features like CorVue, like the ST and the Fortify ST line. On a CRT side, we really think about ourselves as really getting to the next level with the quadripolar system with Promote Quadra and the Quartet lead that we think that's going to become the next real standard, standard of care for CRT. And the customer response for that has been that they agree with us. That they really think that, that is the next true evolution in CRT therapy, and really addresses a number of important clinical concerns that they have and allows them to have much more efficient, not only implants, but also on the follow-up site. 
And in Japan, we're also seeing the results of the strength of our new products. And I think that lays us up well for Q2 start as we're going to be launching, as Dan mentioned, our AnalyST device there. We have a symposium on ST segment monitoring in Japan that's taking place this weekend. The initial response to the concept has been very strong. And then also the DF-4 connector provides for the Japanese market not only for the benefits of that but it also provides a way for downsizing the device. And that's obviously important in that market."

Average selling prices during the first quarter were stable. So there was nothing -- so the prior question wasn't about actual prices, it was about are we seeing a competitor offer lower prices. Not a question of is business being transacted at the lower price. Business in the first quarter was transacted within normal average selling price ranges. And so we saw very stable average selling prices on a total global basis in our ICD business and in our Pacing business. We did see one competitor offer low prices, and it was particularly striking that low prices were offered at a point where they didn't have an approved product offer. But I know I digress. But the actual success of the business was at within normal prices. We don't expect to see a change in the average selling prices in a way that would change our estimate that the global CRM market will continue to grow at the range of 4% to 6%. Everything that we expect with respect to competitive price tactics, number one. But also with respect to new technology and the impact of new technology on product mix, everything that we see with respect to geographic mix of the strengthening of our business in Japan, for example. All of those things are baked into our assessment that the global CRM market will continue to grow at about 4% to 6%. So no change to that. And we see nothing from a competitive customer behavior that we would expect to have changed that."

So the newest product line, if we have a successful product launch over the period of four to eight quarters, that new product line will become most of our business in the markets where it’s been introduced. So that's historically -- that's almost always the case. I can't think of an exception. I suppose if we researched it, someone would point out an exemption. But that's almost always the case. 
The Fortify and Unify product lines, really, we think, we expect a pretty quick shift because they are just such compelling products. I mean, it's a smaller package, it's got more output. More output means opportunity to have a higher degree of safety for patients. You’ve got additional opportunity to defibrillate them, if the patient's condition at the point of the event requires more output. There's just far more new technology there than I've just expressed. All of which is meaningful to physicians, and we think it's going to have a good impact on patients and patient comfort too. So we do expect a pretty quick shift over to Fortify and Unify."

So on a sequential quarter basis, you saw our guidance for our CRM business increase on a sequential-quarter basis. And I mentioned earlier that although we aren't going to break that number I mentioned earlier that as of the day that we learned that our competitor was going to take its ICDs off the market in the United States, we already were on track to deliver global CRM sales. So that means successful U.S. ICD sales. They were up towards the upper end of our guidance. And I think our guidance was probably ahead of where most people have found credible. But we were right on track to offer very strong results, independently, if all our competitors business stayed in a steady-state. So yes, it was as expected. It was actually on the strong side of what we expected. 
And with respect to customer destocking of inventory, we didn’t see anything unusual or unexpected. In the third quarter of last year, we were surprised by changes in customer inventory and quarter-end purchases. But we've adjusted our expectations. And now, I'd say we're back to a steady-state. There's nothing unusual or unexpected in customer inventory practices. Going forward, we expect customers will continue to maintain a tight focus on inventory levels. And so we aren't expecting a rebound in kind of customer stocking. We expect continued tight customer inventory management."

So what is hard to know from outside the business, it's hard to know how hard our global organization worked during the third and fourth quarters of 2009 to restructure and how profound the restructuring was and how spot on it turned out to be. 
So to remind people, we eliminated approximately 700 positions. That was approximately 5% of our global workforce. That was the result of a total global review. The job reductions were throughout the global organization. It involved all of our divisions and our corporate group. The restructuring included revisiting our global structure. We flattened the organization. We realigned the organization where it made sense. We reviewed product lines. We made changes to rationalize the product lines where it made sense. That resulted in some of the inventory write-offs related to product line reviews. 
We revisited some of our business processes here inside the business on a very intensive basis to challenge ourselves. What have we gotten used to doing that isn’t as good as we want it to be and where should we make changes in our business processes. We had a special focus on some of the processes surrounding our sales and marketing effectiveness. And so there was a lot of work done that was really off the radar screen. You saw some special charge from it. But no one could really appreciate the level of work and the level of judgment and the level of change. So what you see now in our first quarter results is the benefit of six months of work that was largely off the radar screen. And as far as investment goes, the level of investment has been uncompromised. So you saw our R&D spending continue to increase on a dollar basis, sequential quarter and year-over-year. Our restructuring was not sacrifice of future growth at all. Our restructuring was a growth-oriented restructuring. 
And the sales success, as well as the productivity gains, all just position us to increase. We increased our sales guidance for the full year. We absorbed $40 million or $50 million reduction in sales due to foreign currency translation changes. We overcame that and increased our guidance of -- originally, we had guidance of 7% to 11% of sales growth for the year a quarter ago and now we've increased the top end slightly. The range is 8% to 11%, after absorbing a $40 million to $50 million reduction due to foreign currency changes. So all of that would really confirm to anyone that our restructuring was a growth-oriented restructuring, not a sacrifice of future growth or sacrifice of appropriate investment."

Sales for the quarter totaled $1.262 billion, up approximately 11% over the $1.134 billion reported in the first quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year’s first quarter increased this quarter’s sales by about $43 million. We will update our currency assumptions in a moment, but the actual average exchange rates during the first quarter were within our previous guidance range. On a constant currency basis, first quarter sales increased approximately 8% versus last year.
At the end of 2009, the Federal Research and Development tax credit expired and then it has not yet been extended for 2010. In this circumstance, GAAP requires us to estimate and record our effective income tax rate assuming that the R&D credit is not extended. For purposes of this conference call and our calculation of adjusted net earnings however, we are assuming that the tax credit will be extended for 2010 as in past years. 
As a result, comments referencing first quarter results and our guidance for 2010 including EPS amounts are presented based on an effective income tax rate that contemplates the extension of the tax credit retroactive to January 1, 2010. To the extent that the Federal Research and Development tax credit is not renewed. Our effective income tax rate for 2010 would be higher than what is being presented during this call.
Earnings per share were $0.75 for the first quarter of 2010, a 29% increase over EPS of $0.58 in the first quarter of 2009 and above our guidance range of $0.66 to $0.68 for the quarter. On a currency neutral basis, we estimate our earnings per share growth for the first quarter was approximately 20%. As you know three selling weeks prior to the end of the first quarter of 2010, a competitor announced the suspension of all sales of their ICD products in the United States. 
We estimate that this dynamic benefited our first quarter US ICD sales by approximately $20 million to $25 million. In preparing our second quarter and full year 2010 guidance we have taken into account, the period in April that this competitive remained out of the US ICD market.
Before we discuss our first quarter 2010 sales results by product category with guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2010, let me comment on foreign currency. As discussed on prior calls, the two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical’s operations are the Euro and the Yen.
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2010, we had used exchange rates, which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.40 to $1.45 and for the yen each 88 yen to 93 yen would translate into $1. For the first quarter the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen versus these assumptions did not result in a material difference in reported sales.
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2010, we’re assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.33 to $1.38 and that for the yen each 90 yen to 95 yen will translate into $1. This change in assumption regarding currency exchange rates has the impact of decreasing total forecasted sales for the remainder of 2010 by about $40 million to $50 million, which we estimate will reduce EPS by approximately $0.04 to $0.05 over the remainder of the year. 
Now for the sales by product category discussion for the first quarter, total Cardiac Rhythm Management sales, which includes revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines was $752 million, up11% from last year’s first quarter, including $24 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, first quarter CRM sales increased 8% versus a strong first quarter from last year. 
For the first quarter, ICD sales were $452 million, up 15% from last year’s first quarter. On a constant currency basis, first quarter ICD sales increased to 12% versus last year. U.S. ICD sales were $281 million, up 9% from last year’s first quarter. International ICD sales were $171 million a 26%, increase over the first quarter of 2009, including $12 million of favorable foreign currency translations.
For low-voltage devices, sales for the first quarter totaled $300 million up 6%, from last year’s first quarter on a constant currency basis first quarter low-voltage device sales increased 2% versus last year.
In the United States pacemaker sales were $128 million flat with last year’s first quarter. In our international markets pacemaker sales were approximately $172 million up 12%, from the first quarter of 2009 including $12 million of favorable foreign currency translations.
For the second quarter of 2010, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $745 million to $775 million and for the full year 2010 we now expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $2.965 billion to $3.40 billion.
Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the first quarter totaled $170 million up 17%, over the first quarter of last year including $7 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis first quarter AF product sales increased 12%, versus last year.
For the second quarter of 2010; we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $165 million to $180 million. We expect our full year 2010 AF product sales to be in the range of $695 million to $725 million. This 2010 outlook range is slightly less than the full year 2010 guidance range we provided last quarter, which primarily reflects the stronger U.S. dollar versus the euro.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the first quarter of 2010 were $256 million, up 7% over the first quarter of 2009, including $10 million of favorable foreign currency translation. On a constant currency basis, first quarter cardiovascular products sales increased 3% versus last year. Within this category of products, sales of vascular closure products in the first quarter of 2010 were $98 million consistent with the first quarter of 2009.
Sales of heart valve products in the first quarter of 2010 were $86 million, a 6% increase over the first quarter of 2009. For the second quarter of 2010, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $245 million to $260 million. We expect full year 2010 cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.45 billion. This 2010 outlook range is slightly less than the full year 2010 guidance range we provided last quarter which primarily reflects the stronger U.S. dollar versus the euro.
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the first quarter of 2010 were $84 million, up 15% from the first quarter of 2009, including $2 million of favorable foreign currency translations. For the second quarter of 2010, we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million and we continue to expect full year 2010 neuromodulation sales in the range of $375 million to $395 million.
Looking to revenue by geography, in total 51% of St. Jude Medical sales in the first quarter of 2010 came from the United States, while 49% came from international markets. As with prior quarters the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales for the first quarter of 2010 is available in our press release.
The gross profit margin this quarter was 74.5% representing a 50 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2009 for the full year 2010 we expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.2% to 73.8%. 
Our full year 2010 gross profit margin guidance continues to incorporate the impact of absorbing the cost associated with the remote monitoring and wireless telemetry capabilities in our pacemaker product line. We are providing for this impact to be slightly higher in the second half of this year. In addition our gross profit margin guidance also reflects the revised currency assumptions for the remainder of 2010.
Our first quarter SG&A expenses were 35.1% of net sales a 170 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010 we continue to forecast SG&A as a percentage of net sales in the range of 35.2% to 35.8%.
Research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2010, was 12% of net sales. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect R&D expense to stay in the range of 12.0% to 12.6% of net sales as we continue to balance delivering short-term results with the right investments in the long-term growth drivers.
Net other expense was $20 million in the first quarter and for the second quarter of 2010 we expect the other income and expense line item will be a net expense of approximately 16 million. For the full year 2010, we expect other expense of approximately $65 million to $70 million.
For the first quarter, the company’s effective income tax rate was 24.8% and for 2010 we continued to expect tax rate to be in the range of 24.5% to 25.0%. As a reminder these effective income tax rates contemplate the extension of the R&D credit in 2010 retroactive to the beginning of the year, to the extent it is not extended. Our overall effective income tax rate would increase. We have also assumed the extension of the federal research and development credit in the EPS guidance for 2010.
Moving on to the balance sheet, at the end of the first quarter 2010 we had $530 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.936 billion in total debt, along with $1 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The debt on our balance sheet includes $1.641 billion of senior notes with maturities in 2013, 2014 and 2019.
In addition to the senior notes, the outstanding debt on our balance sheet includes $295 million of notes issued in Japan, which matured in May 2010 and December 2011. We are currently in the final stages of refinancing the $225 million portion of the Japan notes that mature in May 2010 with a new fixed rate yen based debt having maturities ranging from seven to 10 years.
Next I want to offer comments regarding our EPS outlook for the second quarter and full year 2010. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the second quarter of 2010, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 330 million to 332 million shares with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full-year 2010 at 331 million to 333 million.
The company expects consolidated earnings per share for the second quarter to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.75, and for the full-year 2010, we now expect consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $2.80 to $2.85, a $0.09 increase from the full-year 2010 guidance we gave during our fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. This updated expectation represents EPS growth of approximately 15% to 17% over the 2009 adjusted EPS of $2.43.
To provide some insight into the basis for the increase in our annual EPS guidance, we start out with the results for the first quarter and note that we exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance for the first quarter by approximately $0.08. As previously discussed, we estimate that the change in our assumptions regarding currency exchange rates will reduce our EPS for the remainder of the year by approximately $0.04 to $0.05, and we are factoring this negative change into our updated full-year guidance. However, we expect the strength of our business to continue and we believe that we will more than offset this negative currency impact during the remainder of the year.
I would now like to turn it back to Dan.

I realized many of you have questions about events involving one of our competitors, but our focus on this call is to make sure everyone has good insight into the successive momentum of St. Jude Medical’s own growth program on an indepe",1171,"Thank you, John. I realized many of you have questions about events involving one of our competitors, but our focus on this call is to make sure everyone has good insight into the successive momentum of St. Jude Medical’s own growth program on an independent basis. Yes, we did benefit during the last three months of our first quarter from problems another company was having, but we just delivered a 29% increase in earnings per share and beat the high end of our guidance by $0.07 pre share. These results were driven primarily by the strength and success of our own growth program. The problems one of our competitors had the last three weeks of our quarter had only a small impact. With this in mind, the first topic I want to emphasize is the benefit our restructuring had on our first quarter results.
Our operating profit margin improved to 27.4% for this quarter. This is a full 250 basis point improvement over Q1 2009, and a 160 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2009. Our operating profit margin during the first quarter of 2010 did benefit from ICD sales that were higher than expected the last three weeks of our quarter, but even without this benefit St. Jude Medical would have delivered an operating profit margin gain for the quarter that exceeded the expectations that were incorporated into our prior guidance for earnings per share.
The second topic I want to emphasize is the strength of our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM sales results during the first quarter. Prior to the announcement on March 15, that one competitor was suspending sales of its ICDs in the United States. We already were on track to deliver global CRM sales that were at the upper end of our guidance. This confirmed to us that we made the right changes in our U.S. sales organization during the second half of 2009. This also put us in good shape to provide seamless and timely ICD coverage to customers who turned the St. Jude Medical as a result of competitor issues.
We now expect a gain CRM market share for full-year 2010 both in the United States and on a total global basis. We expect to launch over 10 new CRM products during the second quarter alone. I will refer you to the information we presented last quarter at our annual investor conference for the features and benefits of these new products, but on this mornings call, I at least want to remind you how strong our pipeline of new products is.
In the United States during the second quarter we expect to launch our new Fortify and Unify lines of high voltage devices. We also are launching our 4 French QuickFlex [µ lead] and new [µ lead] delivery system in a cell phone enabled option for our Merlin@Home remote monitoring system. Keep in mind that this is in addition to our 7 French high-voltage leads, our SJ4 connecter system in our accent and anthem lines of low-voltage devices with RF telemetry and remote monitoring capability.
In Europe during the second quarter we are offering all of the same technologies I just listed for the United States, but in addition we also are launching our Fortify ST line of high-voltage devices. Our core view pulmonary edema monitoring technology in our Promote Quadra ICD systems with the Quartet, Quadripolar left ventricular pacing lead to facilitate both electronically positioning in multi-side left ventricular pacing.
In Japan, we already have received regulatory approval for our analyst line of ICDs. We are in the process of obtained reimbursement and expect to launch this product line before the end of the second quarter. Our analyst line of ICDs will introduce ST segment monitoring technology into the Japanese market for the first time; in addition we have received regulatory approval in Japan for our Current Plus ICDs and Remote Plus CRT-D devices along with our Durata 7 French high-voltage lead all with the four connectors the first devices in the world labeled as compliant with the newly published ISO connector standard.
If I were asked to summarize the competitive advantage of St. Jude Medical’s CRM program for the reminder of 2010, I would say this. We have a clear competitive advantage in our product line. We have a strong inventory position and significant additional manufacturing capacity. We have a stable trained and experienced field organization in place to provide complete coverage to customers in all major global markets.
The dynamics of the replacement markets are changing from a headwind that has slowed our growth to a tailwind that we expect to accelerate our growth. We believe we are ahead of all of our competitors in establishing a strong Atrial Fibrillation program and as a result we have also strengthened our ability to gain share and pacemakers and ICDs.
Last but not least, we have good continuity of leadership and program strategy, especially in these times the value of this continuity, the impact it has on product and program quality and the overall competitive advantage of discontinuity should not be underestimated. We fully expect to gain additional CRM market share in 2010.
Before I open it up for questions, I would like to touch briefly on each of our other major growth platforms. Within our cardiovascular business I am pleased to confirm that a limited launch of our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve already is underway in Europe. As a reminder the pericardial segment of the tissue valve market is approximately $500 million on a global basis. Our entry into this market in Europe is a significant milestone in our program to continue to reinvigorate the long-term growth of our cardiovascular business. With respect to the business of our Atrial Fibrillation or AF division, we now have CE Mark for four new families of ablation catheters, including catheters with our contact technology and catheters with our CoolFlex technology.
We recently received approval in Japan for our NavX technology on our EnSite advanced mapping systems platform. We continue to make good progress integrating our EP-WorkMate and our MediGuide technology with our EnSite Velocity platform. All of this reinforces our optimism that we are on track to sustain the long term growth of our AF business. With respect to our neuromodulation business, although first quarter sales came in at $84 million versus our guidance range of $85 million to $90 million, we attribute this minor variance to timing. We expect a rebound of neuromodulation sales during the second quarter.
In conclusion, our first quarter was highly successful by every major measure. We exceeded the high end of our sales guidance. We improved our operating margin on a year-over-year basis by 250 basis points. We delivered a 29% increase in earnings per share. We entered the second quarter with good momentum and with major new product launches scheduled for the remainder of the year.
With that, I’d like to open it up for questions and turn it back to you to moderate, Regina.

So that was due to the market growth assumption that we had at the beginning of the year and nothing that happened during the first quarter changed our assessment of total global market growth, point one.
Point two, if you look at the range of our full-year CRM sales guidance, you can see that although there is some range in there we’re estimating approximately one full point of global CRM share gains for full-year of 2010, so that would be the best way for me to answer your question rather than offer more specificity quarter-by-quarter.
Generally, as you ask about the impact of the circumstances that at Boston Scientific, it’s really too soon for us to know what that impact is going to be. We think about it in several buckets, we think about it first in terms of what’s the impact on the CRM markets in its entity and our assessment is that the palms at Boston Scientific long term are not going to have any material impact on the health and growth of the global CRM market, that’s the first point.
On the topic of impact on market share shifts, it really is too soon for us to assess that will have a better idea after we’ve finish the second quarter, but for now, we’re kind of holding back, or we’re going to wait and see, we don’t really know how to model that, we haven’t been through exactly these circumstances before. So, if we’re going to air, we’re going air on the side of being conservative for purposes of our guidance this morning.

I think that customers generally see as the same way and if you kind of imagine a company that has a product line with the little with new in it you, imagine that same company having a product line that has had numerous advisory here in the recent past as well as in the multiyear past, but even in the recent past multiple advisories, we kind of referred to the whole set of circumstances internally here we refer to the circumstances that the competitive company as the Boston Debacle, and so if you think about a company going through all of the circumstances of the Boston Debacle coming out of that, they’ve indicated that they’re going to change their traditional level of investments to develop the market.
So you’ve got an increasingly uncompetitive product line, one that already has been the target of multiple advisories from a company that has announced that as a growth strategy they’re going to lower the traditional amount of investment they’ve made in developing the CRM market, they’ve got quite a bit of instability in their field organization, and we can only imagine all of the circumstances of that and all of the impact that has on ability to service customer requirements in a high quality way and on top of all of that the company says, yes, but we’ll lower our price. I think the perception customers will get on averages that you get what you pay for and we would see that as a strategy that is a concern, but not a strategy that would have a long term success for that competitive program.

The outcome I’d say is speculative in our own modeling. We do model that we will continue to get benefits from the Parkinson’s indication in our Neuromodulation program.
As everyone in the call knows, we are in still early phases of launching that technology for that indication in Europe. In future years we remain confident and optimistic that we’ll launch our deep brain stimulation technology work for a Parkinson’s indication in the United States as well.
On the migraine side, we model absolutely nothing for the possibility of upside on migraine, and we would think it’s prudent for everyone to have very low expectations and not model any contribution from migraine. If we have positive outcome to the clinical data that will only mark another milestone in what we’ll still be very lengthy multiyear process of adding to the clinical data working to get reimbursement, working to establish creditability in the referral string and so a person are to think about that as a very long term growth opportunity and model nothing in the next few years.

So we are thinking of it in terms of acceleration in the first quarter although I am sure that to the extent your numbers reflect that your numbers are accurate, but we kind of step back and think about this as a 10% to 15% growth market on a sustainable basis over an additional multi-year period and so, when not that we’ve got another quarter behind us our takeaway is, yes this continues to be a good 10% to 15% growth market. We have what we consider to be the leading program in the space, our sales results of 17% growth in a market growing in the range of 10% to 15% indicates that we’re at least holding share and we may be gaining share, other companies don’t report their numbers with enough granularity for us to know for sure. But everything is on track, there were no surprises to us either on the upside or on the downside in the AF market development or market opportunity in the first quarter and we continue to look at this as one of the best growth opportunities in all of medical device technology. We think it’s a winner on cost-effectiveness, we think that the accumulation of clinical trial data will show it’s a winner on clinical effectiveness we’ve got and we see consensus continuing to build in the global cardiology community on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of catheter-based curative approach to Atrial Fibrillation. So, then this just saves a lot of money for a healthcare system as well as alleviates a significant human misery. So that articulates from the first quarter.

We’re just starting off now in the beginning of this month with our full launch for Unify and Fortify and people are really appreciating the full package of those devices with not only the small size, but the 40 joules output, the past charge times, no compromise in longevity, and all the additional features like CoreView, like the ST in the Fortify ST line.
On the CRT side, we really think about ourselves as really getting to the next level with the Quadripolar system with Promote Quadra and the Quartet lead that we think that’s going to become the next real standard of care for CRT and the customer response for that has been that they agree with us that they really think that, that is the next true evolution in CRT therapy and really addresses a number of important clinical concerns that they have and allows them to have much more efficient not only implants, but also on the follow-up side. And then in Japan, we are also seeing the results of the strength of our new products and I think that raises up well for Q2 start as we’re going to be launching as Dan mentioned our analyst device there we have a symposium on ST segment monitoring in Japan that’s taking place this weekend. The initial response to the concept has been very strong and then also the DF-4 connector provides for the Japanese market not only all the benefits of that, but it also provides a way for downsizing the device and that’s obviously important in that market.

Average selling prices during the first quarter were stable. So that was nothing in that so the prior question wasn’t about actual prices it was about are we see a competitor offer, lower prices not a question of is business being transacted at the lower price.
Business in the first quarter was transacted within normal average selling price ranges and so we saw very stable average selling prices on the total global basis in our ICD business and then our pacing business. We did see one competitor offer low prices and it was particularly striking with low prices were offered at a point where they didn’t have an approved product offer, but I digress and so, but the actual success of the business was at within normal prices.
We don’t expect to see a change in average selling prices in a way that would change our estimate that the global CRM market will then continue to grow at the range of 4% to 6%. So everything that we expect with respect to competitive price tactics number one, but also with respect to new technology and other impact of new technology on product mix everything that we see with respect to geographic mix of the strengthening of our business in Japan for example, all of those things are baked into our assessment that the global CRM market will continue to grow at about the 4% to 6%.

I think our guidance was probably ahead of where most people found credible, but we were right on track to offer very strong results independently if all of our competitors business stated in a steady state. So yes it was as expected it was actually on the strong side of what we expected and with respect to customer de-stocking of inventory we didn’t see anything unusual or unexpected. So in the third quarter of last year we were surprised by changes in customer inventory and quarter end purchases, but we’ve adjusted our expectations and now we’re I would say were back to a steady state there was nothing unusual or expected in customer inventory practices.
Going forward we expect customers to continue to maintain a tight focus on inventory levels and so we aren’t expecting a rebound in kind of customers talking and we’re expecting continued tight customer inventory management.

The job reductions were throughout the global organization that involved all of our divisions in our corporate group.

We revisited some of our business processes here inside the business on a very intensive basis to challenge ourselves what have we gotten used to doing that isn’t as good as we wanted to be and where should we make changes in our business processes we had a special focus on some of the processes surrounding our sales and marketing effectiveness and so there was a lot of work done that was really off the rate our screen.
You saw some special charge from it, but no one could really appreciate the level of work and the level of judgment and the level of change. So, what you see now in our first quarter results is the benefit of six months of work that was largely off the radar screen. As far as investment goes, the level of investment has been uncompromised. So you saw our R&D spending continue to increase on a dollar basis, sequential quarter and year-over-year.
So our restructuring was not sacrifice of future at all. Our restructuring was a growth oriented restructuring and the sales success as well as the productivity gains all just position us for to increase. We increased our sales guidance for the full year. We absorbed full year $50 million reduction in sales due to foreign currency translation changes.
We overcame that and increased our guidance. Originally, we had guidance of 7% to 11%. Sales growths for the year a quarter go, now we’ve increased the top end slightly and the range is 8% to 11% after absorbing $40 million to $50 million reduction due to foreign currency changes. So all of that would really confirm to anyone that our restructuring was a growth oriented restructuring, not a sacrifice of future growth or sacrifice of the appropriate investment.

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,262,000,000, up approximately 11% over the $1,134,000,000 reported in the first quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year's first quarter increased this quarter's sales",1962,"Thank you, Dan. Sales for the quarter totaled $1,262,000,000, up approximately 11% over the $1,134,000,000 reported in the first quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year's first quarter increased this quarter's sales by about $43 million. We will update our currency assumptions in a moment. But the actual average exchange rates during the first quarter were within our previous guidance range. 
On a constant-currency basis, first quarter sales increased approximately 8% versus last year. At the end of 2009, the federal research and development tax credit expired, and it has not yet been extended for 2010. In this circumstance, GAAP requires us to estimate and record our effective income tax rate, assuming that the R&D credit is not extended. For purposes of this conference call and our calculation of adjusted net earnings, however, we are assuming that the tax credit will be extended for 2010 as in past years. As a result, comments referencing first quarter results and our guidance for 2010, including EPS amounts, are presented based on an effective income tax rate that contemplates the extension of the tax credit retroactive to January 1, 2010. To the extent that the federal research and development tax credit is not renewed, our effective income tax rate for 2010 would be higher than what is being presented during this call. 
Earnings per share were $0.75 for the first quarter of 2010, a 29% increase over EPS of $0.58 in the first quarter of 2009 and above our guidance range of $0.66 to $0.68 for the quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, we estimate our earnings per share growth for the first quarter was approximately 20%. 
As you know, three selling weeks prior to the end of the first quarter of 2010, a competitor announced the suspension of all sales of their ICD products in the United States. We estimate that this dynamic benefited our first quarter U.S. ICD sales by approximately $20 million to $25 million. In preparing our second quarter and full year 2010 guidance, we have taken into account the period in April that this competitor remained out of the U.S. ICD market. 
Before we discuss our first quarter 2010 sales results by product category with guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2010, let me comment on foreign currency. As discussed on prior calls, the two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2010, we had used exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.40 to $1.45. And for the yen, each 88 yen to 93 yen would translate to USD $1. For the first quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen versus these assumptions did not result in a material difference in reported sales. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2010, we are assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.33 to $1.38; and that for the yen, each 90 yen to 95 yen will translate into USD $1. This change in assumption regarding currency exchange rates has the impact of decreasing total forecasted sales for the remainder of 2010 by about $40 million to $50 million, which we estimate will reduce EPS by approximately $0.04 to $0.05 over the remainder of the year.
Now for the sales by product category discussion for the quarter. Total Cardiac Rhythm Management sales, which includes revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines were $752 million, up 11% from last year's first quarter, including $24 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant-currency basis, first quarter CRM sales increased 8% versus a strong first quarter from last year. For the first quarter, ICD sales were $452 million, up 15% from last year's first quarter. On a constant-currency basis, first quarter ICD sales increased 12% versus last year. U.S. ICD sales were $281 million, up 9% from last year's first quarter. International ICD sales were $171 million, a 26% increase over the first quarter of 2009, including $12 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For our low-voltage devices, sales for the first quarter totaled $300 million, up 6% from last year's first quarter. On a constant-currency basis, first quarter low-voltage device sales increased 2% versus last year. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $128 million, flat with last year's first quarter. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $172 million, up 12% from the first quarter of 2009, including $12 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For the second quarter of 2010, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $745 million to $775 million. And for the full year 2010, we now expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $2,965,000,000 to $3,040,000,000. Atrial Fibrillation, or AF, product sales for the first quarter totaled $170 million, up 17% over the first quarter of last year, including $7 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant-currency basis, first quarter AF product sales increased 12% versus last year. For the second quarter of 2010, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $165 million to $180 million. We expect our full year 2010 AF product sales to be in the range of $695 million to $725 million. This 2010 outlook range is slightly less than the full year 2010 guidance range we provided last quarter, which primarily reflects the stronger U.S. dollar versus the euro. 
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the first quarter of 2010 were $256 million, up 7% over the first quarter of 2009, including $10 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant-currency basis, first quarter cardiovascular product sales increased 3% versus last year. 
Within this category of products, sales of vascular closure products in the first quarter of 2010 were $98 million, consistent with the first quarter of 2009. Sales of heart valve products in the first quarter of 2010 were $86 million, a 6% increase over the first quarter of 2009. 
For the second quarter of 2010, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $245 million to $260 million. We expect full year 2010 cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $1,015,000,000 to $1,045,000,000. This 2010 outlook range is a slightly less than the full year 2010 guidance range we provided last quarter, which primarily reflects the stronger U.S. dollar versus the euro. 
Total sales of Neuromodulation products in the first quarter of 2010 were $84 million, up 15% from the first quarter of 2009, including $2 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For the second quarter of 2010, we expect sales of Neuromodulation products to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million, and we continue to expect full year 2010 Neuromodulation sales in the range of $375 million to $395 million.
Looking to revenue by geography, in total, 51% of St. Jude Medical sales in the first quarter of 2010 came from the United States, while 49% came from international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales for the first quarter of 2010 is available in our press release. The gross profit margin this quarter was 74.5%, representing a 50 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2009. 
For the full year 2010, we expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.2% to 73.8%. Our full year 2010 gross profit margin guidance continues to incorporate the impact of absorbing the costs associated with the remote monitoring and wireless telemetry capabilities in our pacemaker product line. We are providing for this impact to be slightly higher in the second half of this year. In addition, our gross profit margin guidance also reflects the revised currency assumptions for the remainder of 2010.
Our first quarter SG&A expenses were 35.1% of net sales, a 170 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, we continue to forecast SG&A as a percentage of net sales in the range of 35.2% to 35.8%. Research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2010 was 12% of net sales. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect R&D expense to stay in the range of 12.0% to 12.6% of net sales as we continue to balance delivering short-term results with the right investments in long-term growth drivers. 
Net other expense was $20 million in the first quarter. And for the second quarter of 2010, we expect the other income and expense line item will be a net expense of approximately $16 million. For the full year 2010, we expect other expense of approximately $65 million to $70 million. 
For the first quarter, the company's effective income tax rate was 24.8%. And for 2010, we continue to expect tax rate to be in the range of 24.5% to 25.0%. As a reminder, these effective income tax rates contemplate the extension of the R&D credit in 2010 retroactive to the beginning of the year. To the extent it is not extended, our overall effective income tax rate would increase. We have also assumed the extension of the federal research and development credit in the EPS guidance for 2010.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter 2010, we had $530 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,936,000,000 in total debt, along with $1 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The debt on our balance sheet includes $1,641,000,000 of senior notes with maturities in 2013, 2014 and 2019. In addition to the senior notes, the outstanding debt on our balance sheet includes $295 million of notes issued in Japan, which mature in May 2010 and December 2011. We are currently in the final stages of refinancing the $225 million portion of the Japan notes that mature in May 2010 with a new fixed rate yen-based debt having maturities ranging from seven to 10 years.
Next, I want to offer comments regarding our EPS outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2010. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the second quarter of 2010, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 330 million to 332 million shares, with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2010 at 331 million to 333 million. The company expects consolidated earnings per share for the second quarter to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.75. And for the full year 2010, we now expect consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $2.80 to $2.85, a $0.09 increase from the full year 2010 guidance we gave during our fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. This updated expectation represents EPS growth of approximately 15% to 17% over the 2009 adjusted EPS of $2.43. 
To provide some insight into the basis for the increase in our annual EPS guidance, we start out with the results for the first quarter and note that we exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance for the first quarter by approximately $0.08. As previously discussed, we estimate that the change in our assumptions regarding currency exchange rates will reduce our EPS for the remainder of the year by approximately $0.04 to $0.05, and we are factoring this negative change into our updated full year guidance. However, we expect the strength of our business to continue, and we believe that we will more than offset this negative currency impact during the remainder of the year. 
I would now like to turn it back to Dan."

But our focus in this call is to make sure everyone has good insight into the success and momentum of St. Jude Medical's own growth program on an independ",1176,"Thank you, John. I realize many of you have questions about events involving one of our competitors. But our focus in this call is to make sure everyone has good insight into the success and momentum of St. Jude Medical's own growth program on an independent basis. Yes, we did benefit during the last three months of our first quarter from problems another company was having. But we just delivered a 29% increase in earnings per share and beat the high end of our guidance by $0.07 per share. These results were driven primarily by the strength and success of our own growth program. The problems one of our competitors had the last three weeks of our quarter had only a small impact. With this in mind, the first topic I want to emphasize is the benefit our restructuring had on our first quarter results. 
Our operating profit margin improved to 27.4% for this quarter. This is a full 250 basis point improvement over Q1 2009 and a 160 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2009. Our operating profit margin during the first quarter of 2010 did benefit from ICD sales that were higher than expected the last three weeks of our quarter. But even without this benefit, St. Jude Medical would have delivered on operating profit margin gain for the quarter that exceeded the expectations that were incorporated into our prior guidance for earnings per share. 
The second topic I want to emphasize is the strength of our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM sales results during the first quarter. Prior to the announcement on March 15 that one competitor was suspending sales of its ICD's in the United States, we already were on track to deliver global CRM sales that were at the upper end of our guidance. This confirmed to us that we made the right changes in our U.S. sales organization during the second half of 2009. This also put us in good shape to provide seamless and timely ICD coverage to customers who turn to St. Jude Medical as a result of competitor issues.
We now expect to gain CRM market share for full year 2010, both in the United States and on a total global basis. We expect to launch over 10 new CRM products during the second quarter alone. I will refer you to the information we presented last quarter at our Annual Investor Conference for the features and benefits of these new products. But on this morning's call, I at least want to remind you how strong our pipeline of new products is.
In the United States during the second quarter, we expect to launch our new Fortify and Unify lines of high-voltage devices. We also are launching our new 4 French Quickflex Left-Heart Lead, a new Left-Heart Lead delivery system and a cell phone-enabled option for our Merlin@home remote monitoring system. Keep in mind that this is in addition to our 7 French high voltage leads, our SJ4 connector system and our Accent and Anthem lines of low voltage devices with RF telemetry and remote monitoring capability. 
In Europe during the second quarter, we are offering all of the same technologies I just listed for the United States. But in addition, we also are launching our Fortify ST line of high-voltage devices, our CorVue pulmonary edema monitoring technology and our Promote Quadra ICD systems with the Quartet quadripolar left ventricular pacing lead to facilitate both electronic repositioning and Multi-Site Left Ventricular Pacing.
In Japan, we already have received regulatory approval for our AnalyST line of ICDs. We are in the process of obtaining reimbursement and expect to launch this product line before the end of the second quarter. Our AnalyST line of ICDs will introduce ST segment monitoring technology into the Japanese market for the first time. In addition, we have received regulatory approval in Japan for our Current Plus ICDs and Promote Plus CRTD devices, along with our Durata 7 French high voltage lead, all with DF-4 connectors, the first devices in the world labeled as complying with the newly published ISO connector standard. 
If I were asked to summarize the competitive advantage of St. Jude Medical's CRM program for the remainder of 2010, I would say this, we have a clear competitive advantage in our product line. We have a strong inventory position and significant additional manufacturing capacity. We have a stable, trained and experienced field organization in place to provide complete coverage to customers in all major global markets. The dynamics of the replacement market are changing from a headwind that has slowed our growth to a tailwind that we expect to accelerate our growth. We believe we are ahead of all of our competitors in establishing a strong Atrial Fibrillation program. And as a result, we have also strengthened our ability to gain share in pacemakers and ICDs. Last but not least, we have good continuity of leadership and program strategy. Especially in these times, the value of this continuity, the impact it has on product and program quality and the overall competitive advantage of this continuity should not be underestimated. We fully expect to gain additional CRM market share in 2010.
Before I open it up for questions, I would like to touch briefly on each of our other major growth platforms. Within our Cardiovascular business, I am pleased to confirm that a limited launch of our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve already is underway in Europe. As a reminder, the pericardial segment of the tissue valve market is approximately $500 million on a global basis. Our entry into this market in Europe is a significant milestone in our program to continue to reinvigorate the long-term growth of our cardiovascular business. 
With respect to the business of our Atrial Fibrillation or AF division, we now have CE Mark for four new families of ablation catheters, including catheters with our Contact technology and catheters with our Cool Flex technology. We recently received approval in Japan for our NavX technology on our EnSite advanced mapping systems platform. We continue to make good progress, integrating our EP-Workmate and our MediGuide technology with our EnSite Velocity platform. All of this reinforces our optimism that we are on track to sustain the long term growth of our AF business. 
With respect to our in Neuromodulation business, although first quarter sales came in at $84 million versus our guidance range of $85 million to $90 million, we attribute this minor variance to timing. We expect a rebound of Neuromodulation sales during the second quarter. 
In conclusion, our first quarter was highly successful by every major measure. We exceeded the high end of our sales guidance. We improved our operating margin on a year-over-year basis by 250 basis points. We delivered a 29% increase in earnings per share. We entered the second quarter with good momentum and with major new product launches scheduled for the remainder of the year. 
With that, I'd like to open it up for questions and turn it back to you to moderate, Regina."

That's the first major component. So that was the market growth assumption that we had at the beginning of the year, and nothing that happened during the first quarter changed our assessment of total global market growth, point one.  Point two, if you look at the range of our full year CRM sales guidance, you can see that although there's some range in there, we're estimating approximately one full point of global CRM share gain for full year 2010. So that would be the best way for me to answer your question rather than offer more specificity quarter-by-quarter. Generally, as you ask about the impact of the circumstances at Boston Scientific, it's really too soon for us to know what that impact is going to be. We think about it in several buckets. We think about it first, in terms of what's the impact on the CRM market in its entirety. And our assessment is that the problems at Boston Scientific long term are not going to have any material impact on the health and growth of the global CRM market. That's the first point.  On the topic of impact on market share shifts, it really is too soon for us to assess that. We'll have a better idea after we've finished the second quarter. But for now, we're kind of holding back. We're going to wait and see. We don't really know how to model that. We haven't been through exactly these circumstances before. So if we're going to err, we're going to err on the side of being conservative for the purpose of our guidance this morning."

And so we do worry about that for the rest of the year. But ultimately, our experience has been that when a competitor engages on a low-price strategy that's generally an admission of competitive weakness. I think that customers generally see it the same way. And if you kind of imagine a company that has a product line with very little that’s new in it, you imagine that same company having a product line that has had numerous advisories here in the recent past, as well as in the multi-year past, but even in recent past, multiple advisories. We kind of refer to the whole set of circumstances -- internally here, we refer to the circumstances at the competitive company as the “Boston Debacle”. And so if you think about a company going through all the circumstances of “Boston Debacle” coming out of that, they've indicated that they're going to change their traditional level of investment to develop the market.  So you've got an increasingly uncompetitive product line, one that already has been the target of multiple advisories from a company that has announced that as a growth strategy, they're going to lower the traditional amount of investment they've made in developing the CRM market. They've got quite a bit of instability in their field organization, and we can only imagine all of the circumstances of that and all of the impact that has on the ability to service customer requirements in a high-quality way. And if on top of all of that, the company says, yes, but we’ll lower our price, I think the perception customers will get on average is you get what you pay for. And we would see that as a strategy that is a concern, but not a strategy that would have a long-term success for that competitive program."

On the migraine side, the results really I’d say we are still -- I'm blinded to the data. I don't know if we're still entirely blinded to the data. But that's speculative. The outcome, I'd say, is speculative. In our own modeling, we do model that we will continue to get benefit from the Parkinson's indication in our Neuromodulation program. As everyone in the call knows, we are still in the early phases of launching that technology for that indication in Europe. In future years, we remain confident and optimistic that we'll launch our Deep Brain Stimulation technology for our Parkinson's indication in the United States as well.  On the migraine side, we model absolutely nothing for the possibility of upside on migraine. And we think it's prudent for everyone to have very low expectations and not model any contribution from migraine. If we have a positive outcome to the clinical data, that will only mark another milestone in what will still be a very lengthy multi-year process of adding to the clinical data, working to get reimbursement, working to establish credibility in the referral stream. And so a person ought to think about that as a very long-term growth opportunity and model nothing in the next few years."

Our sales results of 17% growth in a market growing in the range of 10% to 15% indicates that we're at least holding share and we may be gaining share. Other companies don’t report their numbers with enough granularity for us to know for sure. Everything is on track. There were no surprises to us even on the upside or on the downside in AF market development or a market opportunity in the first quarter.  We continue to look at this as one of the best growth opportunities in all of medical device technology. We think it's a winner on cost-effectiveness. We think that the accumulation of clinical trial data will show it's a winner on clinical effectiveness. We've got -- we see consensus continuing to build in the global cardiology community on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of catheter-based curative approach to atrial fibrillation.

But also, we had our limited launch of our new Unify, Fortify, and Fortify ST products that really have been met with very, very high degree of enthusiasm. That's allowed us to really get focus on the organization and our customers thinking about us as being truly innovators in this space. It’s also allowed us to get into competitive accounts where we haven't been before.  We’re just starting off now in the beginning of this month with our full launch for Unify and Fortify. And people are really appreciating the full package of those devices with not only the small size but the 40 joules output, the fast charge times, the no compromise in longevity and all the additional features like CorVue, like the ST and the Fortify ST line. On a CRT side, we really think about ourselves as really getting to the next level with the quadripolar system with Promote Quadra and the Quartet lead that we think that's going to become the next real standard, standard of care for CRT. And the customer response for that has been that they agree with us. That they really think that, that is the next true evolution in CRT therapy, and really addresses a number of important clinical concerns that they have and allows them to have much more efficient, not only implants, but also on the follow-up site.  And in Japan, we're also seeing the results of the strength of our new products. And I think that lays us up well for Q2 start as we're going to be launching, as Dan mentioned, our AnalyST device there. We have a symposium on ST segment monitoring in Japan that's taking place this weekend. The initial response to the concept has been very strong. And then also the DF-4 connector provides for the Japanese market not only for the benefits of that but it also provides a way for downsizing the device.

Not a question of is business being transacted at the lower price. Business in the first quarter was transacted within normal average selling price ranges. And so we saw very stable average selling prices on a total global basis in our ICD business and in our Pacing business. We did see one competitor offer low prices, and it was particularly striking that low prices were offered at a point where they didn't have an approved product offer. But I know I digress. But the actual success of the business was at within normal prices. We don't expect to see a change in the average selling prices in a way that would change our estimate that the global CRM market will continue to grow at the range of 4% to 6%. Everything that we expect with respect to competitive price tactics, number one. But also with respect to new technology and the impact of new technology on product mix, everything that we see with respect to geographic mix of the strengthening of our business in Japan, for example. All of those things are baked into our assessment that the global CRM market will continue to grow at about 4% to 6%. So no change to that. And we see nothing from a competitive customer behavior that we would expect to have changed that."

So the newest product line, if we have a successful product launch over the period of four to eight quarters, that new product line will become most of our business in the markets where it’s been introduced. So that's historically -- that's almost always the case. I can't think of an exception. I suppose if we researched it, someone would point out an exemption. But that's almost always the case.  The Fortify and Unify product lines, really, we think, we expect a pretty quick shift because they are just such compelling products. I mean, it's a smaller package, it's got more output. More output means opportunity to have a higher degree of safety for patients. You’ve got additional opportunity to defibrillate them, if the patient's condition at the point of the event requires more output. There's just far more new technology there than I've just expressed. All of which is meaningful to physicians, and we think it's going to have a good impact on patients and patient comfort too. So we do expect a pretty quick shift over to Fortify and Unify."

And I mentioned earlier that although we aren't going to break that number I mentioned earlier that as of the day that we learned that our competitor was going to take its ICDs off the market in the United States, we already were on track to deliver global CRM sales. So that means successful U.S. ICD sales. They were up towards the upper end of our guidance. And I think our guidance was probably ahead of where most people have found credible. But we were right on track to offer very strong results, independently, if all our competitors business stayed in a steady-state. So yes, it was as expected. It was actually on the strong side of what we expected.  And with respect to customer destocking of inventory, we didn’t see anything unusual or unexpected. In the third quarter of last year, we were surprised by changes in customer inventory and quarter-end purchases. But we've adjusted our expectations. And now, I'd say we're back to a steady-state. There's nothing unusual or unexpected in customer inventory practices. Going forward, we expect customers will continue to maintain a tight focus on inventory levels. And so we aren't expecting a rebound in kind of customer stocking. We expect continued tight customer inventory management."

So what is hard to know from outside the business, it's hard to know how hard our global organization worked during the third and fourth quarters of 2009 to restructure and how profound the restructuring was and how spot on it turned out to be.  So to remind people, we eliminated approximately 700 positions. That was approximately 5% of our global workforce. That was the result of a total global review. The job reductions were throughout the global organization. It involved all of our divisions and our corporate group. The restructuring included revisiting our global structure. We flattened the organization. We realigned the organization where it made sense. We reviewed product lines. We made changes to rationalize the product lines where it made sense. That resulted in some of the inventory write-offs related to product line reviews.  We revisited some of our business processes here inside the business on a very intensive basis to challenge ourselves. What have we gotten used to doing that isn’t as good as we want it to be and where should we make changes in our business processes. We had a special focus on some of the processes surrounding our sales and marketing effectiveness. And so there was a lot of work done that was really off the radar screen. You saw some special charge from it. But no one could really appreciate the level of work and the level of judgment and the level of change. So what you see now in our first quarter results is the benefit of six months of work that was largely off the radar screen. And as far as investment goes, the level of investment has been uncompromised. So you saw our R&D spending continue to increase on a dollar basis, sequential quarter and year-over-year. Our restructuring was not sacrifice of future growth at all. Our restructuring was a growth-oriented restructuring.  And the sales success, as well as the productivity gains, all just position us to increase. We increased our sales guidance for the full year. We absorbed $40 million or $50 million reduction in sales due to foreign currency translation changes. We overcame that and increased our guidance of -- originally, we had guidance of 7% to 11% of sales growth for the year a quarter ago and now we've increased the top end slightly. The range is 8% to 11%, after absorbing a $40 million to $50 million reduction due to foreign currency changes. So all of that would really confirm to anyone that our restructuring was a growth-oriented restructuring, not a sacrifice of future growth or sacrifice of appropriate investment."

Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year's first quarter increased this quarter's sales",1962,"Thank you, Dan. Sales for the quarter totaled $1,262,000,000, up approximately 11% over the $1,134,000,000 reported in the first quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year's first quarter increased this quarter's sales by about $43 million. We will update our currency assumptions in a moment. But the actual average exchange rates during the first quarter were within our previous guidance range. 
On a constant-currency basis, first quarter sales increased approximately 8% versus last year. At the end of 2009, the federal research and development tax credit expired, and it has not yet been extended for 2010. In this circumstance, GAAP requires us to estimate and record our effective income tax rate, assuming that the R&D credit is not extended. For purposes of this conference call and our calculation of adjusted net earnings, however, we are assuming that the tax credit will be extended for 2010 as in past years. As a result, comments referencing first quarter results and our guidance for 2010, including EPS amounts, are presented based on an effective income tax rate that contemplates the extension of the tax credit retroactive to January 1, 2010. To the extent that the federal research and development tax credit is not renewed, our effective income tax rate for 2010 would be higher than what is being presented during this call. 
Earnings per share were $0.75 for the first quarter of 2010, a 29% increase over EPS of $0.58 in the first quarter of 2009 and above our guidance range of $0.66 to $0.68 for the quarter. On a currency-neutral basis, we estimate our earnings per share growth for the first quarter was approximately 20%. 
As you know, three selling weeks prior to the end of the first quarter of 2010, a competitor announced the suspension of all sales of their ICD products in the United States. We estimate that this dynamic benefited our first quarter U.S. ICD sales by approximately $20 million to $25 million. In preparing our second quarter and full year 2010 guidance, we have taken into account the period in April that this competitor remained out of the U.S. ICD market. 
Before we discuss our first quarter 2010 sales results by product category with guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2010, let me comment on foreign currency. As discussed on prior calls, the two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the first quarter and full year 2010, we had used exchange rates which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.40 to $1.45. And for the yen, each 88 yen to 93 yen would translate to USD $1. For the first quarter, the actual average exchange rates for the euro and the yen versus these assumptions did not result in a material difference in reported sales. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the second quarter and the remainder of 2010, we are assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.33 to $1.38; and that for the yen, each 90 yen to 95 yen will translate into USD $1. This change in assumption regarding currency exchange rates has the impact of decreasing total forecasted sales for the remainder of 2010 by about $40 million to $50 million, which we estimate will reduce EPS by approximately $0.04 to $0.05 over the remainder of the year.
Now for the sales by product category discussion for the quarter. Total Cardiac Rhythm Management sales, which includes revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines were $752 million, up 11% from last year's first quarter, including $24 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant-currency basis, first quarter CRM sales increased 8% versus a strong first quarter from last year. For the first quarter, ICD sales were $452 million, up 15% from last year's first quarter. On a constant-currency basis, first quarter ICD sales increased 12% versus last year. U.S. ICD sales were $281 million, up 9% from last year's first quarter. International ICD sales were $171 million, a 26% increase over the first quarter of 2009, including $12 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For our low-voltage devices, sales for the first quarter totaled $300 million, up 6% from last year's first quarter. On a constant-currency basis, first quarter low-voltage device sales increased 2% versus last year. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $128 million, flat with last year's first quarter. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $172 million, up 12% from the first quarter of 2009, including $12 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For the second quarter of 2010, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $745 million to $775 million. And for the full year 2010, we now expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $2,965,000,000 to $3,040,000,000. Atrial Fibrillation, or AF, product sales for the first quarter totaled $170 million, up 17% over the first quarter of last year, including $7 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant-currency basis, first quarter AF product sales increased 12% versus last year. For the second quarter of 2010, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $165 million to $180 million. We expect our full year 2010 AF product sales to be in the range of $695 million to $725 million. This 2010 outlook range is slightly less than the full year 2010 guidance range we provided last quarter, which primarily reflects the stronger U.S. dollar versus the euro. 
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the first quarter of 2010 were $256 million, up 7% over the first quarter of 2009, including $10 million of favorable foreign currency translations. On a constant-currency basis, first quarter cardiovascular product sales increased 3% versus last year. 
Within this category of products, sales of vascular closure products in the first quarter of 2010 were $98 million, consistent with the first quarter of 2009. Sales of heart valve products in the first quarter of 2010 were $86 million, a 6% increase over the first quarter of 2009. 
For the second quarter of 2010, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $245 million to $260 million. We expect full year 2010 cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $1,015,000,000 to $1,045,000,000. This 2010 outlook range is a slightly less than the full year 2010 guidance range we provided last quarter, which primarily reflects the stronger U.S. dollar versus the euro. 
Total sales of Neuromodulation products in the first quarter of 2010 were $84 million, up 15% from the first quarter of 2009, including $2 million of favorable foreign currency translations. 
For the second quarter of 2010, we expect sales of Neuromodulation products to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million, and we continue to expect full year 2010 Neuromodulation sales in the range of $375 million to $395 million.
Looking to revenue by geography, in total, 51% of St. Jude Medical sales in the first quarter of 2010 came from the United States, while 49% came from international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales for the first quarter of 2010 is available in our press release. The gross profit margin this quarter was 74.5%, representing a 50 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2009. 
For the full year 2010, we expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.2% to 73.8%. Our full year 2010 gross profit margin guidance continues to incorporate the impact of absorbing the costs associated with the remote monitoring and wireless telemetry capabilities in our pacemaker product line. We are providing for this impact to be slightly higher in the second half of this year. In addition, our gross profit margin guidance also reflects the revised currency assumptions for the remainder of 2010.
Our first quarter SG&A expenses were 35.1% of net sales, a 170 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, we continue to forecast SG&A as a percentage of net sales in the range of 35.2% to 35.8%. Research and development expenses in the first quarter of 2010 was 12% of net sales. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect R&D expense to stay in the range of 12.0% to 12.6% of net sales as we continue to balance delivering short-term results with the right investments in long-term growth drivers. 
Net other expense was $20 million in the first quarter. And for the second quarter of 2010, we expect the other income and expense line item will be a net expense of approximately $16 million. For the full year 2010, we expect other expense of approximately $65 million to $70 million. 
For the first quarter, the company's effective income tax rate was 24.8%. And for 2010, we continue to expect tax rate to be in the range of 24.5% to 25.0%. As a reminder, these effective income tax rates contemplate the extension of the R&D credit in 2010 retroactive to the beginning of the year. To the extent it is not extended, our overall effective income tax rate would increase. We have also assumed the extension of the federal research and development credit in the EPS guidance for 2010.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter 2010, we had $530 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,936,000,000 in total debt, along with $1 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The debt on our balance sheet includes $1,641,000,000 of senior notes with maturities in 2013, 2014 and 2019. In addition to the senior notes, the outstanding debt on our balance sheet includes $295 million of notes issued in Japan, which mature in May 2010 and December 2011. We are currently in the final stages of refinancing the $225 million portion of the Japan notes that mature in May 2010 with a new fixed rate yen-based debt having maturities ranging from seven to 10 years.
Next, I want to offer comments regarding our EPS outlook for the second quarter and the full year 2010. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the second quarter of 2010, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 330 million to 332 million shares, with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2010 at 331 million to 333 million. The company expects consolidated earnings per share for the second quarter to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.75. And for the full year 2010, we now expect consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $2.80 to $2.85, a $0.09 increase from the full year 2010 guidance we gave during our fourth quarter 2009 earnings conference call. This updated expectation represents EPS growth of approximately 15% to 17% over the 2009 adjusted EPS of $2.43. 
To provide some insight into the basis for the increase in our annual EPS guidance, we start out with the results for the first quarter and note that we exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance for the first quarter by approximately $0.08. As previously discussed, we estimate that the change in our assumptions regarding currency exchange rates will reduce our EPS for the remainder of the year by approximately $0.04 to $0.05, and we are factoring this negative change into our updated full year guidance. However, we expect the strength of our business to continue, and we believe that we will more than offset this negative currency impact during the remainder of the year. 
I would now like to turn it back to Dan."

I realize many of you have questions about events involving one of our competitors. But our focus in this call is to make sure everyone has good insight into the success and momentum of St. Jude Medical's own growth program on an independ",1176,"Thank you, John. I realize many of you have questions about events involving one of our competitors. But our focus in this call is to make sure everyone has good insight into the success and momentum of St. Jude Medical's own growth program on an independent basis. Yes, we did benefit during the last three months of our first quarter from problems another company was having. But we just delivered a 29% increase in earnings per share and beat the high end of our guidance by $0.07 per share. These results were driven primarily by the strength and success of our own growth program. The problems one of our competitors had the last three weeks of our quarter had only a small impact. With this in mind, the first topic I want to emphasize is the benefit our restructuring had on our first quarter results. 
Our operating profit margin improved to 27.4% for this quarter. This is a full 250 basis point improvement over Q1 2009 and a 160 basis point improvement over the fourth quarter of 2009. Our operating profit margin during the first quarter of 2010 did benefit from ICD sales that were higher than expected the last three weeks of our quarter. But even without this benefit, St. Jude Medical would have delivered on operating profit margin gain for the quarter that exceeded the expectations that were incorporated into our prior guidance for earnings per share. 
The second topic I want to emphasize is the strength of our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM sales results during the first quarter. Prior to the announcement on March 15 that one competitor was suspending sales of its ICD's in the United States, we already were on track to deliver global CRM sales that were at the upper end of our guidance. This confirmed to us that we made the right changes in our U.S. sales organization during the second half of 2009. This also put us in good shape to provide seamless and timely ICD coverage to customers who turn to St. Jude Medical as a result of competitor issues.
We now expect to gain CRM market share for full year 2010, both in the United States and on a total global basis. We expect to launch over 10 new CRM products during the second quarter alone. I will refer you to the information we presented last quarter at our Annual Investor Conference for the features and benefits of these new products. But on this morning's call, I at least want to remind you how strong our pipeline of new products is.
In the United States during the second quarter, we expect to launch our new Fortify and Unify lines of high-voltage devices. We also are launching our new 4 French Quickflex Left-Heart Lead, a new Left-Heart Lead delivery system and a cell phone-enabled option for our Merlin@home remote monitoring system. Keep in mind that this is in addition to our 7 French high voltage leads, our SJ4 connector system and our Accent and Anthem lines of low voltage devices with RF telemetry and remote monitoring capability. 
In Europe during the second quarter, we are offering all of the same technologies I just listed for the United States. But in addition, we also are launching our Fortify ST line of high-voltage devices, our CorVue pulmonary edema monitoring technology and our Promote Quadra ICD systems with the Quartet quadripolar left ventricular pacing lead to facilitate both electronic repositioning and Multi-Site Left Ventricular Pacing.
In Japan, we already have received regulatory approval for our AnalyST line of ICDs. We are in the process of obtaining reimbursement and expect to launch this product line before the end of the second quarter. Our AnalyST line of ICDs will introduce ST segment monitoring technology into the Japanese market for the first time. In addition, we have received regulatory approval in Japan for our Current Plus ICDs and Promote Plus CRTD devices, along with our Durata 7 French high voltage lead, all with DF-4 connectors, the first devices in the world labeled as complying with the newly published ISO connector standard. 
If I were asked to summarize the competitive advantage of St. Jude Medical's CRM program for the remainder of 2010, I would say this, we have a clear competitive advantage in our product line. We have a strong inventory position and significant additional manufacturing capacity. We have a stable, trained and experienced field organization in place to provide complete coverage to customers in all major global markets. The dynamics of the replacement market are changing from a headwind that has slowed our growth to a tailwind that we expect to accelerate our growth. We believe we are ahead of all of our competitors in establishing a strong Atrial Fibrillation program. And as a result, we have also strengthened our ability to gain share in pacemakers and ICDs. Last but not least, we have good continuity of leadership and program strategy. Especially in these times, the value of this continuity, the impact it has on product and program quality and the overall competitive advantage of this continuity should not be underestimated. We fully expect to gain additional CRM market share in 2010.
Before I open it up for questions, I would like to touch briefly on each of our other major growth platforms. Within our Cardiovascular business, I am pleased to confirm that a limited launch of our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve already is underway in Europe. As a reminder, the pericardial segment of the tissue valve market is approximately $500 million on a global basis. Our entry into this market in Europe is a significant milestone in our program to continue to reinvigorate the long-term growth of our cardiovascular business. 
With respect to the business of our Atrial Fibrillation or AF division, we now have CE Mark for four new families of ablation catheters, including catheters with our Contact technology and catheters with our Cool Flex technology. We recently received approval in Japan for our NavX technology on our EnSite advanced mapping systems platform. We continue to make good progress, integrating our EP-Workmate and our MediGuide technology with our EnSite Velocity platform. All of this reinforces our optimism that we are on track to sustain the long term growth of our AF business. 
With respect to our in Neuromodulation business, although first quarter sales came in at $84 million versus our guidance range of $85 million to $90 million, we attribute this minor variance to timing. We expect a rebound of Neuromodulation sales during the second quarter. 
In conclusion, our first quarter was highly successful by every major measure. We exceeded the high end of our sales guidance. We improved our operating margin on a year-over-year basis by 250 basis points. We delivered a 29% increase in earnings per share. We entered the second quarter with good momentum and with major new product launches scheduled for the remainder of the year. 
With that, I'd like to open it up for questions and turn it back to you to moderate, Regina."

That's the first major component. So that was the market growth assumption that we had at the beginning of the year, and nothing that happened during the first quarter changed our assessment of total global market growth, point one.  Point two, if you look at the range of our full year CRM sales guidance, you can see that although there's some range in there, we're estimating approximately one full point of global CRM share gain for full year 2010. So that would be the best way for me to answer your question rather than offer more specificity quarter-by-quarter. Generally, as you ask about the impact of the circumstances at Boston Scientific, it's really too soon for us to know what that impact is going to be. We think about it in several buckets. We think about it first, in terms of what's the impact on the CRM market in its entirety. And our assessment is that the problems at Boston Scientific long term are not going to have any material impact on the health and growth of the global CRM market. That's the first point.  On the topic of impact on market share shifts, it really is too soon for us to assess that. We'll have a better idea after we've finished the second quarter. But for now, we're kind of holding back. We're going to wait and see. We don't really know how to model that. We haven't been through exactly these circumstances before. So if we're going to err, we're going to err on the side of being conservative for the purpose of our guidance this morning."

And so we do worry about that for the rest of the year. But ultimately, our experience has been that when a competitor engages on a low-price strategy that's generally an admission of competitive weakness. I think that customers generally see it the same way. And if you kind of imagine a company that has a product line with very little that’s new in it, you imagine that same company having a product line that has had numerous advisories here in the recent past, as well as in the multi-year past, but even in recent past, multiple advisories. We kind of refer to the whole set of circumstances -- internally here, we refer to the circumstances at the competitive company as the “Boston Debacle”. And so if you think about a company going through all the circumstances of “Boston Debacle” coming out of that, they've indicated that they're going to change their traditional level of investment to develop the market.  So you've got an increasingly uncompetitive product line, one that already has been the target of multiple advisories from a company that has announced that as a growth strategy, they're going to lower the traditional amount of investment they've made in developing the CRM market. They've got quite a bit of instability in their field organization, and we can only imagine all of the circumstances of that and all of the impact that has on the ability to service customer requirements in a high-quality way. And if on top of all of that, the company says, yes, but we’ll lower our price, I think the perception customers will get on average is you get what you pay for. And we would see that as a strategy that is a concern, but not a strategy that would have a long-term success for that competitive program."

On the migraine side, the results really I’d say we are still -- I'm blinded to the data. I don't know if we're still entirely blinded to the data. But that's speculative. The outcome, I'd say, is speculative. In our own modeling, we do model that we will continue to get benefit from the Parkinson's indication in our Neuromodulation program. As everyone in the call knows, we are still in the early phases of launching that technology for that indication in Europe. In future years, we remain confident and optimistic that we'll launch our Deep Brain Stimulation technology for our Parkinson's indication in the United States as well.  On the migraine side, we model absolutely nothing for the possibility of upside on migraine. And we think it's prudent for everyone to have very low expectations and not model any contribution from migraine. If we have a positive outcome to the clinical data, that will only mark another milestone in what will still be a very lengthy multi-year process of adding to the clinical data, working to get reimbursement, working to establish credibility in the referral stream. And so a person ought to think about that as a very long-term growth opportunity and model nothing in the next few years."

Our sales results of 17% growth in a market growing in the range of 10% to 15% indicates that we're at least holding share and we may be gaining share. Other companies don’t report their numbers with enough granularity for us to know for sure. Everything is on track.

But also, we had our limited launch of our new Unify, Fortify, and Fortify ST products that really have been met with very, very high degree of enthusiasm. That's allowed us to really get focus on the organization and our customers thinking about us as being truly innovators in this space. It’s also allowed us to get into competitive accounts where we haven't been before.  We’re just starting off now in the beginning of this month with our full launch for Unify and Fortify. And people are really appreciating the full package of those devices with not only the small size but the 40 joules output, the fast charge times, the no compromise in longevity and all the additional features like CorVue, like the ST and the Fortify ST line. On a CRT side, we really think about ourselves as really getting to the next level with the quadripolar system with Promote Quadra and the Quartet lead that we think that's going to become the next real standard, standard of care for CRT. And the customer response for that has been that they agree with us. That they really think that, that is the next true evolution in CRT therapy, and really addresses a number of important clinical concerns that they have and allows them to have much more efficient, not only implants, but also on the follow-up site.  And in Japan, we're also seeing the results of the strength of our new products. And I think that lays us up well for Q2 start as we're going to be launching, as Dan mentioned, our AnalyST device there. We have a symposium on ST segment monitoring in Japan that's taking place this weekend. The initial response to the concept has been very strong. And then also the DF-4 connector provides for the Japanese market not only for the benefits of that but it also provides a way for downsizing the device. And that's obviously important in that market."

Not a question of is business being transacted at the lower price. Business in the first quarter was transacted within normal average selling price ranges. And so we saw very stable average selling prices on a total global basis in our ICD business and in our Pacing business. We did see one competitor offer low prices, and it was particularly striking that low prices were offered at a point where they didn't have an approved product offer. But I know I digress. But the actual success of the business was at within normal prices. We don't expect to see a change in the average selling prices in a way that would change our estimate that the global CRM market will continue to grow at the range of 4% to 6%. Everything that we expect with respect to competitive price tactics, number one.

The Fortify and Unify product lines, really, we think, we expect a pretty quick shift because they are just such compelling products. I mean, it's a smaller package, it's got more output. More output means opportunity to have a higher degree of safety for patients. You’ve got additional opportunity to defibrillate them, if the patient's condition at the point of the event requires more output. There's just far more new technology there than I've just expressed.

So that means successful U.S. ICD sales. They were up towards the upper end of our guidance. And I think our guidance was probably ahead of where most people have found credible. But we were right on track to offer very strong results, independently, if all our competitors business stayed in a steady-state. So yes, it was as expected. It was actually on the strong side of what we expected.  And with respect to customer destocking of inventory, we didn’t see anything unusual or unexpected. In the third quarter of last year, we were surprised by changes in customer inventory and quarter-end purchases. But we've adjusted our expectations. And now, I'd say we're back to a steady-state.

So what is hard to know from outside the business, it's hard to know how hard our global organization worked during the third and fourth quarters of 2009 to restructure and how profound the restructuring was and how spot on it turned out to be.  So to remind people, we eliminated approximately 700 positions. That was approximately 5% of our global workforce. That was the result of a total global review. The job reductions were throughout the global organization. It involved all of our divisions and our corporate group. The restructuring included revisiting our global structure. We flattened the organization. We realigned the organization where it made sense. We reviewed product lines. We made changes to rationalize the product lines where it made sense. That resulted in some of the inventory write-offs related to product line reviews.  We revisited some of our business processes here inside the business on a very intensive basis to challenge ourselves. What have we gotten used to doing that isn’t as good as we want it to be and where should we make changes in our business processes. We had a special focus on some of the processes surrounding our sales and marketing effectiveness. And so there was a lot of work done that was really off the radar screen. You saw some special charge from it. But no one could really appreciate the level of work and the level of judgment and the level of change. So what you see now in our first quarter results is the benefit of six months of work that was largely off the radar screen. And as far as investment goes, the level of investment has been uncompromised. So you saw our R&D spending continue to increase on a dollar basis, sequential quarter and year-over-year. Our restructuring was not sacrifice of future growth at all. Our restructuring was a growth-oriented restructuring.  And the sales success, as well as the productivity gains, all just position us to increase. We increased our sales guidance for the full year. We absorbed $40 million or $50 million reduction in sales due to foreign currency translation changes. We overcame that and increased our guidance of -- originally, we had guidance of 7% to 11% of sales growth for the year a quarter ago and now we've increased the top end slightly. The range is 8% to 11%, after absorbing a $40 million to $50 million reduction due to foreign currency changes. So all of that would really confirm to anyone that our restructuring was a growth-oriented restructuring, not a sacrifice of future growth or sacrifice of appropriate investment."

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,313,000,000, up approximately 11% over the $1,184,000,000 million reported in the second quarter of last year.

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,313,000,000, up approximately 11% over the $1,184,000,000 million reported in the second quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year's second quarter increased this quarter's sales by about $5 million. The impact of these foreign currency translations on any one product category is negligible. As a result, we will not call out our constant currency sales growth as it is approximately the same as the reported sales growth.
At the end of 2009, the federal research and development tax credit expired, and Congress has not yet extended the credit for 2010. In this circumstance, GAAP requires us to estimate and record our effective income tax rate assuming that the R&D credit is not extended. For purposes of this conference call and our calculation of adjusted net earnings, however, we are assuming that the tax credit will be extended retroactively for 2010 as in past years. As a result, comments referencing second quarter results and our guidance for 2010, including earnings per share amounts, are presented based on an effective income tax rate that contemplates the extension of the tax credit retroactive to January 1, 2010. To the extent that the federal R&D tax credit is not enacted, our effective income tax rate for 2010 would be higher than what is being presented during this call.
Earnings per share were $0.79 for the second quarter of 2010, a 25% increase over EPS of $0.63 in the second quarter of 2009 and above our guidance range of $0.73 to $0.75. Before we discuss our second quarter 2010 sales results by product category, with guidance for the third quarter and the remainder of 2010, let me comment on foreign currency. 
As discussed on prior calls, the two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance in April 2010 covering the second quarter and the remainder of the year, we used exchange rates, which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.33 to $1.38, and for the yen, each 90 to 95 yen would translate into USD $1. The actual average exchange rates used to translate our sales into U.S. dollars versus the midpoint of the exchange rate assumptions we provided in our April guidance reduced second quarter reported sales by approximately $12 million.
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the third quarter and the second half of 2010, we are now assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.23 to $1.28, and for the yen, each 86 to 91 yen will translate into USD $1. This change in assumption regarding currency exchange rates decreases total forecasted sales for the remainder of 2010 by about $25 million to $35 million, which we estimate will reduce EPS by approximately $0.03 to $0.04 over the remainder of the year.
Now for the sales by product category discussion. Total Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM sales, which includes revenues from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines, were $788 million, up 12% from last year's second quarter. For the second quarter, ICD sales were $471 million, up 18% from last year's second quarter. U.S. ICD sales were $300 million, up 18% from last year's second quarter, and international ICD sales were $171 million, also representing an 18% increase over the second quarter of 2009. 
As you know, for the first two selling weeks of the second quarter of 2010, a competitor had suspended all sales of their ICD products in the United States. As we mentioned during our April conference call, we took this situation into account when we provided our guidance for the second quarter's CRM product sales. We estimate that this dynamic provided a onetime benefit of approximately $15 million to our second quarter U.S. ICD sales.
For low-voltage devices, sales for the second quarter totaled $317 million, up 4% from last year's second quarter. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $140 million, up slightly over 6% from last year's second quarter. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $177 million, up 3% from the second quarter of 2009. 
For the third quarter of 2010, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $715 million to $745 million. The guidance range for the third quarter reflects the normal seasonal impact of the summer selling period, updated currency assumptions and a return to normal competitor dynamics.
For the full year 2010, we now expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $2,975,000,000 to $3,050,000,000. Given the strength of our CRM business, we have raised the guidance range slightly from our April outlook despite the fact that our updated currency assumptions for the remainder of the year are expected to result in lower reported sales versus the currency assumptions we were using in April.
Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the second quarter totaled $176 million, up 13% over the second quarter of last year. For the third quarter of 2010, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $155 million to $170 million. We expect our full year 2010 AF product sales to be in the range of $680 million to $710 million. This 2010 outlook range is slightly less than the full year 2010 guidance range we provided last quarter, which primarily reflects the stronger U.S. dollar versus other euro.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the second quarter of 2010 were $254 million, up 5% over the second quarter of 2009. Within this category of products, sales of vascular closure products in the second quarter of 2010 were $98 million, approximately the same as in the second quarter of 2009. Sales of heart valve products in the second quarter of 2010 were $87 million, a 4% increase over the second quarter of 2009. 
For the third quarter of 2010, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $235 million to $250 million. We expect full year 2010 cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $1,005,000,000 to $1,030,000,000. This 2010 outlook range includes of the expected contributions of LightLab revenue in the second half of this year and also reflects our updated currency assumptions.
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the second quarter of 2010 were $95 million, up 17% from the second quarter of 2009. For the third quarter of 2010, we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million, and we expect full year 2010 neuromodulation sales in the range of $375 million to $390 million. Let me pause at this point and recap our 2010 sales guidance. 
For Cardiac Rhythm Management devices, we expect sales for 2010 in the range of $2,975,000,000 to $3,050,000,000, and sales of our AF product for 2010 are expected to be $680 million to $710 million. For cardiovascular products, we expect 2010 sales in the range of $1,005,000,000 to $1,030,000,000 and we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be $375 million to $390 million. If you add up the sales across all growth platforms, total sales in 2010 are expected to be $5,035,000,000, to $5,180,000,000. This guidance range provides for consolidated sales growth in the range of 8% to 11% on an as-reported basis and constant currency growth of 9% to 12% over 2009. 
Looking to revenue by geography. In total, 53% of St. Jude Medical sales in the second quarter of 2010 came from the United States, while 47% came from our international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales for the second quarter of 2010 is available in our press release.
The gross profit margin this quarter was 73.7%, representing a 50 basis point decline compared with the second quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.2% to 73.8%. Our full year 2010 gross profit margin guidance continues to incorporate the impact of absorbing the costs associated with the remote monitoring and wireless telemetry capabilities in our pacemaker product line. We are providing for this impact to be slightly higher in the second half of this year. In addition, our gross profit margin guidance also reflects the revised currency assumptions for the remainder of 2010.
Our second quarter SG&A expenses were 34.1% of net sales, a 230 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, we now forecast SG&A as a percentage of net sales in the range of 34.7% to 35.2%. R&D expenses in the second quarter of 2010 were 11.8% of net sales.  For the full year 2010, we continue to expect R&D expense to be in the range of 12.0% to 12.6% of net sales, as we continue to balance delivering short-term results with the right investments in long-term growth drivers.  
Net other expense was $20 million in the second quarter. And we note for the first half of 2010, the other expense category totaled $40 million and included the write-off of certain debt issuance costs, which were incurred in connection with our refinancing activities. Going into the second half of 2010, we now have the new debt structure in place and anticipate the other expense category to be in the range of $12 million to $16 million per quarter in Q3 and Q4.
For the second quarter, the company's effective income tax rate was 12.2%. For 2010, we now expect the tax rate to be in the range of 24.2% for the second quarter. And then now for 2010, we expect the tax rate to be in the range of 24.3% to 24.8%. As a reminder, these effective income tax rates contemplate the extension of the federal research and development tax credit in 2010 retroactive to the beginning of the year. As previously noted, to the extent the credit is not extended, our overall effective income tax rate would increase. We have also assumed the extension of the federal R&D tax credit in our EPS guidance for 2010.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter of 2010, we had $667 million in cash and cash equivalents, $1,962,000,000 in total debt and $1 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The debt on our balance sheet includes $1,653,000,000 of senior notes with maturities in 2013, 2014 and 2019. In addition, during the second quarter, we successfully refinanced the portion of our Japanese notes that were set to mature in May 2010, with 309 million of new fixed rate yen-based notes with maturities in 2017 and 2020. 
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our earnings per share outlook for the third quarter and the full year 2010. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the third quarter of 2010, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 330 million to 332 million shares, with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2010 at 329 million to 331 million. In addition, we have incorporated the dilution from the LightLab acquisition, which closed on July 6. However, we have not taken into account any non-recurring charges related to the LightLab acquisition, which we anticipate will be recorded in the third quarter. 
The company expects consolidated earnings per share for the third quarter to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.69. And for the full year 2010, we now expect consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $2.86 to $2.91, a $0.06 increase from the full year 2010 guidance we gave during our April 2010 conference call. This updated expectation represents EPS growth of approximately 18% to 20% over the 2009 adjusted EPS of $2.43.
To provide some insight into the basis for the increase in our annual EPS guidance, we start out with the results for the second quarter and note that we exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance for this quarter by $0.05. As previously discussed, we estimate that the change in our assumptions regarding currency exchange rates will reduce our EPS for the remainder of the year by approximately $0.03 to $0.04, and we are factoring this negative change into our updated full year guidance. In addition, we have factored in the dilutive impact of incorporating the LightLab operations beginning July 6, 2010. However, we expect the strength of our business to continue, and we believe that we will more than offset the negative currency impact, as well as the LightLab dilution during the remainder of the year. And I would now like to turn it back to Dan Starks."

The first question answered was how long it wo",2248,"Thank you, John. Our solid performance in the second quarter answered a lot questions about the strength and sustainability of St. Jude Medical's growth program in current economic and competitive conditions. The first question answered was how long it would take for us to turn around our U.S. sales organization and restore a normal level of effectiveness and operating discipline. It now is clear that under the leadership of Michael Rousseau and his restructured organization, it took us approximately two quarters to convert from losing share with the strong product line in the United States in our CRM business to return to gaining share in the United States in the same way we continue to gain CRM share in international markets.
After adjusting for the estimated $15 million benefit we received during the second quarter from a competitor's temporary suspension of ICD sales in the United States, our U.S. CRM sales grew approximately 10% on a normalized basis during the second quarter, which was clearly faster than market growth. 
A second question we answered relates to our growth platforms, which have proven robust enough to support high-single-digit or low-double-digit sales growth on a constant-currency basis even in the current economic and competitive conditions. We exceeded the high end of our cumulative sales guidance during Q2 for the second quarter in a row. Global revenue increased approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis during the second quarter even after adjusting for the onetime $15 million benefit in U.S. ICDs.
All four of our growth platforms showed continued strength, with three of them, namely, CRM, AF and neuromodulation, independently growing at double-digit rates. As we have guided this year, we expect sales for our cardiovascular platform to be stronger during the second half of 2010, with full launch of our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve program in Europe, the continued strong growth of our Fractional Flow Reserve or FFR business, the value and synergy of our new Optical Coherence Tomography or OCT technology platform and other new product launches that should accelerate Cardiovascular division sales during the second half of the year.
A third question we answered relates to profitability and our ability to protect profit margins in the face of increased pressure on average selling prices or ASPs due to macro economic factors such as volatility of the euro, healthcare reform and other challenging market dynamics. During the first half of 2010, St. Jude Medical's global ASPs for low-voltage and high-voltage systems were higher than our comparable ASPs during the first half of 2009. We attribute this primarily to the value of our technology, our flow of new products, improvements in operating discipline in the United States that I mentioned previously and the overall effectiveness of our global sales and marketing organizations. All of these attributes of St. Jude Medical's growth program are fundamental and sustainable and should continue to support our results in future period.
The challenge of protecting profit margins in the face of healthcare reform in today's economic and competitive market conditions goes well beyond a discussion of average selling prices and trends. Here again, second quarter results reflect how proactive, focused and effective St. Jude Medical is about optimizing its cost structure to support profit margins going forward. Our operating profit margin in the second quarter improved 210 basis points versus the second quarter one year ago. It may be an even greater achievement that we improved our operating profit margin 40 basis points on a sequential quarter basis during Q2, while we simultaneously reduced days inventory on hand by 13 days.
We expect our operating margin to come under pressure during the second half of this year due to our acquisition of LightLab and other factors John Heinmiller has discussed previously, but we are on track to benefit from numerous new initiatives in 2011 and beyond. As a reminder, these initiatives include manufacturing expansion in cost-advantaged locations and other supply chain improvements, as well as leveraging our SAP implementation and other initiatives targeted at continuing to improve productivity and help optimize our cost structure. We expect market conditions to be challenging moving forward, but we believe that we have positioned ourselves well to meet these challenges.
I would next like to offer additional insights into our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM business, starting with market growth. We recently updated our analysis regarding our growth expectations for the global CRM market. Based on this analysis, we continue to expect the global CRM market to grow between 4% and 6% on a constant-currency basis. This analysis has been remarkably stable and predictive on a multi-year basis. This market model takes into account differences in global geographies, the impact of new technologies, changes in model mix, pressure on ASPs, the impact of device replacement cycles and all other appropriate factors.
Next, I would like to talk about CRM market share. We estimate that we exited Q2 holding approximately a 25% share of the global ICD market on a normalized basis. Our internal analysis indicates that in the United States, we hold approximately a 29% share of the ICD market for de novo implants and a 19% share of the ICD market for replacement devices. The implications of this analysis should be clear. First, given the propensity of physicians to replace ICDs with a product on the same manufacturer, we expect to benefit from a tailwind, where our share of the replacement market for ICDs eventually matches our current share of the de novo market for ICDs. This implies a likely four-point gain in market share.
Second, our 29% share of the market for de novo ICD implants reflects the value of our technology and the impact our advantages in technology have on payers, physicians and patients. New technology clearly still counts if it is both cost effective and clinically effective and is supported by an effective field organization. 
During the second quarter, we launched a number of new ICD products, including our Unify and Fortify lines of ICDs, which were launched in the United States at the HRS meeting in mid-May. These devices are smaller, deliver more energy and last longer. We do not usually break out product mix and will not do so in the future, but we will disclose that during June, the first full month of market release, our Unify and Fortify lines of ICDs comprised over 50% of our sales mix in the United States. This level of customer uptake is unprecedented and should be a good leading indicator for the continued success of our U.S. ICD sales through remainder of this year.
In Europe, during the second quarter, we launched our Unify and Fortify lines of ICDs, as well as our CorVue pulmonary edema monitoring technology, our Promote Quadra with Quartet quadripolar lead CRT-D system. These new product joined the existing product advantages we have with our SJ4 and DF4 simplified connector systems, our 7 French high-voltage lead line, our AnalyST line of ICDs with ST segment monitoring and our Quickflex micro 4 French bipolar left heart leads. A full discussion of the advantages these products provide to customers is beyond the scope of my comments this morning, but the impact of these technologies is reflected in our continued gain of international ICD market share during the second quarter. This gain in market share should be another leading indicator for the continued gain of ICD market share in the United States when all of these technologies are fully deployed in the United States market as well.
Next, I will touch briefly on highlights of our Cardiovascular, Atrial Fibrillation and Neuromodulation businesses. Our Cardiovascular or CVD business had a particularly productive quarter. The limited launch of our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve product line in Europe went well. We are now ramping up for a full launch of this product line in Europe before the end of this quarter, and we'll be ready to fully leverage the value of this technology during the fall tender season. We strengthened our leadership in the fast-growing Fractional Flow Reserve or FFR market by launching our next-generation PressureWire Aeris, a first of its kind wireless FFR measuring system that can be used with multiple recording systems to give physicians instant access to patient data.
We expanded our investment in FFR market development with our funding of FAME II trial and enrollment of first patients in that trial. FAME II will build on the results of the landmark FAME trial, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine at the beginning of last year. As a reminder, the FAME trial was a 1,005-patient study, which demonstrated convincingly that the cost of medical care is lower and patient outcomes are better if FFR measurement is used to guide stenting in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease.
Our conviction that the FFR market will become a major new growth driver led to our acquisition of LightLab. This acquisition both provides synergy to strengthen our FFR franchise and potentially is itself another new growth driver. As a result of this acquisition, St. Jude Medical now is the global leader in Optical Coherence Tomography or OCT technology and products for cardiovascular applications. OCT technology competes with intravascular ultrasound technology to provide intravascular imaging to aid coronary stenting and other cath lab procedures. The difference in quality and detail between an OCT image and an IVUS image has been described as analogous to the difference between an analog black-and-white television with a rabbit-ear antenna and a digital colored television with a high-definition image.
We think OCT has the potential to obsolete IVUS imaging in the practices of many physicians. We are in the process of combining our OCT technology with our FFR technology into a single integrated system so that physicians can use the FFR feature to determine which lesions to stent and then use our OCT feature to help guide stent placement. 
As a result of our acquisition of LightLab, St. Jude Medical not only has strengthened its FFR growth driver, but we also now have a credible opportunity to become the leader in the $500 million intravascular imaging market currently dominated by IVUS products.
Turning to the franchise of our Atrial Fibrillation or AF division, our AF growth program continue to make good progress during the second quarter. We are on track to have our first MediGuide-enabled cath labs online in Europe by the end of this year. During the second quarter, we also conducted a limited market release in Europe for four new families of ablation catheters. This limited market release was especially interesting in that it validated the value of our new Contact ablation technology and our new Cool Flex ablation technology. We now look forward to generating additional clinical evidence about these new technologies and then initiating full market launches.
Moving on to our Neuromodulation business. It is noteworthy that Neuromodulation revenue growth strengthened as expected after Q1 and confirms that our neuromodulation growth platform remains robust. The next major development in our Neuromodulation business will be full launch of our deep brain stimulation or DBS system in Europe during the second half of this year. This system will consist of our Brio rechargeable deep brain stimulator, our Athena DBS clinician programmer and a complete line of proprietary leads and accessories. 
With respect to neuromodulation clinical trials, we are on track to complete follow-up this quarter of patients in our U.S. pivotal trial for Parkinson's disease indication. We expect the clinical data to be positive and anticipate submitting our PMA during the first half of 2011.
With respect to our U.S. pivotal trial for patients suffering from certain forms of migraine, we expect to complete follow-up by the end of next quarter and tentatively expect to announce the results of this clinical trail during the first half of 2011. 
Finally, with respect to our broadened U.S. pivotal trial studying the benefits of DBS and a targeted area of the brain for patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression, we have received approval from FDA to expand enrollment from 30 to 50 patients. It is too soon to know whether either the migraine trial or the depression trial will lead to new growth drivers for St. Jude Medical, but we are committed to continue pursuing potential new indications in the field of neuromodulation and are optimistic that neuromodulation will develop into a multi-indication multi-billion dollar growth platform for St. Jude Medical over time.
In conclusion, our second quarter was another highly successful quarter by every major measure. For the second quarter in a row, we exceeded the high end of our sales guidance. We improved our operating margin on a year-over-year basis by 210 basis points. We delivered a 25% increase in earnings per share. We became the leaders in next-generation technology for intravascular imaging and are now prepared to attack a new $500 million market. We competed over 10 new product launches, the impact of which will not fully influence our results until the second half of this year. We entered the third quarter with good momentum and with multiple additional new product launches scheduled for the remainder of the year. Last but not least, St. Jude Medical was named to the Fortune 500 list of companies for the first time, entering the list at number 445. 
At this point, we have concluded our prepared remarks. John Heinmiller, Mark Rousseau, Eric Fain and I now all are ready to take you questions. Operator, would you please moderate the questions?"

We look at the competitive ship hold as being an event that now is quickly fading into the past. I think the better way to think about our ICD strength and our ICD share gain would be to look at what happened in Europe, where there was no ship hold and it really was a cleaner quarter. You saw 18% growth in our international ICD sales, and it's really driven by our new technology and the significant advantages with all of the technologies. I mean, I don't think we've ever had such an era of rich new technology and technology advantage at St. Jude Medical as we now have beginning with the second quarter and with everything that we begun to put into the United States market and with even more technology that we already have put into the European market. So I think that's really a focus. I think the competitors' ship hold just really ends up being a distraction and a little bit of a red herring. To us, our growth is about our core growth program. It's about our technology advantage. It's about the value of the technology that our technology advantages clearly have for customers. You'll see that with the data that we offered that our global ASPs, average selling prices in our CRM business were actually higher in the first half of 2010 than they were in the first half of 2008. So all of that is very much about St. Jude Medical's independent growth program and the value of that program and the impact it's having on customers."

Our view is that anytime there is a crisis, there are going to be winners and losers. The key to us is to be realistic about what the crisis is or what are the macroeconomic conditions and to assess whether we've done a good job being proactive enough to position ourselves to be a winner in the face of those economic and competitive conditions. I think you see from our second quarter a lot of positive indicators to say that we have been proactive. We have positioned ourselves to be a winner in this current economic environment. Then, what I look at -- what I think about more along that line is, first, every company's positioned differently, so I think it would really be a mistake for investors to do a one-size-fits-all view of the sector. Inside the sector, what distinguishes St. Jude Medical, first, is we focus primarily on the life-saving devices. So life-saving devices versus elective procedures is one significant differentiator, which is a favorable to our outlook. Second, where we have devices that are not life saving, they are cost saving. And again, that's not the case with every competitors' portfolio. So we think about our FFR technology, we think about our vascular closure technology, we think about the value of our patient-managed left atrial pressure technology that we're beginning to work with in Europe and more. On the pain side, the cost effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation versus alternative therapies. So either we are focused on life saving or we're focused on money saving or we're focused both on life saving and higher quality in a cost effective way. So all of that advantages us to be a winner in distressed macroeconomic conditions. There's more than. I would move after life saving and money saving. It would be a company whose devices are becoming commoditized, is going to be a loser in this kind of a crisis. A company whose technology is differentiated and differentiated in a way that is valuable to customers and the customers are willing to pay more for, obviously, is going to have a competitive advantage. And you saw it from the data that we provided here in our prepared remarks that we clearly have differentiated technologies that customers are willing to pay a premium for that is an advantage to us versus companies who have been less successful in offering innovative technology and whose portfolio is becoming more commoditized. The next point I would move on to, the advantage of St. Jude Medical to be a winner in this kind of a crisis is the efforts that we've made over the last five years and coming to be six years to optimize our cost structure. So companies that don't have a way to gain an advantage in the state of their costs to address the level of pressure that people expect on budgets and average selling prices are again going to be in a very different reactive mode than a company like St. Jude Medical, where five years ago, we began the investments to really improve our gross margin with manufacturing and cost-advantage locations, which had just becoming online now in 2011. And more on the topic of optimizing our cost structure. So that's an advantage and differentiates us from others in the space. Another advantage we have is as you think about budget pressures, the pressure generally tends to come sooner and stronger to capital budgets than to non-capital budgets. We do have a small component of our portfolio that's a capital budget item, but most of it is not capital budget items. And so that again, there's another advantage to us. And so the market's not monolithic at all, either on the MedTech side or on the customer side. There's the private pay, public pay on the customer side. Our global reach, the extent of our presence in global markets, gives us a lot more diversification than some, which is an advantage to us. So I think you put it all down, there are a lot of things that we worry about and are in everybody else's minds. But in that environment, there will be winners and losers, and we've offered some good evidence among the list of winners and losers at St. Jude Medical, and the second quarter clearly has been an outstanding winner. And going forward, we expect that we're going to continue to focus on doing everything we can to stay in that winner column."

And our system ASPs for low-voltage devices were up this year versus last. So a fairly stunning versus what one might think from a distance. And as you were suggesting, Mike, there a lot of factors that bear on that. It does include, it all includes changes in geographic mix, changes in product mix. It includes ASP premiums on new product launches. It includes operating discipline and leadership changes, restructured leadership, organizations that we put into place in the United States in the second half of 2009 that's now benefiting us in the first half of 2010. And so there really are a lot of factors. There is an increasing trend toward more CRT-D, generally speaking, on the high-voltage side, and so there are a lot of factors. But when you net it all out, those are the results that we have. Having said all of that, we expect continued pressure on average selling prices. And in the past, we've said regularly that our experiences that generally speaking on a kind of an apples-to-apples basis, there is a low-single-digit decreases in ASPs. But we've already said that, that's really not the story, that the story is the big picture in all of these other dynamics and the impact of all of these dynamics together and how they net out to bear on ASPs.

So when we think of a cost advantage manufacturing location, we define that as global costs including tax costs. But clearly, not only tax costs. We look at the -- really the first and we look at is which alternative location have the quality of workforce that would meet our standards and expectations. So that's the first thing. And so we're looking for a level of education, level of experience of the workforce, the history that, that workforce has working with our kind of technology, generally and even then specifically, in our type of regulated industry and with the medical devices in particular. So that's the very first thing, and I appreciate that doesn't address your question exactly, but that's the first thing we look at. Then we look at now where can we access that quality of workforce in a way that is cost advantage, both with respect to overhead rates, with respect to labor rates and with respect to tax rates. And so all of that and to the extent that they're obviously a lot of places at different companies manufacture, there's a lot of places that we do manufacturing, we'll continue to manufacture, but we take all those factors into account. We took all those factors into account in 2005 and making our site selections and then beginning a level of investments that are really just going to start to impact our gross margin here in 2011. So I'm not going to offer -- we haven't given guidance for 2011 yet, and we aren't going to give guidance for kind of years beyond. So I don't want to be exact about kind of degree of impact on gross margin. But clearly, what you will see is you'll start to see first shipments. We're going to open both our new facility in Malaysia and our new facility in Costa Rica by the end of this year. And so everything is on track that way. We will begin first shipment by the end of this year, on or about by the end of this year, don't hold me too exactly. But then you'll see the manufacturing volumes. Our goal is not to manufacture as much as we can, as quick as we can. Our goal is first, to make sure that we keep control in the quality sense. And that means start small, expand our experience on a pilot basis, make sure that we already have the workforce working side-by-side with our California group, for example and with other groups, so that we have very experienced, and very experienced St. Jude Medical people in our initial production in these new locations. And so you will see us gradually increase our volumes with highest attention to quality and secondary attention to leveraging the cost advantages of the site. And then beyond that, all I can say is that with gross margin and with cost structure as with average selling prices, there's so many factors that bear on it that really you're going to have to wait for our 2011 guidance to make more sense of my comments."

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,313,000,000, up approximately 11% over the $1,184,000,000 million reported in the second quarter of last year.

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,313,000,000, up approximately 11% over the $1,184,000,000 million reported in the second quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year's second quarter increased this quarter's sales by about $5 million. The impact of these foreign currency translations on any one product category is negligible. As a result, we will not call out our constant currency sales growth as it is approximately the same as the reported sales growth.
At the end of 2009, the federal research and development tax credit expired, and Congress has not yet extended the credit for 2010. In this circumstance, GAAP requires us to estimate and record our effective income tax rate assuming that the R&D credit is not extended. For purposes of this conference call and our calculation of adjusted net earnings, however, we are assuming that the tax credit will be extended retroactively for 2010 as in past years. As a result, comments referencing second quarter results and our guidance for 2010, including earnings per share amounts, are presented based on an effective income tax rate that contemplates the extension of the tax credit retroactive to January 1, 2010. To the extent that the federal R&D tax credit is not enacted, our effective income tax rate for 2010 would be higher than what is being presented during this call.
Earnings per share were $0.79 for the second quarter of 2010, a 25% increase over EPS of $0.63 in the second quarter of 2009 and above our guidance range of $0.73 to $0.75. Before we discuss our second quarter 2010 sales results by product category, with guidance for the third quarter and the remainder of 2010, let me comment on foreign currency. 
As discussed on prior calls, the two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance in April 2010 covering the second quarter and the remainder of the year, we used exchange rates, which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.33 to $1.38, and for the yen, each 90 to 95 yen would translate into USD $1. The actual average exchange rates used to translate our sales into U.S. dollars versus the midpoint of the exchange rate assumptions we provided in our April guidance reduced second quarter reported sales by approximately $12 million.
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the third quarter and the second half of 2010, we are now assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.23 to $1.28, and for the yen, each 86 to 91 yen will translate into USD $1. This change in assumption regarding currency exchange rates decreases total forecasted sales for the remainder of 2010 by about $25 million to $35 million, which we estimate will reduce EPS by approximately $0.03 to $0.04 over the remainder of the year.
Now for the sales by product category discussion. Total Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM sales, which includes revenues from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines, were $788 million, up 12% from last year's second quarter. For the second quarter, ICD sales were $471 million, up 18% from last year's second quarter. U.S. ICD sales were $300 million, up 18% from last year's second quarter, and international ICD sales were $171 million, also representing an 18% increase over the second quarter of 2009. 
As you know, for the first two selling weeks of the second quarter of 2010, a competitor had suspended all sales of their ICD products in the United States. As we mentioned during our April conference call, we took this situation into account when we provided our guidance for the second quarter's CRM product sales. We estimate that this dynamic provided a onetime benefit of approximately $15 million to our second quarter U.S. ICD sales.
For low-voltage devices, sales for the second quarter totaled $317 million, up 4% from last year's second quarter. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $140 million, up slightly over 6% from last year's second quarter. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $177 million, up 3% from the second quarter of 2009. 
For the third quarter of 2010, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $715 million to $745 million. The guidance range for the third quarter reflects the normal seasonal impact of the summer selling period, updated currency assumptions and a return to normal competitor dynamics.
For the full year 2010, we now expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $2,975,000,000 to $3,050,000,000. Given the strength of our CRM business, we have raised the guidance range slightly from our April outlook despite the fact that our updated currency assumptions for the remainder of the year are expected to result in lower reported sales versus the currency assumptions we were using in April.
Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the second quarter totaled $176 million, up 13% over the second quarter of last year. For the third quarter of 2010, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $155 million to $170 million. We expect our full year 2010 AF product sales to be in the range of $680 million to $710 million. This 2010 outlook range is slightly less than the full year 2010 guidance range we provided last quarter, which primarily reflects the stronger U.S. dollar versus other euro.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the second quarter of 2010 were $254 million, up 5% over the second quarter of 2009. Within this category of products, sales of vascular closure products in the second quarter of 2010 were $98 million, approximately the same as in the second quarter of 2009. Sales of heart valve products in the second quarter of 2010 were $87 million, a 4% increase over the second quarter of 2009. 
For the third quarter of 2010, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $235 million to $250 million. We expect full year 2010 cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $1,005,000,000 to $1,030,000,000. This 2010 outlook range includes of the expected contributions of LightLab revenue in the second half of this year and also reflects our updated currency assumptions.
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the second quarter of 2010 were $95 million, up 17% from the second quarter of 2009. For the third quarter of 2010, we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million, and we expect full year 2010 neuromodulation sales in the range of $375 million to $390 million. Let me pause at this point and recap our 2010 sales guidance. 
For Cardiac Rhythm Management devices, we expect sales for 2010 in the range of $2,975,000,000 to $3,050,000,000, and sales of our AF product for 2010 are expected to be $680 million to $710 million. For cardiovascular products, we expect 2010 sales in the range of $1,005,000,000 to $1,030,000,000 and we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be $375 million to $390 million. If you add up the sales across all growth platforms, total sales in 2010 are expected to be $5,035,000,000, to $5,180,000,000. This guidance range provides for consolidated sales growth in the range of 8% to 11% on an as-reported basis and constant currency growth of 9% to 12% over 2009. 
Looking to revenue by geography. In total, 53% of St. Jude Medical sales in the second quarter of 2010 came from the United States, while 47% came from our international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales for the second quarter of 2010 is available in our press release.
The gross profit margin this quarter was 73.7%, representing a 50 basis point decline compared with the second quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.2% to 73.8%. Our full year 2010 gross profit margin guidance continues to incorporate the impact of absorbing the costs associated with the remote monitoring and wireless telemetry capabilities in our pacemaker product line. We are providing for this impact to be slightly higher in the second half of this year. In addition, our gross profit margin guidance also reflects the revised currency assumptions for the remainder of 2010.
Our second quarter SG&A expenses were 34.1% of net sales, a 230 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, we now forecast SG&A as a percentage of net sales in the range of 34.7% to 35.2%. R&D expenses in the second quarter of 2010 were 11.8% of net sales.  For the full year 2010, we continue to expect R&D expense to be in the range of 12.0% to 12.6% of net sales, as we continue to balance delivering short-term results with the right investments in long-term growth drivers.  
Net other expense was $20 million in the second quarter. And we note for the first half of 2010, the other expense category totaled $40 million and included the write-off of certain debt issuance costs, which were incurred in connection with our refinancing activities. Going into the second half of 2010, we now have the new debt structure in place and anticipate the other expense category to be in the range of $12 million to $16 million per quarter in Q3 and Q4.
For the second quarter, the company's effective income tax rate was 12.2%. For 2010, we now expect the tax rate to be in the range of 24.2% for the second quarter. And then now for 2010, we expect the tax rate to be in the range of 24.3% to 24.8%. As a reminder, these effective income tax rates contemplate the extension of the federal research and development tax credit in 2010 retroactive to the beginning of the year. As previously noted, to the extent the credit is not extended, our overall effective income tax rate would increase. We have also assumed the extension of the federal R&D tax credit in our EPS guidance for 2010.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter of 2010, we had $667 million in cash and cash equivalents, $1,962,000,000 in total debt and $1 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The debt on our balance sheet includes $1,653,000,000 of senior notes with maturities in 2013, 2014 and 2019. In addition, during the second quarter, we successfully refinanced the portion of our Japanese notes that were set to mature in May 2010, with 309 million of new fixed rate yen-based notes with maturities in 2017 and 2020. 
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our earnings per share outlook for the third quarter and the full year 2010. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the third quarter of 2010, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 330 million to 332 million shares, with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2010 at 329 million to 331 million. In addition, we have incorporated the dilution from the LightLab acquisition, which closed on July 6. However, we have not taken into account any non-recurring charges related to the LightLab acquisition, which we anticipate will be recorded in the third quarter. 
The company expects consolidated earnings per share for the third quarter to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.69. And for the full year 2010, we now expect consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $2.86 to $2.91, a $0.06 increase from the full year 2010 guidance we gave during our April 2010 conference call. This updated expectation represents EPS growth of approximately 18% to 20% over the 2009 adjusted EPS of $2.43.
To provide some insight into the basis for the increase in our annual EPS guidance, we start out with the results for the second quarter and note that we exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance for this quarter by $0.05. As previously discussed, we estimate that the change in our assumptions regarding currency exchange rates will reduce our EPS for the remainder of the year by approximately $0.03 to $0.04, and we are factoring this negative change into our updated full year guidance. In addition, we have factored in the dilutive impact of incorporating the LightLab operations beginning July 6, 2010. However, we expect the strength of our business to continue, and we believe that we will more than offset the negative currency impact, as well as the LightLab dilution during the remainder of the year. And I would now like to turn it back to Dan Starks.

The first question answered was how long it would take for us to turn around our U.S. sales organization and restore a normal level of effectiveness and operating discipline. It now is clear that under the leadership of Michael Rousseau and his restructured organization, it took us approximately two quarters to convert from losing share with the strong product line in the United States in our CRM business to return to gaining share in the United States in the same way we continue to gain CRM share in international markets.
After adjusting for the estimated $15 million benefit we received during the second quarter from a competitor's temporary suspension of ICD sales in the United States, our U.S. CRM sales grew approximately 10% on a normalized basis during the second quarter, which was clearly faster than market growth. 
A second question we answered relates to our growth platforms, which have proven robust enough to support high-single-digit or low-double-digit sales growth on a constant-currency basis even in the current economic and competitive conditions. We exceeded the high end of our cumulative sales guidance during Q2 for the second quarter in a row. Global revenue increased approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis during the second quarter even after adjusting for the onetime $15 million benefit in U.S. ICDs.
All four of our growth platforms showed continued strength, with three of them, namely, CRM, AF and neuromodulation, independently growing at double-digit rates. As we have guided this year, we expect sales for our cardiovascular platform to be stronger during the second half of 2010, with full launch of our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve program in Europe, the continued strong growth of our Fractional Flow Reserve or FFR business, the value and synergy of our new Optical Coherence Tomography or OCT technology platform and other new product launches that should accelerate Cardiovascular division sales during the second half of the year.
A third question we answered relates to profitability and our ability to protect profit margins in the face of increased pressure on average selling prices or ASPs due to macro economic factors such as volatility of the euro, healthcare reform and other challenging market dynamics. During the first half of 2010, St. Jude Medical's global ASPs for low-voltage and high-voltage systems were higher than our comparable ASPs during the first half of 2009. We attribute this primarily to the value of our technology, our flow of new products, improvements in operating discipline in the United States that I mentioned previously and the overall effectiveness of our global sales and marketing organizations. All of these attributes of St. Jude Medical's growth program are fundamental and sustainable and should continue to support our results in future period.
The challenge of protecting profit margins in the face of healthcare reform in today's economic and competitive market conditions goes well beyond a discussion of average selling prices and trends. Here again, second quarter results reflect how proactive, focused and effective St. Jude Medical is about optimizing its cost structure to support profit margins going forward. Our operating profit margin in the second quarter improved 210 basis points versus the second quarter one year ago. It may be an even greater achievement that we improved our operating profit margin 40 basis points on a sequential quarter basis during Q2, while we simultaneously reduced days inventory on hand by 13 days.
We expect our operating margin to come under pressure during the second half of this year due to our acquisition of LightLab and other factors John Heinmiller has discussed previously, but we are on track to benefit from numerous new initiatives in 2011 and beyond. As a reminder, these initiatives include manufacturing expansion in cost-advantaged locations and other supply chain improvements, as well as leveraging our SAP implementation and other initiatives targeted at continuing to improve productivity and help optimize our cost structure. We expect market conditions to be challenging moving forward, but we believe that we have positioned ourselves well to meet these challenges.
I would next like to offer additional insights into our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM business, starting with market growth. We recently updated our analysis regarding our growth expectations for the global CRM market. Based on this analysis, we continue to expect the global CRM market to grow between 4% and 6% on a constant-currency basis. This analysis has been remarkably stable and predictive on a multi-year basis. This market model takes into account differences in global geographies, the impact of new technologies, changes in model mix, pressure on ASPs, the impact of device replacement cycles and all other appropriate factors.
Next, I would like to talk about CRM market share. We estimate that we exited Q2 holding approximately a 25% share of the global ICD market on a normalized basis. Our internal analysis indicates that in the United States, we hold approximately a 29% share of the ICD market for de novo implants and a 19% share of the ICD market for replacement devices. The implications of this analysis should be clear. First, given the propensity of physicians to replace ICDs with a product on the same manufacturer, we expect to benefit from a tailwind, where our share of the replacement market for ICDs eventually matches our current share of the de novo market for ICDs. This implies a likely four-point gain in market share.
Second, our 29% share of the market for de novo ICD implants reflects the value of our technology and the impact our advantages in technology have on payers, physicians and patients. New technology clearly still counts if it is both cost effective and clinically effective and is supported by an effective field organization. 
During the second quarter, we launched a number of new ICD products, including our Unify and Fortify lines of ICDs, which were launched in the United States at the HRS meeting in mid-May. These devices are smaller, deliver more energy and last longer. We do not usually break out product mix and will not do so in the future, but we will disclose that during June, the first full month of market release, our Unify and Fortify lines of ICDs comprised over 50% of our sales mix in the United States. This level of customer uptake is unprecedented and should be a good leading indicator for the continued success of our U.S. ICD sales through remainder of this year.
In Europe, during the second quarter, we launched our Unify and Fortify lines of ICDs, as well as our CorVue pulmonary edema monitoring technology, our Promote Quadra with Quartet quadripolar lead CRT-D system. These new product joined the existing product advantages we have with our SJ4 and DF4 simplified connector systems, our 7 French high-voltage lead line, our AnalyST line of ICDs with ST segment monitoring and our Quickflex micro 4 French bipolar left heart leads. A full discussion of the advantages these products provide to customers is beyond the scope of my comments this morning, but the impact of these technologies is reflected in our continued gain of international ICD market share during the second quarter. This gain in market share should be another leading indicator for the continued gain of ICD market share in the United States when all of these technologies are fully deployed in the United States market as well.
Next, I will touch briefly on highlights of our Cardiovascular, Atrial Fibrillation and Neuromodulation businesses. Our Cardiovascular or CVD business had a particularly productive quarter. The limited launch of our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve product line in Europe went well. We are now ramping up for a full launch of this product line in Europe before the end of this quarter, and we'll be ready to fully leverage the value of this technology during the fall tender season. We strengthened our leadership in the fast-growing Fractional Flow Reserve or FFR market by launching our next-generation PressureWire Aeris, a first of its kind wireless FFR measuring system that can be used with multiple recording systems to give physicians instant access to patient data.
We expanded our investment in FFR market development with our funding of FAME II trial and enrollment of first patients in that trial. FAME II will build on the results of the landmark FAME trial, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine at the beginning of last year. As a reminder, the FAME trial was a 1,005-patient study, which demonstrated convincingly that the cost of medical care is lower and patient outcomes are better if FFR measurement is used to guide stenting in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease.
Our conviction that the FFR market will become a major new growth driver led to our acquisition of LightLab. This acquisition both provides synergy to strengthen our FFR franchise and potentially is itself another new growth driver. As a result of this acquisition, St. Jude Medical now is the global leader in Optical Coherence Tomography or OCT technology and products for cardiovascular applications. OCT technology competes with intravascular ultrasound technology to provide intravascular imaging to aid coronary stenting and other cath lab procedures. The difference in quality and detail between an OCT image and an IVUS image has been described as analogous to the difference between an analog black-and-white television with a rabbit-ear antenna and a digital colored television with a high-definition image.
We think OCT has the potential to obsolete IVUS imaging in the practices of many physicians. We are in the process of combining our OCT technology with our FFR technology into a single integrated system so that physicians can use the FFR feature to determine which lesions to stent and then use our OCT feature to help guide stent placement. 
As a result of our acquisition of LightLab, St. Jude Medical not only has strengthened its FFR growth driver, but we also now have a credible opportunity to become the leader in the $500 million intravascular imaging market currently dominated by IVUS products.
Turning to the franchise of our Atrial Fibrillation or AF division, our AF growth program continue to make good progress during the second quarter. We are on track to have our first MediGuide-enabled cath labs online in Europe by the end of this year. During the second quarter, we also conducted a limited market release in Europe for four new families of ablation catheters. This limited market release was especially interesting in that it validated the value of our new Contact ablation technology and our new Cool Flex ablation technology. We now look forward to generating additional clinical evidence about these new technologies and then initiating full market launches.
Moving on to our Neuromodulation business. It is noteworthy that Neuromodulation revenue growth strengthened as expected after Q1 and confirms that our neuromodulation growth platform remains robust. The next major development in our Neuromodulation business will be full launch of our deep brain stimulation or DBS system in Europe during the second half of this year. This system will consist of our Brio rechargeable deep brain stimulator, our Athena DBS clinician programmer and a complete line of proprietary leads and accessories. 
With respect to neuromodulation clinical trials, we are on track to complete follow-up this quarter of patients in our U.S. pivotal trial for Parkinson's disease indication. We expect the clinical data to be positive and anticipate submitting our PMA during the first half of 2011.
With respect to our U.S. pivotal trial for patients suffering from certain forms of migraine, we expect to complete follow-up by the end of next quarter and tentatively expect to announce the results of this clinical trail during the first half of 2011. 
Finally, with respect to our broadened U.S. pivotal trial studying the benefits of DBS and a targeted area of the brain for patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression, we have received approval from FDA to expand enrollment from 30 to 50 patients. It is too soon to know whether either the migraine trial or the depression trial will lead to new growth drivers for St. Jude Medical, but we are committed to continue pursuing potential new indications in the field of neuromodulation and are optimistic that neuromodulation will develop into a multi-indication multi-billion dollar growth platform for St. Jude Medical over time.
In conclusion, our second quarter was another highly successful quarter by every major measure. For the second quarter in a row, we exceeded the high end of our sales guidance. We improved our operating margin on a year-over-year basis by 210 basis points. We delivered a 25% increase in earnings per share. We became the leaders in next-generation technology for intravascular imaging and are now prepared to attack a new $500 million market. We competed over 10 new product launches, the impact of which will not fully influence our results until the second half of this year. We entered the third quarter with good momentum and with multiple additional new product launches scheduled for the remainder of the year. Last but not least, St. Jude Medical was named to the Fortune 500 list of companies for the first time, entering the list at number 445. 
At this point, we have concluded our prepared remarks. John Heinmiller, Mark Rousseau, Eric Fain and I now all are ready to take you questions. Operator, would you please moderate the questions?

We look at the competitive ship hold as being an event that now is quickly fading into the past. I think the better way to think about our ICD strength and our ICD share gain would be to look at what happened in Europe, where there was no ship hold and it really was a cleaner quarter. You saw 18% growth in our international ICD sales, and it's really driven by our new technology and the significant advantages with all of the technologies. I mean, I don't think we've ever had such an era of rich new technology and technology advantage at St. Jude Medical as we now have beginning with the second quarter and with everything that we begun to put into the United States market and with even more technology that we already have put into the European market. So I think that's really a focus. I think the competitors' ship hold just really ends up being a distraction and a little bit of a red herring. To us, our growth is about our core growth program. It's about our technology advantage. It's about the value of the technology that our technology advantages clearly have for customers. You'll see that with the data that we offered that our global ASPs, average selling prices in our CRM business were actually higher in the first half of 2010 than they were in the first half of 2008. So all of that is very much about St. Jude Medical's independent growth program and the value of that program and the impact it's having on customers.

Our view is that anytime there is a crisis, there are going to be winners and losers. The key to us is to be realistic about what the crisis is or what are the macroeconomic conditions and to assess whether we've done a good job being proactive enough to position ourselves to be a winner in the face of those economic and competitive conditions. I think you see from our second quarter a lot of positive indicators to say that we have been proactive. We have positioned ourselves to be a winner in this current economic environment. Then, what I look at -- what I think about more along that line is, first, every company's positioned differently, so I think it would really be a mistake for investors to do a one-size-fits-all view of the sector. Inside the sector, what distinguishes St. Jude Medical, first, is we focus primarily on the life-saving devices. So life-saving devices versus elective procedures is one significant differentiator, which is a favorable to our outlook. Second, where we have devices that are not life saving, they are cost saving. And again, that's not the case with every competitors' portfolio. So we think about our FFR technology, we think about our vascular closure technology, we think about the value of our patient-managed left atrial pressure technology that we're beginning to work with in Europe and more. On the pain side, the cost effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation versus alternative therapies. So either we are focused on life saving or we're focused on money saving or we're focused both on life saving and higher quality in a cost effective way. So all of that advantages us to be a winner in distressed macroeconomic conditions. There's more than. I would move after life saving and money saving. It would be a company whose devices are becoming commoditized, is going to be a loser in this kind of a crisis. A company whose technology is differentiated and differentiated in a way that is valuable to customers and the customers are willing to pay more for, obviously, is going to have a competitive advantage. And you saw it from the data that we provided here in our prepared remarks that we clearly have differentiated technologies that customers are willing to pay a premium for that is an advantage to us versus companies who have been less successful in offering innovative technology and whose portfolio is becoming more commoditized. The next point I would move on to, the advantage of St. Jude Medical to be a winner in this kind of a crisis is the efforts that we've made over the last five years and coming to be six years to optimize our cost structure. So companies that don't have a way to gain an advantage in the state of their costs to address the level of pressure that people expect on budgets and average selling prices are again going to be in a very different reactive mode than a company like St. Jude Medical, where five years ago, we began the investments to really improve our gross margin with manufacturing and cost-advantage locations, which had just becoming online now in 2011. And more on the topic of optimizing our cost structure. So that's an advantage and differentiates us from others in the space. Another advantage we have is as you think about budget pressures, the pressure generally tends to come sooner and stronger to capital budgets than to non-capital budgets. We do have a small component of our portfolio that's a capital budget item, but most of it is not capital budget items. And so that again, there's another advantage to us. And so the market's not monolithic at all, either on the MedTech side or on the customer side. There's the private pay, public pay on the customer side. Our global reach, the extent of our presence in global markets, gives us a lot more diversification than some, which is an advantage to us. So I think you put it all down, there are a lot of things that we worry about and are in everybody else's minds. But in that environment, there will be winners and losers, and we've offered some good evidence among the list of winners and losers at St. Jude Medical, and the second quarter clearly has been an outstanding winner. And going forward, we expect that we're going to continue to focus on doing everything we can to stay in that winner column.

And as you were suggesting, Mike, there a lot of factors that bear on that. It does include, it all includes changes in geographic mix, changes in product mix. It includes ASP premiums on new product launches. It includes operating discipline and leadership changes, restructured leadership, organizations that we put into place in the United States in the second half of 2009 that's now benefiting us in the first half of 2010. And so there really are a lot of factors. There is an increasing trend toward more CRT-D, generally speaking, on the high-voltage side, and so there are a lot of factors. But when you net it all out, those are the results that we have. Having said all of that, we expect continued pressure on average selling prices. And in the past, we've said regularly that our experiences that generally speaking on a kind of an apples-to-apples basis, there is a low-single-digit decreases in ASPs. But we've already said that, that's really not the story, that the story is the big picture in all of these other dynamics and the impact of all of these dynamics together and how they net out to bear on ASPs.

proprietary. The details are always going to be long, anyway. But we keep our insights proprietary. We think that what's really helpful is take as many details as we look at. Many of which are going to be long and blend them together to predict at what level -- Where is the model truly predictive versus just detailed, and we've got every bit of detail. But where we think it's truly predictive is our experience here has been that when we talk about the individual segments, it's only a question of how long are we going to be. But now that we talk about it in terms of 4% to 6% global growth of the combined low-voltage and high-voltage market, that has been remarkably predictive. And so the rest of the discussion about this detail and that detail ends up being relatively non-productive and certainly non-predictive.

And so we continue in that mode. We have the capability to do more than we've done -- to do more in 2010 than we've already done. Our M&A programs remain active and we'll continue to remain active during 2010. Every possibility we approach, we approach with the idea that we don't have to do anything. Our current growth program is intact and adequate. On the other hand, if we can advantage ourselves by doing something, we will do it if all of the stars align. So that's our thinking, and we work to keep ourselves disciplined and constant in that kind of thinking.

I mean, in tough economic conditions and in a tough budget austerity conditions, inevitably, these markets are -- our markets are generally in the same way we said a year ago about recession. I think our markets are austerity resistant, but clearly not austerity proof. So we don't expect our markets to strengthen. I don't expect the Neuromodulation market to accelerate when there is as much budget and economic concern as there is. On the other hand, we're not the first ones to show weakness and if the austerity measures stay in place long enough, it wouldn't surprise any of us to see the growth ranges that we've previously described, drift more toward the lower end of some of the ranges. On the other hand, to the extent that we are able to continue to be successful with technology that saves the healthcare budget money, as we do in Neuromodulation, we think that it will continue to be a healthy double-digit growth market. On the topic of a catch-up, that's inevitable and there were some of that when we said that we thought that results in Q1 reflected some differences and timing of orders. So orders, so yes, I think we've got some of those orders in the second quarter instead of the first quarter. But the market itself continues to be a double-digit growth market.

So when we think of a cost advantage manufacturing location, we define that as global costs including tax costs. But clearly, not only tax costs. We look at the -- really the first and we look at is which alternative location have the quality of workforce that would meet our standards and expectations. So that's the first thing. And so we're looking for a level of education, level of experience of the workforce, the history that, that workforce has working with our kind of technology, generally and even then specifically, in our type of regulated industry and with the medical devices in particular. So that's the very first thing, and I appreciate that doesn't address your question exactly, but that's the first thing we look at. Then we look at now where can we access that quality of workforce in a way that is cost advantage, both with respect to overhead rates, with respect to labor rates and with respect to tax rates. And so all of that and to the extent that they're obviously a lot of places at different companies manufacture, there's a lot of places that we do manufacturing, we'll continue to manufacture, but we take all those factors into account. We took all those factors into account in 2005 and making our site selections and then beginning a level of investments that are really just going to start to impact our gross margin here in 2011. So I'm not going to offer -- we haven't given guidance for 2011 yet, and we aren't going to give guidance for kind of years beyond. So I don't want to be exact about kind of degree of impact on gross margin. But clearly, what you will see is you'll start to see first shipments. We're going to open both our new facility in Malaysia and our new facility in Costa Rica by the end of this year. And so everything is on track that way. We will begin first shipment by the end of this year, on or about by the end of this year, don't hold me too exactly. But then you'll see the manufacturing volumes. Our goal is not to manufacture as much as we can, as quick as we can. Our goal is first, to make sure that we keep control in the quality sense. And that means start small, expand our experience on a pilot basis, make sure that we already have the workforce working side-by-side with our California group, for example and with other groups, so that we have very experienced, and very experienced St. Jude Medical people in our initial production in these new locations. And so you will see us gradually increase our volumes with highest attention to quality and secondary attention to leveraging the cost advantages of the site. And then beyond that, all I can say is that with gross margin and with cost structure as with average selling prices, there's so many factors that bear on it that really you're going to have to wait for our 2011 guidance to make more sense of my comments.

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,313,000,000, up approximately 11% over the $1,184,000,000 million reported in the second quarter of last year.

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,313,000,000, up approximately 11% over the $1,184,000,000 million reported in the second quarter of last year. Favorable foreign currency translations versus last year's second quarter increased this quarter's sales by about $5 million. The impact of these foreign currency translations on any one product category is negligible. As a result, we will not call out our constant currency sales growth as it is approximately the same as the reported sales growth.
At the end of 2009, the federal research and development tax credit expired, and Congress has not yet extended the credit for 2010. In this circumstance, GAAP requires us to estimate and record our effective income tax rate assuming that the R&D credit is not extended. For purposes of this conference call and our calculation of adjusted net earnings, however, we are assuming that the tax credit will be extended retroactively for 2010 as in past years. As a result, comments referencing second quarter results and our guidance for 2010, including earnings per share amounts, are presented based on an effective income tax rate that contemplates the extension of the tax credit retroactive to January 1, 2010. To the extent that the federal R&D tax credit is not enacted, our effective income tax rate for 2010 would be higher than what is being presented during this call.
Earnings per share were $0.79 for the second quarter of 2010, a 25% increase over EPS of $0.63 in the second quarter of 2009 and above our guidance range of $0.73 to $0.75. Before we discuss our second quarter 2010 sales results by product category, with guidance for the third quarter and the remainder of 2010, let me comment on foreign currency. 
As discussed on prior calls, the two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. In preparing our sales and earnings guidance in April 2010 covering the second quarter and the remainder of the year, we used exchange rates, which assumed that each euro would translate into about $1.33 to $1.38, and for the yen, each 90 to 95 yen would translate into USD $1. The actual average exchange rates used to translate our sales into U.S. dollars versus the midpoint of the exchange rate assumptions we provided in our April guidance reduced second quarter reported sales by approximately $12 million.
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the third quarter and the second half of 2010, we are now assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.23 to $1.28, and for the yen, each 86 to 91 yen will translate into USD $1. This change in assumption regarding currency exchange rates decreases total forecasted sales for the remainder of 2010 by about $25 million to $35 million, which we estimate will reduce EPS by approximately $0.03 to $0.04 over the remainder of the year.
Now for the sales by product category discussion. Total Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM sales, which includes revenues from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines, were $788 million, up 12% from last year's second quarter. For the second quarter, ICD sales were $471 million, up 18% from last year's second quarter. U.S. ICD sales were $300 million, up 18% from last year's second quarter, and international ICD sales were $171 million, also representing an 18% increase over the second quarter of 2009. 
As you know, for the first two selling weeks of the second quarter of 2010, a competitor had suspended all sales of their ICD products in the United States. As we mentioned during our April conference call, we took this situation into account when we provided our guidance for the second quarter's CRM product sales. We estimate that this dynamic provided a onetime benefit of approximately $15 million to our second quarter U.S. ICD sales.
For low-voltage devices, sales for the second quarter totaled $317 million, up 4% from last year's second quarter. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $140 million, up slightly over 6% from last year's second quarter. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $177 million, up 3% from the second quarter of 2009. 
For the third quarter of 2010, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $715 million to $745 million. The guidance range for the third quarter reflects the normal seasonal impact of the summer selling period, updated currency assumptions and a return to normal competitor dynamics.
For the full year 2010, we now expect total CRM sales to be in the range of $2,975,000,000 to $3,050,000,000. Given the strength of our CRM business, we have raised the guidance range slightly from our April outlook despite the fact that our updated currency assumptions for the remainder of the year are expected to result in lower reported sales versus the currency assumptions we were using in April.
Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the second quarter totaled $176 million, up 13% over the second quarter of last year. For the third quarter of 2010, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $155 million to $170 million. We expect our full year 2010 AF product sales to be in the range of $680 million to $710 million. This 2010 outlook range is slightly less than the full year 2010 guidance range we provided last quarter, which primarily reflects the stronger U.S. dollar versus other euro.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the second quarter of 2010 were $254 million, up 5% over the second quarter of 2009. Within this category of products, sales of vascular closure products in the second quarter of 2010 were $98 million, approximately the same as in the second quarter of 2009. Sales of heart valve products in the second quarter of 2010 were $87 million, a 4% increase over the second quarter of 2009. 
For the third quarter of 2010, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $235 million to $250 million. We expect full year 2010 cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $1,005,000,000 to $1,030,000,000. This 2010 outlook range includes of the expected contributions of LightLab revenue in the second half of this year and also reflects our updated currency assumptions.
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the second quarter of 2010 were $95 million, up 17% from the second quarter of 2009. For the third quarter of 2010, we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million, and we expect full year 2010 neuromodulation sales in the range of $375 million to $390 million. Let me pause at this point and recap our 2010 sales guidance. 
For Cardiac Rhythm Management devices, we expect sales for 2010 in the range of $2,975,000,000 to $3,050,000,000, and sales of our AF product for 2010 are expected to be $680 million to $710 million. For cardiovascular products, we expect 2010 sales in the range of $1,005,000,000 to $1,030,000,000 and we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be $375 million to $390 million. If you add up the sales across all growth platforms, total sales in 2010 are expected to be $5,035,000,000, to $5,180,000,000. This guidance range provides for consolidated sales growth in the range of 8% to 11% on an as-reported basis and constant currency growth of 9% to 12% over 2009. 
Looking to revenue by geography. In total, 53% of St. Jude Medical sales in the second quarter of 2010 came from the United States, while 47% came from our international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales for the second quarter of 2010 is available in our press release.
The gross profit margin this quarter was 73.7%, representing a 50 basis point decline compared with the second quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.2% to 73.8%. Our full year 2010 gross profit margin guidance continues to incorporate the impact of absorbing the costs associated with the remote monitoring and wireless telemetry capabilities in our pacemaker product line. We are providing for this impact to be slightly higher in the second half of this year. In addition, our gross profit margin guidance also reflects the revised currency assumptions for the remainder of 2010.
Our second quarter SG&A expenses were 34.1% of net sales, a 230 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, we now forecast SG&A as a percentage of net sales in the range of 34.7% to 35.2%. R&D expenses in the second quarter of 2010 were 11.8% of net sales.  For the full year 2010, we continue to expect R&D expense to be in the range of 12.0% to 12.6% of net sales, as we continue to balance delivering short-term results with the right investments in long-term growth drivers.  
Net other expense was $20 million in the second quarter. And we note for the first half of 2010, the other expense category totaled $40 million and included the write-off of certain debt issuance costs, which were incurred in connection with our refinancing activities. Going into the second half of 2010, we now have the new debt structure in place and anticipate the other expense category to be in the range of $12 million to $16 million per quarter in Q3 and Q4.
For the second quarter, the company's effective income tax rate was 12.2%. For 2010, we now expect the tax rate to be in the range of 24.2% for the second quarter. And then now for 2010, we expect the tax rate to be in the range of 24.3% to 24.8%. As a reminder, these effective income tax rates contemplate the extension of the federal research and development tax credit in 2010 retroactive to the beginning of the year. As previously noted, to the extent the credit is not extended, our overall effective income tax rate would increase. We have also assumed the extension of the federal R&D tax credit in our EPS guidance for 2010.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the second quarter of 2010, we had $667 million in cash and cash equivalents, $1,962,000,000 in total debt and $1 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The debt on our balance sheet includes $1,653,000,000 of senior notes with maturities in 2013, 2014 and 2019. In addition, during the second quarter, we successfully refinanced the portion of our Japanese notes that were set to mature in May 2010, with 309 million of new fixed rate yen-based notes with maturities in 2017 and 2020. 
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our earnings per share outlook for the third quarter and the full year 2010. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the third quarter of 2010, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 330 million to 332 million shares, with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2010 at 329 million to 331 million. In addition, we have incorporated the dilution from the LightLab acquisition, which closed on July 6. However, we have not taken into account any non-recurring charges related to the LightLab acquisition, which we anticipate will be recorded in the third quarter. 
The company expects consolidated earnings per share for the third quarter to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.69. And for the full year 2010, we now expect consolidated earnings per share to be in the range of $2.86 to $2.91, a $0.06 increase from the full year 2010 guidance we gave during our April 2010 conference call. This updated expectation represents EPS growth of approximately 18% to 20% over the 2009 adjusted EPS of $2.43.
To provide some insight into the basis for the increase in our annual EPS guidance, we start out with the results for the second quarter and note that we exceeded the midpoint of our prior guidance for this quarter by $0.05. As previously discussed, we estimate that the change in our assumptions regarding currency exchange rates will reduce our EPS for the remainder of the year by approximately $0.03 to $0.04, and we are factoring this negative change into our updated full year guidance. In addition, we have factored in the dilutive impact of incorporating the LightLab operations beginning July 6, 2010. However, we expect the strength of our business to continue, and we believe that we will more than offset the negative currency impact, as well as the LightLab dilution during the remainder of the year. And I would now like to turn it back to Dan Starks."

The first question answered was how long it wo",2248,"Thank you, John. Our solid performance in the second quarter answered a lot questions about the strength and sustainability of St. Jude Medical's growth program in current economic and competitive conditions. The first question answered was how long it would take for us to turn around our U.S. sales organization and restore a normal level of effectiveness and operating discipline. It now is clear that under the leadership of Michael Rousseau and his restructured organization, it took us approximately two quarters to convert from losing share with the strong product line in the United States in our CRM business to return to gaining share in the United States in the same way we continue to gain CRM share in international markets.
After adjusting for the estimated $15 million benefit we received during the second quarter from a competitor's temporary suspension of ICD sales in the United States, our U.S. CRM sales grew approximately 10% on a normalized basis during the second quarter, which was clearly faster than market growth. 
A second question we answered relates to our growth platforms, which have proven robust enough to support high-single-digit or low-double-digit sales growth on a constant-currency basis even in the current economic and competitive conditions. We exceeded the high end of our cumulative sales guidance during Q2 for the second quarter in a row. Global revenue increased approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis during the second quarter even after adjusting for the onetime $15 million benefit in U.S. ICDs.
All four of our growth platforms showed continued strength, with three of them, namely, CRM, AF and neuromodulation, independently growing at double-digit rates. As we have guided this year, we expect sales for our cardiovascular platform to be stronger during the second half of 2010, with full launch of our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve program in Europe, the continued strong growth of our Fractional Flow Reserve or FFR business, the value and synergy of our new Optical Coherence Tomography or OCT technology platform and other new product launches that should accelerate Cardiovascular division sales during the second half of the year.
A third question we answered relates to profitability and our ability to protect profit margins in the face of increased pressure on average selling prices or ASPs due to macro economic factors such as volatility of the euro, healthcare reform and other challenging market dynamics. During the first half of 2010, St. Jude Medical's global ASPs for low-voltage and high-voltage systems were higher than our comparable ASPs during the first half of 2009. We attribute this primarily to the value of our technology, our flow of new products, improvements in operating discipline in the United States that I mentioned previously and the overall effectiveness of our global sales and marketing organizations. All of these attributes of St. Jude Medical's growth program are fundamental and sustainable and should continue to support our results in future period.
The challenge of protecting profit margins in the face of healthcare reform in today's economic and competitive market conditions goes well beyond a discussion of average selling prices and trends. Here again, second quarter results reflect how proactive, focused and effective St. Jude Medical is about optimizing its cost structure to support profit margins going forward. Our operating profit margin in the second quarter improved 210 basis points versus the second quarter one year ago. It may be an even greater achievement that we improved our operating profit margin 40 basis points on a sequential quarter basis during Q2, while we simultaneously reduced days inventory on hand by 13 days.
We expect our operating margin to come under pressure during the second half of this year due to our acquisition of LightLab and other factors John Heinmiller has discussed previously, but we are on track to benefit from numerous new initiatives in 2011 and beyond. As a reminder, these initiatives include manufacturing expansion in cost-advantaged locations and other supply chain improvements, as well as leveraging our SAP implementation and other initiatives targeted at continuing to improve productivity and help optimize our cost structure. We expect market conditions to be challenging moving forward, but we believe that we have positioned ourselves well to meet these challenges.
I would next like to offer additional insights into our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM business, starting with market growth. We recently updated our analysis regarding our growth expectations for the global CRM market. Based on this analysis, we continue to expect the global CRM market to grow between 4% and 6% on a constant-currency basis. This analysis has been remarkably stable and predictive on a multi-year basis. This market model takes into account differences in global geographies, the impact of new technologies, changes in model mix, pressure on ASPs, the impact of device replacement cycles and all other appropriate factors.
Next, I would like to talk about CRM market share. We estimate that we exited Q2 holding approximately a 25% share of the global ICD market on a normalized basis. Our internal analysis indicates that in the United States, we hold approximately a 29% share of the ICD market for de novo implants and a 19% share of the ICD market for replacement devices. The implications of this analysis should be clear. First, given the propensity of physicians to replace ICDs with a product on the same manufacturer, we expect to benefit from a tailwind, where our share of the replacement market for ICDs eventually matches our current share of the de novo market for ICDs. This implies a likely four-point gain in market share.
Second, our 29% share of the market for de novo ICD implants reflects the value of our technology and the impact our advantages in technology have on payers, physicians and patients. New technology clearly still counts if it is both cost effective and clinically effective and is supported by an effective field organization. 
During the second quarter, we launched a number of new ICD products, including our Unify and Fortify lines of ICDs, which were launched in the United States at the HRS meeting in mid-May. These devices are smaller, deliver more energy and last longer. We do not usually break out product mix and will not do so in the future, but we will disclose that during June, the first full month of market release, our Unify and Fortify lines of ICDs comprised over 50% of our sales mix in the United States. This level of customer uptake is unprecedented and should be a good leading indicator for the continued success of our U.S. ICD sales through remainder of this year.
In Europe, during the second quarter, we launched our Unify and Fortify lines of ICDs, as well as our CorVue pulmonary edema monitoring technology, our Promote Quadra with Quartet quadripolar lead CRT-D system. These new product joined the existing product advantages we have with our SJ4 and DF4 simplified connector systems, our 7 French high-voltage lead line, our AnalyST line of ICDs with ST segment monitoring and our Quickflex micro 4 French bipolar left heart leads. A full discussion of the advantages these products provide to customers is beyond the scope of my comments this morning, but the impact of these technologies is reflected in our continued gain of international ICD market share during the second quarter. This gain in market share should be another leading indicator for the continued gain of ICD market share in the United States when all of these technologies are fully deployed in the United States market as well.
Next, I will touch briefly on highlights of our Cardiovascular, Atrial Fibrillation and Neuromodulation businesses. Our Cardiovascular or CVD business had a particularly productive quarter. The limited launch of our Trifecta pericardial stented tissue valve product line in Europe went well. We are now ramping up for a full launch of this product line in Europe before the end of this quarter, and we'll be ready to fully leverage the value of this technology during the fall tender season. We strengthened our leadership in the fast-growing Fractional Flow Reserve or FFR market by launching our next-generation PressureWire Aeris, a first of its kind wireless FFR measuring system that can be used with multiple recording systems to give physicians instant access to patient data.
We expanded our investment in FFR market development with our funding of FAME II trial and enrollment of first patients in that trial. FAME II will build on the results of the landmark FAME trial, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine at the beginning of last year. As a reminder, the FAME trial was a 1,005-patient study, which demonstrated convincingly that the cost of medical care is lower and patient outcomes are better if FFR measurement is used to guide stenting in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease.
Our conviction that the FFR market will become a major new growth driver led to our acquisition of LightLab. This acquisition both provides synergy to strengthen our FFR franchise and potentially is itself another new growth driver. As a result of this acquisition, St. Jude Medical now is the global leader in Optical Coherence Tomography or OCT technology and products for cardiovascular applications. OCT technology competes with intravascular ultrasound technology to provide intravascular imaging to aid coronary stenting and other cath lab procedures. The difference in quality and detail between an OCT image and an IVUS image has been described as analogous to the difference between an analog black-and-white television with a rabbit-ear antenna and a digital colored television with a high-definition image.
We think OCT has the potential to obsolete IVUS imaging in the practices of many physicians. We are in the process of combining our OCT technology with our FFR technology into a single integrated system so that physicians can use the FFR feature to determine which lesions to stent and then use our OCT feature to help guide stent placement. 
As a result of our acquisition of LightLab, St. Jude Medical not only has strengthened its FFR growth driver, but we also now have a credible opportunity to become the leader in the $500 million intravascular imaging market currently dominated by IVUS products.
Turning to the franchise of our Atrial Fibrillation or AF division, our AF growth program continue to make good progress during the second quarter. We are on track to have our first MediGuide-enabled cath labs online in Europe by the end of this year. During the second quarter, we also conducted a limited market release in Europe for four new families of ablation catheters. This limited market release was especially interesting in that it validated the value of our new Contact ablation technology and our new Cool Flex ablation technology. We now look forward to generating additional clinical evidence about these new technologies and then initiating full market launches.
Moving on to our Neuromodulation business. It is noteworthy that Neuromodulation revenue growth strengthened as expected after Q1 and confirms that our neuromodulation growth platform remains robust. The next major development in our Neuromodulation business will be full launch of our deep brain stimulation or DBS system in Europe during the second half of this year. This system will consist of our Brio rechargeable deep brain stimulator, our Athena DBS clinician programmer and a complete line of proprietary leads and accessories. 
With respect to neuromodulation clinical trials, we are on track to complete follow-up this quarter of patients in our U.S. pivotal trial for Parkinson's disease indication. We expect the clinical data to be positive and anticipate submitting our PMA during the first half of 2011.
With respect to our U.S. pivotal trial for patients suffering from certain forms of migraine, we expect to complete follow-up by the end of next quarter and tentatively expect to announce the results of this clinical trail during the first half of 2011. 
Finally, with respect to our broadened U.S. pivotal trial studying the benefits of DBS and a targeted area of the brain for patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression, we have received approval from FDA to expand enrollment from 30 to 50 patients. It is too soon to know whether either the migraine trial or the depression trial will lead to new growth drivers for St. Jude Medical, but we are committed to continue pursuing potential new indications in the field of neuromodulation and are optimistic that neuromodulation will develop into a multi-indication multi-billion dollar growth platform for St. Jude Medical over time.
In conclusion, our second quarter was another highly successful quarter by every major measure. For the second quarter in a row, we exceeded the high end of our sales guidance. We improved our operating margin on a year-over-year basis by 210 basis points. We delivered a 25% increase in earnings per share. We became the leaders in next-generation technology for intravascular imaging and are now prepared to attack a new $500 million market. We competed over 10 new product launches, the impact of which will not fully influence our results until the second half of this year. We entered the third quarter with good momentum and with multiple additional new product launches scheduled for the remainder of the year. Last but not least, St. Jude Medical was named to the Fortune 500 list of companies for the first time, entering the list at number 445. 
At this point, we have concluded our prepared remarks. John Heinmiller, Mark Rousseau, Eric Fain and I now all are ready to take you questions. Operator, would you please moderate the questions?"

We look at the competitive ship hold as being an event that now is quickly fading into the past. I think the better way to think about our ICD strength and our ICD share gain would be to look at what happened in Europe, where there was no ship hold and it really was a cleaner quarter. You saw 18% growth in our international ICD sales, and it's really driven by our new technology and the significant advantages with all of the technologies. I mean, I don't think we've ever had such an era of rich new technology and technology advantage at St. Jude Medical as we now have beginning with the second quarter and with everything that we begun to put into the United States market and with even more technology that we already have put into the European market. So I think that's really a focus. I think the competitors' ship hold just really ends up being a distraction and a little bit of a red herring. To us, our growth is about our core growth program. It's about our technology advantage. It's about the value of the technology that our technology advantages clearly have for customers. You'll see that with the data that we offered that our global ASPs, average selling prices in our CRM business were actually higher in the first half of 2010 than they were in the first half of 2008. So all of that is very much about St. Jude Medical's independent growth program and the value of that program and the impact it's having on customers."

Our view is that anytime there is a crisis, there are going to be winners and losers. The key to us is to be realistic about what the crisis is or what are the macroeconomic conditions and to assess whether we've done a good job being proactive enough to position ourselves to be a winner in the face of those economic and competitive conditions. I think you see from our second quarter a lot of positive indicators to say that we have been proactive. We have positioned ourselves to be a winner in this current economic environment. Then, what I look at -- what I think about more along that line is, first, every company's positioned differently, so I think it would really be a mistake for investors to do a one-size-fits-all view of the sector. Inside the sector, what distinguishes St. Jude Medical, first, is we focus primarily on the life-saving devices. So life-saving devices versus elective procedures is one significant differentiator, which is a favorable to our outlook. Second, where we have devices that are not life saving, they are cost saving. And again, that's not the case with every competitors' portfolio. So we think about our FFR technology, we think about our vascular closure technology, we think about the value of our patient-managed left atrial pressure technology that we're beginning to work with in Europe and more. On the pain side, the cost effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation versus alternative therapies. So either we are focused on life saving or we're focused on money saving or we're focused both on life saving and higher quality in a cost effective way. So all of that advantages us to be a winner in distressed macroeconomic conditions. There's more than. I would move after life saving and money saving. It would be a company whose devices are becoming commoditized, is going to be a loser in this kind of a crisis. A company whose technology is differentiated and differentiated in a way that is valuable to customers and the customers are willing to pay more for, obviously, is going to have a competitive advantage. And you saw it from the data that we provided here in our prepared remarks that we clearly have differentiated technologies that customers are willing to pay a premium for that is an advantage to us versus companies who have been less successful in offering innovative technology and whose portfolio is becoming more commoditized. The next point I would move on to, the advantage of St. Jude Medical to be a winner in this kind of a crisis is the efforts that we've made over the last five years and coming to be six years to optimize our cost structure. So companies that don't have a way to gain an advantage in the state of their costs to address the level of pressure that people expect on budgets and average selling prices are again going to be in a very different reactive mode than a company like St. Jude Medical, where five years ago, we began the investments to really improve our gross margin with manufacturing and cost-advantage locations, which had just becoming online now in 2011. And more on the topic of optimizing our cost structure. So that's an advantage and differentiates us from others in the space. Another advantage we have is as you think about budget pressures, the pressure generally tends to come sooner and stronger to capital budgets than to non-capital budgets. We do have a small component of our portfolio that's a capital budget item, but most of it is not capital budget items. And so that again, there's another advantage to us. And so the market's not monolithic at all, either on the MedTech side or on the customer side. There's the private pay, public pay on the customer side. Our global reach, the extent of our presence in global markets, gives us a lot more diversification than some, which is an advantage to us. So I think you put it all down, there are a lot of things that we worry about and are in everybody else's minds. But in that environment, there will be winners and losers, and we've offered some good evidence among the list of winners and losers at St. Jude Medical, and the second quarter clearly has been an outstanding winner. And going forward, we expect that we're going to continue to focus on doing everything we can to stay in that winner column."

The question of St. Jude Medical's unique prospects, our growth prospects stronger or weaker today than they were two quarters ago. They're clearly stronger. And it's reflected in the increase in our guidance one quarter ago, and then increase in our guidance again this quarter and meaningful increases in our guidance, both at the end of this first quarter and at the end of the second quarter. So I can't speak for other companies and for the peculiarities of their market positions. But for St. Jude Medical, with respect to our markets, it seems to us that our growth outlook is stronger today than it was at the beginning of this year."

In fact, for the first half of 2010 versus the first half of 2009, on a global basis, our system ASPs for ICDs were up this year versus last. And our system ASPs for low-voltage devices were up this year versus last. So a fairly stunning versus what one might think from a distance. And as you were suggesting, Mike, there a lot of factors that bear on that. It does include, it all includes changes in geographic mix, changes in product mix. It includes ASP premiums on new product launches. It includes operating discipline and leadership changes, restructured leadership, organizations that we put into place in the United States in the second half of 2009 that's now benefiting us in the first half of 2010. And so there really are a lot of factors. There is an increasing trend toward more CRT-D, generally speaking, on the high-voltage side, and so there are a lot of factors. But when you net it all out, those are the results that we have. Having said all of that, we expect continued pressure on average selling prices. And in the past, we've said regularly that our experiences that generally speaking on a kind of an apples-to-apples basis, there is a low-single-digit decreases in ASPs. But we've already said that, that's really not the story, that the story is the big picture in all of these other dynamics and the impact of all of these dynamics together and how they net out to bear on ASPs. So that's what we think about it."

I don't expect the Neuromodulation market to accelerate when there is as much budget and economic concern as there is. On the other hand, we're not the first ones to show weakness and if the austerity measures stay in place long enough, it wouldn't surprise any of us to see the growth ranges that we've previously described, drift more toward the lower end of some of the ranges. On the other hand, to the extent that we are able to continue to be successful with technology that saves the healthcare budget money, as we do in Neuromodulation, we think that it will continue to be a healthy double-digit growth market.

So when we think of a cost advantage manufacturing location, we define that as global costs including tax costs. But clearly, not only tax costs. We look at the -- really the first and we look at is which alternative location have the quality of workforce that would meet our standards and expectations. So that's the first thing. And so we're looking for a level of education, level of experience of the workforce, the history that, that workforce has working with our kind of technology, generally and even then specifically, in our type of regulated industry and with the medical devices in particular. So that's the very first thing, and I appreciate that doesn't address your question exactly, but that's the first thing we look at. Then we look at now where can we access that quality of workforce in a way that is cost advantage, both with respect to overhead rates, with respect to labor rates and with respect to tax rates. And so all of that and to the extent that they're obviously a lot of places at different companies manufacture, there's a lot of places that we do manufacturing, we'll continue to manufacture, but we take all those factors into account. We took all those factors into account in 2005 and making our site selections and then beginning a level of investments that are really just going to start to impact our gross margin here in 2011. So I'm not going to offer -- we haven't given guidance for 2011 yet, and we aren't going to give guidance for kind of years beyond. So I don't want to be exact about kind of degree of impact on gross margin. But clearly, what you will see is you'll start to see first shipments. We're going to open both our new facility in Malaysia and our new facility in Costa Rica by the end of this year. And so everything is on track that way. We will begin first shipment by the end of this year, on or about by the end of this year, don't hold me too exactly. But then you'll see the manufacturing volumes. Our goal is not to manufacture as much as we can, as quick as we can. Our goal is first, to make sure that we keep control in the quality sense. And that means start small, expand our experience on a pilot basis, make sure that we already have the workforce working side-by-side with our California group, for example and with other groups, so that we have very experienced, and very experienced St. Jude Medical people in our initial production in these new locations. And so you will see us gradually increase our volumes with highest attention to quality and secondary attention to leveraging the cost advantages of the site. And then beyond that, all I can say is that with gross margin and with cost structure as with average selling prices, there's so many factors that bear on it that really you're going to have to wait for our 2011 guidance to make more sense of my comments."

Welcome to the St. Jude Medical Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call today are John Heinmiller, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Rousseau, Group President; Eric Fain, President of our Cardiac Rhythm Management Division; and Angie Craig, Vice President of Corporate Relations and Human Resources. 
Our third quarter results reinforced our conviction that our growth program is on track and that St. Jude Medical is well positioned to continue growing long term at a superior rate. We now have raised our 2010 EPS guidance range for the third time in three quarters and beaten consensus expectations for EPS by a combined total of $0.17 earnings per share over the same period.
Before I discuss the factors underlying another successful quarter for St. Jude Medical, I want to talk briefly about our proposed acquisition of  AGA Medical. As we announce on Monday, St. Jude Medical has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire AGA Medical for $20.80 per share in cash and stock in a total transaction valued at $1.3 billion. For those of you are unfamiliar with AGA Medical, the company generated total revenue in 2009 of $199 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year on a constant currency basis. AGA Medical has a leading share of the $250 million interventional cardiology market to repair congenital heart defects, as well as a full pipeline of products directed toward new growth drivers. 
We are especially excited to enter the market for  left atrial appendage closure in patients who suffer from atrial fibrillation. The AGA Medical left atrial appendage occluder already has a leading market share in Europe and has the potential to become a major new growth driver for St. Jude Medical over the next five years as part of our Atrial Fibrillation and our structural heart programs.
The AGA Medical acquisition also will add the St. Jude Medical structural heart program, a leading share of the emerging market in Europe to close a PFO or hole in the atrial septum encrypted genic stroke patients. The market for left atrial appendage closure and the market for PFO closure both have the opportunity to become new million-dollar markets following global market release of products and full development of relevant markets. The AGA acquisition also brings the St. Jude Medical a next-generation vascular plug technology that we expect to replace embolic coils to occlude peripheral blood vessel in a variety of interventional radiology procedures. This vascular plug technology will add both a new growth driver and critical mass to St. Jude Medical's vascular closure franchise in the intervention of radiology cath lab. We expect a strong complement between all of these new growth drivers in St. Jude Medical's existing cardiovascular programs. The transaction is expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share in 2011.
Last but not least, John Barr, the President and CEO of AGA Medical has agreed to join St. Jude Medical to add to our leadership talent and to help ensure a smooth integration of the acquisition. We look forward to welcoming John Barr in AGA's 550 employees to St. Jude Medical just as soon as the transaction is closed.
I would now like to ask John Heinmiller to conduct his normal review of our third quarter results, along with his typical update for the entire St. Jude Medical business. I will then address several topics about our overall program and open it up for your questions on the quarter and our acquisition of AGA Medical. Go ahead, John."

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,240,000,000, up approximately 7% over the $1,160,000,000 reported in the third quarter of last year. On a constant currency basis, third quarter sales increased 8% versus last year. Unfavorable foreign currency translations versus last year's third quarter reduced this quarter's sales by about $10 million. At the end of 2009, the federal research and development tax credit expired and Congress has not yet extended the credit for 2010. 
In this circumstance, GAAP requires us to estimate and record our effective income tax rate assuming that the R&D credit is not extended. For purposes of this conference call and our calculation of adjusted net earnings, however, we are assuming that the tax credit will be extended retroactively for 2010 as in past years.
As a result, comments referencing third quarter results and our guidance for 2010, including EPS amounts, are presented based on an effective income tax rate that contemplates the extension of the tax credit retroactive to January 1, 2010. To the extent that the federal research and development tax credit is not enacted, our effective income tax rate for 2010 would be higher than what is being presented during this call.
During the third quarter, we recorded after-tax charges of $11 million related primarily to closing and other costs associated with the acquisition of LightLab Imaging. And $12 million of in-process research and development expenses related to the acquisition of certain predevelopment technology assets. Any financial impact of the AGA Medical transaction, including the impact on shares outstanding, has been excluded from our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2010. We expect to complete the transaction during the fourth quarter. Comments during this call referencing third quarter EPS amounts and our guidance for fourth quarter EPS and 2010 full year earnings per share, therefore exclude any impact from the AGA Medical transaction.
Earnings per share were $0.72 for the third quarter of 2010, a 22% increase over EPS of $0.59 in the third quarter of 2009, and above our guidance range of $0.67 to $0.69. Before we discuss our third quarter 2000 sales result by product category, with guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010, let me comment on foreign currency. As discussed on prior calls, the two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. Given the fact that we establish our exchange rates at the beginning of each month, the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar, which has primarily occurred since mid-September, did not significantly impact our sales results in the third quarter. Currency translations for the third quarter were calculated at average exchange rates that fell within our assumed ranges used in July when we last provided guidance.
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010, we are now assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.34 to $1.39. And for the yen, each 80 to 85 yen will translate into U.S. $1.
Now for the sales by product category discussion. Total cardiac where the management sales, which includes revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines, were $738 million, up 7% from last year's third quarter, including $9 million of unfavorable currency translations. On a constant currency basis, third quarter CRM sales increased 8% versus last year. For the third quarter, ICD sales were $439 million, up 13% from last year's third quarter. On a constant currency basis, third quarter ICD sales increased 14% versus last year. U.S. ICD sales were $284 million, up 15% from last year's third quarter. International ICD sales were $155 million, representing a 10% increase over the third quarter of 2009, including $6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, ICD sales in our international business grew 14% in the third quarter.
For low-voltage devices, sales for the third quarter totaled $299 million, about the same as last year's third quarter, including $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $134 million, down slightly compared to last year's third quarter. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $165 million, equal to the third quarter of 2009. On a currency neutral basis, international pacemaker sales grew approximately 2% in the third quarter.
For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $730 million to $760 million. Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the third quarter totaled $169 million, up 8% over the third quarter of last year. On a constant currency basis, AF sales grew approximately 9% in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $165 million to $180 million.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the third quarter of 2010 were $240 million, up 4% over the third quarter of 2009 on both a reported and constant currency basis. Within this category of products, sales of vascular closure products in the third quarter of 2010 were $86 million and sales of heart valve products in the third quarter of 2010 were $78 million. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $240 million to $255 million.
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the third quarter of 2010 were $93 million, up 11% from the third quarter of 2009. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be in the range of $95 million to $105 million. Looking to revenue by geography, in total, 53% of St. Jude Medical sales in the third quarter of 2010 came from the United States, while 47% came from our international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales for the third quarter of 2010 is available in our press release.
The gross profit margin this quarter was 72.7%, representing a decline as expected compared with the third quarter of 2009 due to the impact of absorbing costs associated with remote monitoring and wireless telemetry capabilities in our pacemaker product line. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.2% to 73.8%. Our third quarter SG&A expenses were 34.3% of net sales, a 250 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, we now forecast SG&A as a percentage of net sales in the range of 34.3% to 34.8%.
R&D expenses in the third quarter of 2010 were 12.1% of net sales. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect R&D expense to be in the range of 12.0% to 12.6% of net sales as we continue to balance delivering short-term results with the right investments in long-term growth drivers. Net other expense was $11 million in the third quarter, and we anticipate the other expense category to be in the range of $12 million to $16 million in the fourth quarter.
For the third quarter, the company's effective income tax rate was 24.5%. For 2010, we continue to expect the tax rate to be in the range of 24.3% to 24.8%. As mentioned previously, these effective income tax rates contemplate the extension of the federal research and development tax credit in 2010, retroactive to the beginning of the year. We have also assumed the extension of the federal research and development tax credit in our EPS guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2010.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter of 2010, we had $852 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,988,000,000 in total debt and $1 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The debt on our balance sheet includes $1,661,000,000  of senior notes with maturities in 2013, 2014 and 2019, and $327 million in yen-based borrowings with maturities in 2017 and 2020. 
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our earnings per share outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2010. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the fourth quarter of 2010, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about $331 million to $333 million shares, with a weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2010 at $329 million to $331 million. Again, this assumption does not include any impact on shares outstanding resulting from the acquisition of AGA Medical. The company expects consolidated earnings per share for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.74. For the full year 2010, we now expect consolidated EPS to be in the range of $2.98 to $3, a $0.09 increase on the top end of the guidance from the full year 2010 guidance we gave during our July 2010 conference call. This updated expectation represents EPS growth of approximately 23% over the 2009 adjusted EPS of $2.43. I would now like to turn it back to Dan."
301667,111997088,80391,"St. Jude Medical Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","St. Jude Medical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Turning to our quarterly results and our confidence that we are well positioned for long-term growth at a superior rate, I would like to review several key factors underlying the success of our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM business. F",2039,"Thank you, John. Turning to our quarterly results and our confidence that we are well positioned for long-term growth at a superior rate, I would like to review several key factors underlying the success of our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM business. First, we are the only one company which has gained major ICD market share over the last six years, the significance of this is that we hold approximately a 29% share of the ICD market per de novo implants and only a 19% share of the ICD market for replacement devices. This implies a likely four-point gain in total ICD market share for St. Jude Medical over the next few years as we move through the natural replacement cycle for our products. Four points of market share translates into approximately 15% growth for St. Jude Medical's base business in ICD's before we factor in the benefit of additional gains in the de novo segment of the ICD market or the impact of any growth in the ICD market as a whole.
With respect to the de novo segment of the ICD market, we expect to continue gaining share of the strength of our unify and fortify lines of ICD. Our CorVue pulmonary edema monitoring technology, our Promote Quadra with quartet quadripolar lead CRT system, our DF4 simplified connector system, our 7 French high-voltage lead line, our ST segment monitoring technology and our Quickflex micro 4 French bipolar left heart leads to name just a few of our many advantages in CRM technology and products. 
The ICD business may not be a growth driver for our competitors as they lose market share, but we expect it to continue to be a growth driver for St. Jude Medical. This expectation is validated by our delivering 14% constant currency growth in global ICD revenue during the third quarter in the face of challenging market dynamics.
With respect to long-term growth of the global CRM market, last quarter, I reported that we expected the global CRM market to grow between 4% and 6% on a constant currency basis, taking into account differences in global geographies, the impact of new technologies, changes in model mix, pressure on ASPs, the impact of device replacement cycles and all other appropriate factors. The global CRM market grew slower than expected during the third quarter. We now expect the global CRM market to grow closer to 3% on a constant currency basis for full year 2010. To be conservative, we will assume that the global CRM market will continue to grow approximately 3% annually due to the impact of macroeconomic factors until we see evidence of market recovery. Keep in mind that with a 25% share of the global CRM market, St. Jude Medical is four times more sensitive to a one-point gain in market share than it is to a one-point change in rate of market growth. We are comfortable with the current rate of growth in the global CRM market in the context of our ability to continue gaining market share. We expect this market growth rate to recover longer-term due to the impact of new technology and the impact of faster growth in under penetrated international markets, but such market recovery will represent upside to our minimum growth holds.
Moving beyond CRM, our entire growth program remains robust at the level needed to meet or exceed the superior long-term growth expectations we announced at the beginning of this year. With respect to initiatives designed to optimize our cost structure, we opened our new manufacturing facility in Costa Rica ahead of schedule and already are shipping finished goods from this facility to our customers. Our new manufacturing facility in Malaysia is on track to come online toward the end of this year. We expect these two components of our cost optimization program alone to benefit our income statement by well over $100 million annually within the next few years.
With respect to our top line growth, we start by reminding investors that St. Jude Medical has a solid leadership position in two of the best growth opportunities in medical device technology, the broad electrophysiology space addressed by our Atrial Fibrillation or AF division and the chronic pain space addressed by the spinal cord stimulation technology of our Neuromodulation division. Each of these growth drivers has an elective component and a capital equipment component that are affected by macroeconomic pressures in the short term, but we continue to expect both of these markets to grow long-term at a double-digit rate due to their current level of under penetration and the ongoing accumulation of data that confirms both the clinical benefit and the cost effectiveness of AF and neuromodulation device therapies.
In spite of the strength of our AF and neuromodulation growth drivers, we indicated during our investor conference in February of this year, that our 2010 growth program includes significant focus and investment to accelerate sales growth longer term. I would like to summarize 14 initiatives that either had been completed or are underway to accelerate our sales growth.
First and foremost, we have restored competitive effectiveness to our U.S. CRM sales organization. This is testament to the leadership effectiveness of Mike Rousseau and the reorganized leadership team he put in place. We have now returned to gaining share CRM share in our U.S. business in the same way we continue to gain CRM share in our international business. 
Second, we are now entering for the first time the $500 million market prepared cardio stented tissue valves. We are rolling out full commercialize launch of Trifecta line of pericardial stented tissue valves in Europe, beginning this quarter. Early clinical response is favorable and consistent with our expectation that our Trifecta line of stented tissue valves can become a major new growth driver for our CVD business. We expect full launch of the Trifecta line in the United States to begin by the middle of 2011. 
Third, we are now entering the $500 million market for deep brain stimulation or DBS for patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. Beginning this quarter, we are rolling out full commercial launch in Europe of our Brio rechargeable deep brain stimulator, our Athena DBS clinician programmer and a complete line of proprietary leads and accessories. 
Brio is a rechargeable in constant currency system and is the smallest, lightest and longest lasting system on the market. We expect to support this launch with publication of favorable data from our U.S. pivotal clinic trial during the first half of 2011. We have only one competitor in this market and expect to gain meaningful market share in this new growing market.
Fourth, we have the leading position in the market for fractional flow reserve or FFR guided therapy for stenting patients with multivessel disease. Although this market is still small today at less than $200 million in size, we expect FFR measurement to become the standard of care in the future on the strength of data from the fame, Landmark Clinical Trial, the potential for positive data from the FAME II trial just getting underway, ongoing improvements to ease of use and our market development programs. 
Fifth, we have just begun to compete in the $500 million market for intravascular imaging technology through our acquisition of LightLab Imaging and our launch of the first and only optical coherence tomography or OCT product line on the market. We are in the process of integrating our OCT technology into our FFR hardware platform to facilitate growth of the FFR market, at the same time, we strengthened both the clinical and the economic benefit of our competitive position in intravascular imaging. We envision strong synergy between our programs to develop the market for OCT technology and our programs to develop the market for FFR technology. We expect both technologies to become meaningful new growth drivers for St. Jude Medical in the near to midterm.
Sixth, we are making good progress continuing to advance our transcatheter aortic valve implant or TAVI development program. During the third quarter, we announced that Dr. Gregory Fontana and Dr. Raj Makkar from Cedars-Sinai will service co-principal investigators for the pivotal trials covering both our transfemoral and our transapical TAVI systems. At the recent TCT meeting, Dr. Fontana presented data about these systems which supports our conviction that our TAVI program consist of next-generation technology that will be fully competitive at the time of market release. We continue expect to launch both our transfemoral and transapical TAVI systems in Europe by the first half of 2013.
Seventh, during the third quarter, we made an equity investment in CardioMEMS with an exclusive option to purchase the company at a later time. This investment positions us to leverage our CRM business and creates a major new growth driver within our heart failure franchise. Data presented at the TCT meeting from the CardioMEMS Champion trial showed a 38% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations during an average follow-up duration of 15 months for patients implanted with the CardioMEMS device. This technology has the potential to support a new billion-dollar growth opportunity, following global market release and full development of the market. The product line is scheduled for limited launch in Europe in 2011 and in the United States in 2012. St. Jude Medical now is positioned to become the clear leader in this new market.
Eighth, we recently announced approval of our Eon Mini line of spinal cord stimulators in Japan. We will begin launching our Eon Mini product line in Japan during the fourth quarter to create the conditions for meaningful sales contribution with this new growth driver in 2011 and beyond. The success of our Eon Mini product line in the United States and in Europe gives us confidence we can gain leadership in the spinal cord stimulation market in Japan. 
Ninth, we are in the process of completing our assessment of data from our U.S. pivotal trial for patients suffering from certain forms of migraine. We plan to announce the results of this clinical trial during the first half of 2011. We are not yet prepared to predict whether our results will meet FDA requirements for approval in the United States, but we expect to receive CE mark for migraine indication in Europe doing 2011. This puts us on track for our Migraine business in Europe to become a meaningful new growth driver for St. Jude Medical in 2012 and beyond.
Tenth, we are continuing to integrate our MediGuide technology with existing technologies in our AF business, our CRM business and our CVD business. Our first MediGuide enabled cath lab already is online in Europe. We are optimistic that over time, our MediGuide technology will be a key differentiator for multiple St. Jude Medical growth programs based on its ability to improve both the clinical effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of minimally invasive procedures in a wide variety of clinical settings. 
Additionally, once we closed the acquisition of AGA Medical, we announced earlier this week, we will add to St. Jude Medical's growth program a leading position in four new markets. The market for left atrial appendage closure, the market for PFO closure encrypted genic stroke patients, the market to modify abnormal peripheral vessels with vascular plugs instead of embolic coils in the market to repair congenital heart defects with an interventional cardiology procedure.
At this point, I have identified 14 areas of investment at St. Jude Medical, all of which are designed to accelerate our rate of sales growth. Many investors ask me routinely why I feel so confident about our business. The comments I just outlined are exactly why. Many of these investments will benefit our sales growth in 2011, all of these investments should benefit our sales growth in 2012 and beyond. All of these new sales growth programs are surrounded by our initiatives to optimize our cost structure and leverage the middle of our income statement. We look forward to providing added additional information about these and other new growth drivers during our next annual investor conference in February 2011.
With that, we have concluded our prepared remarks. John Heinmiller, Mike Rousseau, Eric Fain and I now all are ready to take your questions. Dennis, would you please moderate the questions."

But as I recall, we had the breakout, and everybody can do their own math, but as I recall, the breakout was about 15% growth in the AF business. In international markets it's about 1% of the AF business in the U.S. And so the growth rate was really impacted, I alluded to it in my prepared remarks that the AF business, during the third quarter and here in 2010 is impacted to the extent that procedures are somewhat elective and to the extent that the revenue includes a capital component. And with respect to the impact of the capital component of the revenue and the capital component itself is pretty small, but the capital component ends up impacting the associated sale of disposable devices as well with kind of the razor and razor blades. We sell fewer razor blades when we sell fewer razors. So the macroeconomic factors did impact market growth rate for the AF business in the third quarter. But we expect that impact to be transient. And we expect to continue long term. We expect to see the AF market on a global basis continue to grow in at a double-digit rate."

So that means our strategy is to fully fund an appropriate internal program that we're in control of our own destiny. And so that's option a, we have a good internal program. It is sufficient and we're very encouraged by all of the feedback we get from the KOLs that we've been working with on validating our sense that we have a best-in-class next-generation technology that can help us gain significant market share at the point where we launch it into the market. Having said that, with each one of our internal growth programs, we always are alert for the possibility of either accelerating, strengthening or even replacing our internal growth program with an acquisition. So we always are looking for evaluating whether an acquisition can help us with a key strategic initiative. That puts us in the perfect position where we don't have to do an acquisition. We could be very objective and rigorous in evaluating potential acquisitions. It makes it less likely that we're going to make a bad acquisition. And knowing that we don't have to do anything, but if all the parts fall in place, we certainly have the balance sheet capability to take advantage of all of the parts falling in place if that's what's happened. So we will go forward full steam and the timeline starts out being years out but the timeline is starting to come to near term now for getting to clinical space and getting pivotal trials underway. And we really can see our launch into the European market with two systems in the first half of 2013. And so we're good to go.

Besides that, I think you're right that we've got a product cycle disadvantage which sometimes around the winning side of the product cycle, sometimes we're not. I think we have a product cycle disadvantage here temporarily. And then the product cycle impact is, I think, is exacerbated by the fact that we're still operating under a warning letter from FDA, and that has an impact on new product approvals. And we really don't have the same product line here in the United States currently that we have on the market in Europe. So I think when you see the European growth rate continuing right where we would like to see it at about 15% that product line has come to the U.S. in just a matter of time to get it here."

Well, so there's a lot to it and I'm going to struggle a little bit, Derrick, to give you a crisp answer. There is clearly an ASP element to our revised view of the CRM market growth. But there clearly is on the one hand. On the other hand, I would",970,"Okay. Well, so there's a lot to it and I'm going to struggle a little bit, Derrick, to give you a crisp answer. There is clearly an ASP element to our revised view of the CRM market growth. But there clearly is on the one hand. On the other hand, I would not overstate that. And a data point I would give you is that in our third quarter, our U.S. ICD sales system ASPs were actually a little bit stronger again in the third quarter of 2010 than they were in the third quarter one year ago. So it'd be very surprising to folks I'm sure in counterintuitive but true. So if you took that as one data point and it would be, that would add some balance to what's the impact of ASP pressures. So we are seeing increased pressure on ASPs. We are seeing competitors be more aggressive on price. We are seeing ASP drops in the market. We've seen more of it internationally. We've seen more of it on the low-voltage side, offset by our U.S. ICD sales in our own product line, benefiting from new technology premiums and from our particular mix versus the mix of competitors. But ASP pressure is an element of it. Another big element of it is just that Medtronic came out with CRM number. And in their last reported quarter, that was lower than any of us expected it to be. So when we factor that into what's that due to market growth, we just have to be realistic that based on everybody's reported numbers, the market's growing slower than we had previously modeled. And we can imagine reasons for that in somebody else's business. But the prudent thing for us to do is to say, the numbers are as they are. The total growth is a little bit slower than we estimated and expected one quarter ago, and now what do we say going forward. And we think it's prudent to say, going forward, let's assume that the status quo remains as it is and that the market grows a little bit slower. We can make the case for why the market ought to grow, ought to continue to grow longer-term constant currency, 4% to 6%. We especially would look to -- and when we think about that, the kinds of things that I've especially point to that people can miss. The first would be a we're always talking constant currency and others sometimes you're talking as reported and depending on the currency trend, that does make a difference. So we're always talking constant currency, number one. The other thing is not everybody takes into account the impact on market growth about of about trying to. Some of the market models we see are only taken account the results of the big three and those analysis are going to underestimate market growth when the other two companies between the two of them are taking share as they did in 2008, 2009 and in the first half of 2010. So that would be another potential, that's other component that can lead to different market models producing different results. Another very significant component here in our market model outlook is the impact of new technology. And so others cannot adequately factor in the impact of our new technology without having a complete insight into where our new product flow is over the next few years, which we don't tell people. But you can start to get a glimpse of how real the impact of new technology is in our product line alone. And so if you think about the pulmonary wedge pressure technology, think about direct left atrial pressure technology, you look at our CardioMEMS transaction, you look at our LAP technology, look at our ST segment monitoring technology, just to name a few. These are the kinds of things that can reset a premium ASP that is well justified by clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness in the same way that CRT systems reset the ASP for ICDs and in the same way that ICDs reset the premium ASPs for pacemakers as pacemakers came to have the additional technology of a high-voltage shock in them. So new technology is a particular component of long-term market model growth that has a big impact, that different people will see different ways depending on their level of insight into the flow of new leading technologies that we have in our pipelines. Another thing that I would add, point to just here on the longer-term market growth is the impact of markets like China and other significant emerging markets. So we've mentioned this before, and I think others will validate our data that in 2009, there are fewer than 2000 ICDs in plant in all of -- and for the full year in all of China. And if you kind of look at that as a disconnect between indications and disconnect between that and the state of the economy in China and the size of the growing middle class in China and a disconnect between that level of penetration in the market and the amount of investment that the Chinese government has committed to raising the bar on healthcare in China here over the next number of years, we're going to get a lot of growth out of international markets. And those who are kind of U.S. centric are going to underestimate long-term CRM market growth if they aren't close enough to these major new international markets, so those are all the things. But more than anything, it's just Medtronic came out with a moderate a bad number and we don't know what they're going to come out with here in the next quarter and for the time being, we'll just bring our expectations down."

So this is not a precedent where next quarter, people might ask what's our mix on a particular product line and expect an answer. We generally don't describe product line mix inside the sales categories that we report. However, this Unify and Fortify is extraordinary. In the third quarter, we exited the third quarter with more than, in the United States, with more than 90% of our mix of ICDs consisting of Unify and Fortify. So in the same way that I mentioned that after one month, we had an absolutely unprecedented percent of sales in that new technology. After one quarter we continued, we've set a new standard of uptake of new technology. So it's absolutely a winning product line and strong component of our ASP strength, strong component of our market share growth. And it's going to be a great platform for us going forward for the next couple of years. With respect to AGA integration at a high level, at a high level, it would be appropriate to think of AGA as a bolt-on to our cardio vascular division. You might find that implied by John Barr agreeing to continue to serve as President and CEO of the AGA business unit here within St. Jude Medical. We have tremendous respect for the momentum, the breadth, the quality systems, the R&D productiveness, the manufacturing operations, and to the extent that anybody from AGA is listening and I didn't mention their function, it was not intended to be. But my point is that we think very highly of the AGA team and the condition of their operations. We're happy to stand behind those operations and have the St. Jude Medical name on them. And the highest priority for us in this integration strategy is to make sure that we do not ruin a good thing in any way at all. So we will be deliberate in looking for synergies. We know we can capture some good revenue synergies with the global distribution capabilities and footprint and product lines that we have. We know we can capture great synergies with the left atrial appendage occlusion technology, and our access with electrophysiologist. But on the cost side, we think very highly of the gross margin that AGA has been able to support on a sustainable basis. And there's a lot to like, and so think of it as a bolt-on."

We're going to be slow, deliberate, ramping up as the management team, as the infrastructure has gains the experience and has the credibility and have the track record to continue to go more in the next year and more in the next year.

I really don't want to offer that just from a purely competitive perspective. But what I could say is, generally speaking, the starting point would be to the extent that competitors are bundling in a way that's different from what we're doing, I think the starting point would be to say and how's it working for them. So if they're bundling and losing share in their reported results, and we're not and we're gaining share in our reported results, that's a better answer for you than any kind of soft information that I could provide to you. And I would say that customers are awfully smart. And they're not interested in less than their desired products. And so if the competitors, if all players in the space have commodity devices, then it's going to be price that's going to carry the day. But that's not the case and we don't expect to see that to be the case in our major markets. So technology differences have an impact not only on the cost effectiveness but on the clinical effectiveness. And clearly, there are technology differences in all of our major programs, the quality and capabilities of the field organizations to experience levels and stability of the field organizations are major factors. There's a lot and I'm just going to bite my tongue and not say that I might say with a full head of steam to contrast our excellence versus the presentation of competitors.

We've seen plenty of companies over the years, do dumb dilutive deals and we take some pride in being able to say that we haven't done one and you won't see one on our collective leadership and Board watch. The AGA acquisition, in contrast, is an accretive deal. In the first year, without synergies, it's accretive to the net adjusted earnings, if you exclude the inventory write-up due to acquisition accounting of the inventory, and so that's a baseline right there. We like accretive deals. And then the idea that we can find appropriate synergies, we like that. And then if you add to it that we have four new growth drivers already on the market in Europe, we like that. We're very interested in adding, accelerating the rate of sales growth and doing it with business that we understand. And so all of the new growth drivers of AGA that we look forward to bringing into our own program are technology and ghost drivers and customer cold points that we're already involved in. So you start checking these boxes and this is just a compelling acquisition for us. But none of it was an orientation of let's do a little deal, let's do a midsize deal or let's do a big deal."

Welcome to the St. Jude Medical Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call today are John Heinmiller, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Rousseau, Group President; Eric Fain, President of our Cardiac Rhythm Management Division; and Angie Craig, Vice President of Corporate Relations and Human Resources. 
Our third quarter results reinforced our conviction that our growth program is on track and that St. Jude Medical is well positioned to continue growing long term at a superior rate. We now have raised our 2010 EPS guidance range for the third time in three quarters and beaten consensus expectations for EPS by a combined total of $0.17 earnings per share over the same period.
Before I discuss the factors underlying another successful quarter for St. Jude Medical, I want to talk briefly about our proposed acquisition of  AGA Medical. As we announced on Monday, St. Jude Medical has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire AGA Medical for $20.80 per share in cash and stock in a total transaction valued at $1.3 billion. For those of you who are unfamiliar with AGA Medical, the company generated total revenue in 2009 of $199 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year on a constant currency basis. AGA Medical has a leading share of the $250 million interventional cardiology market to repair congenital heart defects, as well as a full pipeline of products directed toward new growth drivers. 
We are especially excited to enter the market for left atrial appendage closure in patients who suffer from atrial fibrillation. The AGA Medical left atrial appendage occluder already has a leading market share in Europe and has the potential to become a major new growth driver for St. Jude Medical over the next five years as part of our Atrial Fibrillation and our structural heart programs.
The AGA Medical acquisition also will add to St. Jude Medical structural heart program, a leading share of the emerging market in Europe to close a PFO or hole in the atrial septum encrypted genic stroke patients. The market for left atrial appendage closure and the market for PFO closure both have the opportunity to become new billion-dollar markets following global market release of products and full development of relevant markets. The AGA acquisition also brings to St. Jude Medical a next-generation vascular plug technology that we expect to replace embolic coils to occlude peripheral blood vessels in a variety of interventional radiology procedures. This vascular plug technology will add both a new growth driver and critical mass to St. Jude Medical's vascular closure franchise in the interventional radiology cath lab. We expect a strong complement between all of these new growth drivers in St. Jude Medical's existing cardiovascular programs. The transaction is expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share in 2011.
Last but not least, John Barr, the President and CEO of AGA Medical has agreed to join St. Jude Medical to add to our leadership talent and to help ensure a smooth integration of the acquisition. We look forward to welcoming John Barr and AGA's 550 employees to St. Jude Medical just as soon as the transaction is closed.
I would now like to ask John Heinmiller to conduct his normal review of our third quarter results, along with his typical update for the entire St. Jude Medical business. I will then address several topics about our overall program and open it up for your questions on the quarter and our acquisition of AGA Medical. Go ahead, John."

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,240,000,000, up approximately 7% over the $1,160,000,000 reported in the third quarter of last year. On a constant currency basis, third quarter sales increased 8% versus last year. Unfavorable foreign currency translations versus last year's third quarter reduced this quarter's sales by about $10 million. At the end of 2009, the federal research and development tax credit expired and Congress has not yet extended the credit for 2010. 
In this circumstance, GAAP requires us to estimate and record our effective income tax rate assuming that the R&D credit is not extended. For purposes of this conference call and our calculation of adjusted net earnings, however, we are assuming that the tax credit will be extended retroactively for 2010 as in past years.
As a result, comments referencing third quarter results and our guidance for 2010, including EPS amounts, are presented based on an effective income tax rate that contemplates the extension of the tax credit retroactive to January 1, 2010. To the extent that the federal research and development tax credit is not enacted, our effective income tax rate for 2010 would be higher than what is being presented during this call.
During the third quarter, we recorded after-tax charges of $11 million related primarily to closing and other costs associated with the acquisition of LightLab Imaging. And $12 million of in-process research and development expenses related to the acquisition of certain predevelopment technology assets. Any financial impact of the AGA Medical transaction, including the impact on shares outstanding, has been excluded from our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2010. We expect to complete the transaction during the fourth quarter. Comments during this call referencing third quarter EPS amounts and our guidance for fourth quarter EPS and 2010 full year earnings per share, therefore exclude any impact from the AGA Medical transaction.
Earnings per share were $0.72 for the third quarter of 2010, a 22% increase over EPS of $0.59 in the third quarter of 2009, and above our guidance range of $0.67 to $0.69. Before we discuss our third quarter 2000 sales result by product category, with guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010, let me comment on foreign currency. As discussed on prior calls, the two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. Given the fact that we establish our exchange rates at the beginning of each month, the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar, which has primarily occurred since mid-September, did not significantly impact our sales results in the third quarter. Currency translations for the third quarter were calculated at average exchange rates that fell within our assumed ranges used in July when we last provided guidance.
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010, we are now assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.34 to $1.39. And for the yen, each 80 to 85 yen will translate into U.S. $1.
Now for the sales by product category discussion. Total cardiac rhythm management sales, which includes revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines, were $738 million, up 7% from last year's third quarter, including $9 million of unfavorable currency translations. On a constant currency basis, third quarter CRM sales increased 8% versus last year. For the third quarter, ICD sales were $439 million, up 13% from last year's third quarter. On a constant currency basis, third quarter ICD sales increased 14% versus last year. U.S. ICD sales were $284 million, up 15% from last year's third quarter. International ICD sales were $155 million, representing a 10% increase over the third quarter of 2009, including $6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, ICD sales in our international business grew 14% in the third quarter.
For low-voltage devices, sales for the third quarter totaled $299 million, about the same as last year's third quarter, including $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $134 million, down slightly compared to last year's third quarter. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $165 million, equal to the third quarter of 2009. On a currency neutral basis, international pacemaker sales grew approximately 2% in the third quarter.
For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $730 million to $760 million. Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the third quarter totaled $169 million, up 8% over the third quarter of last year. On a constant currency basis, AF sales grew approximately 9% in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $165 million to $180 million.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the third quarter of 2010 were $240 million, up 4% over the third quarter of 2009 on both a reported and constant currency basis. Within this category of products, sales of vascular closure products in the third quarter of 2010 were $86 million and sales of heart valve products in the third quarter of 2010 were $78 million. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $240 million to $255 million.
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the third quarter of 2010 were $93 million, up 11% from the third quarter of 2009. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be in the range of $95 million to $105 million. Looking to revenue by geography, in total, 53% of St. Jude Medical sales in the third quarter of 2010 came from the United States, while 47% came from our international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales for the third quarter of 2010 is available in our press release.
The gross profit margin this quarter was 72.7%, representing a decline as expected compared with the third quarter of 2009 due to the impact of absorbing costs associated with remote monitoring and wireless telemetry capabilities in our pacemaker product line. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.2% to 73.8%. Our third quarter SG&A expenses were 34.3% of net sales, a 250 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, we now forecast SG&A as a percentage of net sales in the range of 34.3% to 34.8%.
R&D expenses in the third quarter of 2010 were 12.1% of net sales. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect R&D expense to be in the range of 12.0% to 12.6% of net sales as we continue to balance delivering short-term results with the right investments in long-term growth drivers. Net other expense was $11 million in the third quarter, and we anticipate the other expense category to be in the range of $12 million to $16 million in the fourth quarter.
For the third quarter, the company's effective income tax rate was 24.5%. For 2010, we continue to expect the tax rate to be in the range of 24.3% to 24.8%. As mentioned previously, these effective income tax rates contemplate the extension of the federal research and development tax credit in 2010, retroactive to the beginning of the year. We have also assumed the extension of the federal research and development tax credit in our EPS guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2010.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter of 2010, we had $852 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,988,000,000 in total debt and $1 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The debt on our balance sheet includes $1,661,000,000 of senior notes with maturities in 2013, 2014 and 2019, and $327 million in yen-based borrowings with maturities in 2017 and 2020. 
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our earnings per share outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2010. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the fourth quarter of 2010, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 331 million to 333 million shares, with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2010 at 329 million to 331 million. Again, this assumption does not include any impact on shares outstanding resulting from the acquisition of AGA Medical. The company expects consolidated earnings per share for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.74. For the full year 2010, we now expect consolidated EPS to be in the range of $2.98 to $3, a $0.09 increase on the top end of the guidance from the full year 2010 guidance we gave during our July 2010 conference call. This updated expectation represents EPS growth of approximately 23% over the 2009 adjusted EPS of $2.43. I would now like to turn it back to Dan."
301667,111997088,80443,"St. Jude Medical Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","St. Jude Medical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Turning to our quarterly results and our confidence that we are well positioned for long-term growth at a superior rate, I would like to review several key factors underlying the success of our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM business. F",2040,"Thank you, John. Turning to our quarterly results and our confidence that we are well positioned for long-term growth at a superior rate, I would like to review several key factors underlying the success of our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM business. First, we are the only one company which has gained major ICD market share over the last six years, the significance of this is that we hold approximately a 29% share of the ICD market per de novo implants and only a 19% share of the ICD market for replacement devices. This implies a likely four-point gain in total ICD market share for St. Jude Medical over the next few years as we move through the natural replacement cycle for our products. Four points of market share translates into approximately 15% growth for St. Jude Medical's base business in ICDs before we factor in the benefit of additional gains in the de novo segment of the ICD market or the impact of any growth in the ICD market as a whole.
With respect to the de novo segment of the ICD market, we expect to continue gaining share on the strength of our unify and fortify lines of ICDs. Our CorVue pulmonary edema monitoring technology, our Promote Quadra with quartet quadripolar lead CRT system, our DF4 simplified connector system, our 7 French high-voltage lead line, our ST segment monitoring technology and our Quickflex micro 4 French bipolar left heart leads to name just a few of our many advantages in CRM technology and products. 
The ICD business may not be a growth driver for our competitors as they lose market share, but we expect it to continue to be a growth driver for St. Jude Medical. This expectation is validated by our delivering 14% constant currency growth in global ICD revenue during the third quarter in the face of challenging market dynamics.
With respect to long-term growth of the global CRM market, last quarter, I reported that we expected the global CRM market to grow between 4% and 6% on a constant currency basis, taking into account differences in global geographies, the impact of new technologies, changes in model mix, pressure on ASPs, the impact of device replacement cycles and all other appropriate factors. The global CRM market grew slower than expected during the third quarter. We now expect the global CRM market to grow closer to 3% on a constant currency basis for full year 2010. To be conservative, we will assume that the global CRM market will continue to grow approximately 3% annually due to the impact of macroeconomic factors until we see evidence of market recovery. Keep in mind that with a 25% share of the global CRM market, St. Jude Medical is four times more sensitive to a one-point gain in market share than it is to a one-point change in rate of market growth. We are comfortable with the current rate of growth in the global CRM market in the context of our ability to continue gaining market share. We expect this market growth rate to recover longer-term due to the impact of new technology and the impact of faster growth in under penetrated international markets, but such market recovery will represent upside to our minimum growth goals.
Moving beyond CRM, our entire growth program remains robust at the level needed to meet or exceed the superior long-term growth expectations we announced at the beginning of this year. With respect to initiatives designed to optimize our cost structure, we opened our new manufacturing facility in Costa Rica ahead of schedule and already are shipping finished goods from this facility to our customers. Our new manufacturing facility in Malaysia is on track to come online toward the end of this year. We expect these two components of our cost optimization program alone to benefit our income statement by well over $100 million annually within the next few years.
With respect to our top line growth, we start by reminding investors that St. Jude Medical has a solid leadership position in two of the best growth opportunities in medical device technology, the broad electrophysiology space addressed by our Atrial Fibrillation or AF division and the chronic pain space addressed by the spinal cord stimulation technology of our Neuromodulation division. Each of these growth drivers has an elective component and a capital equipment component that are affected by macroeconomic pressures in the short term, but we continue to expect both of these markets to grow long-term at a double-digit rate due to their current level of under penetration and the ongoing accumulation of data that confirms both the clinical benefit and the cost effectiveness of AF and neuromodulation device therapies.
In spite of the strength of our AF and neuromodulation growth drivers, we indicated during our investor conference in February of this year, that our 2010 growth program includes significant focus and investment to accelerate sales growth longer term. I would like to summarize 14 initiatives that either have been completed or are underway to accelerate our sales growth.
First and foremost, we have restored competitive effectiveness to our U.S. CRM sales organization. This is testament to the leadership effectiveness of Mike Rousse and the reorganized leadership team he put in place. We have now returned to gaining CRM share in our U.S. business in the same way we continue to gain CRM share in our international business. 
Second, we are now entering for the first time the $500 million market prepared cardio stented tissue valves. We are rolling out full commercialize launch of our Trifecta line of pericardial stented tissue valves in Europe, beginning this quarter. Early clinical response is favorable and consistent with our expectation that our Trifecta line of stented tissue valves can become a major new growth driver for our CVD business. We expect full launch of the Trifecta line in the United States to begin by the middle of 2011. 
Third, we are now entering the $500 million market for deep brain stimulation or DBS for patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. Beginning this quarter, we are rolling out full commercial launch in Europe of our Brio rechargeable deep brain stimulator, our Athena DBS clinician programmer and a complete line of proprietary leads and accessories. 
Brio is a rechargeable and constant currency system and is the smallest, lightest and longest lasting system on the market. We expect to support this launch with publication of favorable data from our U.S. pivotal clinic trial during the first half of 2011. We have only one competitor in this market and expect to gain meaningful market share in this new growing market.
Fourth, we have the leading position in the market for fractional flow reserve or FFR guided therapy for stenting patients with multivessel disease. Although this market is still small today at less than $200 million in size, we expect FFR measurement to become the standard of care in the future on the strength of data from the FAME landmark clinical trial, the potential for positive data from the FAME II trial just getting underway, ongoing improvements to ease of use and our market development programs. 
Fifth, we have just begun to compete in the $500 million market for intravascular imaging technology through our acquisition of LightLab Imaging and our launch of the first and only optical coherence tomography or OCT product line on the market. We are in the process of integrating our OCT technology into our FFR hardware platform to facilitate growth of the FFR market, at the same time we strengthen both the clinical and the economic benefit of our competitive position in intravascular imaging. We envision strong synergy between our programs to develop the market for OCT technology and our programs to develop the market for FFR technology. We expect both technologies to become meaningful new growth drivers for St. Jude Medical in the near to midterm.
Sixth, we are making good progress continuing to advance our transcatheter aortic valve implant or TAVI development program. During the third quarter, we announced that Dr. Gregory Fontana and Dr. Raj Makkar from Cedars-Sinai will serve as co-principal investigators for the pivotal trials covering both our transfemoral and our transapical TAVI systems. At the recent TCT meeting, Dr. Fontana presented data about these systems which supports our conviction that our TAVI program consist of next-generation technology that will be fully competitive at the time of market release. We continue to expect to launch both our transfemoral and transapical TAVI systems in Europe by the first half of 2013.
Seventh, during the third quarter, we made an equity investment in CardioMEMS with an exclusive option to purchase the company at a later time. This investment positions us to leverage our CRM business and creates a major new growth driver within our heart failure franchise. Data presented at the TCT meeting from the CardioMEMS Champion trial showed a 38% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations during an average follow-up duration of 15 months for patients implanted with a CardioMEMS device. This technology has the potential to support a new billion-dollar growth opportunity, following global market release and full development of the market. The product line is scheduled for limited launch in Europe in 2011 and in the United States in 2012. St. Jude Medical now is positioned to become the clear leader in this new market.
Eighth, we recently announced approval of our Eon Mini line of spinal cord stimulators in Japan. We will begin launching our Eon Mini product line in Japan during the fourth quarter to create the conditions for meaningful sales contribution with this new growth driver in 2011 and beyond. The success of our Eon Mini product line in the United States and in Europe gives us confidence we can gain leadership in the spinal cord stimulation market in Japan. 
Ninth, we are in the process of completing our assessment of data from our U.S. pivotal trial for patients suffering from certain forms of migraine. We plan to announce the results of this clinical trial during the first half of 2011. We are not yet prepared to predict whether our results will meet FDA requirements for approval in the United States, but we expect to receive CE mark for migraine indication in Europe during 2011. This puts us on track for our Migraine business in Europe to become a meaningful new growth driver for St. Jude Medical in 2012 and beyond.
Tenth, we are continuing to integrate our MediGuide technology with existing technologies in our AF business, our CRM business and our CVD business. Our first MediGuide enabled cath lab already is online in Europe. We are optimistic that over time, our MediGuide technology will be a key differentiator for multiple St. Jude Medical growth programs based on its ability to improve both the clinical effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of minimally invasive procedures in a wide variety of clinical settings. 
Additionally, once we close the acquisition of AGA Medical, we announced earlier this week, we will add to St. Jude Medical's growth program a leading position in four new markets. The market for left atrial appendage closure, the market for PFO closure encrypted genic stroke patients, the market to modify abnormal peripheral vessels with vascular plugs instead of embolic coils and the market to repair congenital heart defects with an interventional cardiology procedure.
At this point, I have identified 14 areas of investment at St. Jude Medical, all of which are designed to accelerate our rate of sales growth. Many investors ask me routinely why I feel so confident about our business. The comments I just outlined are exactly why. Many of these investments will benefit our sales growth in 2011, all of these investments should benefit our sales growth in 2012 and beyond. All of these new sales growth programs are surrounded by our initiatives to optimize our cost structure and leverage the middle of our income statement. We look forward to providing additional information about these and other new growth drivers during our next annual investor conference in February 2011.
With that, we have concluded our prepared remarks. John Heinmiller, Mike Rousse, Eric Fain and I now all are ready to take your questions. Dennis, would you please moderate the questions."

But as I recall, we had the breakout, and everybody can do their own math, but as I recall, the breakout was about 15% growth in the AF business in international markets and about 1% growth of the AF business in the U.S. And so the growth rate was really impacted, I alluded to it in my prepared remarks that the AF business, during the third quarter and here in 2010 is impacted to the extent that procedures are somewhat elective and to the extent that the revenue includes a capital component. And with respect to the impact of the capital component of the revenue and the capital component itself is pretty small, but the capital component ends up impacting the associated sale of disposable devices as well with kind of the razor and razor blades. We sell fewer razor blades when we sell fewer razors. So the macroeconomic factors did impact market growth rate for the AF business in the third quarter. But we expect that impact to be transient. And we expect to continue long term. We expect to see the AF market on a global basis continue to grow at a double-digit rate."

So absolutely, that was a good data based comment. With respect to the U.S. opportunity for an indication for migraine, I would urge you and everyone else to continue to model nothing for St. Jude Medical revenue for a U.S. migraine indication.

Having said that, with each one of our internal growth programs, we always are alert to the possibility of either accelerating, strengthening or even replacing our internal growth program with an acquisition. So we always are looking for evaluating whether an acquisition can help us with a key strategic initiative. That puts us in the perfect position where we don't have to do an acquisition. We can be very objective and rigorous in evaluating potential acquisitions. It makes it less likely that we're going to make a bad acquisition. And knowing that we don't have to do anything, but if all the parts fall in place, we certainly have the balance sheet capability to take advantage of all of the parts falling in place if that's what's happened. So we will go forward full steam and the timeline starts out being years out but the timeline is starting to come to near term now for getting to clinical phase and getting pivotal trials underway. And we really can see our launch into the European market with two systems in the first half of 2013. And so we're good to go. Though if somebody has something better that's cost effective, we wouldn't hesitate to take advantage of it."

But without a timeline, absolutely expect the AF to return to double digit. I think that here in the third quarter, besides macroeconomics, that again, timeline is debatable. But the extent of the macro factors on the market growth in elective procedures and in the capital equipment component are clearly real and also transient. Besides that, I think you're right that we've got a product cycle disadvantage which sometimes we're on the winning side of the product cycle, sometimes we're not. I think we have a product cycle disadvantage here temporarily. And then the product cycle impact, I think, is exacerbated by the fact that we're still operating under a warning letter from FDA, and that has an impact on new product approvals. And we really don't have the same product line here in the United States currently that we have on the market in Europe. So I think when you see the European growth rate continuing right where we would like to see it at about 15% that product line it's coming to the U.S. and it's just a matter of time to get it here."

There is clearly an ASP element to our revised view of the CRM market growth. But there clearly is on the one hand. On the other hand, I would not overstate that. And a data point I would give you is that in our third quarter, our U.S. ICD sales system ASPs were actually a little bit stronger again in the third quarter of 2010 than they were in the third quarter one year ago. So it'd be very surprising to folks I'm sure and counterintuitive but true. So if you took that as one data point and it would be, that would add some balance to what's the impact of ASP pressures. So we are seeing increased pressure on ASPs. We are seeing competitors be more aggressive on price. We are seeing ASP drops in the market. We've seen more of it internationally. We've seen more of it on the low-voltage side, offset by our U.S. ICD sales in our own product line, benefiting from new technology premiums and from our particular mix versus the mix of competitors. But ASP pressure is an element of it. Another big element of it is just that Medtronic came out with CRM number. And in their last reported quarter, that was lower than any of us expected it to be. So when we factor that into what's that do to market growth, we just have to be realistic that based on everybody's reported numbers, the market's growing slower than we had previously modeled. And we can imagine reasons for that in somebody else's business. But the prudent thing for us to do is to say, the numbers are as they are. The total growth is a little bit slower than we estimated and expected one quarter ago, and now what do we say going forward. And we think it's prudent to say, going forward, let's assume that the status quo remains as it is and that the market grows a little bit slower. We can make the case for why the market ought to grow, ought to continue to grow longer-term constant currency, 4% to 6%. We especially would look to -- and when we think about that, the kinds of things that I've especially point to that people can miss. The first would be we're always talking constant currency and others sometimes are talking as reported and depending on the currency trend, that does make a difference. So we're always talking constant currency, number one. The other thing is not everybody takes into account the impact on market growth of about trying to [indiscernible](1:46:36).  Some of the market models we see are only -- take into account the results of the big three and those analyses are going to underestimate market growth when the other two companies between the two of them are taking share as they did in 2008, 2009 and in the first half of 2010. So that would be another potential, that's another component that can lead to different market models producing different results. Another very significant component here in our market model outlook is the impact of new technology. And so others cannot adequately factor in the impact of our new technology without having a complete insight into what our new product flow is over the next few years, which we don't tell people. But you can start to get a glimpse of how real the impact of new technology is in our product line alone. And so if you think about the pulmonary wedge pressure technology, think about direct left atrial pressure technology, you look at our CardioMEMS transaction, you look at our LAP technology, look at our ST segment monitoring technology, just to name a few. These are the kinds of things that can reset a premium ASP that is well justified by clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness in the same way that CRT systems reset the ASP for ICDs and in the same way that ICDs reset the premium ASPs for pacemakers as pacemakers came to have the additional technology of the high-voltage shock in them. So new technology is a particular component of long-term market model growth that has a big impact, that different people will see different ways depending on their level of insight into the flow of new leading technologies that we have in our pipelines. Another thing that I would add, point to just here on the longer-term market growth is the impact of markets like China and other significant emerging markets. So we've mentioned this before, and I think others will validate our data that in 2009, there are fewer than 2000 ICDs implanted in all of -- and for the full year in all of China. And if you kind of look at that as a disconnect between indications and disconnect between that and the state of the economy in China and the size of the growing middle class in China and a disconnect between that level of penetration in the market and the amount of investment that the Chinese government has committed to raising the bar on healthcare in China here over the next number of years, we're going to get a lot of growth out of international markets. And those who are kind of U.S. centric are going to underestimate long-term CRM market growth if they aren't close enough to these major new international markets, so those are all the things. But more than anything, it's just Medtronic came out with a bad number and we don't know what they're going to come out with here in the next quarter and for the time being, we'll just bring our expectations down."

So this is not a precedent where next quarter, people might ask what's our mix on a particular product line and expect an answer. We generally don't describe product line mix inside the sales categories that we report. However, this Unify and Fortify is extraordinary. In the third quarter, we exited the third quarter with more than, in the United States, with more than 90% of our mix of ICDs consisting of Unify and Fortify. So in the same way that I mentioned that after one month, we had an absolutely unprecedented percent of sales in that new technology. After one quarter we continued, we set a new standard of uptake of new technology. So it's absolutely a winning product line and strong component of our ASP strength, strong component of our market share growth. And it's going to be a great platform for us going forward for the next couple of years. With respect to AGA integration at a high level, at a high level, it would be appropriate to think of AGA as a bolt-on to our cardio vascular division. You might find that implied by John Barr agreeing to continue to serve as President and CEO of the AGA business unit here within St. Jude Medical. We have tremendous respect for the momentum, the breadth, the quality systems, the R&D productiveness, the manufacturing operations, and to the extent that anybody from AGA is listening and I didn't mention their function, it was not intended to be a slight. But my point is that we think very highly of the AGA team and of the condition of their operations. We're happy to stand behind those operations and have the St. Jude Medical name on them. And the highest priority for us in this integration strategy is to make sure that we do not ruin a good thing in any way at all. So we will be deliberate in looking for synergies. We know we can capture some good revenue synergies with the global distribution capabilities and footprint and product lines that we have. We know we can capture great synergies with the left atrial appendage occlusion technology, and our access with electrophysiologist. But on the cost side, we think very highly of the gross margin that AGA has been able to support on a sustainable basis. And there's a lot to like, and so think of it as a bolt-on."

And over time, how you see that playing out as they potentially get more aggressive on the contracting strategy? How you continue to maintain the trajectory that you've established so far?"

I don't want to answer it directly from a competitive perspective, from a purely competitive perspective. I don't really want to indicate to competitors that might be listening to the call or reading the transcript, of how we're doing versus their initiatives and how was it that we're beating them and what do we think is going to happen next. I really don't want to offer that just from a purely competitive perspective. But what I could say is, generally speaking, the starting point would be to the extent that competitors are bundling in a way that's different from what we're doing, I think the starting point would be to say and how's it working for them. So if they're bundling and losing share in their reported results, and we're not and we're gaining share in our reported results, that's a better answer for you than any kind of soft information that I could provide to you. And I would say that customers are awfully smart. And they're not interested in less than their desired products. And so if the competitors, if all players in the space have commodity devices, then it's going to be price that's going to carry the day. But that's not the case and we don't expect to see that to be the case in our major markets. So technology differences have an impact not only on the cost effectiveness but on the clinical effectiveness. And clearly, there are technology differences in all of our major programs, the quality and capabilities of the field organizations, the experience levels and stability of the field organizations are major factors. There's a lot and I'm just going to bite my tongue and not say that I might say with a full head of steam to contrast our excellence versus the presentation of competitors. So I'm sorry, I'm not going to be more precise for you."

Let's not do that. We've seen plenty of companies over the years, do dumb dilutive deals and we take some pride in being able to say that we haven't done one and you won't see one on our collective leadership and Board watch. The AGA acquisition, in contrast, is an accretive deal. In the first year, without synergies, it's accretive to the net adjusted earnings, if you exclude the inventory write-up due to acquisition accounting of the inventory, and so that's a baseline right there. We like accretive deals. And then the idea that we can find appropriate synergies, we like that. And then if you add to it that we have four new growth drivers already on the market in Europe, we like that. We're very interested in adding, accelerating the rate of sales growth and doing it with business that we understand. And so all of the new growth drivers of AGA that we look forward to bringing into our own program are technology and growth drivers and customer call points that we're already involved in. So you start checking these boxes and this is just a compelling acquisition for us. But none of it was with an orientation of let's do a little deal, let's do a midsize deal or let's do a big deal."

Welcome to the St. Jude Medical third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. With me on the call today are John Heinmiller, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Rousseau, Group President, Eric Fain, President of our Cardiac Rhythm Management Division and Angie Craig, Vice President of Corporate Relations and Human Resources.
Our third quarter results reinforce our conviction that our growth program is on track and that St. Jude Medical is well positioned to continue growing long-term at a superior rate. We now have raised our 2010 EPS guidance range for the third time in three quarters and beaten consensus expectations for EPS by a combined total of $0.17 earnings per share over the same period.
Before I discuss the factors underlying another successful quarter for St. Jude Medical, I want to talk briefly about our proposed acquisition of AGA Medical. As we announced on Monday, St. Jude Medical has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire AGA Medical for $20.80 per share in cash and stock in a total transaction valued at $1.3 billion.
For those of you who are unfamiliar with AGA Medical, the company generated total revenue in 2009 of $199 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year on a constant currency basis. AGA Medical has a leading share of the $250 million interventional cardiology market to repair congenital heart defects, as well as a full pipeline of products directed toward new growth drivers.
We are especially excited to enter the market for left atrial appendage closure in patients who suffer from atrial fibrillation. The AGA Medical left atrial appendage occluder already has a leading market share in Europe and has the potential to become a major new growth driver for St. Jude Medical over the next five years as part of our atrial fibrillation and our structural heart programs.
The AGA Medical acquisition also will add to St. Jude Medical’s structural heart program, a leading share of the emerging market in Europe, to close a PFO or hole in the atrial septum in cryptogenic stroke patients.
The market for left atrial appendage closure and the market for PFO closure both have the opportunity to become new billion dollar markets following global market release of products and full development of relevant markets. The AGA acquisition also brings to St. Jude Medical a next generation vascular plug technology that we expect to replace embolic coils to occlude peripheral blood vessels in a variety of interventional radiology procedures.
This vascular plug technology will add both a new growth driver and critical mass to St. Jude Medical’s vascular closure franchise in the interventional radiology cath lab. We expect a strong complement between all of these new growth drivers in St. Jude Medical’s existing cardiovascular programs. The transaction is expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share in 2011.
Last but not least, John Barr, the President and CEO of AGA Medical has agreed to join St. Jude Medical to add to our leadership talent and to help ensure a smooth integration of the acquisition. We look forward to welcoming John Barr and AGA’s 550 employees to St. Jude Medical just as soon as the transaction is closed.
I would now like to ask John Heinmiller to conduct his normal review of our third quarter results along with his typical update for the entire St. Jude Medical business. I will then address several topics about our overall program and open it up for your questions on the quarter and our acquisition of AGA Medical. Go ahead, John.

Sales for the quarter totaled $1.240 billion up approximately 7% over the $1.160 billion reported in the third quarter of last year. On a constant currency basis, third quarter sales increased 8% versus last year. Unfavorable foreign currency translations versus last year’s third quarter reduced this quarter’s sales by about $10 million.
At the end of 2009, the federal research and development tax credit expired and congress has not yet extended the credit for 2010. In this circumstance, GAAP requires us to estimate our-- and record our effective income tax rate assuming that the R&D credit is not extended.
For purposes of this conference call and our calculation of adjusted net earnings, however, we are assuming that the tax credit will be extended retroactively for 2010, as in past years. As a result, comments referencing third quarter results and our guidance for 2010 including EPS amounts are presented based on an effective income tax rate that contemplates the extension of the tax credit retroactive to January 1st, 2010.
To the extent that the federal research and development tax credit is not enacted our effective income tax rate for 2010 would be higher than what is being presented during this call.
During the third quarter, we recorded after tax charges of $11 million related primarily to closing and other costs associated with the acquisition of LightLab imaging. And $12 million of in process research and development expenses related to the acquisition of certain predevelopment technology assets.
Any financial impact of the AGA Medical transaction including the impact on shares outstanding has been excluded from our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2010. We expect to complete the transaction during the fourth quarter.
Comments during this call referencing third quarter EPS amounts and our guidance for fourth quarter EPS and 2010 full year earnings per share therefore exclude any impact from the AGA Medical transaction.
Earnings per share were $0.72 for the third quarter of 2010, a 22% increase over EPS of $0.59 in the third quarter of 2009 and above our guidance range of $0.67 to $0.69. Before we discuss our third quarter 2000 and sales results by product category with guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010, let me comment on foreign currency.
As discussed on prior calls, the two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical’s operations are the euro and the Yen. Given the fact that we established our exchange rates at the beginning of each month, the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar which has primarily occurred since mid-September did not significantly impact our sales results in the third quarter. Currency translations for the third quarter were calculated at average exchange rates that fell within our assumed ranges used in July when we last provided guidance.
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010, we are now assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.34 to $1.39 and for the yen, each 80 to 85 yen will translate into $1.
Now, for the sales by project category discussion. Total cardiac rhythm management sales, which includes revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines were $738 million, up 7% from last year’s third quarter, including $9 million of unfavorable currency translations.
On a constant currency basis third quarter CRM sales increased 8% versus last year. For the third quarter, ICD sales were $439 million, up 13% from last year’s third quarter. On a constant currency basis, third quarter ICD sales increased 14% versus last year. U.S. ICD sales were $284 million, up 15% from last year’s third quarter.
International ICD sales were $155 million, representing a 10% increase over the third quarter of 2009, including $6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, ICD sales in our international business grew 14% in the third quarter.
For low voltage devices, sales for the third quarter totaled $299 million, about the same as last year’s third quarter, including $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $134 million, down slightly compared to last year’s third quarter.
In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $165 million, equal to the third quarter of 2009. On a currency neutral basis, international pacemaker sales grew approximately 2% in the third quarter.
For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $730 million to $760 million. Atrial fibrillation or AF product sales for the third quarter totaled $169 million up 8% over the third quarter of last year.
On a constant currency basis, AF sales grew approximately 9% in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $165 million to $180 million.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the third quarter of 2010 were $240 million, up 4% over the third quarter of 2009 on both a reported and constant currency basis. Within this category of products, sales of vascular closure products in the third quarter of 2010 were $86 million and sales of heart valve products in the third quarter of 2010 were $78 million.
For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $240 million to $255 million. Total sales of neuromodulation products in the third quarter of 2010 were $93 million, up 11% from the third quarter of 2009. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be in the range of $95 million to $105 million.
Looking to revenue by geography, in total 53% of St. Jude Medical’s sales in the third quarter of 2010 came from the United States, while 47% came from our international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical’s sales for the third quarter of 2010 is available in our press release.
The gross profit margin this quarter was 72.7%, representing a decline as expected compared with the third quarter of 2009, due to the impact of absorbing costs associated with remote monitoring and wireless telemetry capabilities in our pacemaker product line. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.2% to 73.8%.
Our third quarter SG&A expenses were 34.3% of net sales, a 250 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, we now forecast SG&A as a percentage of net sales in the range of 34.3% to 34.8%.
R&D expenses in the third quarter of 2010 were 12.1% of net sales. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect R&D expense to be in the range of 12.0% to 12.6% of net sales, as we continue to balance delivering short-term results with the right investments in long-term growth drivers.
Net other expense was $11 million in the third quarter and we anticipate the other expense category to be in the range of $12 million to $16 million in the fourth quarter.
For the third quarter, the company’s effective income tax rate was 24.5%. For 2010, we continue to expect the tax rate to be in the range of 24.3% to 24.8%. As mentioned previously, these effective income tax rates contemplate the extension of the federal research and development tax credit in 2010, retroactive to the beginning of the year. We have also assumed the extension of the federal research and development tax credit in our EPS guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2010.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter of 2010, we had $852 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,988, billion in total debt and $1 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The debt on our balance sheet includes $1,661 billion of senior notes with maturities in 2013, 2014 and 2019, and $327 million in yen-based borrowings with maturities in 2017 and 2020.
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our earnings per share outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2010. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the fourth quarter of 2010 the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be 331 to 333 million shares with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2010 at 329 to 331 million.
Again, this assumption does not include any impact on shares outstanding resulting from the acquisition of AGA Medical. The Company expects consolidated earnings per share for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.74.
For the full year 2010, we now expect consolidated EPS to be in the range of $2.98 to $3, a $0.09 increase on the top end of the guidance from the full year 2010 guidance, we gave during our July 2010 conference call. This updated expectation represents EPS growth of approximately 13 -- I’m sorry, 23% over the 2009 adjusted EPS of $2.43.
I would now like to turn it back to Dan.

301667,111997088,80458,"St. Jude Medical Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","St. Jude Medical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Turning to our quarterly results and our confidence that we are well positioned for long-term growth at a superior rate, I would like to review several key factors underlying the success of our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM business.",2051,"Thank you, John. Turning to our quarterly results and our confidence that we are well positioned for long-term growth at a superior rate, I would like to review several key factors underlying the success of our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM business.
First, we are the only company which has gained major ICD market share over the last six years. The significance of this is that we hold approximately a 29% share of the ICD market for de novo implants and only a 19% share of the ICD market for replacement devices. This implies a likely 4 point gain in total ICD market share for St. Jude Medical over the next few years as we move through the natural replacement cycle for our products.
Four points of market share translates into approximately 15% growth for St. Jude Medical’s base business in ICDs, before we factor in the benefit of additional gains in the de novo segment of the ICD market where the impact of any growth in the ICD market as a whole.
With respect to the de novo segment of the ICD market, we expect to continue gaining share on the strength of our Unify and Fortify lines of ICDs, our core view pulmonary edema monitoring technology, our Promote Quadra with Quartet Quadripolar Lead CRT-system. Our DF4 simplified connector system, our seven French high voltage lead line, our ST segment monitoring technology and our QuickFlex micro 4 French bipolar left heart leads to name just a few of our many advantages in CRM technology and products.
The ICD business may not be a growth driver for our competitors as they lose market share but we expect it to continue to be a growth driver for St. Jude Medical. This expectation is validated by our delivering 14% constant currency growth in global ICD revenue during the third quarter in the face of challenging market dynamics.
With respect to long-term growth of the global CRM market, last quarter I reported that we expected the global CRM market to grow between 4% and 6% on a constant currency basis, taking into account differences in global geographies, the impact of new technologies, changes in model mix, pressure on ASPs, the impact of device replacement cycles and all other appropriate factors.
The global CRM market grew slower than expected during the third quarter. We now expect the global CRM market to grow closer to 3% on a constant currency basis for full year 2010. To be conservative, we will assume that the global CRM market will continue to grow approximately 3% annually, due the impact of macroeconomic factors until we see evidence of market recovery.
Keep in mind that with a 25% share of the global CRM market, St. Jude Medical is four times more sensitive to 1 point gain in market share than it is to a 1 point change in rate of market growth. We are comfortable with the current rate of growth in the global CRM market in the context of our ability to continue gaining market share.
We expect this market growth rate to recover longer term due to the impact of new technology and the impact of faster growth in under penetrated international markets, but such market recovery will represent upside to our minimum growth goals.
Moving beyond CRM, our entire growth program remains robust at the level needed to meet or exceed the superior long-term growth expectations we announced at the beginning of this year. With respect to initiatives designed to optimize our cost structure, we opened our new manufacturing facility in Costa Rica ahead of schedule and already are shipping finished goods from this facility to our customers. Our new manufacturing facility in Malaysia is on track to come online towards the end of this year. We expect these two components of our cost optimization program alone to benefit our income statement by well over $100 million annually, within the next few years.
With respect to our top line growth, we start by reminding investors that St. Jude Medical has a solid leadership position in two of the best growth opportunities in medical device technology, the broad electrophysiology space addressed by our Atrial Fibrillation or AF division and the chronic pain space addressed by the spinal cord stimulation technology of our Neuromodulation division.
Each of these growth drivers has an elective component and a capital equipment component that are affected by macroeconomic pressures in the short-term, but we continue to expect both of these markets to grow long-term at a double-digit rate due to their current level of under-penetration in the ongoing accumulation of data that confirms both the clinical benefit and cost effectiveness of AF and Neuromodulation device therapies.
In spite of the strength of our AF and Neuromodulation growth drivers, we indicated during our Investor Conference in February of this year that our 2010 growth program includes significant focus and investment to accelerate sales growth longer-term.
I would hike to summarize 14 initiatives that either have been completed or are under way to accelerate our sales growth. First and foremost, we have restored competitive effectiveness through our U.S. CRM sales organization. This is testament to the leadership effectiveness of Mike Rousseau in the reorganized leadership team he put in place, we have now returned to gaining CRM share in our U.S. business in the same way we continue to gain CRM share in our international business.
Second, we are now entering for the first time the $500 million market for pericardial stented tissue valves. We are rolling out full commercial launch of our Trifecta line of pericardial stented tissue valves in Europe beginning this quarter.
Early clinical response is favorable and consistent with our expectation that our Trifecta line of stented tissue valves can become a major new growth driver for our CVD business. We expect full launch of the Trifecta line in the United States to begin by the middle of 2011.
Third, we are now entering the $500 million market for deep brain stimulation or DBS for patients suffering from Parkinson’s disease. Beginning this quarter, we are rolling out full of our commercial launch in Europe of our real rechargeable deep brain stimulator, DBA ATHENA programmer, DBS and a clinician programmer and a complete line of proprietary leads and accessories.
It’s a rechargeable and constant currency system and is the smallest, lightest and longest lasting system on the market. We expect to support this launch with publication of favorable data from our U.S. pivotal clinical trial during the first half of 2011. We have only the one key competitor in this market share and expect to gain meaningful market share in this new growing market.
Fourth, we have the leading position in the market for fractional flow reserve or FFR guided therapy for stenting patients of multi-vessel disease. Although this market is still small today at less than $200 million in size, we expect FFR measurement to become the standard of care in the future on the strength of data from the FAME landmark clinical trial, the potential for positive data from the FAME II trial just getting underway, ongoing improvements to ease of use and our market development programs.
Fifth, we have just begun to compete in the $500 million market for intravascular imaging technology through our acquisition of LightLab imaging and our launch of the first and only optical coherence tomography or OCT product line and the market. We are in the process of integrating our OCT technology into our FFR hardware platform to facilitate growth of the FFR market. At the same time we strengthen both the clinical and the economic benefit of our competitive position in intravascular imaging.
We envision strong synergy between our programs to develop the market for OCT technology and our programs to develop the market for FFR technology. We expect both technologies to become meaningful new growth drivers for St. Jude Medical in the near to mid-term.
Sixth, we are making good progress continuing to advance our transcatheter aortic valve implant or T-A-V-I, TAVI development program.
During the third quarter, we announced that Dr. Gregory Fontana and Dr. Raj Makkar from Cedars-Sinai will serve as core principal investigators to the pivotal trials, covering both our transfemoral and our transapical TAVI systems.
At the recent TCT meeting, Dr. Fontana presented data about these systems which supports our conviction that our TAVI program consists of next generation technology that will be fully competitive at the time of market release. We continue to expect to launch both our transfemoral 33:33 and transapical TAVI systems in Europe by the first half of 2013.
Seventh, during the third quarter we made an equity investment in CardioMEMS with an exclusive option to purchase the company at a later time. This investment positions us to leverage our CRM business and creates a major new growth driver within our heart failure franchise. Data presented at the TCT meeting from the CardioMEMS champion trial showed a 38% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations during an average follow-up duration of 15 months for patients implanted with a CardioMEMS device. This technology has the potential to support a new billion dollar growth opportunity following global market release and full development of the market. The product line is scheduled for limited launch in Europe in 2011 and in the United States in 2012. St. Jude Medical now is positioned to become the clear leader in this new market.
Eighth, we recently announced approval of our Eon mini line of spinal cord stimulators in Japan. We will begin launching our Eon mini product line in Japan during the fourth quarter to create the conditions for meaningful sales contribution with this new growth driver in 2011 and beyond. The success of our mini product line in the United States and in Europe gives us confidence we can gain leadership in the spinal cord stimulation market in Japan.
Ninth, we are in the process of completing our assessment of data from our US pivotal trial for patients suffering from certain forms of migraine. We plan to announce the results of this clinical trial during the first half of 2011. We are not yet prepared to predict whether our results will meet FDA requirements for approval in the United States, but we expect to receive CE Mark for migraine indication in Europe during 2011. This puts us on track for our migraine business in Europe to become a meaningful new growth driver for St. Jude Medical in 2012 and beyond.
10th, we are continuing to integrate our MediGuide technology with existing technologies in our AF business, our CRM business and our CVD business. Our first MediGuide enabled cath lab already is online in Europe. We are optimistic that over time our MediGuide technology will be a key differentiator for multiple St. Jude Medical growth programs, based on its ability to improve both the clinical effectiveness and the cost effectiveness of minimally innovative procedures in a wide variety of clinical settings.
Additionally, once we close the acquisition of AGA Medical we announced earlier this week, we will add to St. Jude Medical’s growth program, a leading position in four new markets. The market for left atrial appendage closure, the market for PFO closure in cryptogenic stroke patients, the market to modify abnormal peripheral vessels with vascular plugs instead of embolic coils and the market to repair (inaudible) heart defects with an international cardiology procedure.
At this point, I have identified 14 areas of investment at St. Jude Medical. All of which are designed to accelerate our rate of sales growth. Many investors ask me routinely why I feel so confident about our business. The comments I just outlined are exactly why. Many of these investments will benefit our sales growth in 2011, all of these investments should benefit our sales growth in 2012 and beyond. All of these new sales growth programs are surrounded by our initiatives to optimize our cost structure and leverage the middle of our income statement. We look forward to providing additional information about these and other new growth drivers during our next annual investor conference in February 2011.
With that, we have concluded our prepared remarks. John Heinmiller, Mike Rousseau, Eric Fain and I now all are ready to take your questions. Dennis, would you please moderate the questions?

But I recall the breakout was about 15% growth in the AF business in international markets and about 1% growth of the AF business in the U.S. The growth rate was really impacted. I alluded to it in my prepared remarks that the AF business during the third quarter and here in 2010 is impacted to the extent that procedures are somewhat elective and to the extent that the revenue includes a capital component.
And with respect to the impact of the capital component of the revenue, the capital component itself is pretty small, but capital component ends up impacting the associated sale of disposable devices as well that kind of the razor and razor blades, we sell fewer razor blades when we sell fewer razors. Macroeconomic factors did impact market growth rate for the AF business in the third quarter. But we expect that impact to be transient and we expect to continue long-term. We expect to see the AF market on a global basis continue to grow at a double-digit rate.

And migraine was certainly one of them.
And so I clearly had a well-supported basis supplied by our Neuromodulation team to make the comments I did that we’re very optimistic that we will receive CE Mark for migraine in Europe in 2011. And that this will become a new growth driver for us in 2012. So absolutely, that was a good database comment.
With respect to the U.S. opportunity for an indication for migraine, I would urge you and everyone else to continue to model nothing for St. Jude Medical revenue for a U.S. migraine indication. We will -- we’re not yet completed with our analysis of data. We’re not yet prepared to describe the current state of the analysis.
We will do so once the analysis has been finalized. And we’ll then do so in a peer reviewed setting and we’ll look forward to publishing that data. And we’ll all be sworn to secrecy until such time. But start to expect migraine related revenue in Europe in 2012. We will start to expect a launch of migraine in Europe before the end of 2011 and plan on nothing for migraine in the United States for the time being. Leave it for potential upside.

And so our strategy is with each program that is a major strategic initiative for us. Our strategy is to control it first. So that means our strategy is to fully fund an appropriate internal program where we really -- where we’re in control of our own destiny.
So that’s option A. We have a good internal program. It is sufficient. And we’re very encouraged by all of the feedback we get from the KOLs that we’ve been working with on the -- on validating our sense that we have a Best-in-Class next generation technology that can help us gain significant market share at the point where we launch it into the markets.
Having said that, with each one of our internal growth programs, we always are alert for the possibility of either accelerating, strengthening or even replacing our internal growth program with an acquisition. So we always are looking for evaluating whether an acquisition can help us with a key strategic initiative. That puts us into perfect position where we don’t have to do an acquisition. We can be very objective and rigorous in evaluating potential acquisitions.
It makes it less likely that we’re going to make a bad acquisition and knowing that we don’t have to do anything. But if all the parts fall in place, we certainly have the balance sheet capability to take advantage of all of the parts falling in place if that’s what’s happened.
So we will go forward full steam and the timeline, it starts out being years out but the timeline is starting to come to near term now for getting to clinical phase and getting pivotal trials under way and we really can see our launch into the European market with two systems in the first half of 2013 and so we’re good to go.

But without a timeline, absolutely expect the AF to return to double-digit.
I think that here in the third quarter, besides macroeconomics that, again, timeline is debatable but the extent of macro factors on market growth in elective procedures and the capital equipment component are clearly real and also transient. Besides that, I think you’re right that we’ve got a product cycle disadvantage which sometimes around the winning side of the product cycle, sometimes we’re not. I think we have a product cycle disadvantage here temporarily.
And then the product cycle impact, I think, is exacerbated by the fact that we’re still operating under a warning letter from FDA and that has an impact on new product approvals. And we really don’t have the same product line here in the United States currently that we have on the market in Europe.
So I think when you see the European growth rate continuing right where we would like to see it at about 15%, that product line is coming to the U.S. in just a matter of time to get it here.

And so if you make the assumption that half of that or so drops down to the operating profit line, that would translate into maybe $0.02 of EPS that you might attribute to the improvement in the currency fluctuation. But it wouldn’t be more than that.

But there is clearly an ASP element to our revised view of the CRM market growth but there clearly is on the one hand. On the other hand, I would not overstate that and a data point I would give you is that in our third quarter, our U.S. ICD sales system ASPs were actually a little bit stronger again in the third quarter of 2010 than they were in the third quarter one year ago.
So it would be very surprising to folks I’m sure and counter intuitive but true. So if you took that as one data point and it would be -- that would add some balance to what’s the impact of ASP pressures. So we are seeing increased pressure on ASPs. We are seeing competitors be more aggressive on price. We are seeing ASP drops in the market. We’re seeing it -- we’re seeing more of it internationally. We’ve seen more of it on the low voltage side, offset by our U.S. ICD sales in our own product line benefiting from new technology premiums and from our particular mix versus the mix of competitors but ASP pressure is an element of it.
Another big element of it is just that Medtronic came out with CRM number in their last reported quarter that was lower than any of us expected it to be. So when we factor that into what’s that do to market growth, we just have to be realistic that based on everybody’s reported numbers, the market’s growing slower than we had had previously modeled. And we can imagine reasons for that in somebody else’s business but the prudent thing for us to do is to say the numbers are as they are.
The total growth is a little bit slower than we estimated and expected one quarter ago and now what do we say going forward? And we think it’s prudent to say going forward, let’s assume that the status quo remains as it is and that the market grows a little bit slower. We can make the case for why the market ought to grow up, ought to continue to grow longer term constant currency 4 to 6%. We especially would look to -- when we think about that, the kinds of things that I’d especially point to that people can miss.
You know, the first would be we’re always talking constant currency. And others sometimes are talking as reported and depending on the currency trend, that does make a difference. So we’re always talking constant currency, number one.
The other thing is not everybody takes into account the impact on market growth of - about trying to concern. Some of the market models we see are only take into account the results of the big three. And those analyses are going to underestimate market growth when the other two companies between the two of them are taking share as they did in 2008, 2009 and in the first half of 2010.
So that would be another potential -- that’s another component that can lead to different market models producing different results. Another very significant component here in our market model outlook is the impact of new technology and so others cannot adequately factor in the impact of our new technology without having complete insight into what our new product flow is over the next few years which we don’t tell people.
But you can start to get a glimpse of how real the impact of new technology is in our product line alone. And so if you think about the pulmonary wedge pressure technology, think about left atrial -- direct left atrial pressure technology, you look at our CardioMEMS transaction, you look at our LAP technology, look at our ST segment monitoring technology, you know, just to name a few. These are the kinds of things that can reset a premium ASP that is well justified by clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness in the same way that a CRT systems reset the ASP for ICDs and in the same way that ICDs reset the premium ASPs for pacemakers as pacemakers came to have the additional technology of a high voltage shock in them.
So new technology is a particular component of long-term market model growth that has a big impact that different people will see different ways, depending on their level of insight into the flow of new leading technologies that we have in our pipelines. Another thing that I would add, point to, just here on the longer term market growth is the impact of markets like China and other significant emerging markets. So we mentioned this before and it’s -- I think it’s the -- others will validate our data, that in 2009 there are fewer than 2,000 ICDs implanted in all for the full year in all of China.
And if you kind of look at that as a disconnect between indications and disconnect between that and the state of the economy in China and the size of the growing middle class in China and a disconnect between that level of penetration in the market and the amount of investment that the Chinese government has committed to raising the bar on healthcare in China here over the next number of years, we’re going to get a lot of growth out of international markets. And those who are kind of U.S. centric are going to underestimate long-term CRM market growth if they aren’t close enough to these major new international markets.
So those are all the things. But more than anything it’s just Medtronic came out with a bad number. And we don’t know what they’re going to come out with here in the next quarter and for the time being we’ll just bring our expectations down.

So this is not a precedent where next quarter people might ask what’s our mix on a particular product line and expect an answer. We generally don’t describe product line mix inside the sales categories that we report.
However, this Unify and Fortify is extraordinary. In the third quarter, we exited the third quarter with more than -- in the United States with more than 90% of our mix of ICDs consisting of Unify and Fortify. So in the same way that I mentioned that after one month we had an absolutely unprecedented percent of sales in that new technology. After one quarter, we continue to -- we set a new standard for uptake of new technology. So it’s absolutely a winning product line and strong component of our ASP strength, strong component of our market share growth and it’s going to be a great platform for us going forward for the next couple of years.
With respect to AGA integration at a high level, at a high level it would be appropriate to think of AGA as a bolt-on to our Cardiovascular division. And you might find that implied by John Barr agreeing to continue to serve as President and CEO of the AGA business unit here within St. Jude Medical. We have tremendous respect for the momentum, the breadth, the quality systems, the R&D productiveness, the manufacturing operations, you know and to the extent that anybody from AGA is listening and I didn’t mention their function, it was not intended to be a slight.
But my point is that we think very highly of the AGA team and of the condition of their operations. We’re happy to stand behind those operations and have the St. Jude Medical name on them. And the first -- the highest priority for us in this integration strategy is to make sure that we do not ruin a good thing in any way at all.
So we will be deliberate in looking for synergies. We will -- we know we can capture some good revenue synergies with the global distribution capabilities and footprint and product lines that we have. We know we can capture great synergies with the left atrial appendage occlusion technology and our access with electrophysiologist. On the cost side, we think very highly of the gross margin that AGA has been able to support on a sustainable basis and there’s a lot to like and so think of it as a bolt-on.

I don’t want to answer it directly from a competitive perspective, from a purely competitive perspective. I don’t really want to indicate to competitors that might be listening to the call or reading the transcript how we’re doing versus their initiatives and how is it that we’re beating them and what do we think is going to happen next.
I really don’t want to offer that just from a purely competitive perspective. But what I could say is generally speaking, the starting point would be to the extent that competitors are bundling in a way that’s different from what we’re doing. I think the starting point would be to say and how’s it working for them.
So if the bundling and losing share in their reported results and we’re not and we’re gaining share in our reported results, that’s a better answer for you than any kind of soft information that I could provide to you. And then -- so and then I would say that customers are awfully smart. And they’re not interested in less than their desired products. And so if we’re -- if we have -- if the competitors -- if all players in the space have commodity devices, then it’s going to be price that’s going to carry the day.
But that’s not the case and we don’t expect to see that to be the case in our major markets. So technology differences have an impact, not only on the cost effectiveness but on the clinical effectiveness and there are clearly technology differences in all of our major programs. The quality and capabilities of the field organizations, the experience levels and stability of the field organizations are major factors.
And so I’m not going to -- there’s a lot that I’m just going to bite my tongue and not say that I might say from -- with a full head of steam to contrast our excellence versus the presentation of competitors. So I’m sorry, I’m not going to be more precise for you.

That’s not been our approach. We start with the commitment that we’re not going to do dumb dilutive deals. So, now, that -- so I don’t think in terms of a large deal. I think in terms of a dumb dilutive deal.
Let’s not do that. We’ve seen plenty of companies over the years do dumb diluted deals. And we take some pride in being able to say that we haven’t done one and you won’t see one on our collective leadership and board watch. The AGA acquisition, in contrast, is an accretive deal. In the first year, without synergies, it’s accretive to net adjusted earnings, if you exclude the inventory write-up due to acquisition accounting of the inventory and so that’s a baseline right there.
We like accretive deals and then the idea that we can find appropriate synergies, we like that. And then if you add to it that we have two -- that we have four new growth drivers already on the market in Europe, we like that. We’re very interested in adding accelerating the rate of sales growth and doing it with business that we understand and these -- so all of the new growth drivers of AGA that are -- that we look forward to bringing into our own program, our technology and growth drivers and customer call points that we’re already involved in. So you start checking these boxes and this is just a compelling acquisition for us and -- but none of it was with an orientation of let’s do a little deal, let’s do a mid-sized deal, let’s do a big deal.

Welcome to the St. Jude Medical Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. With me on the call today are John Heinmiller, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Rousseau, Group President; Eric Fain, President of our Cardiac Rhythm Management Division; and Angie Craig, Vice President of Corporate Relations and Human Resources. 
Our third quarter results reinforced our conviction that our growth program is on track and that St. Jude Medical is well positioned to continue growing long term at a superior rate. We now have raised our 2010 EPS guidance range for the third time in three quarters and beaten consensus expectations for EPS by a combined total of $0.17 earnings per share over the same period.
Before I discuss the factors underlying another successful quarter for St. Jude Medical, I want to talk briefly about our proposed acquisition of  AGA Medical. As we announced on Monday, St. Jude Medical has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire AGA Medical for $20.80 per share in cash and stock in a total transaction valued at $1.3 billion. For those of you who are unfamiliar with AGA Medical, the company generated total revenue in 2009 of $199 million, an increase of 21% over the prior year on a constant currency basis. AGA Medical has a leading share of the $250 million interventional cardiology market to repair congenital heart defects, as well as a full pipeline of products directed toward new growth drivers. 
We are especially excited to enter the market for left atrial appendage closure in patients who suffer from atrial fibrillation. The AGA Medical left atrial appendage occluder already has a leading market share in Europe and has the potential to become a major new growth driver for St. Jude Medical over the next five years as part of our Atrial Fibrillation and our structural heart programs.
The AGA Medical acquisition also will add to St. Jude Medical structural heart program, a leading share of the emerging market in Europe to close a PFO or hole in the atrial septum encrypted genic stroke patients. The market for left atrial appendage closure and the market for PFO closure both have the opportunity to become new billion-dollar markets following global market release of products and full development of relevant markets. The AGA acquisition also brings to St. Jude Medical a next-generation vascular plug technology that we expect to replace embolic coils to occlude peripheral blood vessels in a variety of interventional radiology procedures. This vascular plug technology will add both a new growth driver and critical mass to St. Jude Medical's vascular closure franchise in the interventional radiology cath lab. We expect a strong complement between all of these new growth drivers in St. Jude Medical's existing cardiovascular programs. The transaction is expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share in 2011.
Last but not least, John Barr, the President and CEO of AGA Medical has agreed to join St. Jude Medical to add to our leadership talent and to help ensure a smooth integration of the acquisition. We look forward to welcoming John Barr and AGA's 550 employees to St. Jude Medical just as soon as the transaction is closed.
I would now like to ask John Heinmiller to conduct his normal review of our third quarter results, along with his typical update for the entire St. Jude Medical business. I will then address several topics about our overall program and open it up for your questions on the quarter and our acquisition of AGA Medical. Go ahead, John."

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,240,000,000, up approximately 7% over the $1,160,000,000 reported in the third quarter of last year.

Sales for the quarter totaled $1,240,000,000, up approximately 7% over the $1,160,000,000 reported in the third quarter of last year. On a constant currency basis, third quarter sales increased 8% versus last year. Unfavorable foreign currency translations versus last year's third quarter reduced this quarter's sales by about $10 million. At the end of 2009, the federal research and development tax credit expired and Congress has not yet extended the credit for 2010. 
In this circumstance, GAAP requires us to estimate and record our effective income tax rate assuming that the R&D credit is not extended. For purposes of this conference call and our calculation of adjusted net earnings, however, we are assuming that the tax credit will be extended retroactively for 2010 as in past years.
As a result, comments referencing third quarter results and our guidance for 2010, including EPS amounts, are presented based on an effective income tax rate that contemplates the extension of the tax credit retroactive to January 1, 2010. To the extent that the federal research and development tax credit is not enacted, our effective income tax rate for 2010 would be higher than what is being presented during this call.
During the third quarter, we recorded after-tax charges of $11 million related primarily to closing and other costs associated with the acquisition of LightLab Imaging. And $12 million of in-process research and development expenses related to the acquisition of certain predevelopment technology assets. Any financial impact of the AGA Medical transaction, including the impact on shares outstanding, has been excluded from our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2010. We expect to complete the transaction during the fourth quarter. Comments during this call referencing third quarter EPS amounts and our guidance for fourth quarter EPS and 2010 full year earnings per share, therefore exclude any impact from the AGA Medical transaction.
Earnings per share were $0.72 for the third quarter of 2010, a 22% increase over EPS of $0.59 in the third quarter of 2009, and above our guidance range of $0.67 to $0.69. Before we discuss our third quarter 2000 sales result by product category, with guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010, let me comment on foreign currency. As discussed on prior calls, the two main currencies influencing St. Jude Medical's operations are the euro and the yen. Given the fact that we establish our exchange rates at the beginning of each month, the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar, which has primarily occurred since mid-September, did not significantly impact our sales results in the third quarter. Currency translations for the third quarter were calculated at average exchange rates that fell within our assumed ranges used in July when we last provided guidance.
In preparing our sales and earnings guidance for the fourth quarter of 2010, we are now assuming that each euro will translate into about $1.34 to $1.39. And for the yen, each 80 to 85 yen will translate into U.S. $1.
Now for the sales by product category discussion. Total cardiac rhythm management sales, which includes revenue from both our ICD and pacemaker product lines, were $738 million, up 7% from last year's third quarter, including $9 million of unfavorable currency translations. On a constant currency basis, third quarter CRM sales increased 8% versus last year. For the third quarter, ICD sales were $439 million, up 13% from last year's third quarter. On a constant currency basis, third quarter ICD sales increased 14% versus last year. U.S. ICD sales were $284 million, up 15% from last year's third quarter. International ICD sales were $155 million, representing a 10% increase over the third quarter of 2009, including $6 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. On a constant currency basis, ICD sales in our international business grew 14% in the third quarter.
For low-voltage devices, sales for the third quarter totaled $299 million, about the same as last year's third quarter, including $3 million of unfavorable foreign currency translations. In the United States, pacemaker sales were $134 million, down slightly compared to last year's third quarter. In our international markets, pacemaker sales were approximately $165 million, equal to the third quarter of 2009. On a currency neutral basis, international pacemaker sales grew approximately 2% in the third quarter.
For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect total CRM product sales to be in the range of $730 million to $760 million. Atrial Fibrillation or AF product sales for the third quarter totaled $169 million, up 8% over the third quarter of last year. On a constant currency basis, AF sales grew approximately 9% in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect AF product sales to be in the range of $165 million to $180 million.
Total sales of cardiovascular products for the third quarter of 2010 were $240 million, up 4% over the third quarter of 2009 on both a reported and constant currency basis. Within this category of products, sales of vascular closure products in the third quarter of 2010 were $86 million and sales of heart valve products in the third quarter of 2010 were $78 million. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect cardiovascular product sales to be in the range of $240 million to $255 million.
Total sales of neuromodulation products in the third quarter of 2010 were $93 million, up 11% from the third quarter of 2009. For the fourth quarter of 2010, we expect sales of neuromodulation products to be in the range of $95 million to $105 million. Looking to revenue by geography, in total, 53% of St. Jude Medical sales in the third quarter of 2010 came from the United States, while 47% came from our international markets. As with prior quarters, the specific geographic breakdown of St. Jude Medical sales for the third quarter of 2010 is available in our press release.
The gross profit margin this quarter was 72.7%, representing a decline as expected compared with the third quarter of 2009 due to the impact of absorbing costs associated with remote monitoring and wireless telemetry capabilities in our pacemaker product line. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect gross profit margins to be in the range of 73.2% to 73.8%. Our third quarter SG&A expenses were 34.3% of net sales, a 250 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010, we now forecast SG&A as a percentage of net sales in the range of 34.3% to 34.8%.
R&D expenses in the third quarter of 2010 were 12.1% of net sales. For the full year 2010, we continue to expect R&D expense to be in the range of 12.0% to 12.6% of net sales as we continue to balance delivering short-term results with the right investments in long-term growth drivers. Net other expense was $11 million in the third quarter, and we anticipate the other expense category to be in the range of $12 million to $16 million in the fourth quarter.
For the third quarter, the company's effective income tax rate was 24.5%. For 2010, we continue to expect the tax rate to be in the range of 24.3% to 24.8%. As mentioned previously, these effective income tax rates contemplate the extension of the federal research and development tax credit in 2010, retroactive to the beginning of the year. We have also assumed the extension of the federal research and development tax credit in our EPS guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2010.
Moving on to the balance sheet. At the end of the third quarter of 2010, we had $852 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1,988,000,000 in total debt and $1 billion available under a revolving credit facility with a group of banks. The debt on our balance sheet includes $1,661,000,000 of senior notes with maturities in 2013, 2014 and 2019, and $327 million in yen-based borrowings with maturities in 2017 and 2020. 
Next, I want to offer some comments regarding our earnings per share outlook for the fourth quarter and full year 2010. In preparing our EPS guidance, we have assumed that in the fourth quarter of 2010, the share count used in our fully diluted EPS calculation will be about 331 million to 333 million shares, with the weighted average outstanding shares for the full year 2010 at 329 million to 331 million. Again, this assumption does not include any impact on shares outstanding resulting from the acquisition of AGA Medical. The company expects consolidated earnings per share for the fourth quarter to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.74. For the full year 2010, we now expect consolidated EPS to be in the range of $2.98 to $3, a $0.09 increase on the top end of the guidance from the full year 2010 guidance we gave during our July 2010 conference call. This updated expectation represents EPS growth of approximately 23% over the 2009 adjusted EPS of $2.43. I would now like to turn it back to Dan."
301667,111997088,80625,"St. Jude Medical Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","St. Jude Medical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Turning to our quarterly results and our confidence that we are well positioned for long-term growth at a superior rate, I would like to review several key factors underlying the success of our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM business. F",2040,"Thank you, John. Turning to our quarterly results and our confidence that we are well positioned for long-term growth at a superior rate, I would like to review several key factors underlying the success of our Cardiac Rhythm Management or CRM business. First, we are the only one company which has gained major ICD market share over the last six years, the significance of this is that we hold approximately a 29% share of the ICD market per de novo implants and only a 19% share of the ICD market for replacement devices. This implies a likely four-point gain in total ICD market share for St. Jude Medical over the next few years as we move through the natural replacement cycle for our products. Four points of market share translates into approximately 15% growth for St. Jude Medical's base business in ICDs before we factor in the benefit of additional gains in the de novo segment of the ICD market or the impact of any growth in the ICD market as a whole.
With respect to the de novo segment of the ICD market, we expect to continue gaining share on the strength of our unify and fortify lines of ICDs. Our CorVue pulmonary edema monitoring technology, our Promote Quadra with quartet quadripolar lead CRT system, our DF4 simplified connector system, our 7 French high-voltage lead line, our ST segment monitoring technology and our Quickflex micro 4 French bipolar left heart leads to name just a few of our many advantages in CRM technology and products. 
The ICD business may not be a growth driver for our competitors as they lose market share, but we expect it to continue to be a growth driver for St. Jude Medical. This expectation is validated by our delivering 14% constant currency growth in global ICD revenue during the third quarter in the face of challenging market dynamics.
With respect to long-term growth of the global CRM market, last quarter, I reported that we expected the global CRM market to grow between 4% and 6% on a constant currency basis, taking into account differences in global geographies, the impact of new technologies, changes in model mix, pressure on ASPs, the impact of device replacement cycles and all other appropriate factors. The global CRM market grew slower than expected during the third quarter. We now expect the global CRM market to grow closer to 3% on a constant currency basis for full year 2010. To be conservative, we will assume that the global CRM market will continue to grow approximately 3% annually due to the impact of macroeconomic factors until we see evidence of market recovery. Keep in mind that with a 25% share of the global CRM market, St. Jude Medical is four times more sensitive to a one-point gain in market share than it is to a one-point change in rate of market growth. We are comfortable with the current rate of growth in the global CRM market in the context of our ability to continue gaining market share. We expect this market growth rate to recover longer-term due to the impact of new technology and the impact of faster growth in under penetrated international markets, but such market recovery will represent upside to our minimum growth goals.
Moving beyond CRM, our entire growth program remains robust at the level needed to meet or exceed the superior long-term growth expectations we announced at the beginning of this year. With respect to initiatives designed to optimize our cost structure, we opened our new manufacturing facility in Costa Rica ahead of schedule and already are shipping finished goods from this facility to our customers. Our new manufacturing facility in Malaysia is on track to come online toward the end of this year. We expect these two components of our cost optimization program alone to benefit our income statement by well over $100 million annually within the next few years.
With respect to our top line growth, we start by reminding investors that St. Jude Medical has a solid leadership position in two of the best growth opportunities in medical device technology, the broad electrophysiology space addressed by our Atrial Fibrillation or AF division and the chronic pain space addressed by the spinal cord stimulation technology of our Neuromodulation division. Each of these growth drivers has an elective component and a capital equipment component that are affected by macroeconomic pressures in the short term, but we continue to expect both of these markets to grow long-term at a double-digit rate due to their current level of under penetration and the ongoing accumulation of data that confirms both the clinical benefit and the cost effectiveness of AF and neuromodulation device therapies.
In spite of the strength of our AF and neuromodulation growth drivers, we indicated during our investor conference in February of this year, that our 2010 growth program includes significant focus and investment to accelerate sales growth longer term. I would like to summarize 14 initiatives that either have been completed or are underway to accelerate our sales growth.
First and foremost, we have restored competitive effectiveness to our U.S. CRM sales organization. This is testament to the leadership effectiveness of Mike Rousse and the reorganized leadership team he put in place. We have now returned to gaining CRM share in our U.S. business in the same way we continue to gain CRM share in our international business. 
Second, we are now entering for the first time the $500 million market prepared cardio stented tissue valves. We are rolling out full commercialize launch of our Trifecta line of pericardial stented tissue valves in Europe, beginning this quarter. Early clinical response is favorable and consistent with our expectation that our Trifecta line of stented tissue valves can become a major new growth driver for our CVD business. We expect full launch of the Trifecta line in the United States to begin by the middle of 2011. 
Third, we are now entering the $500 million market for deep brain stimulation or DBS for patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. Beginning this quarter, we are rolling out full commercial launch in Europe of our Brio rechargeable deep brain stimulator, our Athena DBS clinician programmer and a complete line of proprietary leads and accessories. 
Brio is a rechargeable and constant currency system and is the smallest, lightest and longest lasting system on the market. We expect to support this launch with publication of favorable data from our U.S. pivotal clinic trial during the first half of 2011. We have only one competitor in this market and expect to gain meaningful market share in this new growing market.
Fourth, we have the leading position in the market for fractional flow reserve or FFR guided therapy for stenting patients with multivessel disease. Although this market is still small today at less than $200 million in size, we expect FFR measurement to become the standard of care in the future on the strength of data from the FAME landmark clinical trial, the potential for positive data from the FAME II trial just getting underway, ongoing improvements to ease of use and our market development programs. 
Fifth, we have just begun to compete in the $500 million market for intravascular imaging technology through our acquisition of LightLab Imaging and our launch of the first and only optical coherence tomography or OCT product line on the market. We are in the process of integrating our OCT technology into our FFR hardware platform to facilitate growth of the FFR market, at the same time we strengthen both the clinical and the economic benefit of our competitive position in intravascular imaging. We envision strong synergy between our programs to develop the market for OCT technology and our programs to develop the market for FFR technology. We expect both technologies to become meaningful new growth drivers for St. Jude Medical in the near to midterm.
Sixth, we are making good progress continuing to advance our transcatheter aortic valve implant or TAVI development program. During the third quarter, we announced that Dr. Gregory Fontana and Dr. Raj Makkar from Cedars-Sinai will serve as co-principal investigators for the pivotal trials covering both our transfemoral and our transapical TAVI systems. At the recent TCT meeting, Dr. Fontana presented data about these systems which supports our conviction that our TAVI program consist of next-generation technology that will be fully competitive at the time of market release. We continue to expect to launch both our transfemoral and transapical TAVI systems in Europe by the first half of 2013.
Seventh, during the third quarter, we made an equity investment in CardioMEMS with an exclusive option to purchase the company at a later time. This investment positions us to leverage our CRM business and creates a major new growth driver within our heart failure franchise. Data presented at the TCT meeting from the CardioMEMS Champion trial showed a 38% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations during an average follow-up duration of 15 months for patients implanted with a CardioMEMS device. This technology has the potential to support a new billion-dollar growth opportunity, following global market release and full development of the market. The product line is scheduled for limited launch in Europe in 2011 and in the United States in 2012. St. Jude Medical now is positioned to become the clear leader in this new market.
Eighth, we recently announced approval of our Eon Mini line of spinal cord stimulators in Japan. We will begin launching our Eon Mini product line in Japan during the fourth quarter to create the conditions for meaningful sales contribution with this new growth driver in 2011 and beyond. The success of our Eon Mini product line in the United States and in Europe gives us confidence we can gain leadership in the spinal cord stimulation market in Japan. 
Ninth, we are in the process of completing our assessment of data from our U.S. pivotal trial for patients suffering from certain forms of migraine. We plan to announce the results of this clinical trial during the first half of 2011. We are not yet prepared to predict whether our results will meet FDA requirements for approval in the United States, but we expect to receive CE mark for migraine indication in Europe during 2011. This puts us on track for our Migraine business in Europe to become a meaningful new growth driver for St. Jude Medical in 2012 and beyond.
Tenth, we are continuing to integrate our MediGuide technology with existing technologies in our AF business, our CRM business and our CVD business. Our first MediGuide enabled cath lab already is online in Europe. We are optimistic that over time, our MediGuide technology will be a key differentiator for multiple St. Jude Medical growth programs based on its ability to improve both the clinical effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of minimally invasive procedures in a wide variety of clinical settings. 
Additionally, once we close the acquisition of AGA Medical, we announced earlier this week, we will add to St. Jude Medical's growth program a leading position in four new markets. The market for left atrial appendage closure, the market for PFO closure encrypted genic stroke patients, the market to modify abnormal peripheral vessels with vascular plugs instead of embolic coils and the market to repair congenital heart defects with an interventional cardiology procedure.
At this point, I have identified 14 areas of investment at St. Jude Medical, all of which are designed to accelerate our rate of sales growth. Many investors ask me routinely why I feel so confident about our business. The comments I just outlined are exactly why. Many of these investments will benefit our sales growth in 2011, all of these investments should benefit our sales growth in 2012 and beyond. All of these new sales growth programs are surrounded by our initiatives to optimize our cost structure and leverage the middle of our income statement. We look forward to providing additional information about these and other new growth drivers during our next annual investor conference in February 2011.

But as I recall, we had the breakout, and everybody can do their own math, but as I recall, the breakout was about 15% growth in the AF business in international markets and about 1% growth of the AF business in the U.S. And so the growth rate was really impacted, I alluded to it in my prepared remarks that the AF business, during the third quarter and here in 2010 is impacted to the extent that procedures are somewhat elective and to the extent that the revenue includes a capital component. And with respect to the impact of the capital component of the revenue and the capital component itself is pretty small, but the capital component ends up impacting the associated sale of disposable devices as well with kind of the razor and razor blades. We sell fewer razor blades when we sell fewer razors. So the macroeconomic factors did impact market growth rate for the AF business in the third quarter. But we expect that impact to be transient. And we expect to continue long term. We expect to see the AF market on a global basis continue to grow at a double-digit rate."

And so our strategy is with each program that is a major strategic initiative for us, our strategy is to control it first. So that means our strategy is to fully fund an appropriate internal program that we're in control of our own destiny. And so that's option A, we have a good internal program. It is sufficient and we're very encouraged by all of the feedback we get from the KOLs that we've been working with on validating our sense that we have a best-in-class next-generation technology that can help us gain significant market share at the point where we launch it into the market. Having said that, with each one of our internal growth programs, we always are alert to the possibility of either accelerating, strengthening or even replacing our internal growth program with an acquisition. So we always are looking for evaluating whether an acquisition can help us with a key strategic initiative. That puts us in the perfect position where we don't have to do an acquisition. We can be very objective and rigorous in evaluating potential acquisitions. It makes it less likely that we're going to make a bad acquisition. And knowing that we don't have to do anything, but if all the parts fall in place, we certainly have the balance sheet capability to take advantage of all of the parts falling in place if that's what's happened. So we will go forward full steam and the timeline starts out being years out but the timeline is starting to come to near term now for getting to clinical phase and getting pivotal trials underway. And we really can see our launch into the European market with two systems in the first half of 2013. And so we're good to go.

But the extent of the macro factors on the market growth in elective procedures and in the capital equipment component are clearly real and also transient. Besides that, I think you're right that we've got a product cycle disadvantage which sometimes we're on the winning side of the product cycle, sometimes we're not. I think we have a product cycle disadvantage here temporarily. And then the product cycle impact, I think, is exacerbated by the fact that we're still operating under a warning letter from FDA, and that has an impact on new product approvals. And we really don't have the same product line here in the United States currently that we have on the market in Europe. So I think when you see the European growth rate continuing right where we would like to see it at about 15% that product line it's coming to the U.S. and it's just a matter of time to get it here."

There is clearly an ASP element to our revised view of the CRM market growth. But there clearly is on the one hand. On the other hand, I would not overstate that. And a data point I would give you is that in our third quarter, our U.S. ICD sales system ASPs were actually a little bit stronger again in the third quarter of 2010 than they were in the third quarter one year ago. So it'd be very surprising to folks I'm sure and counterintuitive but true. So if you took that as one data point and it would be, that would add some balance to what's the impact of ASP pressures. So we are seeing increased pressure on ASPs. We are seeing competitors be more aggressive on price. We are seeing ASP drops in the market. We've seen more of it internationally. We've seen more of it on the low-voltage side, offset by our U.S. ICD sales in our own product line, benefiting from new technology premiums and from our particular mix versus the mix of competitors. But ASP pressure is an element of it. Another big element of it is just that Medtronic came out with CRM number. And in their last reported quarter, that was lower than any of us expected it to be. So when we factor that into what's that do to market growth, we just have to be realistic that based on everybody's reported numbers, the market's growing slower than we had previously modeled. And we can imagine reasons for that in somebody else's business. But the prudent thing for us to do is to say, the numbers are as they are. The total growth is a little bit slower than we estimated and expected one quarter ago, and now what do we say going forward. And we think it's prudent to say, going forward, let's assume that the status quo remains as it is and that the market grows a little bit slower. We can make the case for why the market ought to grow, ought to continue to grow longer-term constant currency, 4% to 6%. We especially would look to -- and when we think about that, the kinds of things that I've especially point to that people can miss. The first would be we're always talking constant currency and others sometimes are talking as reported and depending on the currency trend, that does make a difference. So we're always talking constant currency, number one. The other thing is not everybody takes into account the impact on market growth of about trying to [indiscernible](1:46:36).  Some of the market models we see are only -- take into account the results of the big three and those analyses are going to underestimate market growth when the other two companies between the two of them are taking share as they did in 2008, 2009 and in the first half of 2010. So that would be another potential, that's another component that can lead to different market models producing different results. Another very significant component here in our market model outlook is the impact of new technology. And so others cannot adequately factor in the impact of our new technology without having a complete insight into what our new product flow is over the next few years, which we don't tell people. But you can start to get a glimpse of how real the impact of new technology is in our product line alone. And so if you think about the pulmonary wedge pressure technology, think about direct left atrial pressure technology, you look at our CardioMEMS transaction, you look at our LAP technology, look at our ST segment monitoring technology, just to name a few. These are the kinds of things that can reset a premium ASP that is well justified by clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness in the same way that CRT systems reset the ASP for ICDs and in the same way that ICDs reset the premium ASPs for pacemakers as pacemakers came to have the additional technology of the high-voltage shock in them. So new technology is a particular component of long-term market model growth that has a big impact, that different people will see different ways depending on their level of insight into the flow of new leading technologies that we have in our pipelines. Another thing that I would add, point to just here on the longer-term market growth is the impact of markets like China and other significant emerging markets. So we've mentioned this before, and I think others will validate our data that in 2009, there are fewer than 2000 ICDs implanted in all of -- and for the full year in all of China. And if you kind of look at that as a disconnect between indications and disconnect between that and the state of the economy in China and the size of the growing middle class in China and a disconnect between that level of penetration in the market and the amount of investment that the Chinese government has committed to raising the bar on healthcare in China here over the next number of years, we're going to get a lot of growth out of international markets. And those who are kind of U.S. centric are going to underestimate long-term CRM market growth if they aren't close enough to these major new international markets, so those are all the things. But more than anything, it's just Medtronic came out with a bad number and we don't know what they're going to come out with here in the next quarter and for the time being, we'll just bring our expectations down."

So this is not a precedent where next quarter, people might ask what's our mix on a particular product line and expect an answer. We generally don't describe product line mix inside the sales categories that we report. However, this Unify and Fortify is extraordinary. In the third quarter, we exited the third quarter with more than, in the United States, with more than 90% of our mix of ICDs consisting of Unify and Fortify. So in the same way that I mentioned that after one month, we had an absolutely unprecedented percent of sales in that new technology. After one quarter we continued, we set a new standard of uptake of new technology. So it's absolutely a winning product line and strong component of our ASP strength, strong component of our market share growth. And it's going to be a great platform for us going forward for the next couple of years. With respect to AGA integration at a high level, at a high level, it would be appropriate to think of AGA as a bolt-on to our cardio vascular division. You might find that implied by John Barr agreeing to continue to serve as President and CEO of the AGA business unit here within St. Jude Medical. We have tremendous respect for the momentum, the breadth, the quality systems, the R&D productiveness, the manufacturing operations, and to the extent that anybody from AGA is listening and I didn't mention their function, it was not intended to be a slight. But my point is that we think very highly of the AGA team and of the condition of their operations. We're happy to stand behind those operations and have the St. Jude Medical name on them. And the highest priority for us in this integration strategy is to make sure that we do not ruin a good thing in any way at all. So we will be deliberate in looking for synergies. We know we can capture some good revenue synergies with the global distribution capabilities and footprint and product lines that we have. We know we can capture great synergies with the left atrial appendage occlusion technology, and our access with electrophysiologist. But on the cost side, we think very highly of the gross margin that AGA has been able to support on a sustainable basis. And there's a lot to like, and so think of it as a bolt-on."

Instead, our priority is to make sure that we ramp up gradually and in full control in the quality sense and with the idea that growth too fast carries risks with respect to quality. And so we are not going to err, make that mistake in anyway. We're going to be slow, deliberate, ramping up as the management team, as the infrastructure has gains the experience and has the credibility and have the track record to continue to grow more in the next year and more in the next year. And that also holds we start with the one product line in each facility with the idea that there are additional product lines we can add to the facility in future years as we establish track record and as we broaden and strengthen the local management teams.

I don't want to answer it directly from a competitive perspective, from a purely competitive perspective. I don't really want to indicate to competitors that might be listening to the call or reading the transcript, of how we're doing versus their initiatives and how was it that we're beating them and what do we think is going to happen next. I really don't want to offer that just from a purely competitive perspective. But what I could say is, generally speaking, the starting point would be to the extent that competitors are bundling in a way that's different from what we're doing, I think the starting point would be to say and how's it working for them. So if they're bundling and losing share in their reported results, and we're not and we're gaining share in our reported results, that's a better answer for you than any kind of soft information that I could provide to you. And I would say that customers are awfully smart. And they're not interested in less than their desired products. And so if the competitors, if all players in the space have commodity devices, then it's going to be price that's going to carry the day. But that's not the case and we don't expect to see that to be the case in our major markets. So technology differences have an impact not only on the cost effectiveness but on the clinical effectiveness. And clearly, there are technology differences in all of our major programs, the quality and capabilities of the field organizations, the experience levels and stability of the field organizations are major factors. There's a lot and I'm just going to bite my tongue and not say that I might say with a full head of steam to contrast our excellence versus the presentation of competitors.

Let's not do that. We've seen plenty of companies over the years, do dumb dilutive deals and we take some pride in being able to say that we haven't done one and you won't see one on our collective leadership and Board watch. The AGA acquisition, in contrast, is an accretive deal. In the first year, without synergies, it's accretive to the net adjusted earnings, if you exclude the inventory write-up due to acquisition accounting of the inventory, and so that's a baseline right there. We like accretive deals. And then the idea that we can find appropriate synergies, we like that. And then if you add to it that we have four new growth drivers already on the market in Europe, we like that. We're very interested in adding, accelerating the rate of sales growth and doing it with business that we understand. And so all of the new growth drivers of AGA that we look forward to bringing into our own program are technology and growth drivers and customer call points that we're already involved in. So you start checking these boxes and this is just a compelling acquisition for us. But none of it was with an orientation of let's do a little deal, let's do a midsize deal or let's do a big deal."
