Today, Walter and I will give you some insight into our performance for the quarter. We'll provide an update on our acquisitions and I'll give you some thoughts on our positioning for 2010. We generated solid results in the quarter and for the year. Now that market conditions have been stable and improving for three quarters, our metrics are rebounding from their low points and we're beginning to regain the earnings power of our diversified model. As we begin to derive benefits from our acquisitions and other investments and with the continuing support of our strong balance sheet and expense control, I believe we're in a good position for 2010 and beyond. Clearly, the nation still faces economic concerns, but we feel good about our ability to execute our agenda. We have emerged from 2009 stronger and with many opportunities ahead. As our fourth quarter business results demonstrate, we're driving positive trends across our segments. Our clients are continuing to gain confidence as they emerge from the long-lasting paralysis brought on by the financial crisis. During the quarter, we drove improved client growth, our advisor productivity increased nicely and our asset flows were strong across product lines. As a result of the good flows and rising markets, our asset levels increased significantly. In fact, our total owned, managed and administered assets increased to $458 billion, a 23% increase over a year ago. Just as important, our client and advisor retention continues to hold at very high levels, and the long-lasting client relationships that defined our franchise remain strong.We're also making good progress on our recent acquisitions. The Seligman and H&R Block Financial Advisors integrations are essentially complete, and each is giving us additional leverage. Seligman drove strong growth in our Hedge Fund business in 2009, and our employee advisor channel is now operating on a more efficient and productive model as a result of the H&R Block Financial Advisor acquisition. During the fourth quarter, we accomplished the last major phase of the H&R Block integration with a successful merging of our technology platforms. We also continue to feel good about our Columbia Management acquisition, and I'll give you an update on that shortly.Our strong financial foundation and prudent operating principles continue to serve us well. The balance sheet remains in excellent condition and we remain in a net unrealized gain position. We're also maintaining our capital flexibility with over $2 billion in excess capital, including the capital we raised to pre-fund the Columbia acquisition, and a strong liquidity pool $1.8 billion in free cash.In addition, we remain focused on expense control and reengineering. We accelerated our reengineering agenda in 2009 to offset the effects of weak operating conditions. And we achieved over $400 million in full year savings, with about two-thirds of those savings going to the bottom line. Walter will give you some detail on our fourth quarter expenses shortly, but I want to emphasize that we fully intend to maintain this long-term expense discipline even as conditions continue to improve. So overall, I feel quite good about our earnings trends, and I'm pleased with both our positioning and the opportunities we've created. Now I'd like to provide some insight into our segment performance. First, in Advice and Wealth Management, we reported pretax income of $18 million, and our core earnings in this segment were $35 million. Retail client assets increased 22% over a year ago, which reflects both higher markets and incremental increases in client flows. The positive trends in client activity are meeting our expectations. We knew from past downturns that retail clients would return to investing slowly and we expected the upswing to take longer this time around because of the depth and severity of the crisis.So while client activity is improving, it remains below pre-crisis levels. At the same time, we're still earning very small spreads on our cash as a result of the near-zero short-term interest rates, and these two factors have compressed our margins in the segment. If conditions remain stable, we expect the slow improvement in client trends to continue. As that occurs and if interest rates begin to rise, we'll have the opportunity to drive higher margins.We also believe that our new advertising campaign, which launched two weeks ago, will help us reach more of our target market. The campaign is built around real Ameriprise advisors and the tagline More Within Reach which brings to life the values of our close advisor-client relationships. It's a broad campaign that you will see on TV, in print and online, and we hope to expand on its multimedia possibilities going forward.Our advisors are enthusiastic about the new exposure for the brand, which they view as an important element of support we provide to help them grow their practices. We've always been focused on advisor support. And over the past two years, in particular, we made great strides in the tools, technology, marketing and other support we provide, including the new brokerage platform we began rolling out in the fourth quarter. As a result, our advisors remained satisfied and engaged, and our advisor retention rate remains very high. At the same time, advisor productivity has begun to rebound with net revenue per advisor increasing 7% compared to the sequential quarter, and with a solid increase in financial plan sales in the fourth quarter.The increase in productivity is also evident in our Wrap business, where we had net inflows of $2.6 billion. Total Wrap assets were $95 billion at year end, a 30% increase over a year ago. Our support for advisors is one of the reasons we've had success in ramping up our experienced advisor recruitment efforts. For all of 2009, we recruited 500 experienced advisors. And while we slowed the pipeline in the fourth quarter as we completed the Block integration and rollout the new brokerage platform, we still see good opportunity to bring in experienced people.You'll notice that our total advisor count decreased during the quarter. That's a result of our continued focus on productivity and the reengineering of our employee advisor group. We've been removing less-productive advisors from our system and bringing in established and more productive advisors, a strategy that should generate stronger economics over time.In the Asset Management segment, we generated a significant improvement in profitability with pretax income of $70 million or $77 million excluding integration cost. The stronger earnings were driven by net inflows, market appreciation and hedge fund performance fees. We drove total inflows of $1.4 billion for the quarter and $3.6 billion for the year, which represents a dramatic turnaround from the significant outflows during 2008. The inflows in the fourth quarter came from both the U.S. and our International business and from strong institutional net inflows. Internationally, Threadneedle built on the strength of the third quarter and delivered solid results, highlighted by strong sales and net inflows. In terms of investment performance, domestic performance continued its positive trend in the quarter, with 72% of equity funds and 80% of fixed income funds above their peer medians on an asset-weighted basis for the year. At Threadneedle, while one-year performance was down, 90% of equity funds were above the median for the three-year performance. We firmly believe the Columbia Management acquisition we announced in September will be an excellent addition to our Asset Management business, and we remain on track to close in the spring. The assets we will acquire ended the year at $186 billion, a 13% increase since we announced the deal. Our planning for integration is proceeding according to the schedule and expectations, with most personnel decisions made and communicated. We remain confident that we will be able to execute the transaction and deliver on our financial projections for the deal.The Annuities segment reported pretax income for the quarter of $157 million, and I continue to feel good about both the results and direction of that business. In variable annuities, asset balances increased to $55 billion, a 27% increase over a year ago and a 4% sequential increase. Net flows remained positive despite slower sales, as clients continue to be reluctant to enter long-dated contracts.In Fixed Annuities, our balances were up 20% compared with a year ago, but flat compared with the third quarter. Following several months of very strong fixed annuity sales through the middle of the last year, we lowered our rates in response to the changing spread environment. While we have slowed the faucet on our fixed annuity sales, higher balances in the book are continuing to generate solid returns.The Production segment generated pretax income of $129 million for the quarter. Life insurance in force remained at $193 billion, which is flat compared with last year. Sales were weak for most of the year. But during the fourth quarter, we saw early signs of improvement in variable universal life sales, as well as continued strong sales in UL. The overall book of Insurance business remains very solid, and it continues to generate strong returns.I should point out an ongoing strength in Auto and Home. This business continued its steady growth with another 9% year-over-year increase in policy count, and it continued to deliver solid margins. In total, as I look across our businesses, I'm seeing improvements in our key metrics with client activity, advisor productivity and asset flows all pointing in the right direction.To wrap up, as I think about the very volatile period that began in 2008, I feel good about where we stand today. It's been a tough time, but we're emerging a stronger firm, and rather than having to fix problems, we are focusing on realizing the opportunities we've created. I believe we're positioned well for 2010. We have solid and improving business fundamentals, a promising opportunity ahead through our Columbia acquisition, a strong balance sheet including appropriate excess capital and liquidity and an ongoing commitment to prudent expense management. While we obviously don't know where the markets and the economy will head this year, especially considering the weak January, I feel comfortable with our ability to navigate the conditions. Now I'll turn it over to Walter. And later, we'll take your questions."

We've posted slides in our website again this quarter, and they'll be updated with my talking points after the call. Please turn to Slide 3. As Jim mentioned, we're pleased with the fundamental strength of our business and our improved finance financial performance. Let me take you through the highlights.Fourth quarter 2009 reported earnings per diluted share were $0.90 compared to a net loss last year, and core operating earnings were $0.91 in the quarter. We generated double-digit net revenue growth driven by strong fee and spread-based businesses. G&A expenses remained well controlled. We met our fourth quarter and full year expense targets, and remain committed to effective expense management and our balance sheet remains strong.Let me talk you through each of these points in more detail. Please turn to Slide 4. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2009 was $237 million compared to a loss a year ago. Earnings per diluted share in the quarter were $0.90 compared to a loss of $1.69 last year. I should note that the current year's quarter EPS calculation included 36 million shares we issued to pre-fund the Columbia acquisition. We will not capture the earnings from the acquisition until we close. So for year-over-year comparison, we are showing you the adjusted EPS, excluding the shares issued for the acquisition of $1.04.As for core results, we established the core earnings concept to help segregate the impact of the market dislocations from the underlying business trends. And recently, to provide transparency in year-over-year comparisons. In 2010, we will transition to focus on reported earnings, excluding integration costs primarily for the Columbia acquisition. That said, we will continue to provide the same level of transparency and factors impacting earnings. In summary, earnings growth was solid, with strong revenue growth driven by the business trends, favorable market comparisons and expense controls.On Slide 5, we show revenue growth trends. Year-over-year net revenue, excluding realizing gains and losses, increased 29%. Management and financial advice fees grew 41%, with about a third of the growth coming from market. The remainder was driven by business growth, positive flows in Asset Management and wrap accounts and strong hedge fund performance. Distribution fees grew 17%, while a portion of these fees are asset based and impacted by the market, the portion related to client activity is still below pre-crisis levels. Net investment income, excluding realized gains and losses, was up 37%, driven by higher fixed annuity balances due to the strong fixed annuity flows in the first half of the year, as well as benefits from repositioning our portfolio and cash during 2009. Net investment income growth does not reflect equity-driven returns in hedge funds or alternative investments, but rather base revenues generated from the bond portfolio.Please turn to Slide 6. Our improving revenue picture also reflects our growth in assets. Owned, managed and administered assets were $458 billion at year end, up 23% or $86 billion year-over-year. Owned assets grew $5 billion or 16%, primarily due to the market's impact on non-prop separate account assets as well as business growth. Managed Assets in both Wrap Accounts and the Asset Management segment grew 23% or $61 billion. Market appreciation drove a substantial portion of the increase, with $13 billion driven from net flows in 2009. This is a substantial improvement from the $23 billion in net outflows in 2008. And Administered assets, primarily brokerage accounts, grew 26% or $20 billion, driven by both markets and retail inflows.Let's turn to the next slide. In spite of slower overall client activity, average per advisor productivity has seen a steady increase over the past several quarters and is up 18% in the current quarter. This is primarily driven by market appreciation and improvements in client activity and the actions we've taken to improve our advisor productivity. As a result of these actions, our overall advisor count is down 4% from a year ago, consistent with our efforts to reengineer our employee advisor platform.Advisors must meet productivity requirements, and the vast majority of departing advisors had less than $50,000 in annual production. However, we've also seen solid growth in experienced advisor recruiting. As we stated, more than 500 experienced advisors joined the firm last year. In fact, productivity of the new advisors is over four x the departing advisors, which is contributing to our productivity growth.Let's turn to Page 8. I want to spend a few minutes on our general and administrative expense line. It is important that you understand the various movements to get a picture of the underlying trends. Core G&A, which excludes market and integration impacts, increased $129 million year-over-year. However, on a fully normalized basis, G&A is down approximately 6% for the quarter and 10% for the full year.I want to provide insight into the items we take out to get normalized trends. You saw that we booked strong hedge fund earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009, which also includes the related compensation. In addition, the year-over-year increase in G&A is distorted by the decrease in performance-based compensation in the fourth quarter of 2008 when our overall firm-wide performance suffered due to the market. In 2009, we had the reverse impact due to the strong year-end performance. Both of these items are timing issues and are not expected to carry into the first quarter. We also had accelerated business investments, systems and marketing, and other expenses including a legal settlement. Normalized for these impacts, we achieved our expectations of a fourth quarter 6% to 8% decline in G&A expenses as well as a full year 10% decline. This brings us to our balance sheet discussion on Slide 9. We continue to maintain strong balance sheet fundamentals. Our excess capital position is over $2 billion or over $1 billion when factoring in the capital for the Columbia acquisition. RiverSource Life ended 2009 with an estimated RBC ratio of more than 400%. Our investment portfolio remains well diversified and high quality, we reported a $700 million unrealized gain at year end.Our capital ratios are strong. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 19.5% or 14.5% when excluding non-recourse debt and the credit for the hybrids. We continue to maintain a prudent liquidity position. We ended the year with $1.8 billion in free cash and over $900 million in cash at the holding company. In addition, we expect to take a material dividend from the Life Co. in the first quarter. And finally, our variable annuity hedging continues to perform well.In closing, we had a solid quarter. Our business metrics are headed in the right direction and our foundation remains strong. While markets continue to evolve, we will monitor them closely to make sure we are managing prudently within the context of the environment. We are well positioned and focused on execution. With that, I'll turn it back to the operator so we can answer your questions. Operator?"

First of all, I think, as I said, we're seeing very good trends in the AWM business from an advisor perspective productivity. But one of the things that it's hard to glean from, on the absolute numbers, is we've gone through a pretty major transformation last year.  I mean we've moved for more of a novice-employee network to an experienced, both the integration of Block with over 900 advisors plus 500 experienced recruits. Now during that cycle, we've also had to change out from being in the novice business and all the costs around that, and the real estate and how we do that to recruitment of experienced people. We also had to deal with the integration of the Block in a very down market. And so though the revenues disappeared last year, the expenses were still there and carrying two systems. The fourth quarter, those two systems came together. We closed about 44 offices, we integrated the technology onto a brand-new platform, we started -- we made change in a lot of the leadership and the organization there and combining and putting a number of people, laid off, in that regard. So I think we've come through that in a good way. We also had the hiring costs of bringing in those experienced people that hit last year. So all those things are embedded in our AWM P&L, and what I would call a reduced market. I mean some of those fees start looking come back in the fourth quarter, but we also had a lot of that integration hitting as well in the fourth quarter and carrying the two operating environments.

And so overall, economically for us, it will add to our margin over the next number of years. It's not after the three years that it will just kick in. But as I said, there's always a ramp-up time, they don't come in and automatically day one, produce like they were producing from when they left. And in addition to that, the comment was really around, this is a market that even our current advisors as we know are slowly ramping up again. It's not as though everyone's fully productive to where they were prior to the cycle. So it's a combination of those factors, but this will give us much better economics over time than when we had a few thousand novices in our system.

Thanks for joining us for our first quarter earnings discussion. During this call, I will go into give you some insight into our performance for the quarter.

During this call, I will go into give you some insight into our performance for the quarter. I’ll also provide an update on our pending Columbia acquisition and I will discuss our positioning for the rest of the year. Walter will give you more detail on the quarter and our financial statements.
Let's begin. As our first quarter results demonstrate, we’re generating positive business momentum. While client and advisory activity still have not returned to pre-crisis levels, markets have continue to strengthen and it’s evident that our clients are slowly gaining confidence in the financial environment. During the quarter, we grew our client base, our advisor productivity increased nicely and we saw continued strengthen wrap net flows.
Just as important, our client and advisory retention remained at high levels and the long lasting client relationships that define our franchise are strong. The good friends in our business and the rising markets contributed to solid results for the quarter. The $215 million in operating earnings we reported today marks our best first quarter ever.
In fact, we are approaching the earnings levels we are achieving before the financial crisis and the recession began. For the quarter, our operating net revenues were 25% compared with a year ago and our total owned, managed and administered assets increased to $463 billion, a 31% increase.
Our strong financial foundation and prudent operating principals continue to serve us well. The balance sheet remains in excellent condition and we are maintaining on capital flexibility. We have over $2.5 billion in excess capital including the capital we raced to pre-fund the Columbia acquisition and a strong liquidity pool of $4.3 billion in free cash. I should note that yesterday we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend.
In addition, we remain focused on expense control and re-engineering. We are continuing to make investments for growth. For example, we have committed resources to our marketing campaign and new brokerage platform among other important kind of initiatives, but as we invest, we are maintaining our expense discipline just as we have in the past. While distribution expenses grew as a result of our stronger sales in the quarter, our controllable expenses remain well managed.
The recovery in our client metrics continues to be gradual and clients clearly don't fully trust the economic rebound. But as we continue to build on our steady progress in combination with closing our acquisition and integrating Columbia Management into the company, I feel good about our overall positioning and our ability to execute our agenda.
Before I provide a greater context for our performance, I would like to note that we have presented operating earnings on both a consolidated basis and by segment. Operating earnings exclude the impacts of the required accounting change, which requires consolidation on our balance sheet of client assets and certain investment entities. This rule change results on no financial impact on our financial strength or business.
Operating earnings also exclude integration cost and realize investment gains or losses. We believe this measure gives you a clear picture of our performance and we will continue to provide this disclosure going forward.
Now I will move on to a discussion of the segment performance. First, in Advice and Wealth Management. We reported pretax operating income of $54 million compared with a loss in a very different market environment we faced last year. Retail client assets increased 31% over a year ago which reflects both higher markets and incremental increase in client flows. This led to an increase of 20% in segment operating net revenues and a 6% pretax operating margin in the segment for the quarter, the best margin for Advise and Wealth Management since the second quarter of 2008.
The More Within Reach advertising campaign was launched in January and which is built around our advisors has driven our brand awareness up to 62% which is an all time high. Our advisors are enthusiastic about the new exposure for the brand, which they prove as an important element of support we provide to help them grow their practices.
As a result of this and the other investments, we are making to support them, the advisor remained satisfied and engaged and our advisor retention rate remains very high. At the same time advisor productivity continues to rebound with operating net revenue per advisor increasing 25% compared with a year ago.
The increase in productivity is also evidence in our wrap business where we had net inflows of $2.5 billion and 93% increase over a year ago. Total wrap assets were approximately $1 billion at quarter end, another all time high. While flows in long-term contracts remain challenged as I will discuss shortly, we are quite encouraged by the steady in wrap. This indicates the clients are seeking broad based advice portfolio diversity.
You will notice that our total advisory count decrease during the quarter. That’s a result of our continued focus on productivity. For quite some time now, less productive advisors have been leaving the system and we have been bringing in established and more productive advisors. We slowed our recruitment efforts in the fourth quarter and into this year as we completed H&R Block integration and introduce our new brokerage platform which will provide advisors with technology that will be among the best in the industry.
At the same time, the environment for recruiting experienced advisors has changed quite significantly compared with a year ago when many firms in the industry were in trouble and advisors were actually looking for a stable company and brand. Fewer advisors are switching firms now that conditions are stable. That said, our value proposition is appealing to a significant share recruits and our field leaders and recruiters are again ramping up their efforts.
While we did not bring in as many recruits as we did in the first quarter of last year, our recruiting pipeline is beginning to build again. In asset management, we generated pretax operating income of $22 million which includes a $27 million expense relating to significant come back in Threadneedle’s estimated market valuation which Walter will address.
Excluding the Threadneedle item, the segment’s operating earnings would have been $49 million and its pretax operating margin would have been 13%. Operating net revenues increased 40% over a year ago. The stronger results were driven by market appreciation as well as inflows of the past year and significant reductions in controllable expenses.
In terms of asset flows, we recorded total net outflows of approximately $800 million, but if we exclude Zurich related institutional outflows and Threadneedle and some expected dis-synergy outflows related to the Columbia transaction, we would have been solidly in net inflows.
In the domestic business, equity mutual funds remain in outflows. While many of us in the industry expected investors to return the sideline cash to equities, this development has not fully occurred despite the strength of the markets. Investors remain cautious and continue to seek what they consider consistent returns rather than accept higher level of risk, a trend that underscores the depth and impact of the crisis.
In our domestic institutional business, we lost a few clients as we expect that we would as part of the process of combining Columbia's management team with ours. Nevertheless, domestic institutional sales were quite good and net flows were positive. Internationally, Threadneedle delivered another strong quarter highlighted by strong sales and retail net inflows of $1.3 billion. Even with the Zurich outflows, total Threadneedle net flows were positive in the quarter.
In terms of investment performance, we continue to see positive trends in the domestic equity performance with 78% of equity funds above the Lipper peer medians on an asset weighted basis for the year. At Threadneedle, 93% of equity funds were above medium for both three and five year performance.
We continue to believe that Columbia Management acquisition will be an excellent addition to the Asset Management business. We expect to close on May 1st and we continue to expect the final purchase price to be approximately $1 billion. Similar to our experience in the domestic institutional business, Columbia experience net outflows and low margin institutional counts that certain clients did not consent to change investment advisors. Again, this was a development we expected. Nevertheless, the total assets we will acquire ended the quarter at $189 billion, a 15% increase since we announced the deal.
Our planning our integration is proceeding according to schedule and expectation and we remain confident that we will be able to execute the transaction and deliver on our financial projections for the deal. From an operating perspective, Ted Truscott and his management team are very pleased with the talented investment professionals we have assembled to lead our funds post close. We will soon have a powerful Asset Management with strong performing funds in every style box.
The annuity segment reported pretax operating income for the quarter of $17 million, up slightly from a year ago. Walter will walk through the details of the segments earnings. In variable annuities, asset balances increased to $15 billion, a 37% increase over a year ago and a 3% sequential increase.
Net inflows were low at $98 million in the quarter, consistent with the generally slow sales environment in the industry and because our advisors were awaiting a pending product enhancement in another new product launch, we believe sales will pick up again as clients confidence in the market continues to grow and as these products are introduced.
In fixed annuities, our balances were $15 billion, up 6% from last year. As we told you last quarter, fixed annuity sales slowed in response to the current rate environment. While balances are expected to gradually decline in the coming quarters, the book is continuing to generate solid returns.
The protection segment generated pretax operating income of $118 million for the quarter, up 13% compared with last year. Sales started to improve in the fourth quarter, remain steady through the early part of this year. In fact, VUL and UL sales combined were up 64% compared with a year ago. While we still haven't returned to pre-crisis levels, we are seeing slow and steady progress.
The auto and home business continue to generate steady growth with another quarter of 9% year-over-year growth in policy counts. The overall book of insurance business continues to generate strong returns.
In total, as I look across our businesses, while flows haven't yet returned in all product categories, I am seeing improvement in our metrics, decline activity and advisory productivity trending positively and with assets and account balances rising. I believe we are positioned well for the remainder of the year. Our business fundamentals are improving slowly but steadily. We remain excited about the opportunities that Columbia acquisition and our other investments present and our financial foundation expense controls remain strong.
To wrap up, I feel good about where we stand today. We are focused on realizing the opportunities we created through the recession and we have a clear vision of how we intend to do that.
Now, I will turn it over to Walter and later we will take your questions.

4165019,99131303,57847,"Ameriprise Financial Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-27-2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Ameriprise Financial, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jim. We post the slides in our website again this quarter and they will be updated with my talking points after the call. Please take a moment to review the Safe Harbor on page two and then turn to slide three.This was a good quarter for us. Rep",1500,"Thanks, Jim. We post the slides in our website again this quarter and they will be updated with my talking points after the call. Please take a moment to review the Safe Harbor on page two and then turn to slide three.
This was a good quarter for us. Reported and operating earnings per share were $0.81. We had good operating revenue and continued strong expense management that drove improved managers. All of our operating segments also reported solid performance and our balance sheet and liquidity continue to remain solid.
Turning to page four, in the quarter, the company has introduced new operating measures to provide additional transparency to our underlying business results. The operating result exclude the impact of three items.
One, a new accounting standard that required additional consolidation of certain investment entities onto our financial statements. While these changes impact our balance sheet and income statement, our exposure to these entities is unchanged and there is no impact on the underlying business. While the new rule allows net income to be reported as non-controlling interest, equity must still be reported in the retained earnings. This will be a separate line item and it will add transparency.
Second, acquisition related income, of course, and finally, net realized gains or losses. Our operating net revenue of $2.1 billion for the quarter represents an increase of 25% compared with last year. And our operating PTI of $281 million is 85% higher than the first quarter of 2009. While we realized only minimal Columbia related integration of course in the quarter, these integration expenses are on target to total approximately $100 million by year end.
Please turn to the next slide. You can see that the net income or loss attributable to the non-controlling interest is eliminated for both years, resulting in reported net income of $214 million for the quarter. EPS of $0.81 and return on equity of 9.3%. Our operating net income is 62% better than last year, while EPS is 35% higher than the first quarter of 2009.
The return on equity, which excludes additional equity relating to CIEs is 9.7%. Excluding the shares related to the pre-funding for the Columbia Management acquisition, adjusted EPS would be $0.94 and adjusted to return on equity would be 10.6%.
For future reference, we notice in your estimates that is many of you excluded the seasonal issuance of share in the first quarter related to long-term center plans. We issued $2.7 million share in the first quarter of 2010, and 3.1 million in the same period of 2009.
On the next slide, operating net revenue growth was strong at 25% and revenues have been on a strong trajectory over the past five quarters. Keep in mind the fourth quarter of last year includes hedge fund performance fees, which we always booked in the fourth quarter.
Underlying improved revenues were strong management fees driven by markets and flows over the past year. Distribution fee growth is impacted by markets as well, but continues to be moderated by the slow recovery in client activity. Management, advise and distribution fees were up 36% over a year ago and down 6% sequentially due to hedge fund performance fees recognized in the fourth quarter.
Excluding those performance fees, management's fees are up sequentially as you would expect. Premiums have been stable up 6% over a year ago and down 2% sequentially. And net investment income reflect a strong growth in fixed annuity balance is year-over-year, as well as impact of redeploying cash at attractive yields during the first half of 2009.
Net investment income was up 26% over the first quarter of 2009 and down 2% compared with the prior quarter. Expenses also continued to be well managed, with the benefits of our reengineering program, funding investments and increasing our operating leverage to the markets.
As Jim said, we are making many investments for growth including the new advertising campaign and brokerage platform. Just as revenue in the fourth quarter are skewed by hedge fund performance fees so too, are expenses. In the form of compensation paid in relation to the strong performance.
In the first quarter of 2010, investment performance and center accruals are also higher year-over-year. Excluding these timing impacts, G&A is actually down. Overall though, despite strong rising markets and good business growth. Our G&A expenses remain under control and flat to last year.
On the next slide, I would like to address the segments. First AWM, here you will see that we are making strong progress on margins and Advice & Wealth Management segment. In fact, the 6.1% operating margin this quarter is the highest in nearly two years. This improvement is driven by record wrap balances, stronger distribution fees, even though longer dated decline activity continues to be below pre-crisis levels and reduction in general and administrative expenses 7% year-over-year, reflecting very strong expense management as well as the full integration of the H&R Block acquisition.
In the asset management segment, we are making strong progress toward our margin goals. Our operating margin in the segment was 6% or 13% if we exclude the unusual $27 million expense related to Threadneedle's evaluation. The expense is driven by a more than doubling a Threadneedle's evaluation of over a year ago, which is extremely unusual, but of course it’s good news.
As the value of the business arises, so to our commitments the Threadneedle employees and center plan and because of the accounting, we recognize a full year's change in value in the first quarter upon completion of the evaluation rather than amortizing over time.
Last year declines in Threadneedle evaluation benefited earnings by $10 million. The PTI and revenue growth in the segment reflects market improves, net inflows over the year, a moved to higher fee business at Threadneedle and stronger expense control.
Please turn to slide 10, which about the annuity segment. Last year annuity segment profits were impacted by dislocation in the markets. We had large numbers improving both directions from inversion, credit spreads widening, death benefits and other impacts. This makes a comparison to 2010 difficult.
Focusing on what happened in the 2010 quarter, there are two key trends you need to be aware of in assessing this quarter's annuities PTI. Lower net investment income and higher benefit swing. We are implementing a new portfolio allocation program for valuable annuities, which we call enhanced portfolio navigator that will ship a long portion of fixed accounts from general accounts to separate accounts and establish a fund to fund structure that will provide us with daily of underlying fund investments.
This will allow us to match our hedge assets much closer to the underlying investment to continue to mitigate basis risk. To ship asset to separate accounts, we liquidated about $600 million in general account assets, which negatively impacted net investment income by about $5 million and resulted in about $30 million in realized gains.
We offset these realized gains primarily in the general account backing fixed annuities, strengthening the entire portfolio. The increase in benefit was driven by the mark-to-market of the hedge variable annuities benefits driven by model changes FAS 157 non-economic impacts and basis risk. While, there is a material DAC offset of the mark-to-market living benefit. It was mitigated by the accelerated DAC amortization driven by gains and valuable annuities. The offsetting losses and fixed annuities did not have a material DAC impact.
On the next slide, the protection segment continues to generate stable revenues and earnings. While, we still haven't seen activity are come back to pre-crisis levels sales are up year-over-year. In the quarter, claims were marginally higher in the auto and home business relating to weather events. But these impacts were partially offset by improved benefit expense in the life and health lines.
On next slide, we continue to effetely manage our balance sheet fundamentals. We hold excess capital of $2.5 billion, which includes approximately $1 billion we will use to fund the Columbia purchase next week. And we have a sizeable liquidity pool. During the quarter, we issued $750 million in debt, raised cash to $600 million to implement the enhanced variable annuity portfolio allocation product and increased cash to facilitate the payment of $450 million in dividend from the life company to the holding company.
In the near-term, we will use cash to close on Columbia, transfer cash to separate accounts in variable annuities and we pay $340 million in debt in November. As of March 31, post to dividend to the holding company, our estimated RBC ratio was well above 4 100%. And our invested asset portfolio remains strong.
We had unrealized gain position of approximately $1 billion. Our balance sheet ratios continue to remain conservative. Lastly a variable annuity hedge fund continues to be effective, good operating leverage and we are making progress toward our financial goals. Our balance sheet remains strong including our capital and liquidity position. And overall, we believe we are well-positioned. Now, we will take questions.

We are not back to the productivity levels we were at pre-crisis yet. Now, I was looking at, I mean, the asset fees are coming back more quickly because of the market appreciation. Some of the transaction revenue is still down, like on some of these longer-term contracts that we think we are starting to see some increase and in greater activity. We have been gaining clients over the course of the year and that has been adding to our overall client activity, as well. So I would want to see the revenue per advisor continue to increase and probably in the double-digit category, low to mid-double digits, in that sense and really starting to get back to more of a full-fledged activity across their book of business. And I think we are starting to see some of that increase as we come and, of course, what will be important here is continued stability in the markets. So as the markets continue to be less volatile, client activity will come back as clients feel more comfortable to put more dollars to work.
So we are seeing dollars go back already into the wrap programs, which are shorter-term type of contracts, meaning that we can always rebalance them more quickly. As they move into longer-term contracts, that money becomes pretty much locked up, even though we can reallocate the balances, people still feel a little like they want access. That is why we still have strong cash balances. But I would continue to focus on the continued rise in revenue per advisor. Now, we have been taking out and losing some of the lower-producing advisors, but the people we are bringing in are much higher in production. And overall, the overall production has gone up tremendously. So, we said 25% per advisor, but it is overall 20% as we look at the total across the house, as well.

I think on one end, I continue to feel - if you are asking me am I feeling a bit more positive, the answer would with absolutely yes based on market conditions being more stable and no one is necessarily at the higher level predicting a double dip here. And more stability in the markets gives me more confidence, because we are more of a retail client driven than institutional activity. So, that is all positive.
I would also say, I am quite more positive because the Columbia now is about to close. And I think we spent the last three or four months since we spoke last in our financial community meeting, there was a lot of work going on, to do and integrate and the people line up. And all of that has gone really well from our perspective consistent with what we thought would be really good. So the combination of those factors and I think, as you start to see, like the Advice and Wealth has come back a bit. There is a lot of questions around that in the last quarter of whether we will continue to see some improvement and we are seeing some of that improvement, as well. So the answer to your question would be yes, I am feeling a bit more positive. Under our belt of traction that we are see in progress made. There is always a lot of work to get to where we said we would ideally want to get to, but we are continuing to move it along.

I will have to go back and I'll check, but I think the answer is, the EPP targets at two factors. One, it has an approximation of around 10% of the profitability. And then you have a change in evaluation that then drives it. So that is basically what drives the element. Here, obviously in this quarter and this year, because of the change, it took the valuation portion of it way above. Does that answer?

You discussed repeatedly in this call, how client activity is beginning to recover. My question, where do you best see this in your reported numbers? Specifically, the wrap is doing well but it had been doing well. Essentially, you had been running at about a $2.5 billion rate for several quarters. The Retail Mutual Fund business in the U.S. has negative flows and of course, you have your institution - well, why don't I just end it there.

So, Eric, I think there is a combination of things that you could look at. One is the operating revenue per advisor, you can see it has increased nicely and it's consistent where we were at sort of the year-end overall. But that is the first thing that is up significantly from the previous quarters. Second is our overall flows and certain client activities improved. So if you look at the wrap assets, as you mentioned, the numbers up at $100 billion, we've received good inflows over the last few quarters again, et cetera.
The other thing that I would probably say is that even though we say it is not fully recovered, there is client activity back. And you could see that money moving from some to have cash balances, some activity picking up. You can see some of the insurance sales increasing. We also have brokerage activity that has increased tremendously on some of the transaction activity. So there is that gradual progression that we see. The issue that we are saying, if you go back to pre-crisis, we had more advisors more fully active against the balance of the full book.
So for us, as an example, last year we had strong activity in fixed annuities. Variable was there, but it wasn't as strong and right now variable is a little slower than we usually have and fixed, actually, because we haven't actually put higher rates out to the market because the interest rate environment, is a bit low. So some of that activity that we receive in there is not there. Now, I think variable will start to come back as we get some of the newer product out there and we are starting to see some pick-up right now for some of the enhancement we put out already in April. So I think it is a combination of factors, but you can see steady quarters from the quarters previous.

So things have come back. People are putting money to work, but having said that, I don't think that if you speak to people that you know, people are feeling go-go about the markets or putting all of their money at risk again or locking it down.

The second question is, post the close of this deal are there going to be any incentives in the place for the Bank America distribution that originated these asset to keep the Columbia funds in place? What I am getting at is, I know the earn-out goes away on net flows post the close of the deal. So is there risk here that we see some fall-off in retention for that asset pool on the Columbia side from a retail standpoint? I know you addressed the institutional side.

We are talking about what has occurred at Columbia. And of course, we said that whatever it is pre-close will be in the price, adjusted one way or the another in net inflows or outflows. What Walter is talking about with you is the net negative potential expense savings as well as the synergies on the revenue side, which we factored in post-close. So that if assets were to leave us, we had estimated a number for that. So, as an example, we lost $600 million in the first quarter from RiverSource, that is part of what we estimated for RiverSource as we went forward. For Columbia, the amounts that we have included in this synergy hasn't occurred yet, because we didn't close the transaction.
So we do have a plan in case in case that happens as part of our plan in numbers. But having said that, we are planning that there may be some further dislocation that occurs, and we have factored that into our analysis up front. Now, maybe that will not occur and we are hoping it doesn't or it can occur over the next number of quarters as we had originally planned. We don't see any reason why it should be greater than what we had planned at this point in time. So that is as best I can tell you at this point.

Thanks for joining us for our second quarter earnings discussion. Today, Walter and I will give you some insight into our results for the quarter.

Today, Walter and I will give you some insight into our results for the quarter. We’ll discuss the progress we’re making across our businesses and we’ll give you an update on the Columbia acquisition. Let’s get started.
This was a strong quarter for us. Despite the market declines we experienced in May and June, all four of our business segments performed well highlighted by continued margin improvement in our more fee-based segments - Advice & Wealth Management and Asset Management. We drove stronger client activity and advisor productivity. We made solid progress in our integration of Columbia Management and we experienced good sales trends in both production and annuities.
The positive momentum in the business contributed to operating earnings of $291 million for the quarter, an increase of a 172% compared to a year ago. Operating net revenues were $2.4 billion, a 27% increase over a year ago.
Our operating earnings and revenues, both reached all-time high, which of course reflects the benefits of the acquisitions we’ve made but also demonstrates that the business is returning to its pre-crisis profitability levels.
Total owned, managed, and administered assets increased to a highest level ever at $600 billion, which includes the Columbia assets. Our strong financial foundation and prudent operating principles continue to serve us well. The balance sheet remains in excellent condition, and our capital and liquidity positions continue to provide a great deal of flexibility.
In fact, during the quarter, we received a new stock repurchase authorization from our Board. We subsequently took advantage of the market opportunity and bought back 5.7 million shares for approximately $220 million. Going forward, we’ll continue to balance opportunities to buy shares with external factors.
In addition, we are maintaining our reengineering and expense focus, and we continue to reinvest the portion of our savings to drive growth initiatives. In the quarter, while distribution expenses increased along with advisor productivity, our controllable expenses remained well managed.
Now I’ll discuss our segment performance. First, in Advice & Wealth Management, we reported pre-tax operating earnings of $88 million compared with $21 million a year ago and $54 million last quarter. Our pre-tax operating margin in the segment was up 3% sequentially to 9.1%.
Our advisors remain satisfied and engaged and our retention rates remain high, especially among our most productive advisors. We continue to provide a high standard of advisor support, technology and tools as well as marketing and training.
We’re continuing the phased rollout of our new brokerage platform, which is one of our largest current investments. It provides advisors with important additional capabilities. Advisor productivity continues to rebound in the quarter, with operating revenue per advisor increasing 32% over a year ago and 12% sequentially.
At $83,000 of operating revenue per advisor for the quarter, our productivity has returned to pre-crisis levels. During the quarter, clients continued to increase their activity.
For example, in our wrap business we recorded another quarter of net inflows of more than $2 billion, and brokerage volumes increased. Of course, more recent market conditions could be worst as positive trend. If the downward market movement continues, clients can once again seek safety. Client confidence has rebounded somewhat, but given the depth and duration of the recession, we believe confidence is still quite fragile.
You’ll notice that our advisor count declined again this quarter. As we’ve told you in the past, we strongly focused on productivity and less productive advisors are leaving the system. While experienced advisor recruiting slowed in the quarter, we remained focused on bringing in more productive advisors and we believe we have a compelling offer and value proposition.
In Asset Management, we generated pre-tax operating earnings of $104 million compared with $3 million loss a year ago. The segment’s pre-tax operating margin was 18.5%, the highest level we’ve achieved in this business in several years.
These results, obviously, reflect two months’ of earnings from the combined Columbia Management Organization, but also demonstrate improved profitably in our legacy business.
Our global assets on the management in this segment increased 40% due to the acquisition. In terms of asset flows, we reported total domestic net outflows of approximately $4.6 billion. On the surface, we realized the outflow seems significant, but we feel very comfortable with where we stand.
While we would, of course, like to see stronger equity markets to help drive assets to our funds, the flows in business results are right in line with what we expect it when we close the transaction. Walter, will provide detail to help you understand the flows picture shortly.
Overseas, Threadneedle moved to net outflows, mostly from low margins Zurich assets, return to slight outflows in retail funds resulted from the significant volatility the European markets experienced during the quarter. In terms of investment performance, short-term domestic performance slipped somewhat due to the high quality bias of our portfolios.
Longer term numbers look good and international performance remained very strong. We are comfortable with the current performance trends and we believe the Columbia product platform will be well positioned to deliver consistent competitive performance.
The integration of the acquisition is proceeding according to plan and on budget, and we remain confident that we’ll able to execute the transaction and deliver on our financial projections.
Just as important, we continue to feel very good about the benefits Columbia is giving us. We feel good about our ability over time to realize the significant distribution in wholesaling opportunities, and when we complete fund mergers in the coming months, we will have a deep and compelling product platform.
Moving to Annuities, the segment reported pre-tax operating earnings of $129 million, an increase of 50% over a year ago and 10% sequentially. This segment’s operating revenues increased also to $626 million for the quarter. In variable annuities, we generated net inflows despite a continued challenging environment for sales.
We launched a new product enhancement about two weeks ago, and we believe the advisors were awaiting the latest generation of variable annuity offering, which temporarily muted sales. Early indications for the new product are positive.
The fixed annuity business remained very stable, even though the current rate environment continues to be unfavorable to new fixed annuity sales. The larger book that we accumulated last year continues to generate solid returns.
The Protection segment produced pre-tax operating earnings of $134 million for the quarter, 21% better than a year ago and 14% ahead of the sequential quarter. Sales improved across product lines, especially in variable and fixed universal life and expenses remained well controlled.
The auto and home business continued its steady growth trajectory with policy accounts increasing 9% over a year ago. Overall, our book of insurance business continues to generate strong returns. So, as I look across our businesses, all four segments are performing well, and we’re realizing the value inherent in our diversified and integrated model.
Of course, we continue to monitor the environment closely. The economic recovery still feels fragile and as you’ve seen, markets remain quite volatile. While equity markets have recovered a bit in July, they were very weak in May and June. Clearly, a sustained market decline of renewed macroeconomic problems would impact our asset base fees client activity and profitability to some degree.
That said, our business fundamentals have improved steadily for several quarters now. We’re beginning to realize value from our acquisitions and our financial foundation expense discipline remains strong. We’re making good, consistent progress towards our goals and we’re clearly focused on realizing opportunities we created for the Company.
Now, I’ll turn it over to Walter and later we’ll take your questions.

We posted slides on our website again this quarter, and they will be updated with my talking points after the call. Please take a moment to review the Safe Harbor Statement on page 2, and then turn to slide 3.
This was a strong quarter for Ameriprise. Reported EPS was $0.98 and operating earnings per share were $1.10. We generated strong top line growth along with continued expense management, which resulted in improved margins. All four of our operating segments generated solid PTI and margin results and we maintained our strong balance sheet fundamentals.
Now on the next slide, in the quarter, our operating earnings were $291 million or $1.10 per share. Our operating return on equity, excluding AOCI was 11.4%. This substantial improvement was generated by higher equity markets, benefits of our reengineering activities, and the acquisition of Colombia Management.
This operating performance in the quarter included the following items; the 12% decline in the S&P 500 resulted in a higher DAC amortization impact of $0.09 per share. In the second quarter, we realized $0.08 per share benefit for revising certain calculations in our DAC and DSIC valuation models.
Widening credit spreads impacted the liability valuation of our hedged living benefits, increasing earnings by $0.06 per share and finally, a contribution to support our legacy 2a-7 funds increased expenses by $0.02.
On the next slide, operating net revenue growth was strong at 27%. Revenues have been on an upward trajectory over the past five quarters. Excluding the Colombia acquisition, revenue would have been up 18% driven by primarily higher markets, positive retail flows, and increased client activity.
Let’s turn to expenses, we continue to effectively manage our expense base. Operating, general and administrative expenses grew 13%, however normalized for Columbia’s ongoing operating cost and other items, primarily 2a-7 reimbursement and last year’s legal reserve increases. These expenses increased only 4%.
On the next slide, I’ll turn to the segments. This was an excellent quarter for Advise & Wealth Management. Pre-tax operating earnings were $88 million in the quarter, and the operating margins have improved from 2.6% a year ago to 9.1% this quarter.
Year-over-year earnings growth and margin expansions were driven by growth in average fee-based assets, driven by the daily average S&P up 27% and wrap net inflows of over $10 billion.
Lower operating, general and administrative expenses reflect strong expense management, partially offset by continuing investment in marketing and in the new brokerage platform, and finally, improvement in client activity, although it continues to below pre-crisis levels.
On the next slide, you can see we also had strong performance in our Asset Management segment. Asset Management generated pre-tax operating earnings of $104 million and an operating margin of 18.5% in the quarter.
Earnings and margins benefited from year-over-year market appreciation and expense management, and of course, the addition of Columbia. Our legacy Asset Management margins improved to 15.9% in the quarter. These results reflect continued strong investment performance by levels of retention of our investment professionals and our broad product platform by type and style.
Now, let me give you some color on asset inflows, please turn to the next slide. At the end of June, AUM from the Columbia acquisition was $166 billion. In May and June, market depreciation was $13.5 billion and we experienced $4 billion in net outflows. Legacy outflows in the quarter was $600 million, resulting in a total U.S. net outflow of $4.6 billion.
Institutional net outflows were $2.5 billion. The vast majority of these outflows related to a single low yielding account, where the client diversified into multiple managers. So while we kept the mandate, our portion was cut. We feel good overall about the institutional business with strong asset retention and many mandate wins during the quarter.
Retail experienced $2.3 billion net outflows. We had approximately $700 million in net outflows from platform changes, primarily the integration of Bank of American distribution channels. We expect these outflows to continue over the next several quarters.
It is important to note, these future outflows are expected to be large in revenue and PTI neutral based upon the structure of our underlying agreements and fees. We had an additional $500 million in outflows from sub-advised assets. These assets are lower margin than our retail assets
Outflows were primarily the result of weaker investment performance in the past. However, that performance is improving. Clearly, outflows are being impacted by volatility in the market and the overall market shifts to fixed income products.
While we have significant fixed income capabilities, our retail sales have an equity bias. As you are probably aware, industry flows and domestic equity funds were a negative $28 billion in May and June. The net flows reported in the quarter are consentient with our expectations at this stage of the integration.
Specifically, sales inflows are showing the impact from consolidating funds where advisors are still uncertain about the ultimate outcome of the fund mergers, wholesale realignment, where we are reconfiguring the territories and greatly expanding the products for each wholesaler, and the pending transfer agency integration, which will ultimately facilitate transferring from product to product across our platform.
That being said, the integration is proceeding quite well in all key areas, as the next slide shows. In the current quarter, we expensed $53 million in integration costs, the $48 million recorded in the Asset Management segment. The primary driver of this expense was severance accruals. Our target for the integration cost remains at $130 million to $160 million.
We originally reported expected net synergies of $130 million to $150 million comprised of growth synergies of $150 million to $190 million offset by the dis-synergies I have already discussed. Again, we are on track. In the quarter, we realized $14 million of gross expense synergies and have taken a number of actions that will drive synergies in the future quarters.
We are also on track with respect to our revenue dis-synergy forecast of $20 million to $40 million, having realized about one-third through the second quarter.
Lastly, we committed to update you on the intangible amortization related to this deal. Our current estimate is approximately $17 million per year below our original estimate. The difference is primarily due to allocating more of the purchase price to non-amortizing intangibles.
Before I turn to the remaining segments, I want to provide you context on our Asset Management segment margins compared with our competitors. We believe that our margin target is appropriate for our business model. Many of you have heard us say that accounting differences and business model differences make it difficult to compare our margins across the industry.
On this slide we show the magnitude of some of those differences, and we view this quarter’s 18% margin as the starting point. Some Asset Management’s net pass through distribution expenses from their GAAP revenue line; others netted out as they calculate margins. If you lower the revenue in our margin calculation by netting these pass through distribution fees from revenue, it would add over 7% to the margin calculation.
In addition, our Asset Management business presides over a large block of sub-advised assets; part of it driven by our life and annuities business and the new enhanced portfolio navigator. These sub-advised relationships increased both revenue and expenses and depressed margins.
For us, netting sub-advised fees from revenues would add about 2% to the margin calculation. We also have other pass through revenues like trust administration fees that are a function of the integrated model and our organizational structure.
Finally, we have intangible amortization of about 3%, which some analysts choose to net to see underlying cash margins. Just to be clear, we are providing this to give you some context as you compare our margins across the industry.
Going forward, we will continue to report and focus on the operating margins as we define it. I want to reinforce that we remain committed to driving our margins in this business to 25%.
Let’s move on to the Annuity segment, which also generated strong results in the quarter driven by solid underlying fundamentals. The $129 million of operating earnings included the following. Newer version increased expenses by $35 million, actuary on modeling benefited earnings by $26 million, hedged living benefits increased earnings by $25 million, and finally, the implementation of EPN increased expense by $6 million.
We continue to see positive net flows with variable annuities with second quarter showing improvement over the first quarter of 2010. In the quarter, our hedge problems continued to work well.
On the next slide, the Protection segment continues to generate healthy revenues and earnings. Operating earnings reflect lower DAC amortization expense as a result of the following items; increased expense of $4 million due to the market’s impact on DAC, a benefit of $6 million due to higher gross profits forecast driven by EPN, and a benefit of $7 million due to actuarial modeling changes.
While we still haven’t seen activity come back to pre-crisis levels, VUL/UL sales are up 31% year-over-year. Expenses were well controlled in this business with G&A expenses down 5% from a year ago.
On the next slide, we continue to manage our financial foundation well, which has enabled us to return capital to shareholders.
During the quarter, we repurchased 5.7 million shares for $220 million and continue to hold more than $1.5 billion in excess capital. While our cash flow was down from the first quarter, with Enhanced Portfolio Navigator fully implemented, our free cash and holding company liquidity remained high.
The underlying quality of our balance sheet also remained strong. RiverSource Life’s estimated RBC was above 500% and our unrealized gain position increased to $1.6 billion. Our balance sheet ratios continue to remain conservative. Finally, our variable annuity hedge programs continue to be effective despite volatile markets.
So to summarize, our business trends continue to improve. Our actions have resulted in increased operating leverage and we are making progress towards our financial goals with margin improvement in AWM and asset management and operating returns approaching our on average overtime targets. Our balance sheet remains strong including our capital and liquidity positions.
Overall, although the market and economic outlook remains uncertain and could impact our near term results, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver against our long-term financial goals.
Now, we will take your questions.

We actually are still in the mandate and other people lost completely out; but it was a lumpy outflow, I mean it was $2 billion.
So really what we are going to continue to see really is, as we integrate funds, sales activity is a little slower, we have the wholesaling coming together, new product set territories, we are actually consolidating the fund families. So the advisors want to know which funds are going to remain open because they don’t want their clients repay, et cetera, they want to know the ones that are going to be standing. That will occur in the September timeframe, we can give them all that information.
And then I think the other big thing that we do expect and I want to be very clear about is, similar to what we saw as the combination of the Bank of America and Merrill Lynch platforms, they fully informed us that that was taking place as they integrate the firms. As they move those accounts to their own sort of managed account basis, we will see outflows moving from us managing those accounts to them.
Now part of our agreements and arrangements with them is that you know they use our capabilities in modeling and selection there and then we’ll get certain fees for that and those fees pretty much will offset what we would do in managing those assets under the relationship, but you will see outflows from it.
What we will do each quarter, we know that part of that will occur in the September quarter and we know part of that will occur also at the end of the year, beginning of next year, we will identify that clearly with you. But under our arrangements, a lot of the fees will maintain themselves just under a different sort of clause that we have in the agreements.
So clearly, we are integrating, but I would also say, sales across slowed a bit in the quarter because equity sales aren’t as strong as they were. So, we will do our best to identify for you where it might be from an integration activity, but we still believe that the $20 million to $40 million that we put as dis-synergies on revenue would sort of cover the outflows that we expect from the combination.

So, I think part of what we clearly see is the ability to earn reasonably good returns and get reasonably strong margins. Now, Columbia will give us a whole new level of that that will layer in on, but we’re still working through a lot of the details of Columbia, but we feel good about what we originally put together based on the initial information when we did the deal that we disclosed to you. What it seems as we close that deal and we’re underway in integration, things are proceeding consistent with plan there.
So, I probably would say at this point we need a little more time so that we can see how old things unfold and we can get those synergies and see how we can get some traction against the product line-up and the institutional business, and we’ll get back to you.
I would also say to what Walter pointed out, even though we underlined reported GAAP the way we do on the margins, you can see some of the adjustments and some of what other people have as they reflect their margin. So the 18%, if you look at it fully that way, could be much higher. So when you take the 25 on a similar basis, that looks pretty good as well depending on what you factor in there. But we’re proceeding to get that 25 as a target. But as Walter said, if we can go beyond that and we see the ability to go beyond that, we will start to let you aware of it as we proceed.

I think we’ve been very much focused on continuing to drive the organic growth and we’re starting to see some of that come about. We are right in the heat of the integration of Columbia. So very clearly from an Asset Management business, we have our people very much focused on orchestrating that and it’s a very large deal for us. It’s a sizable integration, because it’s a merger of equals there that we’re working on.
Clearly, we want to continue to invest organically to grow that we’re already doing and putting more funds to work in our investments to do that. We will continue to look at potential opportunities of something really make sense for us or fits as we go further into the year next year. But we would also look to really play the hand that we currently have, we feel like we have a good line up and we have a good position. We have flexibility to do something if necessary, but we also have the flexibility as we have shown in the first quarter to buy back our shares. So, that’s probably what I would probably give you as a perspective right now being where we are in the year.

I think last year it was much more than we expected because of the dislocation that occurred in the market. This year we are starting to refocus as we put in place our new brokerage platform for some of our people to try to accelerate our focus there again.
But having said that, it is a slower period, I think, across the industry. I think it’s getting a little frothy out there with some of the packages that the warehouses are currently putting out for some people. So we are picking on spots. We want to be focused on what’s good for our Company and who will be appropriate for our value proposition. I still see potential for those recruits and I still see our ability to extend our reach throughout our channel, both in our employee channel where we started this all, but also in our franchisee channel as we move forward.
So it will clearly be part of our plans for the future. We will devote time and energy to it. I do believe now the people we are bringing in today are multiples of the people who are leaving in production. So we’re seeing a nice, strong production from the people coming in that would add value to our system over time, and I think it will complement what you’ve seen reported in the production areas. The people we added last year in a similar basis as they ramp up their books will add to that.
As I’ve said the people who’re leaving on average just had a very low production. So the incremental even though on numbers it’s not the same, the incremental production is five-fold, and from the people who are leaving as well on another side, most of those book-of-business stay with us anyway and they just move over to another advisor.

I would also say that from a net production perspective, I’m not saying that won’t be negative as that continues to slow.
As I said, even if we’re bringing in fewer new people at much higher production levels, it more than offsets on a multiple basis. We are looking to grow our ranks. We will probably next year start to kick off a bit more of adding career changes. We’re actually helping and working with franchisees even now to bring in experienced people into their practices, as well as recruiting into our franchisee system. For instances, if you looked at some of our attrition in our franchisee system, it’s down slightly 20, 30 a quarter, something like that. That’s because we have people selling practices, retiring, sorry to say passing away. We also, because we’re not doing novices and then migrating them, we have less transferring in.
So we’re going to start to look at the franchisee system and recruit directly in there, and help the advisors there build their own teams, which they used to do from some of our recruits. So (technical difficulty) ways that we will approach it. But I think the positive for us is, we will do this at a lower cost and at a higher productivity level, and that’s what’s important.
And then, in fact, in our P1 system, we are also following some teams, marrying up some of our advisors that do financial planning with some of the experienced people that we’ve brought in or as well as the block to really help round out their businesses. And then overtime, we’ll be able to add more junior people to those practices to help drive productivity. So those are the some other things that we’re doing. But just to answer your question directly, we will continue to see negative over the next just few quarters, it will continue to slow, it will stabilize thereafter we think, and then we’ll start to try to increase from there.

Thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call.

Thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call.  This morning Walter and I will give you our thoughts on the Company’s performance for the quarter and the progress we’re making across the business.  We’ll also provide (audio interference).  Let’s get started.
This was another strong quarter for us.  In fact, despite the continuing challenges in the environment, we achieved our highest quarterly revenues and earnings since we’ve been a public company with $2.4 billion of net operating revenues and $355 million of operating earnings.  Operating earnings per share of $1.37 represent an increase of 32% compared with a year ago, and 25% compared with last quarter.  Our operating return on equity reached 12% which is up nicely compared with the last couple of years.  
While we realized benefits from DAC in the quarter, strong business fundamentals drove these results.  We continue to generate higher margins in our more fee-based segments - advice and wealth management and asset management - and our client base and advisor productivity continued to improve.  We are realizing the benefits of the Columbia transaction and our other acquisitions which helped drive owned, managed and administered assets to an all-time high of $649 billion.  
Our strong financial foundation and prudent operating principles continue to serve us well.  The balance sheet remains very strong and we continue to hold considerable excess capital and liquidity positions which gives us significant flexibility to invest for growth, to manage through a difficult environment, and to return capital to shareholders.  In fact, I believe we are one of the few firms in the industry that had the strength to repurchase shares.  During the quarter, we bought back an additional 3.6 million shares for $153 million, bringing our total buyback for the year to 9.3 million shares for $373 million.  
We’re also maintaining our commitments through reengineering and expense control, and we’re continuing to fund our investments with a portion of our reengineering savings.  Expenses remain well-managed with general and administrative expenses down in every segment except asset management due to the Columbia acquisition.
Now I’d like to discuss our segment performance.  First, advice and wealth management generated strong results.  We reported pretax operating earnings of $88 million compared with 28 million a year ago.  Our pretax operating margin in this segment was 9.3% for the quarter, up from 3.4% a year ago and up slightly over the sequential quarter.  Our advisor retention rates remain very high with retention of our most productive advisors rising to well above 95%.  Employee advisor retention is also up significantly, and that was a primary goal of our long-term work to reengineer the employee force with a focus on productivity.  
We orchestrated a transformation of the advisor system.  Lower producing advisors have left and we’ve reduced costs significantly while continuing to invest in the business.  And even with the S&P 500 still 25% below all-time highs, advisor productivity is near our all-time highs; so we feel good about the economics we’re generating and the leverage we’ve created in the advisor system.  Lower costs and higher productivity were our goals, and we are achieving them.
In the quarter, operating revenue per advisor increased 21% over a year ago.  While we’re seeing some improvement in client activity compared to this time last year, advisor productivity was off slightly compared with the sequential quarter, mostly due to the slower summer months.  Clients are more confident now than they were a year ago, but doubts and concerns are persisting; and as a result, investing behavior continues to show a fairly high level of risk aversion.
Even with the seasonality impact, we continued to generate asset growth in the advisor business during the quarter.  Total client assets increased to $313 billion, up 9% over a year ago.  Wrap accounts were an important contributor to these increases.  We recorded net inflows in wrap accounts of 1.8 billion in the quarter and total wrap assets increased to 105 billion, an 18% increase over a year ago.
I should note that while the factors we can control are contributing to higher margins, a factor outside our control is offsetting some of our gains.  The historically low short-term interest rates are impacting our profitability in this segment fairly significantly.
The asset management segment also delivered a strong quarter.  We generated pretax operating earnings in the segment of $121 million compared with 17 million in the third quarter of last year and 104 million in the sequential quarter.  The segments pretax operating margin was 18.3%.  These results, which included a full quarter of Columbia contributions for the first time, demonstrate the improved profitability and scale of our combined asset management business.  
Despite the 4% average decline in the S&P during the quarter, revenues grew 18% sequentially and global assets under management increased to a record high of $445 billion.  In terms of asset management flows, we experienced global net outflows of 2.1 billion in the quarter with net inflows of 1.1 billion at Threadneedle, offset by domestic outflows of 3.2 billion.
While we obviously are working to return to domestic net inflows, we continue to feel comfortable with the progress we’re making in the business.  Flows continue to be impacted by the industry wide weakness in retail equity fund flows and by the upcoming merges in our mutual fund lineup, which were announced last month.  While institutional flows remain negative, we feel very good about the pipeline and the overall positioning of that business.
Internationally, Threadneedle’s return to net inflows was led by strong institutional inflows which more than offset the outflows of lower margin Zurich assets. 
Our investment performance continued to improve in most asset classes, highlighted by stronger short-term domestic fixed income performance and continued strength in our three and five-year numbers.  Threadneedle’s performance remained very strong and overall we feel good about our performance records.
The integration of the acquisition is proceeding according to plan.  During the quarter, we completed the move to a common transfer agency for the combined business and we announced a new product lineup.  Once our fund merges are completed, which will occur mostly during the first quarter of next year, we will have a more focused and strong performing product platform.
As we’ve gone through the integration process, which obviously imposed a significant change on the organization, the business has continued to perform well.  We’ve retained talented people and maintained the two firms’ client bases, and we’re now operating truly as one firm with any disruptions from the transaction largely behind us.
In annuities, we reported pretax operating earnings of $265 million for the quarter, a slight decrease compared to a year ago and more than double our sequential earnings.  This quarter reflects our annual DAC unlocking which had a positive impact on the quarter, although less positive than a year ago.  While Walter will discuss the drivers of DAC shortly, I want to note that the primary driver of the positive impact was greater persistency of the book.  Clients are staying in annuity contracts longer.  
Business fundamentals remain solid despite a continued challenging environment for sales.  We produced variable annuity net inflows of approximately $500 million, double our net inflows compared with the sequential quarter.  The inflows were driven primarily by sales of a well-received new product that we introduced during the quarter.
The fixed annuity business remains stable.  While we’re not writing much new business in fixed annuities because of the rate environment, we are seeing lower lapse rates and better than expected asset persistency in the book.  We continue to generate stable spread earnings and good returns from the fixed annuity balances.
The protection segment produced pretax operating earnings of $65 million, a decrease of 53% compared to a year ago and 51% versus the sequential quarter.  We recognized a $39 million expense related to DAC in this segment compared with a $24 million benefit in the third quarter of last year.  Setting aside these impacts, profits were down $10 million year-over-year which resulted from increased claims.  We not see the one-quarter increase in claims as a trend that is likely to continue.
While insurance sales remain well below pre-crisis levels with clients still reluctant to commit cash, we saw a continuation of a gradual improvement in total cash sales.  Expenses remain well controlled in the insurance business and we are pursuing sales improvements through a new simplified approach to help advisors explain product benefits to their clients. 
The auto and home business continued its steady growth with policy counts increasing 10% over a year ago, and we’re promising benefits from alliance partnerships.  
To summarize, we feel very good about the progress we’ve made and the results we generated over the past several quarters.  We’re succeeding at driving higher margins in our less capital demanding businesses, and we are continuing to generate a very real benefit from the scale and strength of each of our operating segments.  At the same time, we continue to manage our financial foundation carefully, and our risk and expense disciplines will not waiver.  
Overall, we are in excellent condition and we are in a strong operating position.  Of course, the environmental factors remain challenging.  We expect the extended period of low short-term interest rates to continue for the foreseeable future, and while equity markets have improved, they’re still struggling to find their direction.  Of course, clients feel these environmental factors and we believe the trend in client activity continues to demonstrate the fragile state of the economic recovery and consumer mindsets.  
So the environment continues to impact us across our businesses.  Asset-based fees, advisor productivity, and our ability to earn investment income are all affected by soft conditions.  While these environmental risks remain, we are confident in our ability to navigate a wide range of conditions and generate good returns for our shareholders.
Now I’ll turn it over to Walter, and later we’ll take your questions.

We posted slides on our website again this quarter, and they will be updated with my talking points after the call.  Please take a moment to review the Safe Harbor statement on Page 2 and then turn to Slide 3.
This was a record quarter for Ameriprise.  Reported EPS was $1.32 and operating earnings per share were $1.37, up 32%.  Revenues were up 26% and we maintained strong expense control which resulted in improved margins.  Our operating return on equity, excluding AOCI, reached 12%; and finally, our balance sheet fundamental remain strong.
Slide 4 reflects highlights of our performance.  In the quarter, our operating earnings were 355 million.  The 31% growth in operating earnings was achieved despite a significant year-over-year decline in DAC unlocking benefits.  In the quarter, we generated a net positive DAC unlocking and other benefits of 47 million versus 105 million last year.
The substantial year-over-year improvement in operating performance reflects the following items:  growth in business drivers, realized reengineering benefits, the acquisition of Columbia Management, and the impact of the 10% year-over-year increase in the equity markets.
On the next slide we provide more insight into the DAC and our associated assumptions.  Of the 47 million in after-tax items in the quarter, 37 million of the benefit was generated by unlocking.  The two major drivers were:  first, updated persistency assumptions drove an overall benefit of 101 million.  Persistency on both fixed and variable annuities has improved to the point we needed to increase DAC amortization periods to better align the recognition of expense with revenues anticipated over the life of the business.  Of course, while improved persistency has a positive impact on continuing fees and spread revenue, it could also lead to increased benefit costs from variable annuity guarantees; so we needed to increase reserves for these benefits.  Consistent with our risk management philosophy, we adjusted our hedge in the third quarter so it is based on the same policyholder behavior assumptions as the liability.  
Secondly, we lowered our equity and fixed income return assumptions to reflect fair value of the equity market and the current interest rate environment.  This resulted in a $55 million expense.  Near-term equity markets now equal our long-term assumption of 9%, reflecting our view that the market is currently reasonably valued.  Fixed income return assumptions reflect our expectation of an extended period of low interest rates gradually increasing over time.
In the quarter, we generated a mean reversion benefit of 25 million reflecting the 11% absolute increase in the S&P 500 during the quarter.  And finally, the narrowing of our own credit spread drove $15 million in losses.  Remember, we do not hedge the impact of our own credit spread on the living benefit valuation.
On the next slide, operating net revenue growth was strong at 26%.  Revenues have been on an upward trajectory over the past five quarters.  Excluding the Columbia acquisition, revenue would have been up 13%, driven primarily by higher markets, positive retail flows, and increased client activity.
Let’s turn to expenses.  We continue to manage our expense base effectively.  Operating, general and administrative expenses grew 15%, primarily due to the Columbia acquisition.  Operating expenses in the other segments were down year-over-year, reflecting continued strong expense controls and reengineering benefits.
On the next slide, you can see we are continuing to drive our business mix towards lower capital, high return on equity businesses, namely advice and wealth management and asset management.  Together these businesses, excluding the DAC impacts, generated 43% of our third quarter operating PTI, and you can see that we have been on a good trajectory for the past year.  Keep in mind, the fourth quarter 2009 results were skewed by the recognition of hedge fund performance fees.  This compares to a 29% mix from these businesses in the 2007 to 2009 period.  
One of our key objectives is driving this mix shift towards lower capital businesses while effectively managing our excess capital position, which ultimately leads to a return on equity expansion.  On the next slide, I’ll turn to the segments.
This was an excellent quarter for the advice and wealth management segment.  Pretax operating earnings were 88 million in the quarter and operating margins have improved from 3.4% last year to 9.3% this quarter.  Year-over-year earnings growth and margin expansions were driven by several factors:  first, continued advisor productivity gains as a result of reengineering our business model; second, growth in average fee-based assets driven by market appreciation and wrap net inflows of 9.1 billion; third, lower operating, general and administrative expenses reflecting strong expense management.  We achieved these expense savings even as we continued to make significant investments in the businesses, including increased marketing and our new brokerage platform.  And finally, an improvement in client activity, although it continues to be below pre-crisis levels.
Client activity typically declines in the third quarter and average equity markets were down 4% sequentially.  That said, a portion of that seasonal drop was offset by stronger sales in our new variable annuity product, RAVA 5; and the market decline was partially offset by retail inflows.  As a result, revenues were down only 2% sequentially.
On the next slide, you can see we also had strong performance in our asset management segment.  In the quarter, we generated pretax operating earnings of 121 million and an operating margin of 18.3%.  This is the first quarter reflecting a full three months of Columbia operating PTI.  
While the year-over-year market appreciation benefited our margin, the sequential decline in average markets did put pressure on revenues.  We estimate the 4% decline in average markets lowered margins by approximately 1%.  The integration of Columbia continues to go well.  Please turn to the next slide for more details.
Year-to-date, we’ve spent $76 million in integration costs with 18 million recorded in the asset management segment in this quarter.  Our estimate of total integration costs remains at 130 to 160 million.  Our expense synergy estimates also remain on track, having realized approximately 47 million year-to-date versus our estimate of total expense synergies of 150 to 190 million.
As we said before, integration was expected to impact flows.  There are three main factors impacting Columbia’s retail flows:  first, the continuing impact of the integration on fund merger; second, we continue to experience significant sub-advisor outflows; and finally, the market demand continues to be skewed towards fixed income products.
Institutional flows, while still negative, have improved significantly and reflect the continued acceleration of our activities in that area.  We are seeing the best institutional pipeline we’ve seen for quite a while.  Finally, alternative flows are being impacted by a soft close of most of our hedge funds to allow us to maintain strong performance.  
At Threadneedle, net inflows of 1.1 billion were driven by strong institutional flows, more than offsetting continued Zurich outflows.  Retail net outflows continue to reflect the overall market volatility in Europe.
Let’s move on to annuities which also generated strong results in the quarter.  The 265 million of operating earnings included the following:  105 million in benefits from unlocking, 29 million in benefits from mean reversion, and 22 million in expenses from VA benefits.  The year-over-year underlying growth was driven primarily by higher account values as a result of markets and business growth.  Sequential underlying growth reflects higher revenues from an extra fee day along with lower amortization of DAC.  
The ongoing impact of DAC amortization from unlocking should not be large as lengthening the amortization period tends to reduce near-term amortization while lowering market return assumptions, and certain other changes tend to increase near-term amortization.  
Focusing on the underlying business trends, we continue to see positive net flows for variable annuities with third quarter showing significant improvement over the second quarter of 2010.  The growth reflects the uptake of our new product, RAVA 5, which was introduced in July.  
Our hedge program continued to work well.  The non-performance risk, which is the impact of our credit spread on the GAAP liability valuation, is not hedged and is the main driver behind the VA benefit expense.
On the next slide, the protection segment reported lower operating earnings due to both unlocking and higher claims for disability income and long-term care insurance.  Operating earnings of 65 million included the following items:  increased expense of 49 million due to unlocking, and a benefit of 10 million from mean reversion.  Sequentially, excluding the disclosed items, underlying earnings were down 21 million with about half attributable to higher DI and LTC claims, and half to higher VUL and UL reserves and amortization expenses, primarily related to secondary guarantees and our expectation of lower interest rates.
On the next slide, we continue to manage our financial foundation well which has enabled us to return capital to shareholders.  During the quarter, we repurchased 3.6 million shares for $153 million.  That brings our year-to-date repurchases to 9.3 million shares for $373 million.  We continue to hold more than 1.5 billion in excess capital while our cash flows remain strong at 3.7 billion.  The 2.1 billion of free cash does not include the 340 million we will use next month to retire debt.
The underlying quality of our balance sheet also remains strong.  RiverSource Life’s estimated RBC remains above 500%, and our unrealized gain position increased to $2.3 billion.  Our balance sheet ratios continue to remain conservative, both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios.  Finally, our variable annuity hedge program continues to be effective.
So to summarize, we generated record earnings in the quarter as a result of strong underlying business performance despite continued challenging market.  Our actions have resulted in increased operating leverage and we are making good progress.  We are driving the mix towards lower capital businesses, effectively managing our excess capital, and driving improved operating returns.  Our balance sheet remains strong, including our capital and liquidity positions.

And we will be dropping off some of the underperforming records that we have in some of the smaller funds as well.  But I would say overall we have a good lineup.  I’m quite excited about what that looks like as a consolidated sort of lineup of funds, and I think once that starts to get communicated and consistently applied out through the distribution force, that should be good as a positive.
Regarding the flows, I would just say it’s a combination of factors, as Walter and I have mentioned.  Clearly you do have an industry-wide pullout of equity funds.  I mean, redemptions are a bit up across the industry and new sales aren’t coming in there.  I think a lot of flows in some of the fund families have really come into the fixed income.  Over 60% of our funds are more in the equity base.  That’s sort of the positioning that we’ve had out in the marketplace.  The second thing, as you would imagine, is we’ve just announced the lineup of the new funds so people don’t want to put into funds that they may think closed.  We also just got the new wholesaling force coordinated and they’re picking up the new products and the new territories, so that takes a bit of time.  And we still are experiencing some outflows in some of the sub-advisor funds that have underperformed in the past, so I think the reason you see a bit of an increase is because we picked up three months of Columbia for the third quarter.  We only had two in in the second quarter that was some of the outflows that we’re continuing to see.  So I think that’s along the lines.  You know, we would love for it to—hope to get it turned around, and that’s what we’re really focused on.  But we did expect some of this based on a combination of the factors I just mentioned.

It’s not necessarily completely over because there are still people that we had added a year ago and two years ago that continue—just as you know, as they mature you always have an attrition rate because they can’t necessarily keep on taking the step up, and we still have advisors in the system such as that.  But I think as it goes on, we’ll have it more normalized.  As you see, the retention rate’s starting to pick up and we’re hoping to get that into the 80s.  And so for the employee system and for the franchisee system, it’s quite strong.  
From a replacement perspective, as you know, when you have 11,000, 12,000 advisors, just to replace normal attrition - people leaving, succession planning, people retiring, et cetera - you have to make up for all of that.  And what we’ve been doing is instead of looking at it as just a count of advisors, we’re trying to add to teams.  We’re trying to give them greater support that they can build out their practices, not necessarily with new reps but with support staff and assistant advisors who are also recruiting in, we think, more experienced people that have books of business already.  So we’re focused more on the productivity aspects.
Over time, I would say over the next number of quarters, yes, I would like to get that to be more of a flat first and then hopefully get it to rise to—slightly in the periods; but the focus will be on increased productivity and growth of practices in combination to the number of people that we have.

In regard to what we’ve done over time is we have a pretty large group of funds in SMA accounts on our shelf over the years, thousands of them.  But we’ve also added hundreds more as people have requested some different variety, or if people are joining us and had certain other fund activity or separate accounts that they wanted to bring over.  So we’ve got a very wide and broad platform on the investment side.  We started with the launch of some additional annuity products in the channel, as we said, in July.  The architecture, even for our annuities, is all open architecture under it for investment.  And then in the insurance, we have a wide range of products from different companies also on our shelf that our advisors can utilize for their client needs.
