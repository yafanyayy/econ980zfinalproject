I'll begin on Slide 3 of the earnings presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $376 million or $0.83 per share, a slight decline from the prior quarter. Earnings for our fu",2879,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon to everyone listening to the call. I'll begin on Slide 3 of the earnings presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $376 million or $0.83 per share, a slight decline from the prior quarter. Earnings for our full year 2009 were $884 million or $0.75 per share, after including the $1.31 dividend and repayment expense of the government's preferred share investment that we repaid in full in the second quarter.Revenues in the fourth quarter were down $216 million from the prior quarter with the largest factor being $113 million fewer gains from the sales of securities than we recognized in the third quarter. A continued decline in average assets also contributed to the dip in revenue despite stable net interest margin. These declines were somewhat offset by a modest improvement in the value of our retained interests, as well as less suppression of Card revenue.Non-interest expenses were up 8% from the link to quarter. This marketing began to recover from historically low levels and operating expenses saw expected fourth-quarter increases. While pre-provision earnings fell by $362 million, provision expense improved by $354 million. It's a $386 million release in our allowance more than offset to modestly higher charge-offs. More on Credit performance in the allowance in a moment.The $28 million after-tax loss in discontinued operations includes GreenPoint rep and warranty expense. All told, despite some larger swings in the individual line items in the quarter, earnings per share were relatively flat. For the full year, a challenging economy helped drive a 3% decrease in average loans. However, historically widespreads on low-risk investment securities, particularly in the first half of 2009, led us to grow the investment portfolio by 26%. So our overall earning assets were up modestly in the year. This strategy helped reduce stable margins in flat year-over-year revenue.Looking ahead to 2010, we expect the trend of declining loans to continue, with the run-off of certain portfolios and high levels of charge-offs. But unlike 2009, we do not expect this average loan decline to be offset by further growth in our securities portfolio, as risk-adjusted returns are likely to be less attractive than in 2009. While margins may moderate slightly from fourth quarter levels, we expect that annual margins will largely be similar year-over-year. All told, stable margins on a smaller portfolio will likely lead to lower revenue in 2010.In response to lower loan demand and economic uncertainty, we pulled back on marketing spend in 2009. This decrease was offset by the addition of Chevy Chase Bank operating expenses. We expect non-interest expenses to increase in 2010. Media and other marketing costs are likely to begin to rise from depressed levels to levels that are more in line with our historical marketing spend depending on our revolving view of market opportunities. Operating expenses will likely remain stable as ongoing efficiency improvements are offset by investments in our banking and mortgage infrastructure.Full year 2009 provision expense was essentially flat versus the 2008 level, as higher charge-offs in 2009 were offset by a $2 billion positive swing in allowance from a $1.6 billion build in 2008 to $400  million release in 2009. This $400 million release was more than accounted for by a smaller reported loan book. The potential for a reduction in our 2010 allowance due to decline in balances and the moderating credit outlook could result in a significantly lower provision expense. Of course, the economic picture continues to evolve rapidly and the results of various line items may play out differently than projections I just as described. In any event, our balance sheet affords us a great deal of flexibility to manage in a changing environment. This flexibility was clearly on display as we navigated to tough environment to produce strong results in 2009 and we'll continue to stay flexible as we manage through 2010.As we turn to Slide 4, I'll describe the impact of our loan trends and economic outlook on our allowance. Our overall allowance declined by $386 million in the quarter as builds in both Commercial and Other Consumer Banking were more than offset by releases in both Auto and Credit Card. In Commercial Banking, it's worth noting that the supplemental tables show a spike in the GreenPoint's Small Ticket CRE charge-offs, which was driven by a movement of $277 million of those loans to held-for-sale, causing us to charge the loans down the market value. Excluding this impact, non-performing loans continue to rise while the total size of the portfolio remained largely flat, causing us to build our allowance by $115 million in the quarter, which will discuss credit trends in the Commercial Banking segment in greater detail in a few moments.In the Auto business, $1.1 billion of loan shrinkage in the quarter and continued improvement in credits stemming from our portfolio shift to higher quality originations from 2008 and 2009 led to $96 million release in our allowance for that business. In Domestic Card, about three quarters of the $416 million allowance release is driven by changes in the size and structure of our loan portfolio. About $220 million of that impact relates directly to the reduced level of reported balances. The remaining quarter of the Card allowance release is driven by the regrounding of our models to reflect the fact that actual credit performance has been favorable to our internal expectations even though some macroeconomic variables have come in worse than we expected. As you'll hear from Rich in a moment, we remain cautious in our economic outlook especially with respect to the labor and housing markets. Consistent with this view, we are continuing to maintain high levels of allowance to both reported loans and delinquencies. Turning to Slide 5, I'll discuss movements in our balance sheet. Assets increased by $2.4 billion in the quarter, as shrinkage in each of our lending businesses was more than offset by growth in our securities portfolio and cash position. Our managed Domestic Card portfolio was down $1.6 billion in the quarter, driven primarily by $1 billion of run-off in our closed-end loan portfolio. The closed-end loan portfolio hit about $7 billion in outstanding as of the end of the year and it will continue to pressure Card growth as we expect approximately $3  billion to run off over the course of 2010. The slight shrinkage in our fourth quarter commercial banking portfolio was more than driven by the shift of the Small Ticket CRE portfolio to held-for-sale that I mentioned earlier. Our Commercial Lending business is expected to grow modestly in 2010.On the Consumer Bank side, the $1.9 billion decline in fourth quarter assets was primarily driven by $1.1 billion of lower outstandings in the Auto business and the $700 million decline in the size of our mortgage portfolio. With respect to Auto, recall, we drastically pulled back on origination volume in early 2008 and we are now beginning to approach the point that which the run-off of prior originations will equal new originations. As a result of this slowing pace of run-off, we expect ending loans to be down approximately $1.5 billion over 2010 compared to a $3.3 billion decline in 2009. Our mortgage portfolio largely remains in run-off mode, and we expect that portfolio to decline by approximately $2.5 billion in 2010.Our $39 billion securities portfolio remains fairly constant quarter-over-quarter, both in terms of size as well as composition. The total net unrealized gain of the portfolio now stands at $291 million, down some $49 million in the third quarter, primarily as a result of higher interest rates across the medium and long-term parts of the yield curve. And finally, we had a nearly $5 billion increase in our cash position in the fourth quarter, as we held late-quarter deposit growth in the proceeds from our November trust preferred issuance in cash and cash equivalents. We expect the substantial amount of disposition to roll off in the first quarter.Between the run-off of our closed-end portfolio in the Card business and declining Consumer Loans in both Auto and Mortgage, we expect these businesses will together lose approximately $7 billion of loans in 2010. While our other lending businesses may see net growth this year despite elevated levels of charge-offs, it is reasonable to assume that the total loan portfolio will decline by mid-single digits in terms of percentage this year. Taking in to account, the rapid shrinkage already experienced in 2009, the averaging impact of a mid-single digit percentage decline in ending loan balances this year will equate to a high-single digit percentage decline in average loan balances. And on liability side, we continue to leverage the flexibility of both our branch and national direct bank platforms to drive down funding costs. In the fourth quarter, we swapped out of higher price time deposits into money market and savings accounts and increased the amount of non-interest-bearing deposits. You'll see the benefit of these moves on funding costs on Slide 6.While asset yield declined by 14 basis points in the quarter, we were able to offset most of the decline through lower funding costs, resulting in a stable net interest margin. As I indicated on the last call, some of the non-interest income revenue realized in the third quarter was not sustainable in the fourth quarter. And revenue margins fell slightly, but remained high. While both net interest margin and revenue margin may moderate slightly from fourth quarter levels, we expect the full-year rates for 2010 to be similar to those in 2009. With revenue down and non-interest expenses up in the quarter, the efficiency ratio climbed 5% from the abnormally low third quarter to 43.9%. Looking ahead, the expectation for a smaller loan portfolio will put downward pressure on revenues in 2010. Coupling that with our expected increase in marketing and largely stable operating expenses, it's prudent to assume that our efficiency ratio will rise year-over-year. I'll now discuss capital on Slide 7.Our ratio of tangible common equity to tangible managed assets rose 10 basis points in the quarter to 6.3%, as earnings more than offset a modest increase in tangible assets. In addition to the increase in common equity, we see in the TCE ratio, the Tier 1 ratio benefited from three additional factors. First, the reported balance sheet got smaller. Second, some of the asset growth was in cash, which carries a zero-risk weight on our regulatory ratio. And finally, Tier 1 includes the proceeds of our $1 billion trust preferred issue in November. In aggregate, these factors resulted in an overall 190-basis-point improvement in the tier one ratio. While these capital ratios are at their highest point since the third quarter of 2008, the composition of reported capital and reserves will, of course, change considerably with the first quarter implementation of FAS 166 and 167, as well as the corresponding implementation of the regulatory capital rules over the next five quarters.Turning to Slide 8, I'll describe these impacts in greater detail for you. For Capital One, consolidation under FAS 166, 167 takes effect on January 1, 2010. While you will see the actual impact of book value consolidation when we report first quarter earnings, we thought it would be useful to describe the key impacts of consolidation by providing on this slide an estimated balance sheet for the start of the quarter. Under FAS 166 and 167, we are bringing back all $46 billion of securitized credit card and installment loan assets and approximately $1.5 billion of securitized mortgage assets. These $47.8 billion of assets can be seen in the adjustment to loans held for investment on the slide. It's worth noting that about $6 billion of securitized mortgage assets will remain off balance sheet. Even though we don't retain all of the risks associated with securitized assets, we will build an allowance at the comparable coverage ratio to existing on balance sheet assets upon consolidation. The implementation of FAS 166 and 167 will, therefore, reduce retained earnings primarily due to the after-tax effect of the $4.3 billion allowance build, and the allowance would stand at $8.4 billion.The change in accounting also eliminates the line item for accounts receivables from securitizations. This account included several different items, most materially the securitizations retained by Capital One as well as the cash in collection accounts related to our securitization transactions. About $5 billion of retained interest in our own securitizations will now be classified as loans and the amounts in the securitization-related cash accounts will now be classified as cash. The change in other assets is primarily due to the deferred tax asset created upon implementation. And finally, we will increase our securitization liability to account for the debt associated with those assets. Now that I've shared the geography movements of the balance sheet, I'll provide pro forma capital estimates for these impact on Slide 9.Since we've always captured securitized card assets and the denominator of our TCE ratio, the only impact of consolidation to the denominator of the TCE ratio comes in the addition of $1.5 billion of securitized mortgage assets. This asset increase, coupled with the reduction in the numerator caused by the $4.3 billion allowance build, would have decreased the TCE ratio by about 150 basis points to 4.8% as of the end of the year. Since the allowance build is tax affected, you'll note on the right-hand graph that the allowance grows more than our TCE declines. Going forward, given the natural run off of high fourth quarter cash balances, the impact of our run-off portfolios and likely seasonal declines in revolving credit utilization, we continue to expect that our TCE ratio will be above 5% at the end of the first quarter and will likely grow thereafter.Our Tier 1 and other risk-based capital ratios will be impacted by more significant moves in both the numerator and the denominator. But unlike the fall, an immediate impact of consolidation to the TCE ratio, the timing of the impact will be realized more gradually, in line with the phasing framework established national bank regulators. The phasing period extends through 2010 with the full impact of consolidation of our balance sheet's securitization for regulatory capital purposes included as of the first quarter of 2011. We are providing pro forma estimates of regulatory capital ratios using the rules, which will be in place as of March 31, 2010, in order to facilitate sequential comparisons when we report at the end of the first quarter of 2010.Pro forma Tier 1 ratios as of 12/31/09 are impacted by a decline in the numerator, as we account for the allowance-driven reduction in retained earnings. The numerator is further reduced by our need to disallow for regulatory capital purposes, some or all of the deferred tax asset, which results from the consolidation-driven increase in allowance. The net result of the reduced numerator will cause pro forma Tier 1 ratios to decline from actual 12/31/09 by some 400 basis points. Beginning in the third quarter of 2010, what remains then of current off balance sheet assets will begin to flow in part into the denominator of the Tier 1 ratio. Of course, the numerator may also change between now and then depending on changes in the allowance over the next few quarters.Total risk-based capital rules dictate not only a phase in period including securitized loans in the denominator of risk-weighted assets but also for the numerator impacted any allowance build associated with the consolidation of off-balance sheet assets. As a result, there's only a de minimis impact in the pro forma estimate of total risk-based capital on 12/31/09 compared to the actual ratio prior to consolidation. Now aside from the balance sheet impact to this transition, it's important to note that our income statement will also be impacted in future quarters by consolidation. Since allowance will now be required for all of our managed assets, the movement in our allowance for our Card business, for example, will be approximately three times as large as it would otherwise have been hit the two-thirds of our card loans that are securitized paid-off balance sheet. Given our expectations for continued loan shrinkage in 2010, allowance releases associated with declining loan volume will now be amplified compared to what it would've been without the FAS 166 and 167 implementation. In addition to the allowance, our I/O strip and other retained interest valuation will change also as a result of consolidation. Prior to FAS 166 in 167, we recognized small gains upon securitization and changes to our valuation float from non-interest income. Post-consolidation, no gains will be recognized and allowance will be established upon loan origination and changes to expected losses will flow through the provision at a level higher than previously recorded through the I/O strip.As we've been saying for a number of quarters, the implementation of FAS 166 and 167 simply creates a migration of accounting entries across the balance sheet and does not change our company's risk profile or capacity to absorb that risk. Our balance sheet remains extremely strong and flexible and those characteristics give us tremendous confidence in our ability to produce strong results despite a challenging and uncertain environment. With that, I'll pass the call over to Rich to talk about the performance of our businesses in greater detail. Rich?"

Our Credit Card business was the biggest contributor of profits in the quarter, with both the Domestic and International Card businesses posting a profit. I'll discuss the results of the Card business in a moment.In our Commercial Banking business, credit performance was the biggest driver of the net loss. Provision expense actually declined modestly from the third quarter, but remains elevated. Looking beyond credit results, commercial loan balances declined slightly while low-cost commercial deposits grew. Higher loan yields drove a modest increase in revenue. Non-interest expenses increased, driven by rising costs associated with loan workouts and by continuing infrastructure investments.The Consumer Banking business posted a modest net loss for the quarter. Seasonal credit trends reduced fourth quarter Auto Finance profit compared to the third quarter. Mortgage portfolio revenues and profits declined as a result of negative valuation adjustments to retain interest and securitized mortgage portfolios and MSR write-down and purchase accounting adjustments. We also continued to experience the expected run-off of mortgage balances.Consumer Banking provision expense increased, with seasonal increases in Auto Finance and continued deterioration in mortgage and home equity credit trends. Operating expenses increased in the quarter as the result of several factors. Fourth quarter includes planned expenses related to the integration of Chevy Chase Bank. Beyond integration, we're investing to build a scalable banking infrastructure to ensure that we're well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities to grow our banking businesses. And higher costs associated with Auto Finance collections and mortgage loss operation contributed to higher operating expenses in the quarter. Consumer Banking deposits grew even as deposit interest expense declined again in the fourth quarter. Slide 11 shows credit results for our Credit Card business. Domestic Card charge-off rate was relatively stable from the third quarter to the fourth quarter decreasing 5 basis points. There were a number of offsetting factors under the surface. The fourth quarter is a period of seasonal headwinds in Domestic Card. All else equal, that would have increased fourth quarter charge-off rate by about 80 basis points. Domestic Card assets continued to shrink in the fourth quarter, this denominator affect led to 45 basis points increase in the fourth quarter charge-off rate. Fourth quarter charge-off rate included a 60 basis point benefit relative to Q3 as we passed the peak of the OCC minimum payment impact in the third quarter. The OCC minimum payment impact fell from about 80 basis points in the third quarter to about 20 basis points in the fourth quarter.When you adjust for the effects of seasonality, OCC minimum payment impact and declining denominator, underlying credit quality in our domestic card portfolio improved in the fourth quarter. Later stage delinquency flow rates declined slightly after rising rapidly over the previous year. Our post charge-off recovery's liquidation rates showed signs of stabilization after prolonged periods of decline. Bankruptcies were slightly lower on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and while early stage delinquency flow rates remain elevated in Q4, they declined slightly from the third quarter.Domestic Card delinquencies rose 40 basis points in the fourth quarter. Our delinquency rate increased more than some others. It appears that the average trends in flow rates in delinquency bucket inventories has abated, although we do expect that elevated delinquency to lead to an increase in charge-offs in the first quarter 2010. Overall, we expect further increases in the Domestic Card charge-off rate into 2010. We expect the charge-off rate for the first quarter could cross 11%, driven by declining loan balances and the effect of pricing actions flowing through to charge-offs.We believe that we'll reach the quarterly peak of charge off dollars in the first quarter of 2010. Although declining loan balances may cause charge-off rates to remain elevated for a bit longer. But similar to our view of unemployment rate, nearing a peak does not necessarily mean that we're nearing the beginning of a robust recovery. But borrowing significant adverse changes to our long-term credit outlook or the regulatory environment, we expect that our Domestic Card business will remain profitable in 2010.Credit trends in the International business reflect continuing economic weakness in the U.K. and Canada. We've been retrenching the U.K. business for sometime now and we've been cautious and Canada in anticipation of the credit worsening that began in the first half of 2009. Fourth quarter credit results as well as the outlook for reaching the peak of dollar charge-offs in the first quarter of 2010 resulted in a significant decline in provision expense for our Credit Card business. Decline in provision expense was the key driver of profitability in the quarter.Slide 12 shows loan balances for the Domestic and International Card businesses. Ending loans in our Domestic Card business continued to decline in the quarter. The decline resulted from the continuing run-off of nationally originated installment loans and elevated charge-offs partially offset by seasonal balance build. In 2009, we continue to aggressively manage the company through the downturn, in part by retrenching and pulling back on originations. As a result, marketing expense for 2009 was unusually low. In 2010, we expect the Domestic Card marketing expenses will ramp back toward more normal levels, depending on our assessment of the market and emerging opportunities for profitable and resilient origination growth. However, we expect that increased marketing will not result in net loan growth in 2010. While increased marketing may result in revolving loan originations that more or less offset the effect of elevated charge-offs, we expect Domestic Card loans to decline in 2010 because continuing run-off of about $3 billion of installment loans.If normal seasonal patterns hold, we'd expect that most or all of the decline would come in the first quarter. In subsequent quarters, we'd expect loan balances for the Domestic Card segment to be relatively flat, as originations roughly offset both elevated charge-offs and installment loan run-off. To put this in perspective, Domestic Card loans shrank by about $11 billion in 2009 as a result of weak demand from creditworthy borrowers, elevated charge-offs, unusually low marketing and origination and the run-off of installment loans.Slide 13 shows annual Domestic Card revenue margins since 2004. While quarterly revenue margin can vary considerably, annual revenue margins have been very steady for seven years. Revenue margin in the Domestic Card business improved modestly in the fourth quarter to just over 17%. Recall that last quarter, we indicated that Domestic Card revenue margin would likely decline modestly in the fourth quarter, but remain above 16%. Fourth quarter revenue margin exceeded our previous expectations, largely as a result of better-than-expected credit results. The same credit results and outlook that contributed to the allowance released in the quarter had a parallel albeit smaller favorable impact on revenue. Actual credit results were favorable to our prior expectations, driving a more favorable assessment of the collectibility of finance charges and fees that were previously billed and not recognized as revenue. This allowed us to recognize some of these previously billed fees as revenue in the fourth quarter and to recognize a larger portion of our fourth quarter fee billings as well.Looking forward, our view of Domestic Card revenue margin for 2010 has not changed meaningfully, although the stronger-than-expected fourth quarter revenue margin changes the trajectory of how we expect to get there. We expect that quarterly Domestic Card revenue margin will be in the mid-15% range in 2010, although the revenue margin in the first quarter may come in a bit higher than that. Several factors may introduce more than usual uncertainty and quarterly variability in revenue margins. Continuing favorable credit impacts the revenue may push revenue margin a bit higher. Conversely, pending regulatory interpretation of aspects of the CARD laws such as defining reasonable fees and the need for issuers to consider ""on repricing"" later in 2010, post risks to the downside.Before moving to our Commercial and Consumer Banking businesses, I'd like to pull up and discuss our long-term outlook for Domestic Card more holistically. Relative to the industry, we believe our Domestic Card business will be less exposed to most aspects of the CARD law because we never relied on practices like aggressive penalty repricing, universal default or double-cycle billing. As a result, we'd expected we'll be able to essentially restart the marketing of similar products to similar customer segments that we were doing before we pulled back during the recession. We do expect to see a redistribution of where Credit Card revenue comes from in our U.S. Card business, with declining revenues from overlimit fees and increasing revenues from upfront pricing. In aggregate, we believe our revenue model will remain largely intact over time. Assuming an intact revenue model, bottom-line returns will be largely determined by where credit losses normalize. We expect the returns in our Card business to diminish modestly from pre-recession levels but to remain very attractive and well above hurdle rates over the longer term.Our outlook for 2010 revenue margin is consistent with this longer-term view. We're already seeing the redistribution in the 2009 trends of rising interest income and falling non-interest income in our Domestic Card business. Compared to 2008, Domestic Card net interest margin increased 86 basis points in 2009, while non-interest income as a percentage of loans decreased 87 basis points. The redistribution drove Domestic Card revenue margin for the third and fourth quarters of 2009 to unusually high levels. While the 2009 decline in non-interest income is mostly the result of consumer behavior changes in the downturn, we expect the new CARD law will drive continuing redistribution in 2010, which will result in quarterly revenue margin returning to more normal levels. As you can see on the graph, expected revenue margin in the mid-15% range is certainly consistent with our history over the last six years.We expect that 2010 Domestic Card results will reflect the continuing drag of declining loan balances resulting from installment loan run-off, as well as increasing marketing expense. But the Credit Card business has always been characterized by significant near-term marketing investments, followed by a long-term payoff with very attractive risk-adjusted returns. Margins will likely return to well above hurdle over the cycle. We expect that returns will be more sustainable, long term with competitive practices cleaned up by the CARD law. And as we said before, we believe that the Domestic Card market and the competitive environment following the implementation of the CARD law will play to our strengths.Slide 14 shows Commercial Banking credit trends. Commercial Banking charge-off rate increased sharply in the fourth quarter while the non-performing asset percentage declined. The divergent trends were driven by the small ticket commercial real estate loan portfolio, which continues to runoff after we stop originating these loans over two years ago. We charged off a portfolio of non-performing loans in the fourth quarter as we move to sell them. This also drove the sharp increase in Small Tickets CRE charge-offs you can see in the press release tables.In our core Commercial Lending businesses, which excludes the Small Ticket Commercial real estate portfolio, charge-off rate and the non-performing asset rate both increased driven by deterioration in the commercial and multi-family real estate portfolio. Within this portfolio, the deterioration remains concentrated in our relatively small construction portfolio and in loans related to New York City office buildings. Credit performance in the Middle Market portfolio was relatively stable. We believe that the continuing recession will drive continuing declines in commercial real estate values and that non-performers and charge-offs will remain elevated across our Commercial Banking businesses in 2010. Compared to most large banks, commercial loans are a much smaller percentage of our total company managed loans. And we also believe that our Commercial Banking loan portfolio is well positioned to weather the recession. We have a favorable loan mix, with relatively small exposure to construction lending. A relatively small exposure to construction lending is a key reason that the absolute level of our CRE charge-off rate is lower than many other banks. We also have a relatively large exposure to New York City multi-family, which has been resilient to recession because of rent controls and supply limitations. We have disciplined lending standards and we underwrite to in-place cash flows, and we follow a relationship-oriented approach that focuses on borrowers with whom we have had a long experience and deep relationships.Slide 15 shows credit results for Mortgage and Auto, the two largest components of the Consumer Banking loan portfolio. Delinquencies and charge-offs of the Mortgage portfolio continued to degrade along with industry but remain in line with industry credit trends for similar high-quality portfolios. Our Mortgage portfolio includes the Chevy Chase mortgage loans we acquired earlier in 2009. Our credit metrics and the P&L are largely insulated from the credit risk of the Chevy Chase mortgage loans because of the substantial credit mark we took at the time of the acquisition. Credit trends through 2009 are in line with our expectations, and we remain comfortable with the mark. Our current priority for the mortgage portfolio is aggressively managing defaults. We're also building infrastructure in developing strategies and anticipation of opportunities to grow in footprint mortgage originations as the mortgage market shakes out in the economic cycle turns.Auto Finance charge offs and delinquency rate both increased in the fourth quarter. The increase has resulted from expected seasonal patterns and the impact of the decline in the denominator. These factors were partially offset by the continuing success of our investments in Auto Finance collections and recoveries. Capital One Auto Finance delivered another strong quarter of profitability despite continuing economic headwinds. Our 2008 and 2009 origination vintages are delivering strong results. We've been able to originate loans with lower LTVs to customers with higher FICO scores. At the same time, we've been able to improve pricing and margins in the current competitive environment. As a result, we expect that the 2008 and 2009 originations will yield above hurdle risk-adjusted returns and our performance to date is tracking at or above these expectations.I'll conclude tonight on Slide 16. Pulling up, we've worked for years to position our company to be resilient, and we're demonstrating that resilience through the most challenging economic cycle that we've seen in generations. We delivered solid, pre-provision pretax earnings throughout the recession. We passed the government stress test, and we're able to be among the earliest to repay TARP. We've delivered bottom-line profitability for both the quarter and the year, and we've maintained the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet. As a result, we are well-positioned to deliver value as the cycle plays out. The mechanics of how we deliver value over the cycle will shape near-term trends. We expect that loans will continue to decline in 2010, driven largely by a continuing run-off of businesses we exited or repositioned earlier in the recession. As we near the peak of charge-offs in our Consumer businesses, the combination of declining loan balances and moderating economic outlook create the potential for significant allowance releases. Potential allowance releases would coincide with investments we expect to make to drive future growth and returns. In 2010, we expect that marketing expense will begin to ramp toward more normal historical levels and that operating expenses will be similar to 2009, as ongoing efficiency improvements are offset by investments in infrastructure.While we expect loan growth and returns to lag investment, just as they always have, we remain confident that the returns will be attractive and sustainable over the long term. Our results for the fourth quarter of 2009 provide a sort of preview of many of the trends that we expect to continue in 2010: Declining loan balances in stable margins; lower revenues and pre-provision earnings; and the offsetting effect of significant allowance release that resulted from both declining loan balances and modest favorability in credit results and outlook. As we enter 2010, we continue to make the tough decisions and take the actions that we believe will put our company in the best possible position to manage the company through the downturn for the benefit of shareholders. As a result of our actions, we believe that we remain well-positioned to weather the storm and to deliver shareholder value over the cycle.Now Gary and I will be happy to answer your questions.

I want to warn you it's not exactly the same thing because there's not an exact one for one in all of our businesses. For example, some of our commercial assets carrying allowance is different than 12 months expected loss and even in the Card business, the allowance is only booked against expected losses on loans already on our balance sheet. It doesn't speak to any potential losses and balances that could be booked over the course of the year.

So I think all told, over the last couple of years, you've seen a great stability, kind of in each of the major line items of our income statement, that is both revenue and expenses and provision, we put a lot of offsets within those areas. What you saw in this last quarter was a decline in revenue largely coming from balances. You saw relatively stable margins. You saw a slight tick up in expenses and a significant decline in provision expense.

However, it's also that we are not projecting some sense of just continual decline over the course of the year. One thing that creates uncertainty about the number and it was on display in the fourth quarter is what happens with respect to how credit comes in relative to our expectations and therefore, how that flows through seeing finance charge reserve impacts, which go through revenue. But frankly, other than those effect, this is pretty much a move toward the 15% kind of range and it's not some big decline over the course of the year. As we indicated that the first quarter probably be a graduation on the way to that. But I think this is more of a destination margin for us as opposed to something on the way to a different destination in the following year. I think our view about this thing is and the reason we put that slide into is kind of striking even to sort of take a trip through memory lane and look back in so many years with a relatively stable revenue margin because fundamentally, our business model isn't really all that much changed from where it's going to be versus where it has been over the past years. It's logical that and somewhat natural to us that it would be -- the revenue margin would be in a similar kind of a place. So frankly, the revenue margin in the 15% that we're talking about, is I think, sort of the -- as far out as we can see it kind of destination margin on the other side of the CARD Act and the other changes. I think there would be a gradual impact over the years as credit losses come down. Probably you'd see margins, sort of naturally moderate from there."

The geographic change, yes, there's some geographic change with respect to non-interest income going to net interest income. But the much more important thing is the geographic change of how pricing happens with respect to customers and the marketing. And the geographic change is that pricing is going to go much more to upfront, very clear pricing, and it's a return, along with that, to this business being about what it used to be so much about, which is upfront underwriting. And this is the business that we've been wanting for a long time. It's the business of the 90s and we look forward to that.

I think that when this CARD Act was first announced, we were thinking that you'd did see a pretty dramatic impact on the industry's loan balances, and that you would cause issuers to pull back from not only from Subprime but also the Prime segment, as the lack of repricing made those businesses, sort of made those little lending opportunities shrink combined with what we're already seeing in the shrinking industry with the consumers deleveraging. Your guidance appears to be a lot more aggressive for 2010 in terms of loan growth in the Card business. I just wanted to know what kind of sort of macro or industry assumptions you have around your ability to grow the card portfolio this year? And if you sort of share my recent thinking that a lot of the shrinkage in the Card industry's balances in 2009 was really more self-inflicted as everyone pulled back on marketing and pulled back online, you had the industry shrink a lot, and maybe as credit is turning, we'll see better industry growth this year."

So before we talk about kind of us in this year, let me talk about the industry and what's been happening and I think what's headed to happen over time. By far, the really big story with respect to outstandings in the Card business is the math of 10% charge-off rates. And it's pretty breathtaking watching the whole industry lose balances. And as we pointed out, that's always first and foremost, the thing that kind of drives ours and frankly, the industry's declines. As we've talked about, for ourselves, I can't speak for the industry, but for ourselves, sort of 2010 is the year that things kind of stabilized with respect to that as origination sort of moved to offset that. The second big point I'd make is there's a very big consumer phenomenon happening here. The lack of credit demand is a striking thing across all of our businesses, but we certainly see it in the Card business. And while I think that is particularly acute during this downturn, our expectation is on the other side of this downturn continued by us for the consumer to increase savings, as opposed to borrowings will be something that probably causes the Card business to be not have much growth and probably more likely to be something with respect to shrinking. So that leaves us to the part that we can more only speculate about is, what is the competitive environment, that in the end, kind of completes this equation? I think, in all the businesses that we're in across all of banking, I think that the competition has generally pulled back and some blend of licking their wounds and kind of rethinking their business model. But I would expect in the Card business there to be less competition than in the really intense days of the past but certainly, more  competition than the fairly obscene competition ourselves included over the past year. But for us, I think the encouraging thing is that for us, it's not really a matter of reinventing a business model. It's a matter of kind of just doing what we've done before and in the context of a more level playing field. And we really look forward to that opportunity. Don't confuse that with big rapid growth. But I think from everything we can see the opportunity, they have very healthy good quality growth with the kind of returns that we've enjoyed for many years is what we see. And as Gary and I have been pointing out, we just got to make sure our investors understand the mechanics of kind of going through the transition from big shrinking time to where we're restarting the engine and really getting growth going again."

So, but let me come back to that. Again, we start with the math. We start our race well behind the starting line because we got to take all the math of charge-offs then our little -- our business of installment loans, which is part of what we report to you, that sense is farther behind the starting line, just with respect to growth. I think our point is not so much about big growth from here. It's more a point of not going backwards more at this year. I think most of the backward move, you'll see in the first quarter. The rest of the year is for the entire reported segment.  It's probably something more about being in balance with respect to that. But whether we move forward or a little somewhat forward or somewhat backwards, relative to that is really more of a matter of what happens at the line of scrimmage. Now, what opportunities there are? I think that we still really have to watch what happens with respect to competitive pricing in the business. The part of the business that is going to see -- that has to be the most sort of reinvented for the industry has been sort of right there square in the Prime Revolver space where the old business model was long 0% teaser rates and have the penalty repricing, as a way to make the margins go around. With that basically gone, as we've always said, the key thing to look at is the go-to rates. Don't focus so much on teasers and their length and what they are. Interest rates are pretty low these days, but the go-to rates will be the key indicator. We have seen go-to rates in the last -- from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this year, go-to rates, with respect to what's in the mail. They have gone up by about 250 basis points in absolute and about 300 basis points when adjusted for the prime rate, so kind of on a net basis. So that is good progress including 100 basis points of progress just in the last quarter. So our appetite for the kind of the right smack in the middle of the Prime Revolver space is going to be driven, I think by where pricing goes, but as well as consumer demand. The other point is, by the way, it's not yet at its destination, where it really needs to be. In my opinion, pricing -- remember that this industry now doesn't have the repricing ability it had before. It's got forward repricing, which works in a muted and very delayed basis. So the industry has to have destination pricing in its go-to rates and that's what we're going to be looking for, and it's not fully there yet."

As far as the marketing expense, Sanjay, again, I think both Rich and I have indicated that we saw a little bit of recovery in the fourth quarter. We certainly expect that artificially depressed or historically depressed levels of 2009 are not a sustainable level of marketing spend. We're going to expect to see that grow exactly how quickly and where we end up is going to be based on the marketing opportunities we see. But I think the direction is pretty clear."

The other thing that we have said simply because the math is pretty obvious is that we do expect our balances to be coming down. And Rich and I both indicated in which businesses those are likely to come. A lot of the balance decline is really going to come outside of the revolving Credit Card space. But with the balances coming down, that would tend to drive allowance releases even if the outlook for credit were to remain absolutely stable. Any additional allowance release that comes from further confidence in the moderating outlook for charge-offs would obviously have the potential to drive more. But in terms of the actual amount, we're just going to wait and see how these things play through."

More importantly, just the way we feel about the business is that it's kind of the good news, bad news. And the most important credit takeaway we want to say is the good news is and certainly in all consumer businesses, probably with the exception of mortgage, you can reach out and just about touch effectively the peak that is there. And we've been waiting for this for a long time, and we've been declaring for sometime now that there are indicators that this thing is coming, and we feel absolutely consistent with respect to that point. The bad news in that sense or the other point want to make is do not confuse that with a lot of evidence out there that there's a big turnaround coming from here. Certainly, the economy, if anything, the metrics have disappointed us over time, and maybe as we keep revising upward our economic -- worsening our economic outlook, interestingly, probably over the course of most of this year, our own credit metrics have actually outperformed in a good way to sort of offset these effects. So we sort of -- in fact, if you look back to a year ago, what we said the losses we're going to be ending up to be almost exactly what -- how they finally have. So I think we see actually in this phase of the cycle, a little bit of reduction in the impact on credit metrics of things like the unemployment, just a little bit, which in the sense, has just serve to allow this settling out to happen even though unemployment still is getting worse. We're probably seeing the early stages of what we've seen in past recessions. I think back to the one in the early 90s as we look through that, that credit metrics tend to level out, somewhat before the final stubborn economic metrics of which the ultimate, probably stubborn one is unemployment rate."

How do you look going forward? I think it's almost a little paradoxical. It's seems Capital One has been early at least in terms of repricing its customers and now you've seen a couple of months most people have repriced on the Prime side. How are you seeing the competitive landscape into the ingredients that made Capital One great? You talked about fund  [ph] and repricing but a lot of that was the discovery of positive selection.

I mean, when we look back to the good old days, there were certainly a few great things about the 90s that we don't have anymore. The top of my list would be the tremendous growth of the industry, and we all had wins in our back. As we're doing that, we were living through what would turn out to be the most protracted positive economic period. That was a great thing and also, the major players were a lot of the business net net was coming away from regional banks. It was really the nationalization of the Credit Card business and therefore, all of us national players were taking share from the regional banks. And along the way, I think some of the innovations led to positive selection. So a lot of those things are there for the history books, but they're not really kind of what is in front of us. But on the other hand, the really tough chapter, which is the second chapter of the Card industry, at least in my 27 years of managing this, is really tough chapter of the last decade, which has been characterized by aggressive industry practices that I think kind of undercut the business model off of what a company like Capital One had built and created something that was very threatening to franchise and caused us to walk away from whole parts of the business. So I would characterized the next generation of the Card business or sort of the third chapter of the Card industry is going to be -- it's a very level playing field. It will be returned to upfront underwriting. And I don't think it's a matter of whether there's positive or negative selection. Every interaction with every day in the marketplace has you can always find positive and negative selection. So I think the opportunities will be there. There will be way more premium on really rigorous information-based decision making than there has been in the last 10 years. And I think that with the bad practices both from a customer point of view and from a credit point of view, having been purged from the system, this is going to be a level of playing field where I think appropriately conservative issuers will have growth opportunities that won't remind you of the 90s. But that I think will make, for those that do it well, make returns very consistent with some of the best periods that we've had pound for pound."

So certainly, the Auto business, from a credit point of view, has certainly performed very well and over the course of the year, better than the expectations consistent with some of my earlier comments. One thing I do want to point out about the Auto business is that it shouldn't necessarily surprise us that it starts performing better with respect to credit because the life of the asset is shorter. So in Auto, because of the essentially two to two and a half year average life of an auto loan, now that we're, like a couple of years into this mess, most of our portfolio has been originated with our eyes wide open with respect to the mess that the economy is in and therefore, it's very conservatively underwritten and so on. And it is performing extremely well and a lot of that is the math of portfolio mix, as well as I think, just generally some of the unique dynamics of how consumers are paying their auto loans. So going forward, we downsize that business so the tail doesn't wag the dog of Capital One, which it almost started to do at some point. But I think that we see that as a good opportunity for Capital One going forward. The International business, we're in the U.K. and Canada with respect to credit card. Let me start with Canada, that's a bit of an easier story. Canada has been really quite a successful business and the Canadian economy hasn't suffered as much. So generally, that business has gone well. We're just still hunkered down a bit, weathering their smaller storm up there. In the U.K., it's been the hardest. It's been kind of a perfect storm combination of tough economic environment and some pretty severe regulatory and legislative kind of changes in that environment. And so, we've gotten hit more badly there. We have hunkered down and you'll notice from the numbers, probably you can't see them by country. That businesses has gone from bleeding pretty substantially to actually really turning the corner and while it's not bringing some great return, it's really stabilized and we feel a lot better about it."

Earnings for our fu",2879,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon to everyone listening to the call. I'll begin on Slide 3 of the earnings presentation. In the fourth quarter, Capital One earned $376 million or $0.83 per share, a slight decline from the prior quarter. Earnings for our full year 2009 were $884 million or $0.75 per share, after including the $1.31 dividend and repayment expense of the government's preferred share investment that we repaid in full in the second quarter.Revenues in the fourth quarter were down $216 million from the prior quarter with the largest factor being $113 million fewer gains from the sales of securities than we recognized in the third quarter. A continued decline in average assets also contributed to the dip in revenue despite stable net interest margin. These declines were somewhat offset by a modest improvement in the value of our retained interests, as well as less suppression of Card revenue.Non-interest expenses were up 8% from the link to quarter. This marketing began to recover from historically low levels and operating expenses saw expected fourth-quarter increases. While pre-provision earnings fell by $362 million, provision expense improved by $354 million. It's a $386 million release in our allowance more than offset to modestly higher charge-offs. More on Credit performance in the allowance in a moment.The $28 million after-tax loss in discontinued operations includes GreenPoint rep and warranty expense. All told, despite some larger swings in the individual line items in the quarter, earnings per share were relatively flat. For the full year, a challenging economy helped drive a 3% decrease in average loans. However, historically widespreads on low-risk investment securities, particularly in the first half of 2009, led us to grow the investment portfolio by 26%. So our overall earning assets were up modestly in the year. This strategy helped reduce stable margins in flat year-over-year revenue.Looking ahead to 2010, we expect the trend of declining loans to continue, with the run-off of certain portfolios and high levels of charge-offs. But unlike 2009, we do not expect this average loan decline to be offset by further growth in our securities portfolio, as risk-adjusted returns are likely to be less attractive than in 2009. While margins may moderate slightly from fourth quarter levels, we expect that annual margins will largely be similar year-over-year. All told, stable margins on a smaller portfolio will likely lead to lower revenue in 2010.In response to lower loan demand and economic uncertainty, we pulled back on marketing spend in 2009. This decrease was offset by the addition of Chevy Chase Bank operating expenses. We expect non-interest expenses to increase in 2010. Media and other marketing costs are likely to begin to rise from depressed levels to levels that are more in line with our historical marketing spend depending on our revolving view of market opportunities. Operating expenses will likely remain stable as ongoing efficiency improvements are offset by investments in our banking and mortgage infrastructure.Full year 2009 provision expense was essentially flat versus the 2008 level, as higher charge-offs in 2009 were offset by a $2 billion positive swing in allowance from a $1.6 billion build in 2008 to $400  million release in 2009. This $400 million release was more than accounted for by a smaller reported loan book. The potential for a reduction in our 2010 allowance due to decline in balances and the moderating credit outlook could result in a significantly lower provision expense. Of course, the economic picture continues to evolve rapidly and the results of various line items may play out differently than projections I just as described. In any event, our balance sheet affords us a great deal of flexibility to manage in a changing environment. This flexibility was clearly on display as we navigated to tough environment to produce strong results in 2009 and we'll continue to stay flexible as we manage through 2010.As we turn to Slide 4, I'll describe the impact of our loan trends and economic outlook on our allowance. Our overall allowance declined by $386 million in the quarter as builds in both Commercial and Other Consumer Banking were more than offset by releases in both Auto and Credit Card. In Commercial Banking, it's worth noting that the supplemental tables show a spike in the GreenPoint's Small Ticket CRE charge-offs, which was driven by a movement of $277 million of those loans to held-for-sale, causing us to charge the loans down the market value. Excluding this impact, non-performing loans continue to rise while the total size of the portfolio remained largely flat, causing us to build our allowance by $115 million in the quarter, which will discuss credit trends in the Commercial Banking segment in greater detail in a few moments.In the Auto business, $1.1 billion of loan shrinkage in the quarter and continued improvement in credits stemming from our portfolio shift to higher quality originations from 2008 and 2009 led to $96 million release in our allowance for that business. In Domestic Card, about three quarters of the $416 million allowance release is driven by changes in the size and structure of our loan portfolio. About $220 million of that impact relates directly to the reduced level of reported balances. The remaining quarter of the Card allowance release is driven by the regrounding of our models to reflect the fact that actual credit performance has been favorable to our internal expectations even though some macroeconomic variables have come in worse than we expected. As you'll hear from Rich in a moment, we remain cautious in our economic outlook especially with respect to the labor and housing markets. Consistent with this view, we are continuing to maintain high levels of allowance to both reported loans and delinquencies. Turning to Slide 5, I'll discuss movements in our balance sheet. Assets increased by $2.4 billion in the quarter, as shrinkage in each of our lending businesses was more than offset by growth in our securities portfolio and cash position. Our managed Domestic Card portfolio was down $1.6 billion in the quarter, driven primarily by $1 billion of run-off in our closed-end loan portfolio. The closed-end loan portfolio hit about $7 billion in outstanding as of the end of the year and it will continue to pressure Card growth as we expect approximately $3  billion to run off over the course of 2010. The slight shrinkage in our fourth quarter commercial banking portfolio was more than driven by the shift of the Small Ticket CRE portfolio to held-for-sale that I mentioned earlier. Our Commercial Lending business is expected to grow modestly in 2010.On the Consumer Bank side, the $1.9 billion decline in fourth quarter assets was primarily driven by $1.1 billion of lower outstandings in the Auto business and the $700 million decline in the size of our mortgage portfolio. With respect to Auto, recall, we drastically pulled back on origination volume in early 2008 and we are now beginning to approach the point that which the run-off of prior originations will equal new originations. As a result of this slowing pace of run-off, we expect ending loans to be down approximately $1.5 billion over 2010 compared to a $3.3 billion decline in 2009. Our mortgage portfolio largely remains in run-off mode, and we expect that portfolio to decline by approximately $2.5 billion in 2010.Our $39 billion securities portfolio remains fairly constant quarter-over-quarter, both in terms of size as well as composition. The total net unrealized gain of the portfolio now stands at $291 million, down some $49 million in the third quarter, primarily as a result of higher interest rates across the medium and long-term parts of the yield curve. And finally, we had a nearly $5 billion increase in our cash position in the fourth quarter, as we held late-quarter deposit growth in the proceeds from our November trust preferred issuance in cash and cash equivalents. We expect the substantial amount of disposition to roll off in the first quarter.Between the run-off of our closed-end portfolio in the Card business and declining Consumer Loans in both Auto and Mortgage, we expect these businesses will together lose approximately $7 billion of loans in 2010. While our other lending businesses may see net growth this year despite elevated levels of charge-offs, it is reasonable to assume that the total loan portfolio will decline by mid-single digits in terms of percentage this year. Taking in to account, the rapid shrinkage already experienced in 2009, the averaging impact of a mid-single digit percentage decline in ending loan balances this year will equate to a high-single digit percentage decline in average loan balances. And on liability side, we continue to leverage the flexibility of both our branch and national direct bank platforms to drive down funding costs. In the fourth quarter, we swapped out of higher price time deposits into money market and savings accounts and increased the amount of non-interest-bearing deposits. You'll see the benefit of these moves on funding costs on Slide 6.While asset yield declined by 14 basis points in the quarter, we were able to offset most of the decline through lower funding costs, resulting in a stable net interest margin. As I indicated on the last call, some of the non-interest income revenue realized in the third quarter was not sustainable in the fourth quarter. And revenue margins fell slightly, but remained high. While both net interest margin and revenue margin may moderate slightly from fourth quarter levels, we expect the full-year rates for 2010 to be similar to those in 2009. With revenue down and non-interest expenses up in the quarter, the efficiency ratio climbed 5% from the abnormally low third quarter to 43.9%. Looking ahead, the expectation for a smaller loan portfolio will put downward pressure on revenues in 2010. Coupling that with our expected increase in marketing and largely stable operating expenses, it's prudent to assume that our efficiency ratio will rise year-over-year. I'll now discuss capital on Slide 7.Our ratio of tangible common equity to tangible managed assets rose 10 basis points in the quarter to 6.3%, as earnings more than offset a modest increase in tangible assets. In addition to the increase in common equity, we see in the TCE ratio, the Tier 1 ratio benefited from three additional factors. First, the reported balance sheet got smaller. Second, some of the asset growth was in cash, which carries a zero-risk weight on our regulatory ratio. And finally, Tier 1 includes the proceeds of our $1 billion trust preferred issue in November. In aggregate, these factors resulted in an overall 190-basis-point improvement in the tier one ratio. While these capital ratios are at their highest point since the third quarter of 2008, the composition of reported capital and reserves will, of course, change considerably with the first quarter implementation of FAS 166 and 167, as well as the corresponding implementation of the regulatory capital rules over the next five quarters.Turning to Slide 8, I'll describe these impacts in greater detail for you. For Capital One, consolidation under FAS 166, 167 takes effect on January 1, 2010. While you will see the actual impact of book value consolidation when we report first quarter earnings, we thought it would be useful to describe the key impacts of consolidation by providing on this slide an estimated balance sheet for the start of the quarter. Under FAS 166 and 167, we are bringing back all $46 billion of securitized credit card and installment loan assets and approximately $1.5 billion of securitized mortgage assets. These $47.8 billion of assets can be seen in the adjustment to loans held for investment on the slide. It's worth noting that about $6 billion of securitized mortgage assets will remain off balance sheet. Even though we don't retain all of the risks associated with securitized assets, we will build an allowance at the comparable coverage ratio to existing on balance sheet assets upon consolidation. The implementation of FAS 166 and 167 will, therefore, reduce retained earnings primarily due to the after-tax effect of the $4.3 billion allowance build, and the allowance would stand at $8.4 billion.The change in accounting also eliminates the line item for accounts receivables from securitizations. This account included several different items, most materially the securitizations retained by Capital One as well as the cash in collection accounts related to our securitization transactions. About $5 billion of retained interest in our own securitizations will now be classified as loans and the amounts in the securitization-related cash accounts will now be classified as cash. The change in other assets is primarily due to the deferred tax asset created upon implementation. And finally, we will increase our securitization liability to account for the debt associated with those assets. Now that I've shared the geography movements of the balance sheet, I'll provide pro forma capital estimates for these impact on Slide 9.Since we've always captured securitized card assets in the denominator of our TCE ratio, the only impact of consolidation to the denominator of the TCE ratio comes from the addition of $1.5 billion of securitized mortgage assets. This asset increase, coupled with the reduction in the numerator caused by the $4.3 billion allowance build, would have decreased the TCE ratio by about 150 basis points to 4.8% as of the end of the year. Since the allowance build is tax affected, you'll note on the right-hand graph that the allowance grows more than our TCE declines. Going forward, given the natural runoff of high fourth quarter cash balances, the impact of our runoff portfolios and likely seasonal declines in revolving credit utilization, we continue to expect that our TCE ratio will be above 5% at the end of the first quarter and will likely grow thereafter.Our Tier 1 and other risk-based capital ratios will be impacted by more significant moves in both the numerator and the denominator. But unlike the full and immediate impact of consolidation to the TCE ratio, the timing of the impact will be realized more gradually, in line with the phase-in framework established by national bank regulators. The phase-in period extends through 2010 with the full impact of consolidation of our balance sheet securitization for regulatory capital purposes included as of the first quarter of 2011. We are providing pro forma estimates of regulatory capital ratios using the rules, which will be in place as of March 31, 2010, in order to facilitate sequential comparisons when we report at the end of the first quarter of 2010.Pro forma Tier 1 ratios as of 12/31/09, are impacted by a decline in the numerator, as we account for the allowance-driven reduction in retained earnings. The numerator is further reduced by our need to disallow, for regulatory capital purposes, some or all of the deferred tax asset, which results from the consolidation-driven increase in allowance. The net result of the reduced numerator will cause pro forma Tier 1 ratios to decline from actual 12/31/09 ratios by some 400 basis points. Beginning in the third quarter of 2010, what remains then of current off-balance sheet assets will begin to flow in part into the denominator of the Tier 1 ratio. Of course, the numerator may also change between now and then depending on changes in the allowance over the next few quarters.Total risk-based capital rules dictate not only a phase-in period for including securitized loans in the denominator of risk-weighted assets, but also for the numerator impact of any allowance build associated with the consolidation of off-balance sheet assets. As a result, there's only a de minimis impact in the pro forma estimate of total risk-based capital on 12/31/09, compared to the actual ratio prior to consolidation. Now aside from the balance sheet impact to this transition, it's important to note that our income statement will also be impacted in future quarters by consolidation. Since allowance will now be required for all of our managed assets, the movement in our allowance for our Card business, for example, will be approximately three times as large as it would otherwise have been had the 2/3 our card loans that are securitized stayed off-balance sheet. Given our expectation for continued loan shrinkage in 2010, allowance releases associated with declining loan volume will now be amplified compared to what it would've been without the FAS 166 and 167 implementation. In addition to the allowance, our I/O strip and other retained interest valuation will change also as a result of consolidation. Prior to FAS 166 and 167, we recognized small gains upon securitization and changes to our valuation flow through non-interest income. Post-consolidation, no gains will be recognized and allowance will be established upon loan origination and changes to expected losses will flow through the provision at a level higher than previously recorded through the I/O strip.As we've been saying for a number of quarters, the implementation of FAS 166 and 167 simply creates a migration of accounting entries across the balance sheet and does not change our company's risk profile or capacity to absorb that risk. Our balance sheet remains extremely strong and flexible and those characteristics give us tremendous confidence in our ability to produce strong results despite a challenging and uncertain environment. With that, I'll pass the call over to Rich to talk about the performance of our businesses in greater detail. Rich?"

I'll begin on Slide 10. Our Credit Card business was the biggest contributor of profits in the quarter, with both the Domestic and International Card businesses posting a profit. I'll discuss the results of the Card business in a moment.In o",2703,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 10. Our Credit Card business was the biggest contributor of profits in the quarter, with both the Domestic and International Card businesses posting a profit. I'll discuss the results of the Card business in a moment.In our Commercial Banking business, credit performance was the biggest driver of the net loss. Provision expense actually declined modestly from the third quarter, but remains elevated. Looking beyond credit results, commercial loan balances declined slightly while low-cost commercial deposits grew. Higher loan yields drove a modest increase in revenue. Non-interest expenses increased, driven by rising costs associated with loan workouts and by continuing infrastructure investments.The Consumer Banking business posted a modest net loss for the quarter. Seasonal credit trends reduced fourth quarter Auto Finance profit compared to the third quarter. Mortgage portfolio revenues and profits declined as a result of negative valuation adjustments to retained interest and securitized mortgage portfolios and MSR write-down and purchase accounting adjustments. We also continued to experience the expected runoff of mortgage balances.Consumer Banking provision expense increased, with seasonal increases in Auto Finance and continued deterioration in mortgage and home equity credit trends. Operating expenses increased in the quarter as the result of several factors. Fourth quarter includes planned expenses related to the integration of Chevy Chase Bank. Beyond integration, we're investing to build a scalable banking infrastructure to ensure that we're well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities to grow our banking businesses. And higher costs associated with Auto Finance collections and mortgage loss mitigation operations contributed to higher operating expenses in the quarter. Consumer Banking deposits grew even as deposit interest expense declined again in the fourth quarter. Slide 11 shows credit results for our Credit Card business. Domestic Card charge-off rate was relatively stable from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, decreasing 5 basis points. There were a number of offsetting factors under the surface. The fourth quarter is a period of seasonal headwinds in Domestic Card. All else equal, that would have increased fourth quarter charge-off rate by about 80 basis points. Domestic Card assets continued to shrink in the fourth quarter. This denominator effect led to a 45 basis point increase in the fourth quarter charge-off rate. Fourth quarter charge-off rate included a 60 basis point benefit relative to Q3, as we passed the peak of the OCC minimum payment impact in the third quarter. The OCC minimum payment impact fell from about 80 basis points in the third quarter to about 20 basis points in the fourth quarter.When you adjust for the effects of seasonality, OCC minimum payment impact and declining denominator, underlying credit quality in our Domestic Card portfolio improved in the fourth quarter. Later stage delinquency flow rates declined slightly after rising rapidly over the previous year. Our post charge-off recovery liquidation rates showed signs of stabilization after prolonged periods of decline. Bankruptcies were slightly lower on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and while early stage delinquency flow rates remain elevated in Q4, they declined slightly from the third quarter.Domestic Card delinquencies rose 40 basis points in the fourth quarter. Our delinquency rate increased more than some others. It appears that the adverse trends in flow rates in delinquency bucket inventories has abated, although we do expect that elevated delinquency to lead to an increase in charge-offs in the first quarter 2010. Overall, we expect further increases in the Domestic Card charge-off rate into 2010. We expect the charge-off rate for the first quarter could cross 11%, driven by declining loan balances and the effect of pricing actions flowing through to charge-offs.We believe that we'll reach the quarterly peak of charge-off dollars in the first quarter of 2010, although declining loan balances may cause charge-off rates to remain elevated for a bit longer. But similar to our view of unemployment rate, nearing a peak does not necessarily mean that we're nearing the beginning of a robust recovery. But barring significant adverse changes to our long-term credit outlook or the regulatory environment, we expect that our Domestic Card business will remain profitable in 2010.Credit trends in the International business reflect continuing economic weakness in the U.K. and Canada. We've been retrenching the U.K. business for sometime now and we've been cautious in Canada in anticipation of the credit worsening that began in the first half of 2009. Fourth quarter credit results, as well as the outlook for reaching the peak of dollar charge-offs in the first quarter of 2010, resulted in a significant decline in provision expense for our Credit Card business. Declining provision expense was the key driver of profitability in the quarter.Slide 12 shows loan balances for the Domestic and International Card businesses. Ending loans in our Domestic Card business continued to decline in the quarter. The decline resulted from the continuing run-off of nationally originated installment loans and elevated charge-offs partially offset by seasonal balance build. In 2009, we continue to aggressively manage the company through the downturn, in part by retrenching and pulling back on originations. As a result, marketing expense for 2009 was unusually low. In 2010, we expect the Domestic Card marketing expenses will ramp back toward more normal levels, depending on our assessment of the market and emerging opportunities for profitable and resilient origination growth. However, we expect that increased marketing will not result in net loan growth in 2010. While increased marketing may result in revolving loan originations that more or less offset the effect of elevated charge-offs, we expect Domestic Card loans to decline in 2010 because continuing run-off of about $3 billion of installment loans.If normal seasonal patterns hold, we'd expect that most or all of the decline would come in the first quarter. In subsequent quarters, we'd expect loan balances for the Domestic Card segment to be relatively flat, as originations roughly offset both elevated charge-offs and installment loan run-off. To put this in perspective, Domestic Card loans shrank by about $11 billion in 2009 as a result of weak demand from credit worthy borrowers, elevated charge-offs, unusually low marketing and origination and the run-off of installment loans.Slide 13 shows annual Domestic Card revenue margins since 2004. While quarterly revenue margin can vary considerably, annual revenue margins have been very steady for seven years. Revenue margin in the Domestic Card business improved modestly in the fourth quarter to just over 17%. Recall that last quarter, we indicated that Domestic Card revenue margin would likely decline modestly in the fourth quarter, but remain above 16%. Fourth quarter revenue margin exceeded our previous expectations, largely as a result of better-than-expected credit results. The same credit results and outlook that contributed to the allowance released in the quarter had a parallel albeit smaller favorable impact on revenue. Actual credit results were favorable to our prior expectations, driving a more favorable assessment of the collectibility of finance charges and fees that were previously billed and not recognized as revenue. This allowed us to recognize some of these previously billed fees as revenue in the fourth quarter and to recognize a larger portion of our fourth quarter fee billings as well.Looking forward, our view of Domestic Card revenue margin for 2010 has not changed meaningfully, although the stronger-than-expected fourth quarter revenue margin changes the trajectory of how we expect to get there. We expect that quarterly Domestic Card revenue margin will be in the mid-15% range in 2010, although the revenue margin in the first quarter may come in a bit higher than that. Several factors may introduce more than usual uncertainty and quarterly variability in revenue margins. Continuing favorable credit impacts the revenue may push revenue margin a bit higher. Conversely, pending regulatory interpretation of aspects of the CARD laws such as defining reasonable fees and the need for issuers to consider ""on repricing"" later in 2010, post risks to the downside.Before moving to our Commercial and Consumer Banking businesses, I'd like to pull up and discuss our long-term outlook for Domestic Card more holistically. Relative to the industry, we believe our Domestic Card business will be less exposed to most aspects of the CARD law because we never relied on practices like aggressive penalty repricing, universal default or double-cycle billing. As a result, we'd expected we'll be able to essentially restart the marketing of similar products to similar customer segments that we were doing before we pulled back during the recession. We do expect to see a redistribution of where Credit Card revenue comes from in our U.S. Card business, with declining revenues from overlimit fees and increasing revenues from upfront pricing. In aggregate, we believe our revenue model will remain largely intact over time. Assuming an intact revenue model, bottom-line returns will be largely determined by where credit losses normalize. We expect the returns in our Card business to diminish modestly from pre-recession levels but to remain very attractive and well above hurdle rates over the longer term.Our outlook for 2010 revenue margin is consistent with this longer-term view. We're already seeing the redistribution in the 2009 trends of rising interest income and falling non-interest income in our Domestic Card business. Compared to 2008, Domestic Card net interest margin increased 86 basis points in 2009, while non-interest income as a percentage of loans decreased 87 basis points. The redistribution drove Domestic Card revenue margin for the third and fourth quarters of 2009 to unusually high levels. While the 2009 decline in non-interest income is mostly the result of consumer behavior changes in the downturn, we expect the new CARD law will drive continuing redistribution in 2010, which will result in quarterly revenue margin returning to more normal levels. As you can see on the graph, expected revenue margin in the mid-15% range is certainly consistent with our history over the last six years.We expect that 2010 Domestic Card results will reflect the continuing drag of declining loan balances resulting from installment loan run-off, as well as increasing marketing expense. But the Credit Card business has always been characterized by significant near-term marketing investments, followed by a long-term payoff with very attractive risk-adjusted returns. Margins will likely return to well above hurdle over the cycle. We expect that returns will be more sustainable, long term with competitive practices cleaned up by the CARD law. And as we said before, we believe that the Domestic Card market and the competitive environment following the implementation of the CARD law will play to our strengths.Slide 14 shows Commercial Banking credit trends. Commercial Banking charge-off rate increased sharply in the fourth quarter while the non-performing asset percentage declined. The divergent trends were driven by the small ticket commercial real estate loan portfolio, which continues to runoff after we stop originating these loans over two years ago. We charged off a portfolio of non-performing loans in the fourth quarter as we move to sell them. This also drove the sharp increase in Small Tickets CRE charge-offs you can see in the press release tables.In our core Commercial Lending businesses, which excludes the Small Ticket Commercial real estate portfolio, charge-off rate and the non-performing asset rate both increased driven by deterioration in the commercial and multi-family real estate portfolio. Within this portfolio, the deterioration remains concentrated in our relatively small construction portfolio and in loans related to New York City office buildings. Credit performance in the Middle Market portfolio was relatively stable. We believe that the continuing recession will drive continuing declines in commercial real estate values and that non-performers and charge-offs will remain elevated across our Commercial Banking businesses in 2010. Compared to most large banks, commercial loans are a much smaller percentage of our total company managed loans. And we also believe that our Commercial Banking loan portfolio is well positioned to weather the recession. We have a favorable loan mix, with relatively small exposure to construction lending. A relatively small exposure to construction lending is a key reason that the absolute level of our CRE charge-off rate is lower than many other banks. We also have a relatively large exposure to New York City multi-family, which has been resilient to recession because of rent controls and supply limitations. We have disciplined lending standards and we underwrite to in-place cash flows, and we follow a relationship-oriented approach that focuses on borrowers with whom we have had a long experience and deep relationships.Slide 15 shows credit results for Mortgage and Auto, the two largest components of the Consumer Banking loan portfolio. Delinquencies and charge-offs of the Mortgage portfolio continued to degrade along with industry but remain in line with industry credit trends for similar high-quality portfolios. Our Mortgage portfolio includes the Chevy Chase mortgage loans we acquired earlier in 2009. Our credit metrics and the P&L are largely insulated from the credit risk of the Chevy Chase mortgage loans because of the substantial credit mark we took at the time of the acquisition. Credit trends through 2009 are in line with our expectations, and we remain comfortable with the mark. Our current priority for the mortgage portfolio is aggressively managing defaults. We're also building infrastructure in developing strategies and anticipation of opportunities to grow in footprint mortgage originations as the mortgage market shakes out in the economic cycle turns.Auto Finance charge-offs and delinquency rate both increased in the fourth quarter. The increase has resulted from expected seasonal patterns and the impact of the decline in the denominator. These factors were partially offset by the continuing success of our investments in Auto Finance collections and recoveries. Capital One Auto Finance delivered another strong quarter of profitability despite continuing economic headwinds. Our 2008 and 2009 origination vintages are delivering strong results. We've been able to originate loans with lower LTVs to customers with higher FICO scores. At the same time, we've been able to improve pricing and margins in the current competitive environment. As a result, we expect that the 2008 and 2009 originations will yield above hurdle risk-adjusted returns and our performance to date is tracking at or above these expectations.I'll conclude tonight on Slide 16. Pulling up, we've worked for years to position our company to be resilient, and we're demonstrating that resilience through the most challenging economic cycle that we've seen in generations. We delivered solid, pre-provision pretax earnings throughout the recession. We passed the government stress test, and we're able to be among the earliest to repay TARP. We've delivered bottom-line profitability for both the quarter and the year, and we've maintained the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet. As a result, we are well-positioned to deliver value as the cycle plays out. The mechanics of how we deliver value over the cycle will shape near-term trends. We expect that loans will continue to decline in 2010, driven largely by a continuing run-off of businesses we exited or repositioned earlier in the recession. As we near the peak of charge-offs in our Consumer businesses, the combination of declining loan balances and moderating economic outlook create the potential for significant allowance releases. Potential allowance releases would coincide with investments we expect to make to drive future growth and returns. In 2010, we expect that marketing expense will begin to ramp toward more normal historical levels and that operating expenses will be similar to 2009, as ongoing efficiency improvements are offset by investments in infrastructure.While we expect loan growth and returns to lag investment, just as they always have, we remain confident that the returns will be attractive and sustainable over the long term. Our results for the fourth quarter of 2009 provide a sort of preview of many of the trends that we expect to continue in 2010: Declining loan balances in stable margins; lower revenues and pre-provision earnings; and the offsetting effect of significant allowance release that resulted from both declining loan balances and modest favorability in credit results and outlook. As we enter 2010, we continue to make the tough decisions and take the actions that we believe will put our company in the best possible position to manage the company through the downturn for the benefit of shareholders. As a result of our actions, we believe that we remain well-positioned to weather the storm and to deliver shareholder value over the cycle.Now Gary and I will be happy to answer your questions.

So I think all told, over the last couple of years, you've seen a great stability, kind of in each of the major line items of our income statement, that is both revenue and expenses and provision, we put a lot of offsets within those areas. What you saw in this last quarter was a decline in revenue largely coming from balances. You saw relatively stable margins. You saw a slight tick up in expenses and a significant decline in provision expense. And that seems to me a reasonable expectation as the economy begins to turn, if that's in fact what it turns out to be doing."

However, it's also that we are not projecting some sense of just continual decline over the course of the year. One thing that creates uncertainty about the number and it was on display in the fourth quarter is what happens with respect to how credit comes in relative to our expectations and therefore, how that flows through, seeing finance charge reserve impacts, which go through revenue. But frankly, other than those effect, this is pretty much a move toward the 15% kind of range and it's not some big decline over the course of the year. As we indicated that the first quarter probably be a graduation on the way to that. But I think this is more of a destination margin for us, as opposed to something on the way to a different destination in the following year. I think our view about this thing is and the reason we put that slide in too, it's kind of striking even to sort of take a trip through memory lane and look back at so many years with a relatively stable revenue margin because fundamentally, our business model isn't really all that much changed from where it's going to be versus where it has been over the past years. It's logical that and somewhat natural to us that it would be -- the revenue margin would be in a similar kind of a place. So frankly, the revenue margin in the 15% that we're talking about, is I think, sort of the -- as far out as we can see it kind of destination margin on the other side of the CARD Act and the other changes. I think there would be a gradual impact over the years as credit losses come down. Probably you'd see margins sort of naturally moderate from there."

The geographic change, yes, there's some geographic change with respect to non-interest income going to net interest income. But the much more important thing is the geographic change of how pricing happens with respect to customers and the marketing. And the geographic change is that pricing is going to go much more to upfront, very clear pricing and it's a return, along with that, to this business being about what it used to be so much about, which is upfront underwriting. And this is the business that we've been wanting for a long time. It's the business of the 90s and we look forward to that.

I think that when this CARD Act was first announced, we were thinking that you'd see a pretty dramatic impact on the industry's loan balances, and that you would cause issuers to pull back from not only Subprime but also the Prime segment, as the lack of repricing made those businesses, sort of made those little lending opportunities shrink combined with what we're already seeing in a shrinking industry with consumers deleveraging. Your guidance appears to be a lot more aggressive for 2010 in terms of loan growth in the Card business. I just wanted to know what kind of sort of macro or industry assumptions you have around your ability to grow the Card portfolio this year? And if you sort of share my recent thinking that a lot of the shrinkage in the Card industry's balances in 2009 was really more self-inflicted as everyone pulled back on marketing and pulled back online, you had the industry shrink a lot, and maybe as credit is turning, we'll see better industry growth this year."

So before we talk about kind of us in this year, let me talk about the industry and what's been happening and I think what's headed to happen over time. By far, the really big story with respect to outstandings in the Card business is the math of 10% charge-off rates. And it's pretty breathtaking watching the whole industry lose balances. And as we pointed out, that's always first and foremost, the thing that kind of drives ours and frankly, the industry's decline. As we've talked about, for ourselves, I can't speak for the industry, but for ourselves, sort of 2010 is the year that things kind of stabilize with respect to that as origination sort of moved to offset that. The second big point I'd make is there's a very big consumer phenomenon happening here. The lack of credit demand is a striking thing across all of our businesses, but we certainly see it in the Card business. And while I think that is particularly acute during this downturn, our expectation is on the other side of this downturn, continued bias for the consumer to increase savings, as opposed to borrowings will be something that probably causes the Card business to be -- not have much growth and probably more likely to be something with respect to shrinking. So that leaves us to the part that we can more only speculate about is, what is the competitive environment, that in the end kind of completes this equation? I think, in all the businesses that we're in across all of banking, I think that the competition has generally pulled back and some blend of licking their wounds and kind of rethinking their business model. But I would expect in the Card business there to be less competition than in the really intense days of the past but certainly, more  competition than the fairly absent competition, ourselves included, over the past year. But for us, I think the encouraging thing is that for us, it's not really a matter of reinventing a business model. It's a matter of kind of just doing what we've done before and in the context of a more level playing field. And we really look forward to that opportunity. Don't confuse that with big rapid growth. But I think from everything we can see, the opportunity to have very healthy, good quality growth with the kind of returns that we've enjoyed for many years is what we see. And as Gary and I have been pointing out, we just got to make sure our investors understand the mechanics of kind of going through the transition from big shrinking time to where we're restarting the engine and really getting growth going again."

So, but let me come back to that. Again, we start with the math. We start our race well behind the starting line because we got to take all the math of charge-offs then our little -- our business of installment loans, which is part of what we report to you, that sense is farther behind the starting line, just with respect to growth. I think our point is not so much about big growth from here. It's more a point of not going backwards more at this year. I think most of the backward move, you'll see in the first quarter. The rest of the year is for the entire reported segment.  It's probably something more about being in balance with respect to that. But whether we move forward or a little somewhat forward or somewhat backwards, relative to that is really more of a matter of what happens at the line of scrimmage. Now, what opportunities there are? I think that we still really have to watch what happens with respect to competitive pricing in the business. The part of the business that is going to see -- that has to be the most sort of reinvented for the industry has been sort of right there square in the Prime Revolver space where the old business model was long 0% teaser rates and have the penalty repricing, as a way to make the margins go around. With that basically gone, as we've always said, the key thing to look at is the go-to rates. Don't focus so much on teasers and their length and what they are. Interest rates are pretty low these days, but the go-to rates will be the key indicator. We have seen go-to rates in the last -- from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this year, go-to rates, with respect to what's in the mail. They have gone up by about 250 basis points in absolute and about 300 basis points when adjusted for the prime rate, so kind of on a net basis. So that is good progress including 100 basis points of progress just in the last quarter. So our appetite for the kind of the right smack in the middle of the Prime Revolver space is going to be driven, I think by where pricing goes, but as well as consumer demand. The other point is, by the way, it's not yet at its destination, where it really needs to be. In my opinion, pricing -- remember that this industry now doesn't have the repricing ability it had before. It's got forward repricing, which works in a muted and very delayed basis. So the industry has to have destination pricing in its go-to rates and that's what we're going to be looking for, and it's not fully there yet."

The other thing that we have said simply because the math is pretty obvious is that we do expect our balances to be coming down. And Rich and I both indicated in which businesses those are likely to come. A lot of the balance decline is really going to come outside of the revolving Credit Card space. But with the balances coming down, that would tend to drive allowance releases even if the outlook for credit were to remain absolutely stable. Any additional allowance release that comes from further confidence in the moderating outlook for charge-offs would obviously have the potential to drive more. But in terms of the actual amount, we're just going to wait and see how these things play through."

More importantly, just the way we feel about the business is that it's kind of the good news, bad news. And the most important credit takeaway we want to say is the good news is and certainly in all consumer businesses, probably with the exception of mortgage, you can reach out and just about touch effectively the peak that is there. And we've been waiting for this for a long time, and we've been declaring for sometime now that there are indicators that this thing is coming, and we feel absolutely consistent with respect to that point. The bad news in that sense or the other point want to make is do not confuse that with a lot of evidence out there that there's a big turnaround coming from here. Certainly, the economy, if anything, the metrics have disappointed us over time, and maybe as we keep revising upward our economic -- worsening our economic outlook, interestingly, probably over the course of most of this year, our own credit metrics have actually outperformed in a good way to sort of offset these effects. So we sort of -- in fact, if you look back to a year ago, what we said the losses we're going to be ending up to be almost exactly what -- how they finally have. So I think we see actually in this phase of the cycle, a little bit of reduction in the impact on credit metrics of things like the unemployment, just a little bit, which in the sense, has just serve to allow this settling out to happen even though unemployment still is getting worse. We're probably seeing the early stages of what we've seen in past recessions. I think back to the one in the early 90s as we look through that, that credit metrics tend to level out, somewhat before the final stubborn economic metrics of which the ultimate, probably stubborn one is unemployment rate."

How do you look going forward? I think it's almost a little paradoxical. It's seems Capital One has been early at least in terms of repricing its customers and now you've seen a couple of months most people have repriced on the Prime side. How are you seeing the competitive landscape into the ingredients that made Capital One great? You talked about front-end repricing but a lot of that was the discovery of positive selection. How does that then now fit Capital One up for the next leg of this credit card market because it seems like those dynamics may not be playing out as they did earlier in the birth of Capital One?"

I mean, when we look back to the good old days, there were certainly a few great things about the 90s that we don't have anymore. The top of my list would be the tremendous growth of the industry, and we all had wins in our back. As we're doing that, we were living through what would turn out to be the most protracted positive economic period. That was a great thing and also, the major players were a lot of the business net net was coming away from regional banks. It was really the nationalization of the Credit Card business and therefore, all of us national players were taking share from the regional banks. And along the way, I think some of the innovations led to positive selection. So a lot of those things are there for the history books, but they're not really kind of what is in front of us. But on the other hand, the really tough chapter, which is the second chapter of the Card industry, at least in my 27 years of managing this, is really tough chapter of the last decade, which has been characterized by aggressive industry practices that I think kind of undercut the business model off of what a company like Capital One had built and created something that was very threatening to franchise and caused us to walk away from whole parts of the business. So I would characterized the next generation of the Card business or sort of the third chapter of the Card industry is going to be -- it's a very level playing field. It will be returned to upfront underwriting. And I don't think it's a matter of whether there's positive or negative selection. Every interaction with every day in the marketplace has you can always find positive and negative selection. So I think the opportunities will be there. There will be way more premium on really rigorous information-based decision making than there has been in the last 10 years. And I think that with the bad practices both from a customer point of view and from a credit point of view, having been purged from the system, this is going to be a level of playing field where I think appropriately conservative issuers will have growth opportunities that won't remind you of the 90s. But that I think will make, for those that do it well, make returns very consistent with some of the best periods that we've had pound for pound."

So certainly, the Auto business, from a credit point of view, has certainly performed very well and over the course of the year, better than the expectations consistent with some of my earlier comments. One thing I do want to point out about the Auto business is that it shouldn't necessarily surprise us that it starts performing better with respect to credit because the life of the asset is shorter. So in Auto, because of the essentially two to two and a half year average life of an auto loan, now that we're, like a couple of years into this mess, most of our portfolio has been originated with our eyes wide open with respect to the mess that the economy is in and therefore, it's very conservatively underwritten and so on. And it is performing extremely well and a lot of that is the math of portfolio mix, as well as I think, just generally some of the unique dynamics of how consumers are paying their auto loans. So going forward, we downsize that business so the tail doesn't wag the dog of Capital One, which it almost started to do at some point. But I think that we see that as a good opportunity for Capital One going forward. The International business, we're in the U.K. and Canada with respect to credit card. Let me start with Canada, that's a bit of an easier story. Canada has been really quite a successful business and the Canadian economy hasn't suffered as much. So generally, that business has gone well. We're just still hunkered down a bit, weathering their smaller storm up there. In the U.K., it's been the hardest. It's been kind of a perfect storm combination of tough economic environment and some pretty severe regulatory and legislative kind of changes in that environment. And so, we've gotten hit more badly there. We have hunkered down and you'll notice from the numbers, probably you can't see them by country. That businesses has gone from bleeding pretty substantially to actually really turning the corner and while it's not bringing some great return, it's really stabilized and we feel a lot better about it."

Let me go straight to the income statement on Slide 3 of the presentation. Capital One earned $636 million or $1.40 per share in the first quarter, up $0.57 per share or 70",1705,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon to everyone listening to the call this afternoon. Let me go straight to the income statement on Slide 3 of the presentation. Capital One earned $636 million or $1.40 per share in the first quarter, up $0.57 per share or 70% from the prior quarter, as modestly improved pre-provision earnings were bolstered by lower provision expenses. 
Total revenue declined $79 million or 1.8%, as an improvement in margin partially offset a 2.9% decline in average loans. The margin benefited from a 17 basis point improvement in cost of funds.
Loan yields were also up slightly in the quarter despite somewhat lower fees as both were positively affected by higher collectability. Despite the slight decline in revenue, pre-provision earnings were up modestly as the $100 million reduction in our non-interest expenses more than offset the lower revenue. The largest contributor to the better quarter-over-quarter performance was the $369 million decrease in provision expense.
Total charge-offs in the quarter fell $170 million as lower charge-offs in our Commercial, Auto Finance and Retail Banking businesses more than offset a slight decrease in Domestic Card charge-offs.
We released $566 million of allowance through provision expense in the first quarter after posting an allowance build of $4.3 billion through retained earnings on January 1 in line with new accounting standards. More on the impact of FAS 167 and the drivers to the allowance in a moment.
Several other items impacted income in the quarter. First, we sold mortgage I/O bonds that were acquired through the purchase of Chevy Chase Bank, resulting in the deconsolidation of $1.5 billion of loans and a net P&L gain of $127 million. We also recognized a net gain on Securities of $65 million as we rebalanced the portion of our agency mortgage-backed Securities portfolio. 
Lastly, we realized a $50 million benefit to tax expense in the quarter resulting from settlements during the quarter. These gains were partially offset by a $224 million cost associated with our rep [representation] and warranty exposure. About half of which is related to the run-off GreenPoint Mortgage portfolio and therefore, is in discontinued operations.
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 4. Total lending assets declined by $11 billion in the quarter. Our Domestic Card portfolio was down $4 billion in the quarter driven by $1.5 billion of charge-offs, $1 billion of run-off in our Installment Loan portfolio, as well as expected seasonal paydowns in revolving credit. The Installment Loan portfolio will continue to pressure Card growth metrics as we expect approximately $2 billion more to run-off over the remainder of 2010.
The Commercial Banking portfolio remained largely flat versus fourth quarter levels, but we expect to see modest growth in this portfolio over the remainder of 2010 as good lending opportunities are beginning to emerge in our markets. On the Consumer Bank side, the nearly $2 billion decline in first quarter assets was primarily driven by two trends I mentioned on last quarter's call. First, in our Auto Finance business, our decision to pull back on origination volume in early 2008 is continuing to reduce the level of outstandings, although we are now beginning to approach the point in which new originations will equal the run-off of prior originations.
Auto assets were down $700 million in the first quarter, and we continue to expect ending loans will be down approximately $2 billion at year-end 2010 versus the end of 2009.
The second factor pressuring Consumer Bank outstandings is that our Mortgage portfolio largely remains in run-off mode, with a $900 million decline in assets in the first quarter. The decline in other assets in the quarter is related to FAS 167 as we reclassified securitization receivables to cash. More on FAS 167 in a minute.
Our $38 billion Securities portfolio shrank slightly in the first quarter as the non-agency book continue to run-off. The portfolio continues to perform well. Our total unrealized gain increased $191 million in the quarter, and now stands in an unrealized gain position of $482 million, even after booking net gains of $65 million.
Between the run-off of our Installment Loan portfolio and declining Consumer Loans in both Auto and Mortgage, we continue to expect these businesses will drive over $7 billion of loan shrinkage over the course of 2010, with $2.6 billion of debt decline already occurring during the first quarter.
While our other Lending businesses may have seen net growth this year despite elevated levels of charge-offs, we still believe our total ending loan balances will decline by mid-single digits in terms of percentage, or taking into account the rapid shrinkage we experienced in 2009, a high single-digit percentage decline in average loan balances year-over-year.
Now to the liability side of the balance sheet. Securitization liability was down sharply, as conduit paydowns and other maturities totaled about $9 billion in this quarter. By year-end 2010, securitization is expected to be down another $11 billion, representing a 43% decline from year-end 2009.
Funding costs declined in the quarter by 17 basis points due to favorable market rates and continued leveraging of our Commercial and Consumer Banking platforms to swap into lower-priced deposits. While on the subject of balance sheet composition, it's worth highlighting that the implementation of FAS 167 has largely eliminated the distinction between our managed and reported balance sheets cost by securitized assets.
I'll briefly discuss this consolidation in greater detail on Slide 5. On January 1, we brought $48 billion of previously off-balance sheet loans, the vast majority of which were securitized Domestic Card loans, onto our balance sheet as we implemented FAS 167. In line with the consolidation of these loans, we built about $4.3 billion in allowance, resulting in a $3 billion after-tax impact to retained earnings, and the creation of a $1.6 billion deferred tax asset. So while our ending fourth quarter allowance stood at $4.1 billion, we began the first quarter with an allowance balance of $8.4 billion.
It's worth noting that this initial allowance build ran through retained earnings rather than through the income statement. However, the allowance released for the first quarter, as well as any future changes to the allowance balance, will run through the P&L.
Turning to Slide 6, I'll discuss the change in first quarter allowance in greater detail. We released $566 million from our allowance in the quarter driven largely by the Domestic Card business. There were three main drivers of the allowance released in Card. First, we continue to believe that the first quarter will be the high watermark for Card losses. So swapping out the first quarter of 2010 for the first quarter of 2011 drives down our allowance needs. The second driver of the release is our moderating credit outlook for the remainder of 2010 compared to what we were projecting at the end of last quarter. And finally, the $5 billion of lower period-end assets requires lower allowance, all else being equal.
It's important to note that the absolute level of this quarter's Card allowance release was materially impacted by the addition of allowance coverage for the nearly 2/3 of Card assets that were previously off-balance sheet and, historically, did not carry an allowance. Had we not consolidated under FAS 167, the Card allowance release would've been approximately $290 million this quarter.
Similar to the improvement in underlying trends we've observed in the Card business, we continue to see strong credit performance in Auto. This performance, coupled with the approximately $700 million reduction in outstandings led to a $142 million release in allowance for that business. Unlike our Consumer Lending businesses, we continue to see an upward trend of non-performing loans in Commercial. And as a result, we built $130 million of additional allowance. All told, despite the $566 million allowance release, we ended the first quarter with an allowance balance of $7.8 billion, or nearly 6% coverage on our $130 billion Loan portfolio. Given the historically high levels of coverage and underlying business and economic trends, it's reasonable to assume that our total allowance levels will likely continue to decline over the course of the rest of the year.
Turning to Slide 7, I'll discuss our overall risk bearing capacity. Our ratio of tangible common equity to tangible managed assets in the quarter increased 70 basis points to 5.5%, versus the fourth quarter pro forma ratio of 4.8%. The increase in TCE was driven by strong earnings in the first quarter, as well as the $11 billion decline in managed assets. Coupling this level of TCE with the allowance built under FAS 167, our total risk bearing capacity now stands at 9.7% of our total assets. We expect earnings and a smaller balance sheet to further increase our TCE ratio over the course of the year.
Given the timing and nature of implementation rules for FAS 167, I indicated last quarter that the trends in TCE and Tier 1 ratios would diverge in 2010 into early 2011. You'll see that happening in the first quarter results. Despite the fundamentally positive trends that helped TCE, our Tier 1 ratio decreased to 9.6% in the quarter, down 30 basis points from Q4 '09 pro forma levels.
The numerator of the Tier 1 ratio already declined in line with the large allowance build required by FAS 167, and is now also being affected by the disallowance of some related deferred tax assets. With consolidation phase in guidance now established, we note that the risk-weighted denominator will increase through the first quarter of 2011. Actually, some of that impact was accelerated into the first quarter in line with the reduced level of off-balance sheet securitizations I mentioned earlier.
In any event, our Tier 1 ratios are and will continue to remain comfortably above well-capitalized levels. And because regulatory capital ratios are more pro-cyclical, as loss levels normalize, our Tier 1 ratios should more than proportionately follow the fundamental upward trajectory of TCE. While there remains a fair amount of uncertainty about the future of bank capital requirements overall, I'm confident that our balance sheet strength and flexibility position us extremely well to grow profitably. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Rich to talk about our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. Rich?"

Net interest margin increased to 7.1% in the first quarter, driven by a 17 basis point improvement in the cost of funds and a three basis point improvement in asset yields. Several factors d",2808,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 8, with a look at our margins. Net interest margin increased to 7.1% in the first quarter, driven by a 17 basis point improvement in the cost of funds and a three basis point improvement in asset yields. Several factors drove the improvement in funding costs. Our funding mix shifted from higher cost wholesale sources to Consumer and Commercial Banking deposits. 
Within our Banking businesses, our mix shifted from higher cost time deposits to lower cost and more relationship-driven liquid saving and transaction accounts. And favorable interest rates and disciplined pricing drove the decrease in deposit interest expense.
Two offsetting forces drove the modest increase in asset yields. Our asset mix shifted from loans to investment securities, which resulted in moderate downward pressure on yields. The effects of this mix shift were more than offset by strong revenue margin in our Domestic Card business.
First quarter Domestic Card revenue margin remained elevated largely as the result of better-than-expected credit results and lower-than-expected attrition of higher-yielding loans. The same credit results and outlook that contributed to the allowance release in the quarter had a parallel favorable impact on revenue. 
Actual credit results were favorable to our prior expectations driving a more favorable assessment of the collectability of finance charges and fees that were previously build but not recognized as revenue.  This allowed us to recognize some of these previously build fees as revenue in the first quarter and to recognize a larger portion of first quarter fee billings as well. 
First quarter non-interest income declined. Overlimit fee revenues declined as the result of the February 22 implementation of CARD Act regulations.  Interchange revenue also declined seasonally in the quarter. 
Last quarter, we said that we expected the quarterly Domestic Card revenue margin to decrease somewhat in the first quarter on its way to settling in the mid-15% range for the subsequent quarters of 2010. However, better-than-expected credit results, the resulting improvement in the collectability of revenue and lower-than-expected attrition have kept that margin at elevated levels. As we have seen over the last several quarters, Domestic Card revenue margin for any specific quarter is subject to considerable uncertainty from credit trends, seasonality and consumer and competitor responses to the CARD Act.
But as these forces play out by the end of 2010 or early 2011, we still expect that the quarterly Domestic Card revenue margin will decline over the next few quarters. The credit related benefit to revenue we experienced in the first quarter is likely to diminish because we were able to recognize more of the finance charges and fees we build in the first quarter. We'll have a smaller backlog of first quarter billings that could be recognized in future quarters as credit improves.
Beginning in the second quarter, we will experience an additional modest decline in overlimit fee revenue resulting from the February 22 implementation of CARD Act regulations. It's still too early to precisely quantify the expected impact of the proposed reasonable and proportional fee regulations because we don't yet know the final rules. But we do know that they are set to be implemented on August 22. That means that the third quarter will include a half quarter revenue impact from the regulations, and that the fourth quarter will include a full quarter effect. We'll need to see more specifics as the rule-making process continues through the comment period and revisions in the spring and summer.
Last quarter, we cited these regulations as a risk, and we're now incorporating a range of potential outcomes into our expectation for Domestic Card quarterly revenue margin. By the end of 2010 or early in 2011, we expect that quarterly Domestic Card revenue margin will be around 15%, which is a level consistent with very healthy overall returns for the Card business.
Slide 9 shows a history of the overall economics of our Domestic Card business. With all the noise surrounding the CARD Act, revenue margin trends and uncertainty about the future of the Card business, we believe that a look at this history provides a helpful context for our expectations of the future economics of the business. Over the last six years, changes in the components of Domestic Card ROA have generally offset each other, preserving strong ROA. The only exception over the last six years was, of course, the great recession. While ROA declined through this period, the graph shows that this was the result of elevated provision expense that could not be fully offset with revenue or expense levers. The graph also shows that our Domestic Card business remained profitable throughout the worst credit cycle in generations.
Looking forward, we expect revenue margin to decline for the next several quarters to around 15% by early 2011 as I just discussed. Over time, margins may experience further modest decline as credit improves.
We expect non-interest expense as a percentage of loans to increase in the near term, largely as the result of the declining loans and the denominator and the expected increase in marketing expenses. We expect that marketing will ramp back toward more normal levels over the next several quarters. The pace and extent of that ramp will depend upon consumer demand and the competitive landscape. We expect increased marketing and improving charge-offs will result in modest growth in our revolving Card balances over the remainder of 2010. But we expect that Domestic Card loan balances, the overall segment, will be relatively flat for the remaining quarters of 2010 as growth in revolving Cards is offset by elevated charge-offs and the continuing run-off of Installment Loans.
One issue of particular importance is equilibrium pricing in the industry following the CARD Act. Pricing for new customers has been increasing gradually. We're watching industry pricing trends carefully as they are a bellwether for the long-term health of the card industry. Go to APRs, they've risen about 300 basis points over the last year and have edged into the mid-teens in the last few months. We believe that industry pricing needs to continue to increase to provide appropriate resiliency for new originations since post the CARD Act, there is less repricing resilience of APRs than there was in the past.
Over time, we expect that higher marketing expenses will be partially offset by a decline in operating expense. We expect operating expense as a percentage of loans to decline as improving credit allows us to reduce collections intensity and as balances begin to rebuild. We expect provision expense to decline over the next several quarters. We believe that credit losses peaked in the first quarter of 2010. We expect modest improvement in charge-offs beginning in the second quarter of 2010. And as Gary discussed, we continue to see the potential for significant allowance releases in the Domestic Card business.
As a result of these revenue and expense trends, it's likely that pre-provision earnings as a percentage of loans will decline through 2010 and perhaps into early 2011. But we expect that this decline will be partially offset by the expected improvement in provision expense.
All these components of ROA will almost certainly move over time as the result of market conditions, competitor moves and consumer behavior. But history has shown that they often move in ways that naturally offset. We've been able to manage multiple levers to deliver solid pre-provision and bottom line ROA as the industry and the economy have gone through enormous changes.
In the long term, we still believe that the overall economics of the Domestic Card business are very attractive. We'd expect that growth and returns will lag marketing investments as they always have. But with healthy ROA and the return to loan growth, we expect that Domestic Card business will still be the most attractive Consumer Lending business in banking, and that it will continue to deliver returns that are well above hurdle over the cycle.
Slide 10 shows credit results for our Consumer Lending businesses. Domestic charge-off rate increased to 10.5% for the first quarter of 2010 driven by declining loan balances and a temporary increase in charge-offs as last year's pricing actions flowed through the charge-off. The charge-off increase was smaller than expected due to favorable bankruptcy trends and favorable performance in late-stage delinquencies.
The 30-plus delinquency rate improved nearly 50 basis points to 5.3% at the end of the quarter. Expected seasonal trends and the diminishing impact of last year's pricing actions drove the improvement. Based on first quarter charge-off and delinquency results, we now believe that the first quarter is likely to be the peak for both dollar charge-offs and charge-off rate in Domestic Card.
While we believe Q1 is the peak, we expect only modest improvement in second quarter, as seasonal improvements are offset by continuing declines in loan balances. We expect continuing modest improvement in charge-offs in the second half of 2010. We expect modest growth in Consumer Cards to offset Installment Loan run-off reducing the denominator effect. And although it's still early, in recent months we've seen further signs of stabilization, and even some modest improvements in labor and housing markets.
International charge-offs and delinquency trends remained stable to slightly improving. We've been retrenching the U.K. business for some time now, and we've been cautious in Canada. First quarter credit results reflect this cautious stance, as well as the fact that unemployment is improving in Canada and appears to be stabilizing in the U.K. Strong credit performance drove first quarter profit to the $117 million in our International Card business.
Charge-offs for the Mortgage portfolio were relatively stable. Early delinquencies improved, but non-performing and foreclosure inventories continue to increase due to a very slow resolution process. Modifications add several months to the process, and local jurisdictions face growing foreclosure backlogs that further slow resolution. Overall, our portfolio continues to perform better than industry averages. 
Our Mortgage portfolio includes the challenged Chevy Chase portfolio that we acquired in 2009. Chevy Chase portfolio is protected by the credit mark we took at acquisition. This portfolio continues to perform in line with our expectations, and we remain comfortable with the mark.
Auto Finance charge-off rate and delinquency rate both improved in the first quarter. The improvements resulted from expected seasonal patterns, the strong performance of recent origination vintages and the stabilizing economic and auction price trends.  These factors were partially offset by the impact of declining loan balances. Favorable consumer credit performance and credit outlook were key drivers to strong profitability in our Credit Card and Consumer Banking businesses in the first quarter.
Slide 11 shows credit performance in our Commercial Banking businesses. In the first quarter, Commercial Banking charge-off rate declined from elevated charge-off levels in the fourth quarter of 2009. We charged off fewer loans in the first quarter, and we experienced lower severities on the loans we charged off. Non-performing asset rate increased modestly in the quarter, but the pace of deterioration was slower than we have seen over the last several quarters. The pressure on non-performing asset rate and charge-off rate remains concentrated in our Commercial and Multi-family Real Estate business, about 70% of which is located in metro New York City.
Within this portfolio, the source of deterioration has shifted from the relatively small Construction portfolio to loans related to New York City office buildings. Sequential quarter charge-off comparisons were also impacted by actions we took in the fourth quarter in our Small Ticket CRE portfolio, which continues to run-off after we stopped originating these loans over two years ago.
Last quarter, we charged off a portfolio of non-performing Small Ticket CRE loans as we sold them in the distressed debt market. Selling non-performers is an ongoing part of our workout strategy for the Small Ticket CRE portfolio. The timing of such sales depends upon investor appetite and market conditions, and the volume of loan sales was much smaller in the fourth quarter.
Credit performance in the Middle Market portfolio remains relatively stable. Overall, we expect non-performers and charge-offs will continue to deteriorate in our Commercial business, but the pace of deterioration is slowing. It appears that the worst of the commercial credit cycle may be behind us. We continue to believe that our Commercial Banking Loan portfolio is well positioned to weather this downturn in Commercial Real Estate. We have a favorable loan mix with a relatively small exposure to construction lending. And our relatively small exposure to construction lending is a key reason that the absolute level of our CRE charge-off rate is lower than many other banks.
We also have a relatively large exposure to New York City Multi-family, which has been resilient to the recession because of rent controls and supply limitations. We have disciplined lending standards, and we underwrite to in-place cash flows in rents. And compared to most large banks, Commercial Loans are much smaller percentage of our total company-managed loans.
I'll conclude this afternoon on Slide 12. We've worked for years to position our company to be resilient, and we're demonstrating that resilience through the most challenging economic cycle we've seen in generations. We've delivered relatively resilient profitability through the downturn. We maintained the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet. We built strong and stable liquidity through careful management of our balance sheet and by growing deposits with disciplined pricing. We maintained healthy allowance coverage ratios throughout the downturn. And we maintained sufficient capital to address both the recession and the FAS 166/167 accounting changes.
We're now on the path to delivering normalized earnings. Over the next several quarters, we expect that quarterly margins will decline to more normal levels driven by the expected decline in Domestic Card revenue margin I described earlier, as well as the stabilization of funding costs. We expect that loans will continue to decline over the next few quarters before finding a bottom at the end of 2010 or early in 2011.
Continuing run-off of businesses we exited or repositioned earlier in the recession will drive loan declines even as some of our businesses begin to grow sooner. And we expect that expenses will increase over this timeframe as marketing expense will ramp toward more normal historical levels and we make investments in banking infrastructure to support future growth. The combination of these expected trends will result in lower quarterly pre-provision earnings in 2011.
We expect the decline in pre-provision expense will cushion the bottom line impact of falling pre-provision earnings. It should be expected the decline in provision expense will cushion the bottom line of falling pre-provision earnings. We expect continuing improvement in charge-offs. And the combination of declining loan balances and improving credit trends create the potential for significant allowance releases as well.
As we move past the early part of 2011, we believe that our path to normalized earnings will become more apparent in our quarterly results. We expect pre-provision earnings to establish a positive trend over the course of 2011. We remain well positioned to deliver significant shareholder value over the long term.
In our Commercial and Consumer Banking businesses, we have great market positions in some of the best local markets in the country. We can grow commercial relationships and loans as the commercial credit cycle improves. We can continue to grow deposits with disciplined pricing. And as we complete our investments and infrastructure, we expect our cost structure and bottom line profitability will improve over time.
Our Domestic Card business has delivered industry-leading profitability and returns through cycles, including the most significant recession in generations. We believe that our Domestic Card business is well positioned to compete on a new level playing field that's created because the CARD Act prohibits widely-used industry practices, which we never relied on, like aggressive single-infraction penalty repricing. As a result, we expect that we'll be able to essentially restart the marketing of similar products to similar customer segments that we were doing before we pulled back during the recession.
The Credit Card business has always been characterized by significant near-term marketing investments, followed by a long-term payoff with very attractive risk-adjusted returns. Margins may moderate modestly over time as charge-offs normalize, but we're confident that returns will remain well above hurdle rate over cycles. We expect that returns will be more sustainable long term, with competitive practices cleaned up by the CARD Act. And as we've said before, we believe that the Domestic Card market and competitive environment following the implementation of the CARD law will play to our strengths.
Our balance sheet is emerging from the dual challenges of the recession and the FAS 166/167 accounting change, with its resilience intact. As Gary described earlier, our balance sheet strength and flexibility put us in a strong position to grow profitably and to sustain above hurdle returns over the long term.

So we're pretty close to where we said we thought we would be by the end of the year in terms of the overall balance shrinkage. Now to break that down into the segments, what we've said is that we expect another $4.5 billion worth of decline between now and the end of 2010 coming from a run-off in Installment Loans. That's a couple of billion dollars. In Mortgage, that's maybe another $1.5 billion, and the reduction in Auto outstandings would be another $0.5 billion or so. So the decline from here to the end of the year, about $4.5 billion. Just about offsetting that would be loan balances in our revolving Credit Card portfolio and in our Commercial book. Particularly in the revolving Credit Card portfolio, we'll continue to have an elevated level of charge-offs. So in effect, we're going to have to grow that both to cover the involuntary attrition that comes from the charge-offs, as well as to offset some of the decline in the other businesses. So all told, year-end 2009 to year-end 2010, down in the mid-single digits. Again, it'll be a little bit more in terms of average outstandings.

So a lot of our competitors have given numbers saying the CARD Act, the cost of the CARD Act is x hundred million dollars.

And so what we try to do, Sanjay, for you is just try to guide you to a destination, because the destination incorporates all of the combined effects of impacts and counter actions and a lot of things that -- so I think it's most useful for us to really focus on that. And so again, kind of hitting the highlights of the revenue margin, we -- before, if you go all the way back to before all of these changes began, in some ways, our revenue margin was in the 15s. Then The Great Recession came along, the regulations came along, and we got to an unusually elevated level that you see at 17%, really because of three factors. So we're kind of at the peak here, and I want to kind of savor the three factors. One is repricing in advance of the CARD Act. One is revenue benefits from improving credit, so that's the fee and finance charge releases that we've been getting here. And the third is the decline in TCE rate percentage because during the recession, we haven't been doing very much marketing. So the margin is going to go down to 15% because of really three factors: The implementation of the CARD Act, not getting the reserve releases that we -- as much of it as we enjoyed say, in a quarter like this one, and the resumption of marketing with TCE rates. And the impact will be somewhat progressive in that things -- you start to get partial quarters of effects like we had the partial impact of the -- partial quarter of the impact on overlimits, then we get the full quarter impact and then in the third and fourth quarter, we're going to get a partial and then full impact of the reasonable fees. But we are pretty confident about the destination of being around 15%. Obviously, subject to the final interpretation of reasonable fees."

On the supply side, I'm bullish about the impact of the CARD Act, because we've spent a decade feeling like we have one arm and one leg tied behind our back, choosing not to market in whole parts of the Card business because we were uncomfortable with the practices and both the market-clearing price from the credit point of view and especially the damage to franchise, building a franchise that we felt some of those practices entailed. So we are, from a supply of point of view, feel that the CARD Act is a very good thing for Capital One because it returns underwriting back to where it was in the '90s, which is it's all about upfront underwriting and not about the repricings that follow after the fact. So we feel good about our relative chances, and I also think that the CARD Act is going to put a much greater rationality to the nature of the competition. And so again, on the supply side, I'm not quite a bit more bullish because also in terms of revenue margins and our business model, I think we feel things are relatively intact. The wild card is on the demand side. On the one hand, consumers are deleveraging. I think that there's been an awful lot of noise about credit cards in the paper everyday. It'll be still to be determined how much demand there is on the other side of this. And also, you do have the growth of debit cards causing some modest encroachment into card territory. On the other hand however, history shows deleveraging tend to be cyclical things. And also, we don't have one of the biggest factors that held us back in the last decade, and that was home equity loans were a massive cannibalizer of really good core card growth. So I look at it this way, I mean, while there is a big variance in our own view of the outcome in terms of demand, I'm just assuming it's going to be flattish. Industry growth would be flattish to positively negative, sort of as things stabilize, but I'm just making that up. The thing that makes me bullish is that while I'd love a rapidly growing industry, the most important thing is being able to have a relative competitive advantage in a level playing field in the industry, which paradoxically, The Great Recession and the great legislation, if you will, have sort of rendered that. So I'm very bullish about that, and we'll just have to see how demand comes out."

I think our view is that we'll take a differentiated approach in parts of our portfolio, just not offer them. In other cases, offer opt-in but it's a little premature to conclude where that comes out. But our overall expectation is that overlimit fees are substantially down versus the old days. And we put that into our planning so you should assume that as well, significant reductions in overlimit revenues. And for us, it's part of the redistribution of how the revenue model works in the card business, and it's between what's happened on the overlimit side and our expectation with respect to the CARD Act, with respect to reasonable and proportional fees. There is a shift in how the revenue model and pricing structure in the credit card works from away from back-end pricing toward front end, upfront, APR and in some cases, annual fees. And I think there's a lot of benefits to that model. It's important -- one of the things that I most have my eye on is to make sure that the industry price is high enough for resilience, because the thing that I don't think's getting enough attention is the some of the resilience diminishment in APR repricing that comes from the CARD Act. And so I'm bullish about the redistribution and the strength of the revenue model as the business changes, but we also are putting into our planning effect that the expectation that resilience will be somewhat diminished."

And as you suggest in the first quarter, pretty much all of the reduction in the suppression was in the finance charge and fee reserve, and think of that like an allowance. So we're definitely seeing those numbers come down. The big reasons for the big step change this quarter were two folds. First, we assessed many fewer fees, and we're not going to suppress unless we obviously are assessing the fees, and fees were down in terms of assessments because of lower overlimit fees of assessed in line with the CARD Act. A continued decline in the overall balances, and frankly, continued general improvement in consumer behavior has had a downward impact on the assessment of penalty fees. So lower quantum of fees is driving that reserve down. Secondly, like with an allowance, the credit improvement that we're seeing in loan principal, we're also seeing in the delinquency rate on finance charges and fees. So with the improvement in the consumer credit behavior there, that's going to draw down the need for reserves. So in that case, we could see further declines going forward. I would be surprised if we saw a step change as large as this one. Again, it's being impacted by the one-time effect of a major change coming from the CARD Act, but it could continue to come down. Finally, in terms of where we're going, I would certainly believe that the finance charge reserve will always exist. In fact, the redistribution of income suggests that's going to be a larger portion of our business. So yes, that number will go down and go up over time. But I think going forward, we shouldn't expect to see a big step change like we did in this past quarter."

So our big focus right now is on pulling these banks together, building a scalable infrastructure and what the regulators would call, ""Top 10 bank capability,"" which is something that's really quite different from what any bank of the size of banks we buy. They're at a very different level of scalability. So it's a big effort to pull this together and create sort of truly scalable infrastructure, and that is -- we're well along in the process of doing that, and that's a very top priority. Along the way, we are really building up the capability to be able to grow our bank within our local markets and generate significant deposit growth, loan growth and ultimately, growing returns. So that's the top priority. Now it's not lost on us along the way that a lot of banks have been struggling around the country, and that there could be opportunities for particularly attractive deals. I mean, you saw that in fact, during The Great Recession, we bought Chevy Chase. We always take a look at things like that but I want you to know that it's not a sense of manifest destiny.

Obviously, we need to have a view about where rates are going, and let's just assume that today's yield curve is giving an accurate reflection of future rates. Meaning that they're going to be going up. I think that means that there is a considerably less scope at this point for continued improvement in our cost of funds. I would say, again assuming the curve is a good predictor of where rates are going in the short run, I'd say there's some room for a modest decline in cost of funds over the balance of 2010. We do have some continued runoff of higher-cost term funding that would be in the form of auto securitizations and some of our retail time deposits. And at the margin as you can see, we're replacing all of these maturing funds with lower-cost liquid deposits. So I'd say in the short run, room for a modest decline in cost of funds compared to the improvements we've seen over the course over the last year or so. And from there on, it's really going to be a matter of what happens to the curve. Now in terms of operating expenses, what we've said at the top of the house that you should expect to see that operating expenses, that is non-interest expense minus marketing, should stay on an annual basis, with a little bit of quarterly up and down, should stay more or less constant from 2009 to 2010. And essentially, what you're seeing there is continued investment particularly in the infrastructure of our bank as we move towards full integration and really trying to get traction there. And that will be offset by continuing efficiencies that we're having throughout the company, continuing the benefits we've seen from some significant efficiency work over the course of the last couple of years. So top of the house, you should expect to see operating expenses stay in and around current levels with a little bit of quarterly  variability as you saw up in the fourth quarter, down in the first, and we'll see a little bit more of that over the course of the year."

So there's a lot of -- I think everybody has a different strategy but in the end, I think the subprime percentage, interestingly, is fairly similar. Our mix over the last year or so, and probably consistent with my expectation, would be flattish to declining a little bit in that marketplace. So it's certainly not something we are planning to leap into and where you would see a big change. A thing that I said earlier was that after The Great Recession and the great regulation and legislation, in a sense, when we look at our business model, other than a redistribution of where pricing comes from, which generally by the way is a healthy redistribution that I embraced for the marketplace, the same strategies we were pursuing before in the same segments are pretty much what you should expect from us. And so the biggest wildcard to me is -- the two biggest uncertainties going forward, which really not about mix, because I think our mix, I would expect it to be pretty similar to what has been over the past number of years, and has been pretty stable for quite a long period of time. The biggest uncertainties to me are consumer demand like I talked about, and that one, we can argue all sides of it, so we'll just have to see. And the other very important one, Mike, is pricing in the revolver segment, go-to pricing. Because in this last past decade, the industry has slipped through its practices into a rather weak underwriting habit of originating at lower rate and letting repricing take care of it on the other end. It is profoundly important that our investors and our industry understand that this is not how it's going to work going forward. Will there never be -- there will still be repricing in the sense there can be forward repricing, and in its own natural way, that will always be a component of the business. But the defining issue is that while people can use TCE rates all they want, the go-to rate of APR has a very important destination importance to it that it used to have in the '90s but sort of didn't have so much in the last decade. We are watching that like a hawk. We're watching it in every single segment, every single subsegment. The good news is that it's going up from the beginning. The first couple of months of '09 to 2010 has gone up 300 basis points, that's a good thing, while the primary has basically stayed flat. So you can see the market moving. So the other thing that's going to impact our growth will be watching where that destination go-to rate goes to, and we are going to be managing our business, very much building resilience into our pricing. How much growth we have in particular segments is really going to be driven on whether the industry prices prudently, so that's the other one to watch. And when all the dust settles, Mike, I think, probably our mix of our business and the type of things we're marketing -- to the customers, we're marketing is going to be pretty much the same."

I mean it's something less than 2% of our revenue that, in aggregate, it represents. So we've made important changes in our overdraft policies, which we disclosed on our website if you'd like to look at those, since -- frankly, right when we got into banking, one of our first meetings was we wanted to take a look in the same way we try to look at practices in the current business, we took a look and started letting some of the air out of those practices way back then. But we have made some other recent changes which you can find in our website. So if I pull way up, Moshe, I sort of philosophically feel the same way about this that I do about some of the card practices. These are things that right when you see what is legislated, it has impact and hurts the P&L, but I think the equilibrium that comes out of it is going to be a healthy one. Certainly, not a lot of reliance by us on that form of income, but I think that it will end up again helping the building of franchise and some of the same things that I felt on the card side."

Let me go straight to the income statement on slide three of the presentation. Capital One earned $636 million, or $1.40 per share in the first quarter, up $0.57 per share or 70% from the prior quarter, as modestly improved pre-provision earnings were bolstered by lower expenses.
Total revenue declined $79 million, or 1.8%, as an improvement in margin, partially offset a 2.9% decline in average loans. The margin benefited from a 17 basis point improvement in cost of funds. Loan yields were also up slightly in the quarter despite somewhat lower fees, as both were positively affected by higher collectability.
Despite the slight decline in revenue, pre-provision earnings were up modestly, as a $100 million reduction in our non-interest expenses more than offset the lower revenue. The largest contributor to the better quarter-over-quarter performance was the $369 million decrease in provision expense.
Total charge-offs in the quarter fell $170 million, as a lower charge-offs in our commercial, auto finance and retail banking businesses, more than offset a slight decrease in domestic card charge-offs.
We released $566 million of allowance through provision expense in the first quarter, after posting an allowance build a $4.3 billion to retained earnings on January 1st in line with new accounting standards. More on the impact of FAS 167 and the drivers of the allowance in a moment.
Several other items impacted income in the quarter. First, we sold mortgage I/O bonds that were acquired through the purchase of Chevy Chase Bank, resulting in the deconsolidation of $1.5 billion of loans and a net P&L gain of $127 million.
We also recognized a net gain on securities of $65 million as we rebalanced a portion of our agency mortgage bank securities portfolio.
Lastly we realized a $50 million benefit to tax expense in the quarter, resulting from settlements during the quarter. These gains were partially offset by a $224 million cost associated with our rep and warranty exposure, about half of which is related to the run-off GreenPoint mortgage portfolio and therefore is in discontinued operations.
Let’s turn to the balance sheet on slide four. Total lending assets declined by $11 billion in the quarter. Our domestic card portfolio was down $4 billion in the quarter, driven by $1.5 billion in charge-offs, $1 billion of run-off in our installment loan portfolio, as well as expected seasonal pay downs and revolving credit.
The installment loan portfolio will continue to pressure card growth metrics, as we expect approximately $2 billion more to run-off over the remainder of 2010.
The commercial banking portfolio remained largely flat versus fourth quarter levels, but we expect to see modest growth in this portfolio over the remainder of 2010, as good lending opportunities are beginning to emerge in our markets.
On the consumer bank side, the nearly $2 billion decline in first quarter assets, is primarily driven by two trends I mentioned on last quarter’s call. First, in our auto finance business, our decision to pull back on origination volume in early 2008 is continuing to reduce the level of outstandings, although we’re now beginning to approach the point at which new originations will equal the run-off of prior originations.
Auto assets were down $700 million in the first quarter and we continue to expect ending loans will be down approximately $2 billion at year-end 2010 versus the end of 2009.
The second factor pressuring consumer bank outstandings is that our mortgage portfolio largely remains in run-off mode with a $900 million declined in assets in the first quarter. The decline in other assets in the quarter is related to FAS 167 as we reclassified securitization receivables to cash, more on FAS 167 in a minute.
Our $38 billion securities portfolio shrank slightly in the first quarter, as the non-agency book continued to run-off. The portfolio continues to perform well and our total unrealized gain increased $191 million in the quarter and now stands at an unrealized gain position of $482 million, even after booking net gains of $65 million.
Between the run-off of our installment loan portfolio and declining consumer loans in both auto and mortgage, we continue to expect these businesses will drive over $7 billion of loan shrinkage over the course of 2010, with $2.6 billion of debt declined already occurring during the first quarter.
While our other lending business may see net growth this year, despite elevated levels of charge-offs, we still believe our total ending loan balances will decline by mid single digits in terms of percentage or taking into account the shrinkage we experienced in 2009, a high single-digit percentage decline in average loan balances year-over-year.
Now to the liability side of the balance sheet, securitization liability was down sharply, as conduit pay downs and others maturities totaled about $9 billion in this quarter. By year-end 2010, securitization is expected to be down another $11 billion, representing a 43% decline from year-end 2009.
Funding costs decline in the quarter by 17 basis points due to favorable market rates and continued leveraging of our commercial and consumer banking platforms to swap into lower priced deposits.
While on the subject of balance sheet composition, its worth highlighting that the implementation of FAS 167 has largely eliminated the distinction between our managed and reported balance sheet caused by securitized assets. I’ll briefly discuss this consolidation in greater detail on slide five.
On January 1st, we brought $48 billion of previously off balance sheet loans, the vast majority of which were securitized domestic card loans onto our balance sheet as we implemented FAS 167.
In line with the consolidation of these loans, we built about $4.3 billion in allowance, resulting in a $3 billion after-tax impact to retained earnings and the creation of a $1.6 billion deferred tax asset. So while our ending fourth quarter allowance stood at $4.1 billion, we begin the first quarter with an allowance balance of $8.4 billion.
It’s worth noting that this initial allowance build ran through retained earnings rather than through the income statement. However, the allowance release for the first quarter as well any future changes to the allowance balance will run through the P&L.
Turning to slide six, I’ll discuss the change in first quarter allowance in greater detail. We released $566 million from our allowance in the quarter, driven largely by the domestic card business. There were three main drivers of the allowance release in card.
First, we continue to believe that the first quarter will be the high watermark for card losses, so swapping of the first quarter of 2010 for the first quarter of 2011 drives down our allowance needs.
The second driver of the release is our moderating credit outlook for the remainder of 2010, compared to what we were projecting at the end of last quarter. And finally, the $5 billion of lower period end assets requires lower allowance, all else being equal.
It’s important to note that the absolute level of this quarter’s card allowance release was materially impacted by the addition of allowance coverage for the nearly two thirds of card assets that were previously off balance sheet and historically did not carry an allowance. Had we not consolidated under FAS 167, the card allowance release would have been approximately $290 million this quarter.
Similar to the improvement in underlying trends we’ve observed in the card business, we continue to see strong credit performance in auto. This performance, coupled with the approximately $700 million reduction in outstandings led to a $142 million release in for that business.
Unlike our consumer lending businesses, we continue to see an upward trend of non-performing loans in commercial and as a result, we built $130 million of additional allowance.
All told, despite the $566 million allowance release, we ended the first quarter with an allowance balance of $7.8 billion or nearly 6% coverage on our $130 billion loan portfolio.
Given the historically high levels of coverage and underlying business and economic trends, it’s reasonable to assume their total allowance levels will likely continue to decline over the course of the rest of the year.
Turning to slide seven, I’ll discuss our overall risk bearing capacity. Our ratio of tangible common equity to tangible managed assets in the quarter increased 70 basis points to 5.5% versus the fourth quarter pro forma ratio of 4.8%.
The increase in TCE was driven by strong earnings in the first quarter, as well as the $11 billion decline in managed assets. Coupling this level of TCE with the allowance built under FAS 167, our total risk bearing capacity now stands at 9.7% of our total assets. We expect earnings and a smaller balance sheet to further increase our TCE ratio over the course of the year.
Given the timing and nature of implementation rules for FAS 167, I indicated last quarter that the trends in TCE and Tier 1 ratios will diverge in 2010 and early 2011. You’ll see that happening in the first quarter results. Despite the fundamentally positive trends, that helps TCE, our Tier 1 ratio decreased to 9.6% in the quarter, down 30 basis points from Q4 2009 pro forma levels.
The numerator of the Tier 1 ratio already declined in line with the a large allowance caused by FAS 167 and is now also being affected by the disallowance of some related deferred tax assets. With consolidation phase in guidance now established, we know that the risk weighted denominator will increase through the first quarter of 2011. Actually, some of the impact was accelerated into the first quarter in line with the reduced level of off balance sheet securitizations I mentioned earlier.
In any event, our Tier 1 ratios are and will continue to remain comfortably above well-capitalized levels. And because regulatory capital ratios are more pro cyclical, as loss levels normalize, our Tier 1 ratio should more than proportionately follow the fundamental upward trajectory of TCE.
While there remains a fair amount of uncertainty about the future of bank capital requirements overall, I’m confident that our balance sheet strength and flexibility position us extremely well to grow profitably.
With that, I’ll hand it over to Rich to talk about our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. Rich?

I’ll begin on slide eight with a look at our margins. Net interest margin increased to 7.1% in the first quarter, driven by a 17 basis point improvement in the cost of funds and a 3 basis point improvement in asset yields. Several factors",2817,"Thanks, Gary. I’ll begin on slide eight with a look at our margins. Net interest margin increased to 7.1% in the first quarter, driven by a 17 basis point improvement in the cost of funds and a 3 basis point improvement in asset yields. Several factors drove the improvement in funding costs.
Our funding mix shifted from higher cost wholesale sources to consumer and commercial banking deposits. Within our banking businesses, our mix shifted from higher cost con deposits to lower costs and more relationship driven liquid saving and transaction accounts. And favorable interest rates and disciplined pricing drove a decrease in the deposit interest expense.
Two offsetting forces drove a modest increase in asset yield. Our asset mix shifted from loans to investment securities, which resulted in modest downward pressure on yields. The effects of this mix shift were more than offset by strong revenue margin in our domestic card business.
First quarter domestic card revenue margin remained elevated largely as a result of better than expected credit results and lower than expected attrition of higher yielding loans. The same credit results and outlook that contributed to the allowance release in the quarter had a parallel favorable impact on revenue.
Actual credit results were favorable to our prior expectations, driving a more favorable assessment of the collectibility of finance charges and fees that were previously billed but not recognized as revenue. This allowed us to recognize some of these previously billed fees as revenue in the first quarter and to recognize a larger portion of first quarter fee billings as well.
First quarter non-interest income declined. Over limit fee revenues declined as a result of the February 22nd implementation of Card Act Regulations. Interchange revenue also declined seasonally in the quarter.
Last quarter, we said that we expected the quarterly domestic card revenue margin to decrease somewhere - to decrease somewhat in the first quarter on its way to settling in the mid 15% range for subsequent quarters of 2010.
However, better than expected credit results, the resulting improvement in the collectability of revenue and lower than expected attrition have kept that margin at elevated levels.
As we’ve seen over the last several quarters, domestic card revenue margin for any specific quarter is subject to considerable uncertainty from Credit Trends, seasonality and consumer and competitive responses to the Card Act. But as these forces play out by the end of 2010 or early 2011, we still expect that the quarterly domestic card revenue margin will decline over the next few quarters.
The credit related benefit to revenue we experienced in the first quarter is likely to diminish because we’re able to recognize more of the finance charges and fees we billed in the first quarter will have a smaller backlog of first quarter billings that could be recognized in future quarters as credit improves.
Beginning in the second quarter, we’ll experience and additional modest decline in over limit fee revenue resulting from the February 22nd implementation of Card Act regulations.
It is still too early to precisely quantify the expected impact of the proposed reasonable and proportional fee regulations because we don’t yet know the final rules. But we do know that they are set to be implemented on August 22nd. That means that the third quarter will include a half quarter revenue impact from the regulations and that the fourth quarter include a full quarter impact. We’ll need to see more specifics at the rule making process continues through the common period and revisions in the spring and summer.
Last quarter we cited these revelations as a risk and we’re now incorporating a range of potential outcomes into our expectations for domestic card quarterly revenue margins. By the end of 2010 or early in 2011, we expect that quarterly domestic card revenue margin will be around 15%, which is a level consistent with very healthy overall returns for the card business.
Slide nine shows a history of the overall economics of our domestic card business. With all the noise surrounding the Card Act, revenue margin trends and uncertainty about the future of the card business, we believe that a look at this history provides a helpful context for our expectation of the future economics of the business.
Over the last six years, changes in the components of domestic card ROA have generally offset each other preserving strong ROA. The only exception over the last six years was, of course, the great recession.
While ROA declined over this period, the graph shows that this was the result of elevated provision expense that could not be fully offset with revenue or expense levers. The graph also shows that our domestic card business remained profitable throughout the worst credit cycle in generations.
Looking forward, we expect revenue margin to decline for the next several quarters to around 15% by early 2011, as I just discussed. Overtime, margins may experience further modest decline as credit improves.
We expect non-interest expense as a percentage of loans to increase in a near-term largely as a result of the declining loans in the denominator and the expected increase in marketing expense.
We expect that marketing will ramp back toward more normal levels over the next several quarters. The pace and extent of that ramp will depend upon consumer demand and the competitive landscape. We expect increased marketing and improved charge-offs will result in modest growth in our revolving card balances over the remainder of 2010.
But we expect that domestic card loan balances, the overall segment will be relatively flat for the remaining quarters of 2010 as growth in revolving cards is offset by elevated charge-offs in the continuing run-off of installment loans.
One issue of particular importance is equilibrium pricing in the industry following the Card Act. Pricing for new customers has been increasing gradually. We’re watching industry pricing trends carefully, as they are bellwether for the long-term health of the card industry. Go to APRs have risen about 300 basis points over the last year and have edged into the mid teens in the last few months.
We believe industry pricing needs to continue to increase to provide appropriate resiliency for new originations since post the Card Act there is less pricing resilience of APRs and there was in the past.
Overtime, we expect that higher marketing expenses will be partially offset by a decline in operating expenses. We expect operating expense as a percentage of loans to decline as improving credit allows us to reduce collections intensity and as balances begin to rebuild.
We expect provision expense to decline over the next several quarters. We believe that credit losses peaked in the first quarter of 2010. We expect modest improvement in charge-offs beginning in the second quarter of 2010. And as Gary discussed, we continue to see the potential for significant allowance releases in the domestic card business.
As a result of these revenue and expense trends, it’s likely that pre-provision earnings as a percentage of loans will decline through 2010 and perhaps into early 2011. But we expect that this decline will be partially offset by the expected improvement in provision expense.
All these components of ROA will almost certainly move over time as a result of market conditions, competitor moves and consumer behavior. But history has shown that they often move in ways that naturally offset.
We’ve been able to manage multiple levers to be delivered solid levers pre-provision and bottom line ROA as the industry and the economy have gone through enormous changes.
In the long-term, we still believe that the overall economics of the domestic card business are very attractive. We’d expect that growth and returns will lag marketing investments as they always have, but with healthy ROA and the return to loan growth, we expect the domestic card business will still be the most attractive consumer lending business in banking and that it will continue to deliver returns that are well above hurdle over the cycle.
Slide 10 shows credit results for our consumer lending businesses. Domestic charge-off rate increased to 10.5% for the first quarter of 2010, driven by declining loan balances and a temporary increase in charge-offs as last year’s pricing actions flowed through the charge-offs.
The charge-off increase was smaller than expected due to favorable bankruptcy trends and favorable performance in late stage delinquencies. The 30 plus delinquency rate improved nearly 50 basis points to 5.3% at the end of the quarter. Expected seasonal trends and the diminishing impact of last year’s pricing actions drove the improvement.
Based on first quarter charge-off and delinquency results, we now believe that the first quarter is likely to be the peak for both dollar charge-offs and charge-off rate in domestic card.
While we believe Q1 is the peak, we expect only modest improvement in second quarter, as seasonal improvements are offset by continuing declines in loan balance. We expect continuing modest improvement in charge-offs in the second half of 2010.
We expect modest growth in consumer cards to offset installment loan run-off reducing the denominator effect. And although it’s still early, in recent months we’ve seen further signs of stabilization and even some modest improvements in labor and housing markets.
International charge-offs and delinquency trends remain stable to slightly improving. We’ve been retrenching the U.K. business for some time now and we’ve been cautious in Canada. First quarter credit results reflect this cautious stance, as well as the fact that unemployment is improving in Canada and appears to be stabilizing in the U.K. Stronger that performs grow first quarter profits of a $117 million in our international card business.
Charge-offs for the mortgage portfolio were relatively stable. Early delinquencies improved, but non-performing foreclosure inventories continued to increase due to a very slow resolution process. Modifications add several months to the process and local jurisdictions face growing foreclosure backlog that further slow resolution. Overall our portfolio continues to perform better than industry averages.
Our mortgage portfolio includes the challenged Chevy Chase portfolio that we acquired in 2009. Chevy Chase portfolio is protected by the credit mark we took at acquisition. This portfolio continues to perform in line with our expectations and we remain comfortable with the mark.
Auto finance charge-off rate and delinquency rate both improved in the first quarter. The improvements resulted from expected seasonal patterns, the strong performance of recent origination vintages and the stabilizing economic and auction price trends. These factors were partially offset by the impact of declining loan balances.
Favorable consumer credit performance and credit outlook were key drivers of strong profitability in our credit card and consumer banking businesses in the first quarter.
Slide 11 shows credit performance in our commercial banking business. In the first quarter, commercial banking charge-off rate declined from elevated charge-off levels in the fourth quarter of 2009. We charged off fewer loans in the first quarter and we experienced lower severities on the loans we charged off.
Non-performing asset rate increased modestly in the quarter, but the pace of the deterioration was slower than we’ve seen the last several quarters. The pressure on non-performing asset rate and charge-off rate remains concentrated in our commercial and multifamily real estate business, about 70% of which is located in metro New York City. Within this portfolio the source of deterioration has shifted from the relatively small construction portfolio to loans related to New York City office buildings.
Sequential quarter charge-off comparisons were also impacted by actions we took in the fourth quarter on our small ticket CRE portfolio, which continues to run-off after we stopped originating these loans over two years ago.
Last quarter, we charged off a portfolio non-performing small ticket CRE loans as we sold them in the distressed debt market. Selling non-performers is an ongoing part of our workout strategy for the small ticket CRE portfolio. The timing of such sales depends upon investor appetite and market conditions and the volume of loan sales was much smaller in the first quarter. Credit performance in the middle market portfolio remained relatively stable.
Overall, we expect non-performers and charge-offs will continue to deteriorate in our commercial business but the pace of deterioration is slowing. It appears that the worst of the commercial credit cycle may be behind us.
We continue to believe that our commercial banking loan portfolio is well positioned to weather this downturn in commercial real estate. We have a favorable loan mix with a relatively small exposure to construction lending and our relatively small exposure to construction lending is a key reason that the absolute level of our CRE charge-off rate is lower than many other banks.
We also have relatively large exposure to New York City multifamily, which has been resilient to the recession because of rent controls and supply limitations. We have disciplined lending standards and we underwrite to in place cash flows and rents. And compared to most large banks, commercial loans are much smaller percentage of our total company managed loans.
I’ll conclude this afternoon on slide 12. We’ve worked for years to position our company to be resilient and we’re demonstrating that resilience through the most challenging economic cycle we’ve seen in generations.
We’ve delivered relatively resilient profitability through the downturn. We maintained the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet. We built strong and stable liquidity through careful management of our balance sheet and the growing deposits with disciplined pricings.
We maintained healthy allowance coverage ratios throughout the downturn and we maintained sufficient capital to address both the recession and the FAS 166 and 167 accounting changes. We’re now on the path to delivering normalized earnings.
Over the next several quarters, we expect the quarterly margins will decline to more normal levels driven by the expected decline in domestic card revenue margin, I described earlier, as well as the stabilization of funding costs. We expect the loans will continue to decline over the next few quarters before finding a bottom at the end of 2010 or early in 2011.
Continuing run-off of businesses we exited or repositioned earlier in the recession will drive loan declines even as some of our businesses begin to grow sooner and we expect that expenses will increase over this timeframe as marketing expense will ramp toward more normal historical levels and we make investments in banking infrastructure to support future growth.
The competition of these expected trends will result in lower quarterly pre-provision earnings in 2011. We expect that declining pre-provision expense will cushion the bottom line impact of falling pre-provision earnings. Actually we expect the decline in provision expense will cushion the bottom line of falling pre-provision earnings. We expect continuing improvement in charge-offs and the domination of declining loan balances and improving credit trends create the potential for significant allowance releases as well.
As we move past the early part of 2011, we believe that our path to normalized earnings will become more apparent in our quarterly results. We expect pre-provision earnings to establish a positive trend over the course of 2011. We remain well-positioned to deliver significant shareholder value over the long-term.
In our commercial and consumer banking businesses, we have great market positions and some of the best local markets in the country. We can grow commercial relationships in loans as the commercial credit cycle improves. We can continue to grow deposits with disciplined pricing and as we complete our investments in infrastructure, we expect our cost structure and bottom line profitability will improve overtime.
Our domestic card business has delivered industry-leading profitability and returns through cycles, including the most significant recession in generations. We believe that our domestic card business is well position to compete on a new level playing fields that’s created because the Card Act prohibits widely used industry practices, which we never relied on, like aggressive single infraction penalty re-pricing.
As a result, we expect that we’ll be able to essentially restart the marketing of similar products to similar customer segments that we were doing before we pulled back during the recession.
The credit card business has always been characterized by significant near-term marketing investments followed by a long-term payoff with very attractive risk adjusted returns.
Margins may moderate modestly overtime as charge-offs normalize, but we’re confident that returns will remained well above hurdle rate over cycles. We expect that returns will be more sustainable long-term with competitive practices cleaned up by the Card Act and as we’ve said before, we believe that the domestic card market and competitive environment following the implementation of the card law will play to our strengths.
Our balance sheet is emerging from the dual challenges of recession and the FAS 166, 167 accounting change with its resilience intact. As Gary described earlier, our balance sheet strength and flexibility put us in a strong position to grow profitably and to sustain above hurdle returns over the long-term.
Now Gary and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?

In the first quarter, we were down nearly 5% or about $6.7 million. So we’re pretty close to where we said, we thought we would be by the end of the year in terms of the overall balance shrinkage.
Now, to break that down into the segments, what we said is, that we expect another $4.5 billion worth of decline between now and the end of 2010 coming from a run-off in installment loans, that’s a couple of billion dollars. In mortgage that’s maybe another $1.5 billion and the reduction in auto outstandings would be another $0.5 billion or so. So that’s the decline from here to the end of the year, about $4.5 billion.
Just about offsetting that would be loan balances in our revolving credit card portfolio and in our commercial book, particularly in the revolving credit card portfolio, we’ll continue to have an elevated level of charge-offs.
So in effect, we’re going to have to grow that both to cover the involuntary attrition that comes from the charge-offs as well as two offset some of the decline in the other businesses.
So, all told, year-end 2009 to year-end 2010 down in the mid single digits. Again, it will be a little more -- bit more in terms of average outstandings and quite frankly, will probably remain near the bottom of the (inaudible) for a couple of quarters, before seeing that growth at the end of this year and then into next year.

We have revises our outlook from mid 15’s to 15 and while there are several kind of moving pieces there, essentially that’s kind of the impact of our estimation of the reasonable fees. Although, of course, getting full resolution of that still awaits us. But yes, that was the effect.
So the, a lot of our competitors have given numbers saying the Card Act, the cost of the Card Act is ex $100 million. And I find that when we listen to that, I’m not sure, how to interpret that number because there are so many effects that go on.
And so what we tried to do, Sanjay, for you is just try to guide you to a destination. Because the destination incorporates all of the combined effects of impact and counter actions and a lot of things that, so I think it would be - it’s most useful for us to really focus on that.
And so again, kind of hitting the highlights of the revenue margin, we, before, if you go all the way back to before all these changes began, in some ways our Card Act, I mean our revenue margin was in the 15%. And then the great recession came along, the regulations came along and we got to an unusually elevated level that you see at 17% really because of three factors. So we’re kind of at the peak here and I want to kind of savor the three factors.
One is re-pricing in advance of the Card Act, one is revenue benefits from improving credit, so that the fee and finance charge releases that we’ve been getting here and the third is the decline in this rate percentage because during the recession we haven’t been doing very much marketing.
So the margin is going to go down to 15% because of really three factors. The implementation of the Card Act, not getting the reserve releases that we, as much that as we enjoyed in, say in a quarter like this one and the resumption of marketing with these rates.
And the impact will be somewhat progressive in that thing like, you start to get partial quarters of effects like we had the partial impact of the partial quarter of the impact on over limits then we get the full quarter impact and then a third and fourth quarter were going to get a partial and then full impact of the reasonable fees. But we’re pretty confident about the destination of being around 15%, obviously subject to the final interpretation of reasonable fees.

On the supply side, I’m bullish about the impact of the Card Act. Because we’ve spent a decade feeling like we’ve one arm and one leg tied behind our back choosing not to market in whole parts of the card business because we were uncomfortable with the practices in both the market clearing price from the credit point of view and especially the damage to franchise, building a franchise that we felt some of those practices entailed.
So we’re from a supply point of view feel that the Card Act is a very good thing for Capital One because it returns underwriting back to where it was in the 1990s, which is it’s all about up front underwriting and not about the re-pricing that follow after the fact.
So we feel good about our relative chances and I also think that Card Act is going to put a much greater rationality to the nature of the competition. And so again, on the supply side on that, quite a bit more bullish because also in terms of revenue margins and our business model, I think we feel things are relatively intact.
The wildcard is on the demand side. On the one hand, consumers are deleveraging. I think that, there has been an awful lot of noise about credit cards in the paper every day. It will be still to be determined how much demand there is on the other side of this and also to do have the growth of debit cards causing some modest encroachment into card territory.
On the other hand, however, history shows deleveraging tends to be cyclical things and also, we don’t have one of the biggest factors that held us back in the last decade and that was home equity loans were a massive cannibalize of really good core card growth.
So, I look at it this way, I mean, while there’s a big variance in our own view of the outcome in terms of demand. I’m just assuming it’s going to be flattish, industry growth will be flattish to possibly negative sort of a things stabilizer. But I’m just making that up.
The thing that makes me bullish is that while I’d love a rapidly growing industry, the most important thing is being able to have a relative competitive advantage and a level playing field in the industry, which, paradoxically the great recession and the great legislation if you will have sort of rendered that. So I’m very bullish about that and we just have to see how demand comes out.

Chris, of course, the rules were fairly recent in coming out relative two over limits and opt in. I think our view is that we’ll take a differentiated approach in parts of our portfolio and just not offer them. In other cases offer opt in, but it’s a little premature to conclude where that comes out. But our overall expectation is that over limit fees are substantially down versus the old days and we’ve build that -- we’ve put that into our planning. So you should assume that as well.
Significant reductions in over limit revenues and for us it’s part of the redistribution of how the revenue model works in the card business. And it’s between what’s happened on the over limit side and our expectation with respect to the Card Act with respect to reasonable and proportional fees. There is a shift in how the revenue model and pricing structure in credit card works from away from back-end pricing toward front-end, upfront APR and in some cases annual fees.
And I think there’s a lot of benefits to that model. It’s important, one of the things that I most have my eye on is to make sure that the industry price is high enough for resilience. Because the thing that I don’t think is getting enough attention is some of the resilience diminishment in APR re-pricing that comes from the Card Act.
And so, I’m bullish about the redistribution and the strength of the revenue model as the business changes. But we also are putting into our planning a fact that the expectation that resilience will be somewhat diminished.

Look, first of all, think of the suppression as kind of the provision equivalent for fees and finance charges and as you suggest, in the first quarter, pretty much all of the reduction and the suppression was in the finance charge and fee reserve and think of that like an allowance, okay.
So, we’re definitely seeing those numbers come down. The big reasons for the big step change this quarter were two fold. First, we assessed many fewer fees and we’re not going to suppress unless we obviously are assessing the fees and fees were down in terms of assessments because of lower over limit fees assessed in line with the Card Act.
A continued decline in the overall balances and frankly, continued general improvement in consumer behavior has had a downward impact on the assessment of penalty fees, so lower quantum of fees is driving that reserve down.
Secondly, like with an allowance, the credit improvement that we’re seeing in loan principal, we’re also seeing in the delinquency rate on finance charges and fees. So with the improvement in the consumer credit behavior there, that’s going to draw down the need for reserves.
So in that case, we could see further declines going forward. I would be surprised if we saw a step change as large as this one. Again, it’s being impacted by the one-time effect of a major change coming from the Card Act. But it could continue to come down.
Finally, in terms of where we’re going, I would certainly believe that the finance charge reserve will always exist. In fact, the redistribution of income suggests that’s going to be a larger portion of our business. So, yes, that number will go down and go up over time. But I think going forward, we shouldn’t expect to see a big step change like we did in this past quarter.

And so if you notice with the acquisitions that we’ve done, we have gone into attractive markets with a starting position that really has -- is well beyond the threshold scale and has a real shot at being one of the ultimate large players in each market. And that’s extremely important for an institution that’s not of the scale of the really large banks.
So our big focus right now is on pulling these banks together, building a scalable infrastructure and what the regulators would call top 10 banking capability, which is something that’s really quite different from what any bank of the size of the banks we buy, there at a very different level of scalability. So it’s a big effort to pull this together and create sort of truly scalable infrastructure and that is we’re will along in the process of doing that and that’s a very top priority.
Along the way, we are really building up the capability to be able to grow our bank within our local markets and generate significant deposit growth, loan growth and ultimately growing returns. So that’s the top priority.
Now, it’s not lost on us along the way that a lot of banks have been struggling around the country and that there could be opportunities for particularly attractive deals. I mean, you saw that in fact during the great recession we bought Chevy Chase.
We always take a look at things like that and but I want you to know that it’s not a sense of manifest destiny. We’ve got to get there any particular market. The real sense is, the manifest destiny we’re pursuing is to make sure that we’ve a very well running scalable bank that’s able to take advantage of the considerable unique advantages Capital One brings to the table to leverage a large customer base, a huge national lending business, a national brand and the kind of information based capabilities that we have.

Obviously, we need to have a view about where rates are going and let’s assume that, today’s yield curve is getting accurate reflection of future rates, meaning that they’re going to be going up.
I think that that means that there is considerably less scope at this point, for continued improvement in our cost of funds. So I would say, again, assuming the curve is a good predictor of where rates are going in the short run. I’d say there’s some room for a modest decline in cost of funds over the balance of 2010. We do have some continued run-off of higher cost term funding. That would be in the form of auto securitization and some of our retail time deposits and at the margin, as you can see, we’re replacing all of these maturing funds with lower cost but the deposits.
So I’d say in the short run room for a modest decline in cost of funds, compared to the improvements we’ve seen over the course of the last year or so and from there on it’s really going to be a matter of what happens to the curve.
Now, in terms of operating expenses, what we said at the top of the house, that you should expect to see that operating expenses, that is non-interest expenses minus marketing, should stay on an annual basis with a little bit of quarterly up and down, should stay more or less constant from 2009 to 2010.
And essentially what you’re seeing there is continued investment, particularly in the infrastructure of our bank as we move towards full integration, really trying to get traction there. And that will be offset by continuing efficiencies that we’re having throughout the company, continuing the benefits that we’ve seen from some significant efficiency work over the course of the last couple of years.
So top of the house, you should expect to see operating expenses stay in and around current levels with a little bit of quarterly variability as you saw up in the fourth quarter, down in the first and we’ll see a little bit more that over the course of the year.

I mean, we, if you look at the trust data, our mix of sub 660 business is really quite similar to the other players. So, there’s a lot of, I think, everybody has a different strategy, but in the end I think that the subprime percentage interestingly is very similar.
Our mix over, the over the last year or so and probably consistent with my expectation would be flattish to declining a little bit in that marketplace. So it’s certainly not something we are planning to leap into and where you would see a big change.
As we -- a thing that I said earlier was that after the great recession and the great regulation and legislation in a sense, when we look at our business model, other than a redistribution of where pricing comes from, which generally by the way is a healthy redistribution that I embrace for the marketplace, the same strategies that we were pursuing before in the same segments are pretty much what you should expect from us.
And so, the biggest wildcard to me is, the two biggest uncertainties going forward, which are really not about mix, because I think our mix, I would expected to be pretty similar to what it’s been over the past number of years and it’s been pretty stable for a quite a long period of time.
The biggest uncertainties to me our consumer demand, like I talked about and that one we can argue all sides of it, so well just have to see. And the other very important one, Mike, is pricing in the revolver segment. Go to pricing. Because in the -- in this last past decade, the industry has slipped through its practices into a rather weak underwriting habit of originating at low rate and letting re-pricing take care of it on the other hand.
It is profoundly important that our investors and our industry understand that this is not how it’s going to work going forward. Will they never be, there will still be re-pricing in the sense, there can be forward re-pricing and in its own natural way that will always be a component of the business.
But the defining issue is that while people can use teaser rates all they want, the go to rate of APR has a very important destination importance to it that it used to have in the ‘90s, but sort of didn’t have so much in the last decade.
We’re watching that like a hawk. We’re watching it in every single state segment, every signal sub-segment. The good news is that is going up from the beginning, this first couple of quarters of 2009 to the first couple of months of ‘09 to 2010 has gone up 300 basis points that’s a good thing, while the prime rate has basically stayed flat. So you can see the market moving.
So the other thing that’s going to impact our growth will be watching where that destination go to rate goes to and we’re going to be managing our business very much building resilience into our pricing. How much growth we have in particular segments is really going to be driven on whether the industry prices prudently.
So that’s the other one to watch. And when all the dust settles, Mike, I think probably our mix of our business and the type of things we’re marketing to the customers, we are marketing is going to be pretty much the same.

Our business practices in the NSF OD space are in line compared with other banks. But because the size of our retail bank in comparison to our overall company versus that ratio for most of the people that we compete against, the impact of this legislation on our earnings is probably going to be less. I mean, its something less than 2% of our revenue that in aggregate it represents.
So we’ve made important changes in our overdraft policies, which we disclosed on our website if you’d like to look at those. Since, well, frankly, right after we got into banking, one of our first meetings was we wanted to take a look, in the same as we try to look at practices in the card business, we took a look and started letting some of the air of those practices way back then. But we’ve made some other recent changes, which you can find at our website.
So we don’t, so if I pull way up, Moshe, I sort of philosophically feel the same way about this that I do about some of the card practices. These are things that right when you see what is legislated. It adds impact and hurts the P&L.
But I think the equilibrium that comes out of it is going to be a healthy one, certainly not a lot of reliance by us on that type of income. But I think that it will end up again helping the building of franchise and some of the same things that I felt on the card site. Go head to head a second part of the question?

Let me go straight to the income statement on Slide 3 of the presentation. Capital One earned $636 million or $1.40 per share in the first quarter, up $0.57 per share or 70",1702,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon to everyone listening to the call this afternoon. Let me go straight to the income statement on Slide 3 of the presentation. Capital One earned $636 million or $1.40 per share in the first quarter, up $0.57 per share or 70% from the prior quarter, as modestly improved pre-provision earnings were bolstered by lower provision expenses. 
Total revenue declined $79 million or 1.8%, as an improvement in margin partially offset a 2.9% decline in average loans. The margin benefited from a 17 basis point improvement in cost of funds.
Loan yields were also up slightly in the quarter despite somewhat lower fees as both were positively affected by higher collectability. Despite the slight decline in revenue, pre-provision earnings were up modestly as the $100 million reduction in our non-interest expenses more than offset the lower revenue. The largest contributor to the better quarter-over-quarter performance was the $369 million decrease in provision expense.
Total charge-offs in the quarter fell $170 million as lower charge-offs in our Commercial, Auto Finance and Retail Banking businesses more than offset a slight decrease in Domestic Card charge-offs.
We released $566 million of allowance through provision expense in the first quarter after posting an allowance build of $4.3 billion through retained earnings on January 1 in line with new accounting standards. More on the impact of FAS 167 and the drivers to the allowance in a moment.
Several other items impacted income in the quarter. First, we sold mortgage I/O bonds that were acquired through the purchase of Chevy Chase Bank, resulting in the deconsolidation of $1.5 billion of loans and a net P&L gain of $127 million. We also recognized a net gain on Securities of $65 million as we rebalanced the portion of our agency mortgage-backed Securities portfolio. 
Lastly, we realized a $50 million benefit to tax expense in the quarter resulting from settlements during the quarter. These gains were partially offset by a $224 million cost associated with our rep [representation] and warranty exposure, about half of which is related to the run-off GreenPoint Mortgage portfolio and therefore, is in discontinued operations.
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 4. Total lending assets declined by $11 billion in the quarter. Our Domestic Card portfolio was down $4 billion in the quarter driven by $1.5 billion of charge-offs, $1 billion of run-off in our Installment Loan portfolio, as well as expected seasonal paydowns in revolving credit. The Installment Loan portfolio will continue to pressure Card growth metrics as we expect approximately $2 billion more to run-off over the remainder of 2010.
The Commercial Banking portfolio remained largely flat versus fourth quarter levels, but we expect to see modest growth in this portfolio over the remainder of 2010 as good lending opportunities are beginning to emerge in our markets. On the Consumer Bank side, the nearly $2 billion decline in first quarter assets was primarily driven by two trends I mentioned on last quarter's call. First, in our Auto Finance business, our decision to pull back on origination volume in early 2008 is continuing to reduce the level of outstandings, although we are now beginning to approach the point in which new originations will equal the run-off of prior originations.
Auto assets were down $700 million in the first quarter, and we continue to expect ending loans will be down approximately $2 billion at year-end 2010 versus the end of 2009.
The second factor pressuring Consumer Bank outstandings is that our Mortgage portfolio largely remains in run-off mode, with a $900 million decline in assets in the first quarter. The decline in other assets in the quarter is related to FAS 167 as we reclassified securitization receivables to cash. More on FAS 167 in a minute.
Our $38 billion Securities portfolio shrank slightly in the first quarter as the non-agency book continue to run-off. The portfolio continues to perform well. Our total unrealized gain increased $191 million in the quarter, and now stands in an unrealized gain position of $482 million, even after booking net gains of $65 million.
Between the run-off of our Installment Loan portfolio and declining Consumer Loans in both Auto and Mortgage, we continue to expect these businesses will drive over $7 billion of loan shrinkage over the course of 2010, with $2.6 billion of debt decline already occurring during the first quarter.
While our other Lending businesses may have seen net growth this year despite elevated levels of charge-offs, we still believe our total ending loan balances will decline by mid-single digits in terms of percentage, or taking into account the rapid shrinkage we experienced in 2009, a high single-digit percentage decline in average loan balances year-over-year.
Now to the liability side of the balance sheet. Securitization liability was down sharply, as conduit paydowns and other maturities totaled about $9 billion in this quarter. By year-end 2010, securitization is expected to be down another $11 billion, representing a 43% decline from year-end 2009.
Funding costs declined in the quarter by 17 basis points due to favorable market rates and continued leveraging of our Commercial and Consumer Banking platforms to swap into lower-priced deposits. While on the subject of balance sheet composition, it's worth highlighting that the implementation of FAS 167 has largely eliminated the distinction between our managed and reported balance sheets caused by securitized assets.
I'll briefly discuss this consolidation in greater detail on Slide 5. On January 1, we brought $48 billion of previously off-balance sheet loans, the vast majority of which were securitized Domestic Card loans, onto our balance sheet as we implemented FAS 167. In line with the consolidation of these loans, we built about $4.3 billion in allowance, resulting in a $3 billion after-tax impact to retained earnings and the creation of a $1.6 billion deferred tax asset. So while our ending fourth quarter allowance stood at $4.1 billion, we began the first quarter with an allowance balance of $8.4 billion.
It's worth noting that this initial allowance build ran through retained earnings rather than through the income statement. However, the allowance released for the first quarter, as well as any future changes to the allowance balance, will run through the P&L.
Turning to Slide 6, I'll discuss the change in first quarter allowance in greater detail. We released $566 million from our allowance in the quarter driven largely by the Domestic Card business. There were three main drivers of the allowance release in Card. First, we continue to believe that the first quarter will be the high watermark for Card losses so swapping out the first quarter of 2010 for the first quarter of 2011 drives down our allowance needs. The second driver of the release is our moderating credit outlook for the remainder of 2010 compared to what we were projecting at the end of last quarter. And finally, the $5 billion of lower period-end assets requires lower allowance, all else being equal.
It's important to note that the absolute level of this quarter's Card allowance release was materially impacted by the addition of allowance coverage for the nearly 2/3 of Card assets that were previously off-balance sheet and, historically, did not carry an allowance. Had we not consolidated under FAS 167, the Card allowance release would've been approximately $290 million this quarter.
Similar to the improvement in underlying trends we've observed in the Card business, we continued to see strong credit performance in Auto. This performance, coupled with the approximately $700 million reduction in outstandings led to a $142 million release in allowance for that business. Unlike our Consumer Lending businesses, we continued to see an upward trend of nonperforming loans in Commercial. And as a result, we built $130 million of additional allowance. All told, despite the $566 million allowance release, we ended the first quarter with an allowance balance of $7.8 billion or nearly 6% coverage on our $130 billion Loan portfolio. Given the historically high levels of coverage and underlying business and economic trends, it's reasonable to assume that our total allowance levels will likely continue to decline over the course of the rest of the year.
Turning to Slide 7, I'll discuss our overall risk-bearing capacity. Our ratio of tangible common equity to tangible managed assets in the quarter increased 70 basis points to 5.5% versus the fourth quarter pro forma ratio of 4.8%. The increase in TCE was driven by strong earnings in the first quarter, as well as the $11 billion decline in managed assets. Coupling this level of TCE with the allowance built under FAS 167, our total risk-bearing capacity now stands at 9.7% of our total assets. We expect earnings and a smaller balance sheet to further increase our TCE ratio over the course of the year.
Given the timing and nature of implementation rules for FAS 167, I indicated last quarter that the trends in TCE and Tier 1 ratios would diverge in 2010 into early 2011. You'll see that happening in the first quarter results. Despite the fundamentally positive trends that helped TCE, our Tier 1 ratio decreased to 9.6% in the quarter, down 30 basis points from Q4 '09 pro forma levels.
The numerator of the Tier 1 ratio already declined in line with the large allowance build required by FAS 167 and is now also being affected by the disallowance of some related deferred tax assets. With consolidation phase-in guidance now established, we know that the risk-weighted denominator will increase through the first quarter of 2011. Actually, some of that impact was accelerated into the first quarter, in line with the reduced level of off-balance sheet securitizations I mentioned earlier.
In any event, our Tier 1 ratios are and will continue to remain comfortably above well-capitalized levels. And because regulatory capital ratios are more pro-cyclical, as loss levels normalize, our Tier 1 ratios should more than proportionately follow the fundamental upward trajectory of TCE. While there remains a fair amount of uncertainty about the future of bank capital requirements overall, I'm confident that our balance sheet strength and flexibility position us extremely well to grow profitably. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Rich to talk about our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. Rich?"

I'll begin on Slide 8, with a look at our margins. Net interest margin increased to 7.1% in the first quarter, driven by a 17 basis point improvement in the cost of funds and a three basis point improvement in asset yields. Several factors d",2809,"Thanks, Gary. I'll begin on Slide 8, with a look at our margins. Net interest margin increased to 7.1% in the first quarter, driven by a 17 basis point improvement in the cost of funds and a three basis point improvement in asset yields. Several factors drove the improvement in funding costs. Our funding mix shifted from higher cost wholesale sources to Consumer and Commercial Banking deposits. 
Within our Banking businesses, our mix shifted from higher cost time deposits to lower cost and more relationship-driven liquid saving and transaction accounts. And favorable interest rates and disciplined pricing drove the decrease in deposit interest expense.
Two offsetting forces drove the modest increase in asset yields. Our asset mix shifted from loans to investment securities, which resulted in moderate downward pressure on yields. The effects of this mix shift were more than offset by strong revenue margin in our Domestic Card business.
First quarter Domestic Card revenue margin remained elevated largely as the result of better-than-expected credit results and lower-than-expected attrition of higher-yielding loans. The same credit results and outlook that contributed to the allowance release in the quarter had a parallel favorable impact on revenue. 
Actual credit results were favorable to our prior expectations driving a more favorable assessment of the collectability of finance charges and fees that were previously build but not recognized as revenue. This allowed us to recognize some of these previously build fees as revenue in the first quarter and to recognize a larger portion of first quarter fee billings as well. 
First quarter non-interest income declined. Overlimit fee revenues declined as the result of the February 22 implementation of CARD Act regulations. Interchange revenue also declined seasonally in the quarter. 
Last quarter, we said that we expected the quarterly Domestic Card revenue margin to decrease somewhat in the first quarter on its way to settling in the mid-15% range for the subsequent quarters of 2010. However, better-than-expected credit results, the resulting improvement in the collectability of revenue and lower-than-expected attrition have kept that margin at elevated levels. As we have seen over the last several quarters, Domestic Card revenue margin for any specific quarter is subject to considerable uncertainty from credit trends, seasonality and consumer and competitor responses to the CARD Act.
But as these forces play out by the end of 2010 or early 2011, we still expect that the quarterly Domestic Card revenue margin will decline over the next few quarters. The credit related benefit to revenue we experienced in the first quarter is likely to diminish because we were able to recognize more of the finance charges and fees we build in the first quarter. We'll have a smaller backlog of first quarter billings that could be recognized in future quarters as credit improves.
Beginning in the second quarter, we will experience an additional modest decline in overlimit fee revenue resulting from the February 22 implementation of CARD Act regulations. It's still too early to precisely quantify the expected impact of the proposed reasonable and proportional fee regulations because we don't yet know the final rules. But we do know that they are set to be implemented on August 22. That means that the third quarter will include a half-quarter revenue impact from the regulations, and that the fourth quarter will include a full quarter effect. We'll need to see more specifics as the rule-making process continues through the comment period and revisions in the spring and summer.
Last quarter, we cited these regulations as a risk, and we're now incorporating a range of potential outcomes into our expectation for Domestic Card quarterly revenue margin. By the end of 2010 or early in 2011, we expect that quarterly Domestic Card revenue margin will be around 15%, which is a level consistent with very healthy overall returns for the Card business.
Slide 9 shows a history of the overall economics of our Domestic Card business. With all the noise surrounding the CARD Act, revenue margin trends and uncertainty about the future of the Card business, we believe that a look at this history provides a helpful context for our expectations of the future economics of the business. Over the last six years, changes in the components of Domestic Card ROA have generally offset each other, preserving strong ROA. The only exception over the last six years was, of course, the great recession. While ROA declined through this period, the graph shows that this was the result of elevated provision expense that could not be fully offset with revenue or expense levers. The graph also shows that our Domestic Card business remained profitable throughout the worst credit cycle in generations.
Looking forward, we expect revenue margin to decline for the next several quarters to around 15% by early 2011 as I just discussed. Over time, margins may experience further modest decline as credit improves.
We expect non-interest expense as a percentage of loans to increase in the near term, largely as the result of the declining loans and the denominator and the expected increase in marketing expenses. We expect that marketing will ramp back toward more normal levels over the next several quarters. The pace and extent of that ramp will depend upon consumer demand and the competitive landscape. We expect increased marketing and improving charge-offs will result in modest growth in our revolving Card balances over the remainder of 2010. But we expect that Domestic Card loan balances, the overall segment, will be relatively flat for the remaining quarters of 2010 as growth in revolving Cards is offset by elevated charge-offs and the continuing run-off of Installment Loans.
One issue of particular importance is equilibrium pricing in the industry following the CARD Act. Pricing for new customers has been increasing gradually. We're watching industry pricing trends carefully as they are a bellwether for the long-term health of the card industry. Go to APRs, they've risen about 300 basis points over the last year and have edged into the mid-teens in the last few months. We believe that industry pricing needs to continue to increase to provide appropriate resiliency for new originations since post the CARD Act, there is less repricing resilience of APRs than there was in the past.
Over time, we expect that higher marketing expenses will be partially offset by a decline in operating expense. We expect operating expense as a percentage of loans to decline as improving credit allows us to reduce collections intensity and as balances begin to rebuild. We expect provision expense to decline over the next several quarters. We believe that credit losses peaked in the first quarter of 2010. We expect modest improvement in charge-offs beginning in the second quarter of 2010. And as Gary discussed, we continue to see the potential for significant allowance releases in the Domestic Card business.
As a result of these revenue and expense trends, it's likely that pre-provision earnings as a percentage of loans will decline through 2010 and perhaps into early 2011. But we expect that this decline will be partially offset by the expected improvement in provision expense.
All these components of ROA will almost certainly move over time as the result of market conditions, competitor moves and consumer behavior. But history has shown that they often move in ways that naturally offset. We've been able to manage multiple levers to deliver solid pre-provision and bottom line ROA as the industry and the economy have gone through enormous changes.
In the long term, we still believe that the overall economics of the Domestic Card business are very attractive. We'd expect that growth and returns will lag marketing investments as they always have. But with healthy ROA and the return to loan growth, we expect that Domestic Card business will still be the most attractive Consumer Lending business in banking, and that it will continue to deliver returns that are well above hurdle over the cycle.
Slide 10 shows credit results for our Consumer Lending businesses. Domestic charge-off rate increased to 10.5% for the first quarter of 2010 driven by declining loan balances and a temporary increase in charge-offs as last year's pricing actions flowed through the charge-off. The charge-off increase was smaller than expected due to favorable bankruptcy trends and favorable performance in late-stage delinquencies.
The 30-plus delinquency rate improved nearly 50 basis points to 5.3% at the end of the quarter. Expected seasonal trends and the diminishing impact of last year's pricing actions drove the improvement. Based on first quarter charge-off and delinquency results, we now believe that the first quarter is likely to be the peak for both dollar charge-offs and charge-off rate in Domestic Card.
While we believe Q1 is the peak, we expect only modest improvement in second quarter, as seasonal improvements are offset by continuing declines in loan balances. We expect continuing modest improvement in charge-offs in the second half of 2010. We expect modest growth in Consumer Cards to offset Installment Loan run-off reducing the denominator effect. And although it's still early, in recent months we've seen further signs of stabilization, and even some modest improvements in labor and housing markets.
International charge-offs and delinquency trends remained stable to slightly improving. We've been retrenching the U.K. business for some time now, and we've been cautious in Canada. First quarter credit results reflect this cautious stance, as well as the fact that unemployment is improving in Canada and appears to be stabilizing in the U.K. Strong credit performance drove first quarter profit to the $117 million in our International Card business.
Charge-offs for the Mortgage portfolio were relatively stable. Early delinquencies improved, but non-performing and foreclosure inventories continue to increase due to a very slow resolution process. Modifications add several months to the process, and local jurisdictions face growing foreclosure backlogs that further slow resolution. Overall, our portfolio continues to perform better than industry averages. 
Our Mortgage portfolio includes the challenged Chevy Chase portfolio that we acquired in 2009. Chevy Chase portfolio is protected by the credit mark we took at acquisition. This portfolio continues to perform in line with our expectations, and we remain comfortable with the mark.
Auto Finance charge-off rate and delinquency rate both improved in the first quarter. The improvements resulted from expected seasonal patterns, the strong performance of recent origination vintages and the stabilizing economic and auction price trends. These factors were partially offset by the impact of declining loan balances. Favorable consumer credit performance and credit outlook were key drivers to strong profitability in our Credit Card and Consumer Banking businesses in the first quarter.
Slide 11 shows credit performance in our Commercial Banking businesses. In the first quarter, Commercial Banking charge-off rate declined from elevated charge-off levels in the fourth quarter of 2009. We charged off fewer loans in the first quarter, and we experienced lower severities on the loans we charged off. Non-performing asset rate increased modestly in the quarter, but the pace of deterioration was slower than we have seen over the last several quarters. The pressure on non-performing asset rate and charge-off rate remains concentrated in our Commercial and Multi-family Real Estate business, about 70% of which is located in metro New York City.
Within this portfolio, the source of deterioration has shifted from the relatively small Construction portfolio to loans related to New York City office buildings. Sequential quarter charge-off comparisons were also impacted by actions we took in the fourth quarter in our Small Ticket CRE portfolio, which continues to run-off after we stopped originating these loans over two years ago.
Last quarter, we charged off a portfolio of non-performing Small Ticket CRE loans as we sold them in the distressed debt market. Selling non-performers is an ongoing part of our workout strategy for the Small Ticket CRE portfolio. The timing of such sales depends upon investor appetite and market conditions, and the volume of loan sales was much smaller in the fourth quarter.
Credit performance in the Middle Market portfolio remains relatively stable. Overall, we expect non-performers and charge-offs will continue to deteriorate in our Commercial business, but the pace of deterioration is slowing. It appears that the worst of the commercial credit cycle may be behind us. We continue to believe that our Commercial Banking Loan portfolio is well positioned to weather this downturn in Commercial Real Estate. We have a favorable loan mix with a relatively small exposure to construction lending. And our relatively small exposure to construction lending is a key reason that the absolute level of our CRE charge-off rate is lower than many other banks.
We also have a relatively large exposure to New York City Multi-family, which has been resilient to the recession because of rent controls and supply limitations. We have disciplined lending standards, and we underwrite to in-place cash flows in rents. And compared to most large banks, Commercial Loans are much smaller percentage of our total company-managed loans.
I'll conclude this afternoon on Slide 12. We've worked for years to position our company to be resilient, and we're demonstrating that resilience through the most challenging economic cycle we've seen in generations. We've delivered relatively resilient profitability through the downturn. We maintained the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet. We built strong and stable liquidity through careful management of our balance sheet and by growing deposits with disciplined pricing. We maintained healthy allowance coverage ratios throughout the downturn. And we maintained sufficient capital to address both the recession and the FAS 166/167 accounting changes.
We're now on the path to delivering normalized earnings. Over the next several quarters, we expect that quarterly margins will decline to more normal levels driven by the expected decline in Domestic Card revenue margin I described earlier, as well as the stabilization of funding costs. We expect that loans will continue to decline over the next few quarters before finding a bottom at the end of 2010 or early in 2011.
Continuing run-off of businesses we exited or repositioned earlier in the recession will drive loan declines even as some of our businesses begin to grow sooner. And we expect that expenses will increase over this timeframe as marketing expense will ramp toward more normal historical levels and we make investments in banking infrastructure to support future growth. The combination of these expected trends will result in lower quarterly pre-provision earnings in 2011.
We expect the decline in pre-provision expense will cushion the bottom line impact of falling pre-provision earnings. It should be expected the decline in provision expense will cushion the bottom line of falling pre-provision earnings. We expect continuing improvement in charge-offs. And the combination of declining loan balances and improving credit trends create the potential for significant allowance releases as well.
As we move past the early part of 2011, we believe that our path to normalized earnings will become more apparent in our quarterly results. We expect pre-provision earnings to establish a positive trend over the course of 2011. We remain well positioned to deliver significant shareholder value over the long term.
In our Commercial and Consumer Banking businesses, we have great market positions in some of the best local markets in the country. We can grow commercial relationships and loans as the commercial credit cycle improves. We can continue to grow deposits with disciplined pricing. And as we complete our investments and infrastructure, we expect our cost structure and bottom line profitability will improve over time.
Our Domestic Card business has delivered industry-leading profitability and returns through cycles, including the most significant recession in generations. We believe that our Domestic Card business is well positioned to compete on the new level playing field that's created because the CARD Act prohibits widely used industry practices, which we never relied on, like aggressive single-infraction penalty repricing. As a result, we expect that we'll be able to essentially restart the marketing of similar products to similar customer segments that we were doing before we pulled back during the recession.
The Credit Card business has always been characterized by significant near-term marketing investments, followed by a long-term payoff with very attractive risk-adjusted returns. Margins may moderate modestly over time as charge-offs normalize, but we're confident that returns will remain well above hurdle rate over cycles. We expect that returns will be more sustainable long term, with competitive practices cleaned up by the CARD Act. And as we've said before, we believe that the Domestic Card market and competitive environment following the implementation of the CARD law will play to our strengths.
Our balance sheet is emerging from the dual challenges of the recession and the FAS 166/167 accounting change with its resilience intact. As Gary described earlier, our balance sheet strength and flexibility put us in a strong position to grow profitably and to sustain above hurdle returns over the long term. 
Now Gary and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?

In the first quarter, we were down nearly 5% or about $6.7 billion. So we're pretty close to where we said we thought we would be by the end of the year in terms of the overall balance shrinkage. Now to break that down into the segments, what we've said is that we expect another $4.5 billion worth of decline between now and the end of 2010 coming from a runoff in Installment Loans. That's a couple of billion dollars. In Mortgage, that's maybe another $1.5 billion, and the reduction in Auto outstandings would be another $0.5 billion or so. So that's the decline from here to the end of the year, about $4.5 billion. Just about offsetting that would be loan balances in our revolving Credit Card portfolio and in our Commercial book. Particularly in the revolving Credit Card portfolio, we'll continue to have an elevated level of charge-offs. So in effect, we're going to have to grow that both to cover the involuntary attrition that comes from the charge-offs, as well as to offset some of the decline in the other businesses. So all told, year-end 2009 to year-end 2010, down in the mid-single digits. Again, it'll be a little bit more in terms of average outstandings.

And then The Great Recession came along, the regulations came along, and we got to an unusually elevated level that you see at 17%, really because of three factors. So we're kind of at the peak here, and I want to kind of savor the three factors. One is repricing in advance of the CARD Act. One is revenue benefits from improving credit, so that's the fee and finance charge releases that we've been getting here. And the third is the decline in teaser rate percentage because during the recession, we haven't been doing very much marketing. So the margin is going to go down to 15% because of really three factors: The implementation of the CARD Act; not getting the reserve releases that we -- as much of it as we enjoyed say, in a quarter like this one; and the resumption of marketing with teaser rates. And the impact will be somewhat progressive in that things -- you start to get partial quarters of effects like we had the partial impact of the -- partial quarter of the impact on overlimits, then we get the full quarter impact and then in the third and fourth quarter, we're going to get a partial and then full impact of the reasonable fees.

On the supply side, I'm bullish about the impact of the CARD Act, because we've spent a decade feeling like we have one arm and one leg tied behind our back, choosing not to market in whole parts of the Card business because we were uncomfortable with the practices and both the market-clearing price from the credit point of view and especially the damage to franchise, building a franchise that we felt some of those practices entailed. So we are, from a supply of point of view, feel that the CARD Act is a very good thing for Capital One because it returns underwriting back to where it was in the '90s, which is it's all about upfront underwriting and not about the repricings that follow after the fact. So we feel good about our relative chances, and I also think that the CARD Act is going to put a much greater rationality to the nature of the competition. And so again, on the supply side, I'm not quite a bit more bullish because also in terms of revenue margins and our business model, I think we feel things are relatively intact. The wild card is on the demand side. On the one hand, consumers are deleveraging. I think that there's been an awful lot of noise about credit cards in the paper everyday. It'll be still to be determined how much demand there is on the other side of this. And also, you do have the growth of debit cards causing some modest encroachment into card territory. On the other hand however, history shows deleveraging tend to be cyclical things. And also, we don't have one of the biggest factors that held us back in the last decade, and that was home equity loans were a massive cannibalizer of really good core card growth. So I look at it this way, I mean, while there is a big variance in our own view of the outcome in terms of demand, I'm just assuming it's going to be flattish. Industry growth would be flattish to positively negative, sort of as things stabilize, but I'm just making that up. The thing that makes me bullish is that while I'd love a rapidly growing industry, the most important thing is being able to have a relative competitive advantage in a level playing field in the industry, which paradoxically, The Great Recession and the great legislation, if you will, have sort of rendered that. So I'm very bullish about that, and we'll just have to see how demand comes out."

I think our view is that we'll take a differentiated approach in parts of our portfolio, just not offer them. In other cases, offer opt-in but it's a little premature to conclude where that comes out. But our overall expectation is that overlimit fees are substantially down versus the old days. And we put that into our planning so you should assume that as well, significant reductions in overlimit revenues. And for us, it's part of the redistribution of how the revenue model works in the card business, and it's between what's happened on the overlimit side and our expectation with respect to the CARD Act, with respect to reasonable and proportional fees. There is a shift in how the revenue model and pricing structure in the credit card works from away from back-end pricing toward front end, upfront, APR and in some cases, annual fees. And I think there's a lot of benefits to that model. One of the things that I most have my eye on is to make sure that the industry price is high enough for resilience, because the thing that I don't think's getting enough attention is some of the resilience diminishment in APR repricing that comes from the CARD Act. And so I'm bullish about the redistribution and the strength of the revenue model as the business changes, but we also are putting into our planning effect that the expectation that resilience will be somewhat diminished."

And as you suggest in the first quarter, pretty much all of the reduction in the suppression was in the finance charge and fee reserve, and think of that like an allowance. So we're definitely seeing those numbers come down. The big reasons for the big step change this quarter were twofold. First, we assessed many fewer fees, and we're not going to suppress unless we obviously are assessing the fees, and fees were down in terms of assessments because of lower overlimit fees assessed in line with the CARD Act. A continued decline in the overall balances, and frankly, continued general improvement in consumer behavior has had a downward impact on the assessment of penalty fees. So lower quantum of fees is driving that reserve down. Secondly, like with an allowance, the credit improvement that we're seeing in loan principal, we're also seeing in the delinquency rate on finance charges and fees. So with the improvement in the consumer credit behavior there, that's going to draw down the need for reserves. So in that case, we could see further declines going forward. I would be surprised if we saw a step change as large as this one. Again, it's being impacted by the one-time effect of a major change coming from the CARD Act, but it could continue to come down. Finally, in terms of where we're going, I would certainly believe that the finance charge reserve will always exist. In fact, the redistribution of income suggests that's going to be a larger portion of our business. So yes, that number will go down and go up over time. But I think going forward, we shouldn't expect to see a big step change like we did in this past quarter."

And so if you notice with the acquisitions that we've done, we have gone into attractive markets with a starting position that really has -- well, it's well beyond threshold scale and has a real shot at being one of the ultimate and large players in each market, and that's extremely important for an institution that's not of the scale of the really large banks. So our big focus right now is on pulling these banks together, building a scalable infrastructure and what the regulators would call, ""Top 10 bank capability,"" which is something that's really quite different from what any bank of the size of banks we buy. They're at a very different level of scalability. So it's a big effort to pull this together and create sort of truly scalable infrastructure, and that is -- we're well along in the process of doing that, and that's a very top priority. Along the way, we are really building up the capability to be able to grow our bank within our local markets and generate significant deposit growth, loan growth and ultimately, growing returns. So that's the top priority. Now it's not lost on us along the way that a lot of banks have been struggling around the country, and that there could be opportunities for particularly attractive deals. I mean, you saw that in fact, during The Great Recession, we bought Chevy Chase. We always take a look at things like that but I want you to know that it's not a sense of manifest destiny. We've got to get there to any particular market. The real sense is the manifest destiny we're pursuing is to make sure that we have a very well-running scalable bank that's able to take advantage of the considerably unique advantages Capital One brings to the table to leverage a large customer base, a huge national lending business, a national brand and the kind of information-based capabilities that we have."

Obviously, we need to have a view about where rates are going, and let's just assume that today's yield curve is giving an accurate reflection of future rates. Meaning that they're going to be going up. I think that means that there is a considerably less scope at this point for continued improvement in our cost of funds. I would say, again assuming the curve is a good predictor of where rates are going in the short run, I'd say there's some room for a modest decline in cost of funds over the balance of 2010. We do have some continued runoff of higher-cost term funding that would be in the form of auto securitizations and some of our retail time deposits. And at the margin as you can see, we're replacing all of these maturing funds with lower-cost liquid deposits. So I'd say in the short run, room for a modest decline in cost of funds compared to the improvements we've seen over the course over the last year or so. And from there on, it's really going to be a matter of what happens to the curve. Now in terms of operating expenses, what we've said at the top of the house that you should expect to see that operating expenses, that is non-interest expense minus marketing, should stay on an annual basis, with a little bit of quarterly up and down, should stay more or less constant from 2009 to 2010. And essentially, what you're seeing there is continued investment particularly in the infrastructure of our bank as we move towards full integration and really trying to get traction there. And that will be offset by continuing efficiencies that we're having throughout the company, continuing the benefits we've seen from some significant efficiency work over the course of the last couple of years. So top of the house, you should expect to see operating expenses stay in and around current levels with a little bit of quarterly  variability as you saw up in the fourth quarter, down in the first, and we'll see a little bit more of that over the course of the year."

So there's a lot of -- I think everybody has a different strategy but in the end, I think the subprime percentage, interestingly, is fairly similar. Our mix over the last year or so, and probably consistent with my expectation, would be flattish to declining a little bit in that marketplace. So it's certainly not something we are planning to leap into and where you would see a big change. A thing that I said earlier was that after The Great Recession and the great regulation and legislation, in a sense, when we look at our business model, other than a redistribution of where pricing comes from, which generally by the way is a healthy redistribution that I embraced for the marketplace, the same strategies we were pursuing before in the same segments are pretty much what you should expect from us. And so the biggest wildcard to me is -- the two biggest uncertainties going forward, which really not about mix, because I think our mix, I would expect it to be pretty similar to what has been over the past number of years, and has been pretty stable for quite a long period of time. The biggest uncertainties to me are consumer demand like I talked about, and that one, we can argue all sides of it, so we'll just have to see. And the other very important one, Mike, is pricing in the revolver segment, go-to pricing. Because in this last past decade, the industry has slipped through its practices into a rather weak underwriting habit of originating at lower rate and letting repricing take care of it on the other end. It is profoundly important that our investors and our industry understand that this is not how it's going to work going forward. Will there never be -- there will still be repricing in the sense there can be forward repricing, and in its own natural way, that will always be a component of the business. But the defining issue is that while people can use TCE rates all they want, the go-to rate of APR has a very important destination importance to it that it used to have in the '90s but sort of didn't have so much in the last decade. We are watching that like a hawk. We're watching it in every single segment, every single subsegment. The good news is that it's going up from the beginning. The first couple of months of '09 to 2010 has gone up 300 basis points, that's a good thing, while the primary has basically stayed flat. So you can see the market moving. So the other thing that's going to impact our growth will be watching where that destination go-to rate goes to, and we are going to be managing our business, very much building resilience into our pricing. How much growth we have in particular segments is really going to be driven on whether the industry prices prudently, so that's the other one to watch. And when all the dust settles, Mike, I think, probably our mix of our business and the type of things we're marketing -- to the customers, we're marketing is going to be pretty much the same."

Our business practices in the NSF/OD space are in line compared with other banks. But because the size of our retail bank in comparison to our overall company versus that ratio for most of the people that we compete against, the impact of this legislation on our earnings is probably going to be less.

So we've made important changes in our overdraft policies, which we disclosed on our website if you'd like to look at those, since -- frankly, right when we got into banking, one of our first meetings was we wanted to take a look in the same way we try to look at practices in the current business, we took a look and started letting some of the air out of those practices way back then. But we have made some other recent changes which you can find in our website.

Let's go straight into the income statement on Slide 3. Capital One earned $608 million or $1.33 per share in the second quarter, with all of our businesses posting a profit. As we for",1383,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon to everyone listening in to the call. Let's go straight into the income statement on Slide 3. Capital One earned $608 million or $1.33 per share in the second quarter, with all of our businesses posting a profit. As we foreshadowed in last quarter's call, lower provision expense more than offset the expected decline in pre-provision earnings. 
Total revenue declined $385 million or 9%. As net interest margin was stable, the revenue decline was driven by a 4.5% decline in average loans and a decrease in noninterest income. The single largest driver of the decline in noninterest income was the absence of the first quarter's mortgage I/O bond sale. In addition, noninterest income was impacted by significantly fewer security sales and a full quarter impact of the reduction in overlimit fees resulting from the move to opt-in mandated under the CARD law.
Marketing expenses rose somewhat from seasonally low first quarter levels and will likely continue to rise in the second half of the year, though the magnitude of the increase will depend on the opportunities for growth. Operating expenses increased $114 million in the quarter, which included a number of onetime items, including legal reserves and a tax accrual due the legislative changes in Canada. We expect near-term operating expenses to moderate a bit, with second half expenses approximating the level realized in the first half of the year.
Credit performance continues to improve, and as a result, provision expense declined 51% or $755 million in the quarter. Charge-offs declined in each of our businesses, yielding a $301 million aggregate improvement in the quarter. Also benefiting provision expense was the release of just over $1 billion of allowance, up from a $566 million release in the prior quarter. More on the allowance in a moment. 
One final item of note on the income statement was a $404 million rep and warranty expense, approximately 3/4 of which was recorded in discontinued operations. Wherever possible we have now incorporated probable future losses on an expected life-of-loan basis. The single biggest impact of this change was on GSE loans, which are now fully accounted for on this basis. 
Turning to Slide 4, I'll discuss the balance sheet. Total ending loans declined by $3 billion or 2% in the quarter, with more than all of the decline accounted for by run-off portfolios and elevated levels in charge-offs. Our Domestic Card portfolio was down $1.6 billion in the quarter or 3%, as $1.3 billion of charge-offs and $1.2 billion of run-off of our Installment Loan portfolio more than offset gross originations in the quarter. With increasing quarterly origination of new accounts, improving charge-offs and a gradually moderating impact of run-off, we expect Domestic Card balances to be approaching their lows. 
The Commercial Banking Loan portfolio continues to hover around $30 billion, although we did have an approximately $500 million increase in unfunded commitments for our Commercial customers in the quarter. We expect to see modest growth in this portfolio over the balance of the year. 
The Consumer Banking portfolio decreased $1 billion in the quarter, about 2/3 of which was caused by the continued decline in our run-off Mortgage portfolio. Auto Finance outstandings are approaching an equilibrium where our level of new originations will equal the run-off of prior originations for that business. 
We grew our Securities portfolio by $1.1 billion in the quarter, with the bulk of growth in agency mortgage-backs and floating rate asset-backed securities. The portfolio continues to perform well, and our unrealized gain position is now $930 million, up from $482 million at the end of the first quarter.
On the liability side, we continue to leverage our Commercial and Consumer Banking platforms to take advantage of strong demand for deposits. By slopping out maturing securitizations liabilities and time deposits into lower-priced liquid deposits, we drove down our total cost of funds by another seven basis points in the quarter. 
Securitization liability was down $5 billion in the quarter, and we expect it to end 2010 at $27 billion, a 43% decline from year-end 2009. Our loan-to-deposit ratio is now 1.08, the lowest point in our company's history.
As we turn to Slide 5, I'll discuss the allowance. The continuing improvement in credit drove a reduction in allowance balances in all of our businesses in the second quarter, totaling $953 million for the company overall. $665 million of the reduction was in the Card business, the vast majority of which was in Domestic Card. This allowance release largely reflects the better-than-expected loss performance in our portfolio during the second quarter and a lower level of delinquencies. In addition, the $2 billion of lower-period end loans requires lower allowance, all else being equal. 
Despite the reduction in allowance, you'll note that our Domestic Card allowances as a percent of delinquencies remained stable in the quarter. This reflects the fact that while delinquencies are improving, we are not assuming an improvement in the expected losses per delinquent dollar for the sake of the allowance. 
We continue to see strong credit performance in Auto Finance, with charge-offs down $41 million quarter-over-quarter to just 2.09%. This performance, coupled with a modest reduction in outstandings, led to $158 million reduction in allowance for that business, which accounts for 2/3 of the Consumer Banking allowance release. 
After many quarters of building allowance in our Commercial Banking segment, we released $33 million of allowance in the second quarter. This release was a result of both improving recent risk trends as well as further segmentation in our methodology to reflect different credit performance within segments of the business. Despite this release, allowance as a percent of nonperforming loans rose in the quarter and now stands at 149%. Rich will talk more about commercial credit in a moment.
All told, despite the $953 million allowance release, we ended the second quarter with an allowance balance of $6.8 billion or 5.35% coverage on our Loan portfolio. It's reasonable to assume that our total allowance levels will likely continue to decline over the course of the rest of the year, given the historically high levels of coverage and underlying credit trends we are experiencing. 
I'll now provide color on our capital ratios as we turn to Slide 6. Our tangible-common-equity-to-tangible-managed-assets ratio increased 60 basis points in the quarter to 6.1%, nearly rebounding to the levels prior to the implementation of FAS 167. This increase in TCE was primarily driven by strong earnings in the quarter and an improvement in OCI. 
Taking into account the allowance, our total risk-bearing capacity is now greater than it was at any point in 2009. This increase in our risk-bearing capacity has been accompanied by a decrease in risk with ongoing improvement in credit performance. 
Strong earnings and reduced loan balances in the quarter also helped our Tier 1 ratios, despite the continued onboarding of risk-weighted assets, due to the reduction in securitization levels.
We still expect a declining trend in our Tier 1 ratios, however, over the near term. Rather than reflecting any fundamental weakness, this declining trend will be caused by two factors: first, the phased-in onboarding of remaining securitized assets, which begins in the third quarter of this year, will increase the denominator; second, in the first quarter of 2011, we expect a decrease in the portion of our currently elevated DTA to qualify as Tier 1 capital. 
However, our Tier 1 ratios are and will continue to remain comfortably above well-capitalized levels. Once the phase-in period is complete in early 2011 and loss level has normalized further, the pro-cyclical Tier 1 ratios should more than proportionately follow the fundamental upward trajectory of TCE. 
Before I pass the call over to Rich, I'd like to note that the recent enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act may have an impact on the Tier 1 treatment of our approximately $3.5 billion of trust preferred securities and provides for a phase-in period expected to begin in 2013.
Given the potential change in capital treatment of these securities, we anticipate that we will determine whether to exercise our rights to redeem our trust-preferred securities at or near the beginning of the phase-in period. We look forward to receiving clarity on these issues through rule-making and other regulatory action. With that, I'll pass it over to Rich."

Modest funding cost improvements were offset by a modest decline in asset yields. Asset yield decreased as a result of a greater mix of investment securities versus loans in the quarter. The decline in our revenue margin resulted mostly from the absence of onetime benefits we experienced in the first quarter, as Gary just discussed, as well as the expected decline in our Domestic Card business revenue margin. 
Second quarter Domestic Card revenue margin declined 48 basis points to 16.6% as the expectations we described last quarter began to play out. Two factors caused the second quarter decline: overlimit fee revenues declined as expected, with the full quarter effect of the CARD Act opt-in requirement; and the revenue benefit from improving credit performance was smaller in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter. In the second quarter, improving credit performance continued to increase the expected collectability of finance charge and fee billings, but the favorable impact on revenue diminished somewhat from elevated first quarter levels.
Looking forward, we expect that Domestic Card revenue margin will continue to decline over the next few quarters. We still expect that quarterly Domestic Card revenue margin will be around 15% by the end of 2010 or early 2011, as the major impact of the CARD Act and cyclical forces are fully absorbed. 
While the overlimit fee impact has largely run its course, we expect that three factors will continue to pressure revenue margin with each factor driving about 1/3 of the expected decline. As higher margin loan balances charge off or pay down, we expect that they will be partially replaced by new originations with lower go-to and promotional rates, which will result in lower net interest margin. 
The credit-related benefit to revenue we experienced in the first and second quarters is likely to diminish further. Because we were able to recognize more of the finance charge and fees we billed in the first two quarters of the year, we'll have a smaller backlog of prior billings that could be recognized in future quarters as credit improves.
And our assumptions about declining late fee revenues are essentially unchanged by the Fed's final rules on reasonable and proportional late fee levels scheduled to go into effect on August 22. We expect that the third quarter Domestic Card revenue margin will show a partial quarter effect from reduced late fees and that the fourth quarter revenue margin will show the full quarter run-rate effect of this new regulation. Longer term, the revenue margin may drift downward modestly as credit continues to improve toward more normal levels. We continue to expect that Domestic Card revenue margin will remain at a level consistent with very healthy overall returns for the Card business.
As you can see on Slide 8, loan balances continue to decline across our businesses. Expected run-off continues in our Installment Loan portfolio in Domestic Card, our Mortgage portfolio in Consumer Banking and our Small Ticket CRE portfolio in Commercial Banking. Overall consumer demand remains week, despite emerging pockets of improving demand and origination growth in our Domestic Card and Auto Finance business. 
In our Commercial Banking business, we've increased lending and loan commitments, but utilization of committed lines remains low by historical standards, resulting in stable outstanding commercial loan balances.
The pace of balance declines is slowing as charge-off improve and expected run-off abates somewhat. We expect that loan balances will find a bottom and stabilize over the next several quarters. We believe balances will begin to grow modestly in 2011. The timing and pace of expected growth remains uncertain because the timing and pace of any rebound in consumer and commercial demand remains uncertain. While we remain well positioned to gain share in our Domestic Card business and to grow modestly in our Commercial Banking business, the overall level of growth will be dependent upon broader trends in overall consumer and commercial demand. 
In the face of uncertain consumer demand, we will rigorously manage credit underwriting and margins. We will work backwards from the goal of building businesses with attractive, sustainable and resilient economics. And we will take whatever growth the market will give us, rather than misguided efforts to generate growth that are either too risky or uneconomic.
Slide 9 shows consumer credit trends. Charge-offs and delinquencies improved across our Consumer businesses, with the exception of an expected seasonal uptick in Auto delinquencies. These seasonal trends suggest that Auto charge-off rate will increase in the second half of 2010, but Auto Finance credit remains exceptionally strong with significant improvements as compared to the prior year. 
While our consumer credit results improved in the quarter, recent economic data provides a reminder that the overall economic recovery remains fragile. May and June labor market reports were weak, and we continue to see risks in the housing markets as well, as the shadow inventory of homes in foreclosure or with severely delinquent mortgages remain very high. 
Our credit results have continued to improve even as the economic recovery faltered a bit over the last couple of months. As we've discussed for several quarters, our economic assumptions have incorporated a view that economic recovery would be fragile and modest at best. While recent economic trends are consistent with our assumptions, we remain cautious, so underwriting remains tight across our Lending businesses. Credit performance also benefits from the portfolio turnover that comes with a prolonged recession. And consumer deleveraging, by definition, means that consumers are paying down debt rather than spending and borrowing. While this pressures loan growth, it also contributes to the improvement in delinquencies and charge-offs. 
You can see credit trends in our Commercial Banking businesses on Slide 10. Commercial Banking credit results improved in the quarter. In addition to the improvement in charge-off rates and nonperforming asset rates, we experienced a quarter-over-quarter decline in the dollar amount of criticized loans, reflecting stabilization across our Commercial Banking businesses. Largely as a result of improving credit results, our Commercial Banking business posted a profit in the second quarter. 
During the second quarter, we saw some stability return to the CRE market. Leasing activity increased, and vacancies started to decline in New York, where we have our largest commercial real estate exposure. Traditional CRE investors have begun to re-enter the market, providing needed liquidity. And sponsors have been willing to inject new capital into troubled transactions, which has allowed us to rightsize many of our troubled loans.
While commercial credit appears to be stabilizing, we are not quite prepared to call a peak in commercial charge-offs or nonperformers. We believe that the worst is behind us, but we expect a few more quarters of uncertainty and choppiness in commercial charge-offs and nonperformers. 
There's been quite a bit of interest this quarter in our exposure to the Gulf oil spill, given our leading market position in Louisiana. We have very little direct exposure to the most impacted industries, like fishing and tourism, on the Gulf Coast beaches. Our Oil and Gas businesses are well diversified and mostly onshore. As a result, our credit performance has not seen a significant impact from the oil spill. 
Longer term, if the moratorium on deepwater drilling persists, the rigs in the Gulf may be forced to move to other drilling locations. This would not be a good thing for the local economy, as offshore oil and gas drilling provides significant employment along the Gulf Coast. Many of the people, businesses and communities we serve in Louisiana and Texas are facing tremendous challenges from the spill. Just as we did in the aftermath of Katrina, we are committed to serving them and supporting our customers and communities through the cleanup and recovery from this environmental disaster.
I'll close tonight on Slide 11. Capital One is demonstrating considerable resilience through the Great Recession and ongoing legislative and rate regulatory changes. But economic and regulatory uncertainty remains high. While the modest economic recovery continues, the last two months of labor and housing market data showed weakness. Consumer demand remains weak. And while the recently passed regulatory reform law provides some closure, the banking industry now faces the development of hundreds of regulatory rules over the next couple of years to actually implement the new law. 
Our businesses and our business model are relatively less impacted by many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act, as we are a Main Street bank rather than a Wall Street bank. Like all banks, we'll be subject to changing capital requirements that will evolve as U.S. and international regulators work to coordinate the capital aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act on the ongoing Basel III discussions. The CARD Act and the CFPB are the areas of new legislation and regulation that have the most direct impacts on Capital One. We've been discussing the CARD Act for some time now, and we've incorporated the expected impact into our strategies and our outlook. 
The potential impact of the CFPB is impossible to predict precisely, but to the extent that it promotes and preserves a truly level playing field for all banks and consumer lenders, we believe that our underwriting and marketing capabilities as well as our customer practices will continue to be competitive advantages.
Against that backdrop, our near-term and long-term expectations are essentially unchanged from what we articulated a quarter ago. Over the next several quarters, we expect that quarterly pre-provision earnings will decline into 2011. We expect the declining provision expense will cushion the bottom line impact of falling pre-provision earnings. As we move past the early part of 2011, we believe that our path to normalized earnings will become more apparent in our quarterly results. We expect that loan balances will stabilize and that pre-provision earnings will begin to improve in 2011. Economic and regulatory uncertainty posed obvious challenges, but those same forces are also creating attractive opportunities for Capital One. Many banks are reeling from the financial crisis and from poorly performing assets generated over the last decade. Others are struggling to address revenue and growth challenges resulting from legislative and regulatory reform and the new level playing fields that they create. As a result, we’re seeing reduced competition in some of our markets. We're also seeing opportunities to acquire asset portfolios, origination platforms or banks.
And with relatively few well-positioned buyers, the potential for attractively priced deals increases. We remain well positioned to take advantage of emerging opportunities and to deliver significant shareholder value over the long term. We’ve weathered the recession relatively well. We've been able to absorb the existing and anticipated CARD Act impacts with our Domestic Card revenue model and business model largely intact. Credit losses are returning to more normal levels, and we have a strong brand and advantage customer access. 
In our Commercial and Consumer Banking businesses, we have great market positions in some of the best local markets in the country. We can grow commercial relationships and loans as the commercial credit cycle improves. And we can continue to grow deposits with disciplined pricing. 
Our Domestic Card business has delivered industry-leading profitability and returns through cycles including the most significant recession in generations. We believe that our Domestic Card business is well positioned to compete on the new level playing field that's created by the CARD Act.
Our balance sheet remains strong and resilient. We're well positioned for the current interest rate environment and ready to respond quickly as interest rates change. We have ample and resilient deposit funding. And TCE is strong and growing. Now Gary and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?"

So we feel a real stability in our outlook, for our revenue margin in Card. In fact, we've been talking about 15% for a long time now, and it looks like the business is very sure-footedly driving toward that destination. So I don't think in the Card business we're going to have financial offsets, any more financial offset. The big offset, Bruce, that awaits us, hopefully, in the Card business is the opportunities from the level playing field. And really my number-one haunt by far in this anchor-tenant business of Capital One was the -- how more and more we were -- felt like we had an arm and a leg tied behind our back because of pulling out of marketing in whole parts of the business and choosing not to do some of the practice our competitors were doing. So I think that, that represents a very substantial opportunity, but it also needs demand to accommodate that. So again, that is something we're very optimistic about. But I think -- so on the Card side, what we feel really good about is that we're headed for a destination of a revenue margin that is only a touch down from the kind of basic revenue margin level that we had in the years prior to the recession, with a much better competitive environment. And now we just need a little accommodation by the consumer. I do want to say that we got to be careful what we wish for, because frankly, the very same thing that is causing the weak demand, which is consumer deleveraging, is, of course, leading to the consumers to be paying down their debt. And frankly, while I and you would love to see demand pick up, something tells me in my gut we're probably better served by consumers making this choice. And really -- and that's the biggest driver of why credit has really, I think, outperformed the economy during this period of time. On the banking side, Bruce, with respect to the Durbin Amendment, I mean of course for Capital One, this is a much smaller stakes issue, just because of the relatively smaller size of our banking business. I know some competitors are stepping up to make a series of financial moves to accommodate some of these changes. I think we're more in -- we’re assessing the situation, but that's just not something that has a really big impact on Capital One. I think we feel comfortable that our banking business, our banking strategy, is going to be able to proceed."

We know what's going to be happening to the card margin. Again, as Rich said, we've now got a full quarter impact of the change in overlimit fee regulations. We're going to start seeing the impact of the reasonable proportional fees guidance on our late fees. That's going to be driving our margin down. We've talked about the fact that we expect marketing to go up from these currently depressed levels. Exactly how much, it’s kind of hard to say. And we also know that with continued high levels of charge-offs and run-offs in our business, even if we are able to identify everything else correctly, we know there's going to be some decline in average loan balances for the next couple of quarters as well. So that's why the trend in pre-provision between now and the end of the year is pretty clear, because all of the factors are pretty obvious to us, and they're starting to play through. Our comment that we expect that you will see through the course of 2011 a path towards more normalized earnings means that we’ll get to our longer-term revenue margin. We will have less pressure on loan balances coming from reduced levels of charge-offs. We will obviously calibrate our marketing, as Rich said, to the opportunities we have to grow. And so it's kind of hard today to say where we will be in the middle of 2011. A lot of that's going to be around marketing opportunities and growth opportunities, but most of the other factors by then will have played through. Hopefully, we'll continue towards more normal loss levels. And that's why we say the trend is going to be down in pre-provision over the next couple of quarters. even though provision may be cushioning that. And then 2011 is when we should start to see the fundamentals really more clearly."

We don't think we've really established a new run rate this quarter. About 2/3 of the increase were onetime items. We had a litigation reserve not related to rep and warranty. We had an accrual for some recently passed Canadian tax legislation and so forth. So that's what's affected this quarter. We think that you should really kind of take a look at the first half of 2010 as a whole. That's probably your better guide to run-rate expenses. And again, as we've said all through the year, OpEx in the year probably not materially different from where it was last year. Effectively, we’re getting the benefit of some run-rate efficiencies in some of our businesses, and we're reinvesting that in ongoing infrastructure and -- to try and improve our ability to serve our customers and build our returns in many of our business lines. So those are the onetimers there. Obviously noninterest expense will probably be more impacted going forward by whatever happens to marketing, because I believe operating expenses will be relatively stable. With respect to the rep and warranty reserve, David, again, we increased our reserve largely because we had extended the time frame over which we estimate our rep- and warranty-related claims and losses for the various kinds of claimants we have. And wherever we could, we’ve tried to estimate the ultimate liability over the remaining life of these exposures. Now the vast majority of repurchase requests we've gotten in the past year come from two groups: one is the GSEs, and the other are loans that are wrapped by some of the monoline bond insurers. With respect to the GSEs, they've got some reasonably predictable processes for identifying, submitting and settling claims. And provided that their past behavior is similar to the future, we think we have recognized most of our exposure. There could be some kind of quarterly variability due to ongoing adjustments, but only if there's a material change in the GSEs' behavior or if we had a material change in our estimate of future lifetime defaults is that number likely to change materially. The repurchased liabilities associated with monoline bond insurers and other potential claimants are less predictable and subject to a wider range of potential outcomes where we can. We have predicted those now or estimated those on a life-of-loan basis, but there's a little more unpredictability there. And so that is more likely to drive future variability, but for right now we feel we've got a very healthy reserve."

And so we're doing mostly the same thing we used to do, and it's having the same kind of pound-for-pound success that it did before. And I'm very happy about that. Another positive is just the overall kind of credit environment. That's the context in which we originate and, of course, we'll have to see what the credit performance on our brand-new originations is. But I think everything we see suggests we're pretty confident on the credit side. The biggest negative, of course, is demand itself, as we talked about. And the other thing that's not a negative in the last three months, but I put a yellow flag of caution out there, is that the pricing -- kind of every quarter I talk about pricing in the marketplace and where it's going. We, because of the CARD Act and because of some of the practices of repricing that are no longer allowed, it’s been a very important -- because fundamentally, the industry is not going to be able to do retroactive repricing. It's very important that go-to rates essentially be destination long-term go-to rates. And so we've been saying for some time, keep an eye out, what competitors are doing vis-a-vis these go-to rates. And predictably, they started rising both in absolute and on an interest-rate adjusted basis over the period preceding the February implementation of the CARD Act and rose for a little bit after that. But they have sort of flattened out in the last few months. And for us, it's not an absolute thing. Are they at the destination they need to be? Or are they not? They are in some pockets, and they’re not in some pockets. Now there’s a new sort of overlay that has come into the decisions about pricing that we all make in the marketplace. And that is that the Fed's new rule, their implementation of this August rule-making that they did, requires a revaluation of APRs that were repriced in the 15 months prior to the imposition of the CARD Act prohibition on retroactive repricing. And the new rules require issuers to compare the pricing of their existing accounts that were repriced to similar accounts that they offer to new customers today. So I think the stakes of where those go-to rates are have been actually raised by that Fed ruling. And so, in other words, issuers’ go-to rates need to be very consistent with what their existing portfolio rates are. So that's a little yellow flag. We'll keep an eye on that. Overall by far, though, the big flag that we're watching is demand itself. That's the thing we worry about. We're comforted by the flipside benefits of weak demand, as I mentioned earlier. But we’re -- we feel very good about the ability to continue originating with our business model and with the kind of returns and performance that we've had in the past."

I think if you kind of pull away up here, the -- it's not surprising with the game changing, dislocation in financial services from both the Great Recession and the great legislation, if you will, that there would be not only a larger number of sort of businesses and parts of businesses for sale but also potentially ones that wouldn't normally ever come up in the normal course of a robust kind of economy. So it's certainly not lost on us. In fact, the central part of how we think, that one of the rewards of coming out of the tsunami in one piece and ready for business on the other side is that we could be one of a relatively small number of potential buyers looking at these thing. So we are actually looking across the landscape here. And that landscape, I know most people tend to think of banks focusing on buying banks. I mean, we're keeping an eye on that. But I think some of the possibly more interesting opportunities exist in asset acquisitions, pieces of businesses or growth platforms that are being sold by other companies, as well as just distressed banks themselves. So I was more making a philosophical point that the very same conditions that lead to weakness in the banking industry exacerbate the weakness for all the weak players. So that I think in some sense a little bit of the silver lining of industry weakness is both the credit benefits I mentioned earlier as well as probably hastening to some extent the sale of businesses or pieces of businesses. So we’re just -- we've been talking about this for quite a long time. You noticed since the entire recession began, we've done exactly one acquisition, which was Chevy Chase. So we're being very, very selective, and we just, though, definitely are looking at these opportunity."

I think there are several things I want to say about the Auto business. First of all, the Auto business in many ways was one of the first businesses to really feel the pressure of the oncoming recession and was kind of the first one to turn the corner out of it. And it’s both causally linked to the same thing, and that is because that business has basically less than a 2 1/2-year average life for the assets. The fortunes of the business definitionally ride on the choices you made in the last couple of years. So going into the downturn, one was dealing with a portfolio almost entirely originated in the pre-recession period. Those tend not to be very good. And now the, as Gary mentioned, well over half of our portfolio, the significant majority, in many ways, of our portfolio, is business-originated with eyes wide open during the downturn. Now that is accentuated in Capital One's case by the dramatic repositioning of the business that we engineered at the start of 2008, where if you remember, we dialed back to an origination run rate that was down from -- it was at its highest point, $13 billion in annual originations down to about $5.5 billion running rate. But it wasn't just dial back randomly. This was kind of dialing back to the highest ground of the best parts of the business for us, the best relationships and a lot of other things, with very tight credit cuts along the way. This portfolio has performed extremely well, and it is, of course, now a growing part of our entire business. So along the way, as we've really stabilized that business and are very pleased with our performance, we are now growing originations, and that will continue. As Gary mentioned, because the back, the kind of the -- that goes against the run-off of the portfolio from the old $13 billion level of origination. So Auto won't feel like a growth business, but within what we're doing, it’s a -- the originations are growing. We feel really good about our opportunities there. AmeriCredit, that certainly was a blockbuster. I can't say I woke up today and say, “I bet you AmeriCredit’s going to sell itself to General Motors.” But as we’ve tried to get our head around that one, I think I want to be a little cautious in declaring the impact, but I guess -- I would probably guess in the near term, we don't expect to see a significant impact on our business. I mean, AmeriCredit’s already stated that it's trying to continue doing its business as usual. And it's already, of course, in a subvention relationship with General Motors already. I think, though, in the longer-term, we certainly believe that depository institutions will continue to be advantaged in the Auto lending space. And the GM acquisition of AmeriCredit likely will open up opportunities in the non-GM business that AmeriCredit currently does. Now that could trade off with some loss in current GM business for us. But I think all in all, we think this will be probably not a huge amount of impact or may actually represent a positive for Capital One."

When did they sort of hit the bottom, if you will, of sort of their earnings? And when did they really start growing and growing earnings? The Card business, we've talked about -- Card business, it’s -- the reduction in -- Card business has to go through the reduction in revenue margin. And that's the most, I mean, that's really not a cyclical thing. That's the implementation of the CARD Act driving that. That, by sort of year end to beginning of '11, will be at its equilibrium point. And then we -- so that would represent kind of the low point of sort of earnings for the Card business. And then from there, I think, now -- well, in terms of core earnings of the business, from there you have growth opportunities and the significant benefit of charge-offs coming down. Now when allowance is released is the slight wild card there. But I think, Henry, in that business, I don't know if -- I mean, whether you call it a growth machine, I think it's certainly an earnings machine with the opportunity to gain share. And it's getting close to sort of its low point in terms of its earnings, and it's very well positioned for success. The Auto business passed its low point a while ago and is powering to a better place. It right now is enjoying a lot of allowance release. Its natural earnings will be down from where they are right now, but I think that's in a very -- in a position to be generating a lot of positive return here. In our Commercial business, the -- it's funny, one would think that Commercial, it's hard to sort of grow that business. If you look at our Commercial, it's been surprisingly stable in terms of outstandings and revenues, given how much of a decline there's been in the Commercial business. But I think that there is a upside for growth in the business and in earnings that might be a little bit more than meets the eye. And we’re at a -- the issue here is we’re at a historic low in utilization rates for commercial credit facilities. And so we've been growing our total loan commitments, for example, 10% over the last 12 months, but outstanding loans have stayed essentially flat because of how low utilizations are. So I think there's kind of built-in growth, not dramatic, but there's kind of inherently built-in growth in that business without going out and having to beat out other competitors for new originations. We also have very low share in the Washington, D.C., metro area, where we have a huge branch presence. So we certainly plan on building it there. And we're investing in some target segments, like of our C&I business, like Energy and Healthcare, that have performed very well through the downturn, and I think represents a growth opportunity for ourselves. In the Mortgage business, if you get past the -- I mean, most of our portfolio is really toxic mortgages that have come along with the acquisitions. All that is running off. But we're just really starting to build a Mortgage Origination business where we think over the next number of years we will get our fair share in our existing branch markets, and that represents, actually, a pretty nice thrust for the company. So if you find me talking so optimistically here, I kind of speak for 22 years of building Capital One. Yes, we are at a time right now where there's been a lot of turmoil, and everyone's adjusting to legislation. But when I look ahead, I see the most level playing field and certainly the best bone structure that Capital One has ever had and relative competitive position to be successful here. We just need to ride through the revenue margin running its course in the Card business, the charge-offs getting back to more normal levels and demand picking up. These are all things that I feel very confident. I can't tell you exact timing other than the revenue margin, but I'm comfortable they're going to happen. And I think on the other side of this is a very well-positioned company that frankly has a lot of advantages over a number of our regional bank competitors."

First of all, it's a disappointment to me, frankly, that our performance is kind of pound for pound is similar to what it was a few years ago, because the competition is massively down from what it was before. So I think it’s testament to just how weak the demand is. So I mean, so I want to kind of pile on to your point here. Card competition, first of all, was dramatic drop. We witnessed about a 75% drop in mail volume, for example, from the pre-recession levels. But to your point, volume now is only about 35% to 40% off of the older highs. So we're definitely seeing competition picking up in the Card business as, frankly, we're seeing in all of the businesses. So I think competition across all the businesses we're in is less than it was as its most intense time, Moshe.

Definitely, Moshe, there's an awful lot of competition in the transactor space in particular, because the Rewards business, frankly, was the top performer during the downturn. And that's not lost on any of the other players there. So I think that -- so I don't want to at all declare that we see -- we see a level playing field. We don't see an open playing field, and I think that's an important difference."

It was really our point that, and I've been saying for some time now, we certainly think that one of the most important thing that's going to happen with the Great Recession is a tremendous amount of dislocation of competitors out there. So, Moshe, we have been looking at the gamut. I mean, things right in our core businesses that where we have distressed competitors, we have been looking at those, haven't bought any of those things yet. We've looked in some cases at growth platforms that would allow extension into a new business area that we've always been interested in, but didn't necessarily have an easy access to that. And we've been looking at distressed institutions on the banking side. The point I want to make here is that there are, I think, three aspects about the current acquisition environment that make it better than usual: one is that you have more and different types of things getting stirred up and things that might otherwise not be stirred up; secondly, there is profoundly less competition; and thirdly, is really result of the second one, and I forgot to mention it the first time I was talking about it. What interests us here is the chance to buy properties with significantly better pricing than would normally exist in the frenzied kind of acquisition environment that usually exists. Now again, we've been looking for years during this thing and have exactly one acquisition to show for it. So hopefully, you draw from that the discipline that we have. But we certainly have noticed as part of this process that the sort of market-clearing prices that things sort of go at is definitely lower than the frenzied days that we've seen in the past. So given that, I think that we want to make sure that we take a good look at what's out there."

Let's go straight into the income statement on Slide 3. Capital One earned $608 million or $1.33 per share in the second quarter, with all of our businesses posting a profit. As we for",1383,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon to everyone listening in to the call. Let's go straight into the income statement on Slide 3. Capital One earned $608 million or $1.33 per share in the second quarter, with all of our businesses posting a profit. As we foreshadowed in last quarter's call, lower provision expense more than offset the expected decline in pre-provision earnings. 
Total revenue declined $385 million or 9%. As net interest margin was stable, the revenue decline was driven by a 4.5% decline in average loans and a decrease in noninterest income. The single largest driver of the decline in noninterest income was the absence of the first quarter's mortgage I/O bond sale. In addition, noninterest income was impacted by significantly fewer security sales and a full quarter impact of the reduction in overlimit fees resulting from the move to opt-in mandated under the CARD law.
Marketing expenses rose somewhat from seasonally low first quarter levels and will likely continue to rise in the second half of the year, though the magnitude of the increase will depend on the opportunities for growth. Operating expenses increased $114 million in the quarter, which included a number of onetime items, including legal reserves and a tax accrual due the legislative changes in Canada. We expect near-term operating expenses to moderate a bit, with second half expenses approximating the level realized in the first half of the year.
Credit performance continues to improve, and as a result, provision expense declined 51% or $755 million in the quarter. Charge-offs declined in each of our businesses, yielding a $301 million aggregate improvement in the quarter. Also benefiting provision expense was the release of just over $1 billion of allowance, up from a $566 million release in the prior quarter. More on the allowance in a moment. 
One final item of note on the income statement was a $404 million rep and warranty expense, approximately 3/4 of which was recorded in discontinued operations. Wherever possible we have now incorporated probable future losses on an expected life-of-loan basis. The single biggest impact of this change was on GSE loans, which are now fully accounted for on this basis. 
Turning to Slide 4, I'll discuss the balance sheet. Total ending loans declined by $3 billion or 2% in the quarter, with more than all of the decline accounted for by run-off portfolios and elevated levels in charge-offs. Our Domestic Card portfolio was down $1.6 billion in the quarter or 3%, as $1.3 billion of charge-offs and $1.2 billion of run-off of our Installment Loan portfolio more than offset gross originations in the quarter. With increasing quarterly origination of new accounts, improving charge-offs and a gradually moderating impact of run-off, we expect Domestic Card balances to be approaching their lows. 
The Commercial Banking Loan portfolio continues to hover around $30 billion, although we did have an approximately $500 million increase in unfunded commitments for our Commercial customers in the quarter. We expect to see modest growth in this portfolio over the balance of the year. 
The Consumer Banking portfolio decreased $1 billion in the quarter, about 2/3 of which was caused by the continued decline in our run-off Mortgage portfolio. Auto Finance outstandings are approaching an equilibrium where our level of new originations will equal the run-off of prior originations for that business. 
We grew our Securities portfolio by $1.1 billion in the quarter, with the bulk of growth in agency mortgage-backs and floating rate asset-backed securities. The portfolio continues to perform well, and our unrealized gain position is now $930 million, up from $482 million at the end of the first quarter.
On the liability side, we continue to leverage our Commercial and Consumer Banking platforms to take advantage of strong demand for deposits. By slopping out maturing securitizations liabilities and time deposits into lower-priced liquid deposits, we drove down our total cost of funds by another seven basis points in the quarter. 
Securitization liability was down $5 billion in the quarter, and we expect it to end 2010 at $27 billion, a 43% decline from year-end 2009. Our loan-to-deposit ratio is now 1.08, the lowest point in our company's history.
As we turn to Slide 5, I'll discuss the allowance. The continuing improvement in credit drove a reduction in allowance balances in all of our businesses in the second quarter, totaling $953 million for the company overall. $665 million of the reduction was in the Card business, the vast majority of which was in Domestic Card. This allowance release largely reflects the better-than-expected loss performance in our portfolio during the second quarter and a lower level of delinquencies. In addition, the $2 billion of lower-period end loans requires lower allowance, all else being equal. 
Despite the reduction in allowance, you'll note that our Domestic Card allowances as a percent of delinquencies remained stable in the quarter. This reflects the fact that while delinquencies are improving, we are not assuming an improvement in the expected losses per delinquent dollar for the sake of the allowance. 
We continue to see strong credit performance in Auto Finance, with charge-offs down $41 million quarter-over-quarter to just 2.09%. This performance, coupled with a modest reduction in outstandings, led to $158 million reduction in allowance for that business, which accounts for 2/3 of the Consumer Banking allowance release. 
After many quarters of building allowance in our Commercial Banking segment, we released $33 million of allowance in the second quarter. This release was a result of both improving recent risk trends as well as further segmentation in our methodology to reflect different credit performance within segments of the business. Despite this release, allowance as a percent of nonperforming loans rose in the quarter and now stands at 149%. Rich will talk more about commercial credit in a moment.
All told, despite the $953 million allowance release, we ended the second quarter with an allowance balance of $6.8 billion or 5.35% coverage on our Loan portfolio. It's reasonable to assume that our total allowance levels will likely continue to decline over the course of the rest of the year, given the historically high levels of coverage and underlying credit trends we are experiencing. 
I'll now provide color on our capital ratios as we turn to Slide 6. Our tangible-common-equity-to-tangible-managed-assets ratio increased 60 basis points in the quarter to 6.1%, nearly rebounding to the levels prior to the implementation of FAS 167. This increase in TCE was primarily driven by strong earnings in the quarter and an improvement in OCI. 
Taking into account the allowance, our total risk-bearing capacity is now greater than it was at any point in 2009. This increase in our risk-bearing capacity has been accompanied by a decrease in risk with ongoing improvement in credit performance. 
Strong earnings and reduced loan balances in the quarter also helped our Tier 1 ratios, despite the continued onboarding of risk-weighted assets, due to the reduction in securitization levels.
We still expect a declining trend in our Tier 1 ratios, however, over the near term. Rather than reflecting any fundamental weakness, this declining trend will be caused by two factors: first, the phased-in onboarding of remaining securitized assets, which begins in the third quarter of this year, will increase the denominator; second, in the first quarter of 2011, we expect a decrease in the portion of our currently elevated DTA to qualify as Tier 1 capital. 
However, our Tier 1 ratios are and will continue to remain comfortably above well-capitalized levels. Once the phase-in period is complete in early 2011 and loss level has normalized further, the pro-cyclical Tier 1 ratios should more than proportionately follow the fundamental upward trajectory of TCE. 
Before I pass the call over to Rich, I'd like to note that the recent enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act may have an impact on the Tier 1 treatment of our approximately $3.5 billion of trust preferred securities and provides for a phase-in period expected to begin in 2013.
Given the potential change in capital treatment of these securities, we anticipate that we will determine whether to exercise our rights to redeem our trust-preferred securities at or near the beginning of the phase-in period. We look forward to receiving clarity on these issues through rule-making and other regulatory action. With that, I'll pass it over to Rich.

Modest funding cost improvements were offset by a modest decline in asset yields. Asset yield decreased as a result of a greater mix of investment securities versus loans in the quarter. The decline in our revenue margin resulted mostly from the absence of onetime benefits we experienced in the first quarter, as Gary just discussed, as well as the expected decline in our Domestic Card business revenue margin. 
Second quarter Domestic Card revenue margin declined 48 basis points to 16.6% as the expectations we described last quarter began to play out. Two factors caused the second quarter decline: overlimit fee revenues declined as expected, with the full quarter effect of the CARD Act opt-in requirement; and the revenue benefit from improving credit performance was smaller in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter. In the second quarter, improving credit performance continued to increase the expected collectability of finance charge and fee billings, but the favorable impact on revenue diminished somewhat from elevated first quarter levels.
Looking forward, we expect that Domestic Card revenue margin will continue to decline over the next few quarters. We still expect that quarterly Domestic Card revenue margin will be around 15% by the end of 2010 or early 2011, as the major impact of the CARD Act and cyclical forces are fully absorbed. 
While the overlimit fee impact has largely run its course, we expect that three factors will continue to pressure revenue margin with each factor driving about 1/3 of the expected decline. As higher margin loan balances charge off or pay down, we expect that they will be partially replaced by new originations with lower go-to and promotional rates, which will result in lower net interest margin. 
The credit-related benefit to revenue we experienced in the first and second quarters is likely to diminish further. Because we were able to recognize more of the finance charge and fees we billed in the first two quarters of the year, we'll have a smaller backlog of prior billings that could be recognized in future quarters as credit improves.
And our assumptions about declining late fee revenues are essentially unchanged by the Fed's final rules on reasonable and proportional late fee levels scheduled to go into effect on August 22. We expect that the third quarter Domestic Card revenue margin will show a partial quarter effect from reduced late fees and that the fourth quarter revenue margin will show the full quarter run-rate effect of this new regulation. Longer term, the revenue margin may drift downward modestly as credit continues to improve toward more normal levels. We continue to expect that Domestic Card revenue margin will remain at a level consistent with very healthy overall returns for the Card business.
As you can see on Slide 8, loan balances continue to decline across our businesses. Expected run-off continues in our Installment Loan portfolio in Domestic Card, our Mortgage portfolio in Consumer Banking and our Small Ticket CRE portfolio in Commercial Banking. Overall consumer demand remains week, despite emerging pockets of improving demand and origination growth in our Domestic Card and Auto Finance business. 
In our Commercial Banking business, we've increased lending and loan commitments, but utilization of committed lines remains low by historical standards, resulting in stable outstanding commercial loan balances.
The pace of balance declines is slowing as charge-off improve and expected run-off abates somewhat. We expect that loan balances will find a bottom and stabilize over the next several quarters. We believe balances will begin to grow modestly in 2011. The timing and pace of expected growth remains uncertain because the timing and pace of any rebound in consumer and commercial demand remains uncertain. While we remain well positioned to gain share in our Domestic Card business and to grow modestly in our Commercial Banking business, the overall level of growth will be dependent upon broader trends in overall consumer and commercial demand. 
In the face of uncertain consumer demand, we will rigorously manage credit underwriting and margins. We will work backwards from the goal of building businesses with attractive, sustainable and resilient economics. And we will take whatever growth the market will give us, rather than misguided efforts to generate growth that are either too risky or uneconomic.
Slide 9 shows consumer credit trends. Charge-offs and delinquencies improved across our Consumer businesses, with the exception of an expected seasonal uptick in Auto delinquencies. These seasonal trends suggest that Auto charge-off rate will increase in the second half of 2010, but Auto Finance credit remains exceptionally strong with significant improvements as compared to the prior year. 
While our consumer credit results improved in the quarter, recent economic data provides a reminder that the overall economic recovery remains fragile. May and June labor market reports were weak, and we continue to see risks in the housing markets as well, as the shadow inventory of homes in foreclosure or with severely delinquent mortgages remain very high. 
Our credit results have continued to improve even as the economic recovery faltered a bit over the last couple of months. As we've discussed for several quarters, our economic assumptions have incorporated a view that economic recovery would be fragile and modest at best. While recent economic trends are consistent with our assumptions, we remain cautious, so underwriting remains tight across our Lending businesses. Credit performance also benefits from the portfolio turnover that comes with a prolonged recession. And consumer deleveraging, by definition, means that consumers are paying down debt rather than spending and borrowing. While this pressures loan growth, it also contributes to the improvement in delinquencies and charge-offs. 
You can see credit trends in our Commercial Banking businesses on Slide 10. Commercial Banking credit results improved in the quarter. In addition to the improvement in charge-off rates and nonperforming asset rates, we experienced a quarter-over-quarter decline in the dollar amount of criticized loans, reflecting stabilization across our Commercial Banking businesses. Largely as a result of improving credit results, our Commercial Banking business posted a profit in the second quarter. 
During the second quarter, we saw some stability return to the CRE market. Leasing activity increased, and vacancies started to decline in New York, where we have our largest commercial real estate exposure. Traditional CRE investors have begun to re-enter the market, providing needed liquidity. And sponsors have been willing to inject new capital into troubled transactions, which has allowed us to rightsize many of our troubled loans.
While commercial credit appears to be stabilizing, we are not quite prepared to call a peak in commercial charge-offs or nonperformers. We believe that the worst is behind us, but we expect a few more quarters of uncertainty and choppiness in commercial charge-offs and nonperformers. 
There's been quite a bit of interest this quarter in our exposure to the Gulf oil spill, given our leading market position in Louisiana. We have very little direct exposure to the most impacted industries, like fishing and tourism, on the Gulf Coast beaches. Our Oil and Gas businesses are well diversified and mostly onshore. As a result, our credit performance has not seen a significant impact from the oil spill. 
Longer term, if the moratorium on deepwater drilling persists, the rigs in the Gulf may be forced to move to other drilling locations. This would not be a good thing for the local economy, as offshore oil and gas drilling provides significant employment along the Gulf Coast. Many of the people, businesses and communities we serve in Louisiana and Texas are facing tremendous challenges from the spill. Just as we did in the aftermath of Katrina, we are committed to serving them and supporting our customers and communities through the cleanup and recovery from this environmental disaster.
I'll close tonight on Slide 11. Capital One is demonstrating considerable resilience through the Great Recession and ongoing legislative and rate regulatory changes. But economic and regulatory uncertainty remains high. While the modest economic recovery continues, the last two months of labor and housing market data showed weakness. Consumer demand remains weak. And while the recently passed regulatory reform law provides some closure, the banking industry now faces the development of hundreds of regulatory rules over the next couple of years to actually implement the new law. 
Our businesses and our business model are relatively less impacted by many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act, as we are a Main Street bank rather than a Wall Street bank. Like all banks, we'll be subject to changing capital requirements that will evolve as U.S. and international regulators work to coordinate the capital aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act on the ongoing Basel III discussions. The CARD Act and the CFPB are the areas of new legislation and regulation that have the most direct impacts on Capital One. We've been discussing the CARD Act for some time now, and we've incorporated the expected impact into our strategies and our outlook. 
The potential impact of the CFPB is impossible to predict precisely, but to the extent that it promotes and preserves a truly level playing field for all banks and consumer lenders, we believe that our underwriting and marketing capabilities as well as our customer practices will continue to be competitive advantages.
Against that backdrop, our near-term and long-term expectations are essentially unchanged from what we articulated a quarter ago. Over the next several quarters, we expect that quarterly pre-provision earnings will decline into 2011. We expect the declining provision expense will cushion the bottom line impact of falling pre-provision earnings. As we move past the early part of 2011, we believe that our path to normalized earnings will become more apparent in our quarterly results. We expect that loan balances will stabilize and that pre-provision earnings will begin to improve in 2011. Economic and regulatory uncertainty posed obvious challenges, but those same forces are also creating attractive opportunities for Capital One. Many banks are reeling from the financial crisis and from poorly performing assets generated over the last decade. Others are struggling to address revenue and growth challenges resulting from legislative and regulatory reform and the new level playing fields that they create. As a result, we’re seeing reduced competition in some of our markets. We're also seeing opportunities to acquire asset portfolios, origination platforms or banks.
And with relatively few well-positioned buyers, the potential for attractively priced deals increases. We remain well positioned to take advantage of emerging opportunities and to deliver significant shareholder value over the long term. We’ve weathered the recession relatively well. We've been able to absorb the existing and anticipated CARD Act impacts with our Domestic Card revenue model and business model largely intact. Credit losses are returning to more normal levels, and we have a strong brand and advantage customer access. 
In our Commercial and Consumer Banking businesses, we have great market positions in some of the best local markets in the country. We can grow commercial relationships and loans as the commercial credit cycle improves. And we can continue to grow deposits with disciplined pricing. 
Our Domestic Card business has delivered industry-leading profitability and returns through cycles including the most significant recession in generations. We believe that our Domestic Card business is well positioned to compete on the new level playing field that's created by the CARD Act.
Our balance sheet remains strong and resilient. We're well positioned for the current interest rate environment and ready to respond quickly as interest rates change. We have ample and resilient deposit funding. And TCE is strong and growing. Now Gary and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?

But certainly from this point on, there's a good chance of seeing some stability in overall loan balances.

So we feel a real stability in our outlook, for our revenue margin in Card. In fact, we've been talking about 15% for a long time now, and it looks like the business is very sure-footedly driving toward that destination. So I don't think in the Card business we're going to have financial offsets, any more financial offset. The big offset, Bruce, that awaits us, hopefully, in the Card business is the opportunities from the level playing field. And really my number-one haunt by far in this anchor-tenant business of Capital One was the -- how more and more we were -- felt like we had an arm and a leg tied behind our back because of pulling out of marketing in whole parts of the business and choosing not to do some of the practice our competitors were doing. So I think that, that represents a very substantial opportunity, but it also needs demand to accommodate that. So again, that is something we're very optimistic about. But I think -- so on the Card side, what we feel really good about is that we're headed for a destination of a revenue margin that is only a touch down from the kind of basic revenue margin level that we had in the years prior to the recession, with a much better competitive environment. And now we just need a little accommodation by the consumer. I do want to say that we got to be careful what we wish for, because frankly, the very same thing that is causing the weak demand, which is consumer deleveraging, is, of course, leading to the consumers to be paying down their debt. And frankly, while I and you would love to see demand pick up, something tells me in my gut we're probably better served by consumers making this choice. And really -- and that's the biggest driver of why credit has really, I think, outperformed the economy during this period of time. On the banking side, Bruce, with respect to the Durbin Amendment, I mean of course for Capital One, this is a much smaller stakes issue, just because of the relatively smaller size of our banking business. I know some competitors are stepping up to make a series of financial moves to accommodate some of these changes. I think we're more in -- we’re assessing the situation, but that's just not something that has a really big impact on Capital One. I think we feel comfortable that our banking business, our banking strategy, is going to be able to proceed.

We know what's going to be happening to the card margin. Again, as Rich said, we've now got a full quarter impact of the change in overlimit fee regulations. We're going to start seeing the impact of the reasonable proportional fees guidance on our late fees. That's going to be driving our margin down. We've talked about the fact that we expect marketing to go up from these currently depressed levels. Exactly how much, it’s kind of hard to say. And we also know that with continued high levels of charge-offs and run-offs in our business, even if we are able to identify everything else correctly, we know there's going to be some decline in average loan balances for the next couple of quarters as well. So that's why the trend in pre-provision between now and the end of the year is pretty clear, because all of the factors are pretty obvious to us, and they're starting to play through. Our comment that we expect that you will see through the course of 2011 a path towards more normalized earnings means that we’ll get to our longer-term revenue margin. We will have less pressure on loan balances coming from reduced levels of charge-offs. We will obviously calibrate our marketing, as Rich said, to the opportunities we have to grow. And so it's kind of hard today to say where we will be in the middle of 2011. A lot of that's going to be around marketing opportunities and growth opportunities, but most of the other factors by then will have played through. Hopefully, we'll continue towards more normal loss levels. And that's why we say the trend is going to be down in pre-provision over the next couple of quarters. even though provision may be cushioning that. And then 2011 is when we should start to see the fundamentals really more clearly.

We don't think we've really established a new run rate this quarter. About 2/3 of the increase were onetime items. We had a litigation reserve not related to rep and warranty. We had an accrual for some recently passed Canadian tax legislation and so forth. So that's what's affected this quarter. We think that you should really kind of take a look at the first half of 2010 as a whole. That's probably your better guide to run-rate expenses. And again, as we've said all through the year, OpEx in the year probably not materially different from where it was last year. Effectively, we’re getting the benefit of some run-rate efficiencies in some of our businesses, and we're reinvesting that in ongoing infrastructure and -- to try and improve our ability to serve our customers and build our returns in many of our business lines. So those are the onetimers there. Obviously noninterest expense will probably be more impacted going forward by whatever happens to marketing, because I believe operating expenses will be relatively stable. With respect to the rep and warranty reserve, David, again, we increased our reserve largely because we had extended the time frame over which we estimate our rep- and warranty-related claims and losses for the various kinds of claimants we have. And wherever we could, we’ve tried to estimate the ultimate liability over the remaining life of these exposures. Now the vast majority of repurchase requests we've gotten in the past year come from two groups: one is the GSEs, and the other are loans that are wrapped by some of the monoline bond insurers. With respect to the GSEs, they've got some reasonably predictable processes for identifying, submitting and settling claims. And provided that their past behavior is similar to the future, we think we have recognized most of our exposure. There could be some kind of quarterly variability due to ongoing adjustments, but only if there's a material change in the GSEs' behavior or if we had a material change in our estimate of future lifetime defaults is that number likely to change materially. The repurchased liabilities associated with monoline bond insurers and other potential claimants are less predictable and subject to a wider range of potential outcomes where we can. We have predicted those now or estimated those on a life-of-loan basis, but there's a little more unpredictability there. And so that is more likely to drive future variability, but for right now we feel we've got a very healthy reserve.

And so we're doing mostly the same thing we used to do, and it's having the same kind of pound-for-pound success that it did before. And I'm very happy about that. Another positive is just the overall kind of credit environment. That's the context in which we originate and, of course, we'll have to see what the credit performance on our brand-new originations is. But I think everything we see suggests we're pretty confident on the credit side. The biggest negative, of course, is demand itself, as we talked about. And the other thing that's not a negative in the last three months, but I put a yellow flag of caution out there, is that the pricing -- kind of every quarter I talk about pricing in the marketplace and where it's going. We, because of the CARD Act and because of some of the practices of repricing that are no longer allowed, it’s been a very important -- because fundamentally, the industry is not going to be able to do retroactive repricing. It's very important that go-to rates essentially be destination long-term go-to rates. And so we've been saying for some time, keep an eye out, what competitors are doing vis-a-vis these go-to rates. And predictably, they started rising both in absolute and on an interest-rate adjusted basis over the period preceding the February implementation of the CARD Act and rose for a little bit after that. But they have sort of flattened out in the last few months. And for us, it's not an absolute thing. Are they at the destination they need to be? Or are they not? They are in some pockets, and they’re not in some pockets. Now there’s a new sort of overlay that has come into the decisions about pricing that we all make in the marketplace. And that is that the Fed's new rule, their implementation of this August rule-making that they did, requires a revaluation of APRs that were repriced in the 15 months prior to the imposition of the CARD Act prohibition on retroactive repricing. And the new rules require issuers to compare the pricing of their existing accounts that were repriced to similar accounts that they offer to new customers today. So I think the stakes of where those go-to rates are have been actually raised by that Fed ruling. And so, in other words, issuers’ go-to rates need to be very consistent with what their existing portfolio rates are. So that's a little yellow flag. We'll keep an eye on that. Overall by far, though, the big flag that we're watching is demand itself. That's the thing we worry about. We're comforted by the flipside benefits of weak demand, as I mentioned earlier. But we’re -- we feel very good about the ability to continue originating with our business model and with the kind of returns and performance that we've had in the past.

I think if you kind of pull away up here, the -- it's not surprising with the game changing, dislocation in financial services from both the Great Recession and the great legislation, if you will, that there would be not only a larger number of sort of businesses and parts of businesses for sale but also potentially ones that wouldn't normally ever come up in the normal course of a robust kind of economy. So it's certainly not lost on us. In fact, the central part of how we think, that one of the rewards of coming out of the tsunami in one piece and ready for business on the other side is that we could be one of a relatively small number of potential buyers looking at these thing. So we are actually looking across the landscape here. And that landscape, I know most people tend to think of banks focusing on buying banks. I mean, we're keeping an eye on that. But I think some of the possibly more interesting opportunities exist in asset acquisitions, pieces of businesses or growth platforms that are being sold by other companies, as well as just distressed banks themselves. So I was more making a philosophical point that the very same conditions that lead to weakness in the banking industry exacerbate the weakness for all the weak players. So that I think in some sense a little bit of the silver lining of industry weakness is both the credit benefits I mentioned earlier as well as probably hastening to some extent the sale of businesses or pieces of businesses. So we’re just -- we've been talking about this for quite a long time. You noticed since the entire recession began, we've done exactly one acquisition, which was Chevy Chase. So we're being very, very selective, and we just, though, definitely are looking at these opportunity.

First of all, the Auto business in many ways was one of the first businesses to really feel the pressure of the oncoming recession and was kind of the first one to turn the corner out of it.

The fortunes of the business definitionally ride on the choices you made in the last couple of years.

Now that is accentuated in Capital One's case by the dramatic repositioning of the business that we engineered at the start of 2008, where if you remember, we dialed back to an origination run rate that was down from -- it was at its highest point, $13 billion in annual originations down to about $5.5 billion running rate. But it wasn't just dial back randomly. This was kind of dialing back to the highest ground of the best parts of the business for us, the best relationships and a lot of other things, with very tight credit cuts along the way. This portfolio has performed extremely well, and it is, of course, now a growing part of our entire business. So along the way, as we've really stabilized that business and are very pleased with our performance, we are now growing originations, and that will continue. As Gary mentioned, because the back, the kind of the -- that goes against the run-off of the portfolio from the old $13 billion level of origination. So Auto won't feel like a growth business, but within what we're doing, it’s a -- the originations are growing. We feel really good about our opportunities there. AmeriCredit, that certainly was a blockbuster. I can't say I woke up today and say, “I bet you AmeriCredit’s going to sell itself to General Motors.” But as we’ve tried to get our head around that one, I think I want to be a little cautious in declaring the impact, but I guess -- I would probably guess in the near term, we don't expect to see a significant impact on our business. I mean, AmeriCredit’s already stated that it's trying to continue doing its business as usual. And it's already, of course, in a subvention relationship with General Motors already. I think, though, in the longer-term, we certainly believe that depository institutions will continue to be advantaged in the Auto lending space. And the GM acquisition of AmeriCredit likely will open up opportunities in the non-GM business that AmeriCredit currently does. Now that could trade off with some loss in current GM business for us. But I think all in all, we think this will be probably not a huge amount of impact or may actually represent a positive for Capital One.

So let me think about each of the four businesses, Henry. When did they sort of hit the bottom, if you will, of sort of their earnings? And when did they really start growing and growing earnings? The Card business, we've talked about -- Card busine",729,"Okay. So let me think about each of the four businesses, Henry. When did they sort of hit the bottom, if you will, of sort of their earnings? And when did they really start growing and growing earnings? The Card business, we've talked about -- Card business, it’s -- the reduction in -- Card business has to go through the reduction in revenue margin. And that's the most, I mean, that's really not a cyclical thing. That's the implementation of the CARD Act driving that. That, by sort of year end to beginning of '11, will be at its equilibrium point. And then we -- so that would represent kind of the low point of sort of earnings for the Card business. And then from there, I think, now -- well, in terms of core earnings of the business, from there you have growth opportunities and the significant benefit of charge-offs coming down. Now when allowance is released is the slight wild card there. But I think, Henry, in that business, I don't know if -- I mean, whether you call it a growth machine, I think it's certainly an earnings machine with the opportunity to gain share. And it's getting close to sort of its low point in terms of its earnings, and it's very well positioned for success. The Auto business passed its low point a while ago and is powering to a better place. It right now is enjoying a lot of allowance release. Its natural earnings will be down from where they are right now, but I think that's in a very -- in a position to be generating a lot of positive return here. In our Commercial business, the -- it's funny, one would think that Commercial, it's hard to sort of grow that business. If you look at our Commercial, it's been surprisingly stable in terms of outstandings and revenues, given how much of a decline there's been in the Commercial business. But I think that there is a upside for growth in the business and in earnings that might be a little bit more than meets the eye. And we’re at a -- the issue here is we’re at a historic low in utilization rates for commercial credit facilities. And so we've been growing our total loan commitments, for example, 10% over the last 12 months, but outstanding loans have stayed essentially flat because of how low utilizations are. So I think there's kind of built-in growth, not dramatic, but there's kind of inherently built-in growth in that business without going out and having to beat out other competitors for new originations. We also have very low share in the Washington, D.C., metro area, where we have a huge branch presence. So we certainly plan on building it there. And we're investing in some target segments, like of our C&I business, like Energy and Healthcare, that have performed very well through the downturn, and I think represents a growth opportunity for ourselves. In the Mortgage business, if you get past the -- I mean, most of our portfolio is really toxic mortgages that have come along with the acquisitions. All that is running off. But we're just really starting to build a Mortgage Origination business where we think over the next number of years we will get our fair share in our existing branch markets, and that represents, actually, a pretty nice thrust for the company. So if you find me talking so optimistically here, I kind of speak for 22 years of building Capital One. Yes, we are at a time right now where there's been a lot of turmoil, and everyone's adjusting to legislation. But when I look ahead, I see the most level playing field and certainly the best bone structure that Capital One has ever had and relative competitive position to be successful here. We just need to ride through the revenue margin running its course in the Card business, the charge-offs getting back to more normal levels and demand picking up. These are all things that I feel very confident. I can't tell you exact timing other than the revenue margin, but I'm comfortable they're going to happen. And I think on the other side of this is a very well-positioned company that frankly has a lot of advantages over a number of our regional bank competitors.

First of all, it's a disappointment to me, frankly, that our performance is kind of pound for pound is similar to what it was a few years ago, because the competition is massively down from what it was before. So I think it’s testament to just how weak the demand is. So I mean, so I want to kind of pile on to your point here. Card competition, first of all, was dramatic drop. We witnessed about a 75% drop in mail volume, for example, from the pre-recession levels. But to your point, volume now is only about 35% to 40% off of the older highs. So we're definitely seeing competition picking up in the Card business as, frankly, we're seeing in all of the businesses. So I think competition across all the businesses we're in is less than it was as its most intense time, Moshe. But it is definitely picking up from where it was, and the fact that right now supply and demand are such that we have similar kind of performance that happened a few years ago really kind of underscores how weak the demand is. So we're just very disciplined about making sure that our marketing, that we're going to get paid for that. And it's partly why we're cautious about to suggesting to you how big that's going to be, because really want to validate every solicitation at every point what its return is. Definitely, Moshe, there's an awful lot of competition in the transactor space in particular, because the Rewards business, frankly, was the top performer during the downturn. And that's not lost on any of the other players there. So I think that -- so I don't want to at all declare that we see -- we see a level playing field. We don't see an open playing field, and I think that's an important difference.

It was really our point that, and I've been saying for some time now, we certainly think that one of the most important thing that's going to happen with the Great Recession is a tremendous amount of dislocation of competitors out there. So, Moshe, we have been looking at the gamut. I mean, things right in our core businesses that where we have distressed competitors, we have been looking at those, haven't bought any of those things yet. We've looked in some cases at growth platforms that would allow extension into a new business area that we've always been interested in, but didn't necessarily have an easy access to that. And we've been looking at distressed institutions on the banking side. The point I want to make here is that there are, I think, three aspects about the current acquisition environment that make it better than usual: one is that you have more and different types of things getting stirred up and things that might otherwise not be stirred up; secondly, there is profoundly less competition; and thirdly, is really result of the second one, and I forgot to mention it the first time I was talking about it. What interests us here is the chance to buy properties with significantly better pricing than would normally exist in the frenzied kind of acquisition environment that usually exists. Now again, we've been looking for years during this thing and have exactly one acquisition to show for it. So hopefully, you draw from that the discipline that we have. But we certainly have noticed as part of this process that the sort of market-clearing prices that things sort of go at is definitely lower than the frenzied days that we've seen in the past. So given that, I think that we want to make sure that we take a good look at what's out there.

Let's go straight into the income statement on Slide 3. Capital One earned $608 million or $1.33 per share in the second quarter, with all of our businesses posting a profit. As we for",1383,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon to everyone listening in to the call. Let's go straight into the income statement on Slide 3. Capital One earned $608 million or $1.33 per share in the second quarter, with all of our businesses posting a profit. As we foreshadowed in last quarter's call, lower provision expense more than offset the expected decline in pre-provision earnings. 
Total revenue declined $385 million or 9%. As net interest margin was stable, the revenue decline was driven by a 4.5% decline in average loans and a decrease in noninterest income. The single largest driver of the decline in noninterest income was the absence of the first quarter's mortgage I/O bond sale. In addition, noninterest income was impacted by significantly fewer security sales and a full quarter impact of the reduction in overlimit fees resulting from the move to opt-in mandated under the CARD law.
Marketing expenses rose somewhat from seasonally low first quarter levels and will likely continue to rise in the second half of the year, though the magnitude of the increase will depend on the opportunities for growth. Operating expenses increased $114 million in the quarter, which included a number of onetime items, including legal reserves and a tax accrual due the legislative changes in Canada. We expect near-term operating expenses to moderate a bit, with second half expenses approximating the level realized in the first half of the year.
Credit performance continues to improve, and as a result, provision expense declined 51% or $755 million in the quarter. Charge-offs declined in each of our businesses, yielding a $301 million aggregate improvement in the quarter. Also benefiting provision expense was the release of just over $1 billion of allowance, up from a $566 million release in the prior quarter. More on the allowance in a moment. 
One final item of note on the income statement was a $404 million rep and warranty expense, approximately 3/4 of which was recorded in discontinued operations. Wherever possible we have now incorporated probable future losses on an expected life-of-loan basis. The single biggest impact of this change was on GSE loans, which are now fully accounted for on this basis. 
Turning to Slide 4, I'll discuss the balance sheet. Total ending loans declined by $3 billion or 2% in the quarter, with more than all of the decline accounted for by run-off portfolios and elevated levels in charge-offs. Our Domestic Card portfolio was down $1.6 billion in the quarter or 3%, as $1.3 billion of charge-offs and $1.2 billion of run-off of our Installment Loan portfolio more than offset gross originations in the quarter. With increasing quarterly origination of new accounts, improving charge-offs and a gradually moderating impact of run-off, we expect Domestic Card balances to be approaching their lows. 
The Commercial Banking Loan portfolio continues to hover around $30 billion, although we did have an approximately $500 million increase in unfunded commitments for our Commercial customers in the quarter. We expect to see modest growth in this portfolio over the balance of the year. 
The Consumer Banking portfolio decreased $1 billion in the quarter, about 2/3 of which was caused by the continued decline in our run-off Mortgage portfolio. Auto Finance outstandings are approaching an equilibrium where our level of new originations will equal the run-off of prior originations for that business. 
We grew our Securities portfolio by $1.1 billion in the quarter, with the bulk of growth in agency mortgage-backs and floating rate asset-backed securities. The portfolio continues to perform well, and our unrealized gain position is now $930 million, up from $482 million at the end of the first quarter.
On the liability side, we continue to leverage our Commercial and Consumer Banking platforms to take advantage of strong demand for deposits. By slopping out maturing securitizations liabilities and time deposits into lower-priced liquid deposits, we drove down our total cost of funds by another seven basis points in the quarter. 
Securitization liability was down $5 billion in the quarter, and we expect it to end 2010 at $27 billion, a 43% decline from year-end 2009. Our loan-to-deposit ratio is now 1.08, the lowest point in our company's history.
As we turn to Slide 5, I'll discuss the allowance. The continuing improvement in credit drove a reduction in allowance balances in all of our businesses in the second quarter, totaling $953 million for the company overall. $665 million of the reduction was in the Card business, the vast majority of which was in Domestic Card. This allowance release largely reflects the better-than-expected loss performance in our portfolio during the second quarter and a lower level of delinquencies. In addition, the $2 billion of lower-period end loans requires lower allowance, all else being equal. 
Despite the reduction in allowance, you'll note that our Domestic Card allowances as a percent of delinquencies remained stable in the quarter. This reflects the fact that while delinquencies are improving, we are not assuming an improvement in the expected losses per delinquent dollar for the sake of the allowance. 
We continue to see strong credit performance in Auto Finance, with charge-offs down $41 million quarter-over-quarter to just 2.09%. This performance, coupled with a modest reduction in outstandings, led to $158 million reduction in allowance for that business, which accounts for 2/3 of the Consumer Banking allowance release. 
After many quarters of building allowance in our Commercial Banking segment, we released $33 million of allowance in the second quarter. This release was a result of both improving recent risk trends as well as further segmentation in our methodology to reflect different credit performance within segments of the business. Despite this release, allowance as a percent of nonperforming loans rose in the quarter and now stands at 149%. Rich will talk more about commercial credit in a moment.
All told, despite the $953 million allowance release, we ended the second quarter with an allowance balance of $6.8 billion or 5.35% coverage on our Loan portfolio. It's reasonable to assume that our total allowance levels will likely continue to decline over the course of the rest of the year, given the historically high levels of coverage and underlying credit trends we are experiencing. 
I'll now provide color on our capital ratios as we turn to Slide 6. Our tangible-common-equity-to-tangible-managed-assets ratio increased 60 basis points in the quarter to 6.1%, nearly rebounding to the levels prior to the implementation of FAS 167. This increase in TCE was primarily driven by strong earnings in the quarter and an improvement in OCI. 
Taking into account the allowance, our total risk-bearing capacity is now greater than it was at any point in 2009. This increase in our risk-bearing capacity has been accompanied by a decrease in risk with ongoing improvement in credit performance. 
Strong earnings and reduced loan balances in the quarter also helped our Tier 1 ratios, despite the continued onboarding of risk-weighted assets, due to the reduction in securitization levels.
We still expect a declining trend in our Tier 1 ratios, however, over the near term. Rather than reflecting any fundamental weakness, this declining trend will be caused by two factors: first, the phased-in onboarding of remaining securitized assets, which begins in the third quarter of this year, will increase the denominator; second, in the first quarter of 2011, we expect a decrease in the portion of our currently elevated DTA to qualify as Tier 1 capital. 
However, our Tier 1 ratios are and will continue to remain comfortably above well-capitalized levels. Once the phase-in period is complete in early 2011 and loss level has normalized further, the pro-cyclical Tier 1 ratios should more than proportionately follow the fundamental upward trajectory of TCE. 
Before I pass the call over to Rich, I'd like to note that the recent enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act may have an impact on the Tier 1 treatment of our approximately $3.5 billion of trust preferred securities and provides for a phase-in period expected to begin in 2013.
Given the potential change in capital treatment of these securities, we anticipate that we will determine whether to exercise our rights to redeem our trust-preferred securities at or near the beginning of the phase-in period. We look forward to receiving clarity on these issues through rule-making and other regulatory action. With that, I'll pass it over to Rich."

Modest funding cost improvements were offset by a modest decline in asset yields. Asset yield decreased as the result of a greater mix of investment securities versus loans in the quarter. The decline in our revenue margin resulted mostly from the absence of onetime benefits we experienced in the first quarter, as Gary just discussed, as well as the expected decline in our Domestic Card business revenue margin. 
Second quarter Domestic Card revenue margin declined 48 basis points to 16.6% as the expectations we described last quarter began to play out. Two factors caused the second quarter decline: overlimit fee revenues declined as expected, with the full quarter effect of the CARD Act opt-in requirement; and the revenue benefit from improving credit performance was smaller in the second quarter than it was in the first quarter. In the second quarter, improving credit performance continued to increase the expected collectability of finance charge and fee billings, but the favorable impact on revenue diminished somewhat from elevated first quarter levels.
Looking forward, we expect that Domestic Card revenue margin will continue to decline over the next few quarters. We still expect that quarterly Domestic Card revenue margin will be around 15% by the end of 2010 or early 2011, as the major impact of the CARD Act and cyclical forces are fully absorbed. 
While the overlimit fee impact has largely run its course, we expect that three factors will continue to pressure revenue margin with each factor driving about a third of the expected decline. As higher margin loan balances charge off or pay down, we expect that they will be partially replaced by new originations with lower go-to and promotional rates, which will result in lower net interest margin. 
The credit-related benefit to revenue we experienced in the first and second quarters is likely to diminish further. Because we were able to recognize more of the finance charge and fees we billed in the first two quarters of the year, we'll have a smaller backlog of prior billings that could be recognized in future quarters as credit improves.
And our assumptions about declining late fee revenues are essentially unchanged by the Fed's final rules on reasonable and proportional late fee levels scheduled to go into effect on August 22. We expect that the third quarter Domestic Card revenue margin will show a partial quarter effect from reduced late fees and that the fourth quarter revenue margin will show the full quarter run-rate effect of this new regulation. Longer term, the revenue margin may drift downward modestly as credit continues to improve toward more normal levels. We continue to expect that Domestic Card revenue margin will remain at a level consistent with very healthy overall returns for the Card business.
As you can see on Slide 8, loan balances continue to decline across our businesses. Expected run-off continues in our Installment Loan portfolio in Domestic Card, our Mortgage portfolio in Consumer Banking and our Small Ticket CRE portfolio in Commercial Banking. Overall consumer demand remains week, despite emerging pockets of improving demand and origination growth in our Domestic Card and Auto Finance businesses. 
In our Commercial Banking business, we've increased lending and loan commitments, but utilization of committed lines remains low by historical standards, resulting in stable outstanding commercial loan balances.
The pace of balance declines is slowing as charge-offs improve and expected run-off abates somewhat. We expect that loan balances will find a bottom and stabilize over the next several quarters. We believe balances will begin to grow modestly in 2011. The timing and pace of expected growth remains uncertain because the timing and pace of any rebound in consumer and commercial demand remains uncertain. While we remain well positioned to gain share in our Domestic Card business and to grow modestly in our Commercial Banking business, the overall level of growth will be dependent upon broader trends in overall consumer and commercial demand. 
In the face of uncertain consumer demand, we will rigorously manage credit underwriting and margins. We will work backwards from the goal of building businesses with attractive, sustainable and resilient economics. And we will take whatever growth the market will give us, rather than misguided efforts to generate growth that are either too risky or uneconomic.
Slide 9 shows consumer credit trends. Charge-offs and delinquencies improved across our Consumer businesses, with the exception of an expected seasonal uptick in auto delinquencies. These seasonal trends suggest that auto charge-off rate will increase in the second half of 2010, but Auto Finance credit remains exceptionally strong with significant improvements as compared to the prior year. 
While our consumer credit results improved in the quarter, recent economic data provides a reminder that the overall economic recovery remains fragile. May and June labor market reports were weak, and we continue to see risks in the housing markets as well, as the shadow inventory of homes in foreclosure or with severely delinquent mortgages remain very high. 
Our credit results have continued to improve even as the economic recovery faltered a bit over the last couple of months. As we've discussed for several quarters, our economic assumptions have incorporated a view that economic recovery would be fragile and modest at best. While recent economic trends are consistent with our assumptions, we remain cautious, so underwriting remains tight across our Lending businesses. Credit performance also benefits from the portfolio turnover that comes with a prolonged recession. And consumer deleveraging, by definition, means that consumers are paying down debt rather than spending and borrowing. While this pressures loan growth, it also contributes to the improvement in delinquencies and charge-offs. 
You can see credit trends in our Commercial Banking businesses on Slide 10. Commercial Banking credit results improved in the quarter. In addition to the improvement in charge-off rates and nonperforming asset rates, we experienced a quarter-over-quarter decline in the dollar amount of criticized loans, reflecting stabilization across our Commercial Banking businesses. Largely as a result of improving credit results, our Commercial Banking business posted a profit in the second quarter. 
During the second quarter, we saw some stability return to the CRE market. Leasing activity increased, and vacancies started to decline in New York, where we have our largest commercial real estate exposure. Traditional CRE investors have begun to re-enter the market, providing needed liquidity. And sponsors have been willing to inject new capital into troubled transactions, which has allowed us to rightsize many of our troubled loans.
While commercial credit appears to be stabilizing, we are not quite prepared to call a peak in commercial charge-offs or nonperformers. We believe that the worst is behind us, but we expect a few more quarters of uncertainty and choppiness in commercial charge-offs and nonperformers. 
There's been quite a bit of interest this quarter in our exposure to the Gulf oil spill, given our leading market position in Louisiana. We have very little direct exposure to the most impacted industries, like fishing and tourism, on the Gulf Coast beaches. Our Oil and Gas businesses are well diversified and mostly onshore. As a result, our credit performance has not seen a significant impact from the oil spill. 
Longer term, if the moratorium on deepwater drilling persists, the rigs in the Gulf may be forced to move to other drilling locations. This would not be a good thing for the local economy, as offshore oil and gas drilling provides significant employment along the Gulf Coast. Many of the people, businesses and communities we serve in Louisiana and Texas are facing tremendous challenges from the spill. Just as we did in the aftermath of Katrina, we are committed to serving them and supporting our customers and communities through the cleanup and recovery from this environmental disaster.
I'll close tonight on Slide 11. Capital One is demonstrating considerable resilience through the Great Recession and ongoing legislative and rate regulatory changes. But economic and regulatory uncertainty remains high. While the modest economic recovery continues, the last two months of labor and housing market data show weakness. Consumer demand remains weak. And while the recently passed regulatory reform law provides some closure, the banking industry now faces the development of hundreds of regulatory rules over the next couple of years to actually implement the new law. 
Our businesses and our business model are relatively less impacted by many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act, as we are a Main Street bank rather than a Wall Street bank. Like all banks, we'll be subject to changing capital requirements that will evolve as U.S. and international regulators work to coordinate the capital aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act on the ongoing Basel III discussions. The CARD Act and the CFPB are the areas of new legislation and regulation that have the most direct impacts on Capital One. We've been discussing the CARD Act for some time now, and we've incorporated the expected impacts into our strategies and our outlook. 
The potential impact of the CFPB is impossible to predict precisely, but to the extent that it promotes and preserves a truly level playing field for all banks and consumer lenders, we believe that our underwriting and marketing capabilities as well as our customer practices will continue to be competitive advantages.
Against that backdrop, our near-term and long-term expectations are essentially unchanged from what we articulated a quarter ago. Over the next several quarters, we expect that quarterly pre-provision earnings will decline into 2011. We expect the declining provision expense will cushion the bottom line impact of falling pre-provision earnings. As we move past the early part of 2011, we believe that our path to normalized earnings will become more apparent in our quarterly results. We expect that loan balances will stabilize and that pre-provision earnings will begin to improve in 2011. Economic and regulatory uncertainty posed obvious challenges, but those same forces are also creating attractive opportunities for Capital One. Many banks are reeling from the financial crisis and from poorly performing assets generated over the last decade. Others are struggling to address revenue and growth challenges resulting from legislative and regulatory reform and the new level playing fields that they create. As a result, we’re seeing reduced competition in some of our markets. We're also seeing opportunities to acquire asset portfolios, origination platforms or banks.
And with relatively few well-positioned buyers, the potential for attractively priced deals increases. We remain well positioned to take advantage of emerging opportunities and to deliver significant shareholder value over the long term. We’ve weathered the recession relatively well. We've been able to absorb the existing and anticipated CARD Act impacts with our Domestic Card revenue model and business model largely intact. Credit losses are returning to more normal levels, and we have a strong brand and advantage customer access. 
In our Commercial and Consumer Banking businesses, we have great market positions in some of the best local markets in the country. We can grow commercial relationships and loans as the commercial credit cycle improves. And we can continue to grow deposits with disciplined pricing. 
Our Domestic Card business has delivered industry-leading profitability and returns through cycles including the most significant recession in generations. We believe that our Domestic Card business is well positioned to compete on the new level playing field that's created by the CARD Act.
Our balance sheet remains strong and resilient. We're well positioned for the current interest rate environment and ready to respond quickly as interest rates change. We have ample and resilient deposit funding. And TCE is strong and growing. Now Gary and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?"

So we feel a real stability in our outlook for our revenue margin in Card. In fact, we've been talking about 15% for a long time now, and it looks like the business is very sure-footedly driving toward that destination. So I don't think in the Card business we're going to have financial offsets, any more financial offset. The big offset, Bruce, that awaits us, hopefully, in the Card business is the opportunities from the level playing field. And really my number-one haunt by far in this anchor-tenant business of Capital One was the -- how more and more we were -- felt like we had an arm and a leg tied behind our back because of pulling out of marketing in whole parts of the business and choosing not to do some of the practice our competitors were doing. So I think that, that represents a very substantial opportunity, but it also needs demand to accommodate that. So again, that is something we're very optimistic about. But I think -- so on the Card side, what we feel really good about is that we're headed for a destination of a revenue margin that is only a touch down from the kind of basic revenue margin level that we had in the years prior to the recession, with a much better competitive environment. And now we just need a little accommodation by the consumer. I do want to say that we got to be careful what we wish for, because frankly, the very same thing that is causing the weak demand, which is consumer deleveraging, is, of course, leading to the consumers to be paying down their debt. And frankly, while I and you would love to see demand pick up, something tells me in my gut we're probably better served by consumers making this choice. And really -- and that's the biggest driver of why credit has really, I think, outperformed the economy during this period of time. On the banking side, Bruce, with respect to the Durbin amendment, I mean of course for Capital One, this is a much smaller stakes issue, just because of the relatively smaller size of our banking business. I know some competitors are stepping up to make a series of financial moves to accommodate some of these changes. I think we're more in -- we’re assessing the situation, but that's just not something that has a really big impact on Capital One. I think we feel comfortable that our banking business, our banking strategy, is going to be able to proceed."

We're going to start seeing the impact of the reasonable proportional fees guidance on our late fees. That's going to be driving our margin down. We've talked about the fact that we expect marketing to go up from these currently depressed levels. Exactly how much, it’s kind of hard to say. And we also know that with continued high levels of charge-offs and run-offs in our business, even if we are able to identify everything else correctly, we know there's going to be some decline in average loan balances for the next couple of quarters as well. So that's why the trend in pre-provision between now and the end of the year is pretty clear, because all of the factors are pretty obvious to us, and they're starting to play through. Our comment that we expect that you will see through the course of 2011 a path towards more normalized earnings means that we’ll get to our longer-term revenue margin. We will have less pressure on loan balances coming from reduced levels of charge-offs. We will obviously calibrate our marketing, as Rich said, to the opportunities we have to grow. And so it's kind of hard today to say where we will be in the middle of 2011. A lot of that's going to be around marketing opportunities and growth opportunities, but most of the other factors by then will have played through. Hopefully, we'll continue towards more normal loss levels.

We don't think we've really established a new run rate this quarter. About 2/3 of the increase were onetime items. We had a litigation reserve not related to rep and warranty. We had an accrual for some recently passed Canadian tax legislation and so forth. So that's what's affected this quarter. We think that you should really kind of take a look at the first half of 2010 as a whole. That's probably your better guide to run-rate expenses. And again, as we've said all through the year, OpEx in the year probably not materially different from where it was last year. Effectively, we’re getting the benefit of some run-rate efficiencies in some of our businesses, and we're reinvesting that in ongoing infrastructure and -- to try and improve our ability to serve our customers and build our returns in many of our business lines. So those are the onetimers there. Obviously noninterest expense will probably be more impacted going forward by whatever happens to marketing, because I believe operating expenses will be relatively stable. With respect to the rep and warranty reserve, David, again, we increased our reserve largely because we had extended the time frame over which we estimate our rep- and warranty-related claims and losses for the various kinds of claimants we have. And wherever we could, we’ve tried to estimate the ultimate liability over the remaining life of these exposures. Now the vast majority of repurchase requests we've gotten in the past year come from two groups: one is the GSEs, and the other are loans that are wrapped by some of the monoline bond insurers. With respect to the GSEs, they've got some reasonably predictable processes for identifying, submitting and settling claims. And provided that their past behavior is similar to the future, we think we have recognized most of our exposure. There could be some kind of quarterly variability due to ongoing adjustments, but only if there's a material change in the GSEs' behavior or if we had a material change in our estimate of future lifetime defaults is that number likely to change materially. The repurchased liabilities associated with monoline bond insurers and other potential claimants are less predictable and subject to a wider range of potential outcomes where we can. We have predicted those now or estimated those on a life-of-loan basis, but there's a little more unpredictability there. And so that is more likely to drive future variability, but for right now we feel we've got a very healthy reserve."

And so we're doing mostly the same thing we used to do, and it's having the same kind of pound-for-pound success that it did before. And I'm very happy about that. Another positive is just the overall kind of credit environment. That's the context in which we originate and, of course, we'll have to see what the credit performance on our brand-new originations is. But I think everything we see suggests we're pretty confident on the credit side. The biggest negative, of course, is demand itself, as we talked about. And the other thing that's not a negative in the last three months, but I put a yellow flag of caution out there, is that the pricing -- kind of every quarter I talk about pricing in the marketplace and where it's going. We, because of the CARD Act and because of some of the practices of repricing that are no longer allowed, it’s been a very important -- because fundamentally, the industry is not going to be able to do retroactive repricing. It's very important that go-to rates essentially be destination long-term go-to rates. And so we've been saying for some time, keep an eye out, what competitors are doing vis-a-vis these go-to rates. And predictably, they started rising both in absolute and on an interest-rate adjusted basis over the period preceding the February implementation of the CARD Act and rose for a little bit after that. But they have sort of flattened out in the last few months. And for us, it's not an absolute thing. Are they at the destination they need to be? Or are they not? They are in some pockets, and they’re not in some pockets. Now there’s a new sort of overlay that has come into the decisions about pricing that we all make in the marketplace. And that is that the Fed's new rule, their implementation of this August rule-making that they did, requires a revaluation of APRs that were repriced in the 15 months prior to the imposition of the CARD Act prohibition on retroactive repricing. And the new rules require issuers to compare the pricing of their existing accounts that were repriced to similar accounts that they offer to new customers today. So I think the stakes of where those go-to rates are have been actually raised by that Fed ruling. And so, in other words, issuers’ go-to rates need to be very consistent with what their existing portfolio rates are. So that's a little yellow flag. We'll keep an eye on that. Overall by far, though, the big flag that we're watching is demand itself. That's the thing we worry about. We're comforted by the flipside benefits of weak demand, as I mentioned earlier. But we’re -- we feel very good about the ability to continue originating with our business model and with the kind of returns and performance that we've had in the past."

Can you put a finer point on what we should start to think about opportunities for Capital One over the coming couple of years?

I think if you kind of pull away up here, the -- it's not surprising with the game changing, dislocation in financial services from both the Great Recession and the great legislation, if you will, that there would be not only a larger number of sort of businesses and parts of businesses for sale but also potentially ones that wouldn't normally ever come up in the normal course of a robust kind of economy. So it's certainly not lost on us. In fact, the central part of how we think, that one of the rewards of coming out of the tsunami in one piece and ready for business on the other side is that we could be one of a relatively small number of potential buyers looking at these thing. So we are actually looking across the landscape here. And that landscape, I know most people tend to think of banks focusing on buying banks. I mean, we're keeping an eye on that. But I think some of the possibly more interesting opportunities exist in asset acquisitions, pieces of businesses or growth platforms that are being sold by other companies, as well as just distressed banks themselves. So I was more making a philosophical point that the very same conditions that lead to weakness in the banking industry exacerbate the weakness for all the weak players. So that I think in some sense a little bit of the silver lining of industry weakness is both the credit benefits I mentioned earlier as well as probably hastening to some extent the sale of businesses or pieces of businesses. So we’re just -- we've been talking about this for quite a long time. You noticed since the entire recession began, we've done exactly one acquisition, which was Chevy Chase. So we're being very, very selective, and we just, though, definitely are looking at these opportunity."

I think there are several things I want to say about the Auto business. First of all, the Auto business in many ways was one of the first businesses to really feel the pressure of the oncoming recession and was kind of the first one to turn the corner out of it. And it’s both causally linked to the same thing, and that is because that business has basically less than a 2 1/2-year average life for the assets. The fortunes of the business definitionally ride on the choices you made in the last couple of years. So going into the downturn, one was dealing with a portfolio almost entirely originated in the pre-recession period. Those tend not to be very good. And now the, as Gary mentioned, well over half of our portfolio, the significant majority, in many ways, of our portfolio, is business-originated with eyes wide open during the downturn. Now that is accentuated in Capital One's case by the dramatic repositioning of the business that we engineered at the start of 2008, where if you remember, we dialed back to an origination run rate that was down from -- it was at its highest point, $13 billion in annual originations down to about $5.5 billion running rate. But it wasn't just dial back randomly. This was kind of dialing back to the highest ground of the best parts of the business for us, the best relationships and a lot of other things, with very tight credit cuts along the way. This portfolio has performed extremely well, and it is, of course, now a growing part of our entire business. So along the way, as we've really stabilized that business and are very pleased with our performance, we are now growing originations, and that will continue. As Gary mentioned, because the back, the kind of the -- that goes against the run-off of the portfolio from the old $13 billion level of origination. So Auto won't feel like a growth business, but within what we're doing, it’s a -- the originations are growing. We feel really good about our opportunities there. AmeriCredit, that certainly was a blockbuster. I can't say I woke up today and say, “I bet you AmeriCredit’s going to sell itself to General Motors.” But as we’ve tried to get our head around that one, I think I want to be a little cautious in declaring the impact, but I guess -- I would probably guess in the near term, we don't expect to see a significant impact on our business. I mean, AmeriCredit’s already stated that it's trying to continue doing its business as usual. And it's already, of course, in a subvention relationship with General Motors already. I think, though, in the longer-term, we certainly believe that depository institutions will continue to be advantaged in the Auto lending space. And the GM acquisition of AmeriCredit likely will open up opportunities in the non-GM business that AmeriCredit currently does. Now that could trade off with some loss in current GM business for us. But I think all in all, we think this will be probably not a huge amount of impact or may actually represent a positive for Capital One."

When did they sort of hit the bottom, if you will, of sort of their earnings? And when did they really start growing and growing earnings? The Card business, we've talked about -- Card business, it’s -- the reduction in -- Card business has to go through the reduction in revenue margin. And that's the most, I mean, that's really not a cyclical thing. That's the implementation of the CARD Act driving that. That, by sort of year end to beginning of '11, will be at its equilibrium point. And then we -- so that would represent kind of the low point of sort of earnings for the Card business. And then from there, I think, now -- well, in terms of core earnings of the business, from there you have growth opportunities and the significant benefit of charge-offs coming down. Now when allowance is released is the slight wild card there. But I think, Henry, in that business, I don't know if -- I mean, whether you call it a growth machine, I think it's certainly an earnings machine with the opportunity to gain share. And it's getting close to sort of its low point in terms of its earnings, and it's very well positioned for success. The Auto business passed its low point a while ago and is powering to a better place. It right now is enjoying a lot of allowance release. Its natural earnings will be down from where they are right now, but I think that's in a very -- in a position to be generating a lot of positive return here. In our Commercial business, the -- it's funny, one would think that Commercial, it's hard to sort of grow that business. If you look at our Commercial, it's been surprisingly stable in terms of outstandings and revenues, given how much of a decline there's been in the Commercial business. But I think that there is a upside for growth in the business and in earnings that might be a little bit more than meets the eye. And we’re at a -- the issue here is we’re at a historic low in utilization rates for commercial credit facilities. And so we've been growing our total loan commitments, for example, 10% over the last 12 months, but outstanding loans have stayed essentially flat because of how low utilizations are. So I think there's kind of built-in growth, not dramatic, but there's kind of inherently built-in growth in that business without going out and having to beat out other competitors for new originations. We also have very low share in the Washington, D.C., metro area, where we have a huge branch presence. So we certainly plan on building it there. And we're investing in some target segments, like of our C&I business, like Energy and Healthcare, that have performed very well through the downturn, and I think represents a growth opportunity for ourselves. In the Mortgage business, if you get past the -- I mean, most of our portfolio is really toxic mortgages that have come along with the acquisitions. All that is running off. But we're just really starting to build a Mortgage Origination business where we think over the next number of years we will get our fair share in our existing branch markets, and that represents, actually, a pretty nice thrust for the company. So if you find me talking so optimistically here, I kind of speak for 22 years of building Capital One. Yes, we are at a time right now where there's been a lot of turmoil, and everyone's adjusting to legislation. But when I look ahead, I see the most level playing field and certainly the best bone structure that Capital One has ever had and relative competitive position to be successful here. We just need to ride through the revenue margin running its course in the Card business, the charge-offs getting back to more normal levels and demand picking up. These are all things that I feel very confident. I can't tell you exact timing other than the revenue margin, but I'm comfortable they're going to happen. And I think on the other side of this is a very well-positioned company that frankly has a lot of advantages over a number of our regional bank competitors."

First of all, it's a disappointment to me, frankly, that our performance is kind of pound for pound is similar to what it was a few years ago, because the competition is massively down from what it was before. So I think it’s testament to just how weak the demand is. So I mean, so I want to kind of pile on to your point here. Card competition, first of all, was dramatic drop. We witnessed about a 75% drop in mail volume, for example, from the pre-recession levels. But to your point, volume now is only about 35% to 40% off of the older highs. So we're definitely seeing competition picking up in the Card business as, frankly, we're seeing in all of the businesses. So I think competition across all the businesses we're in is less than it was as its most intense time, Moshe. But it is definitely picking up from where it was, and the fact that right now supply and demand are such that we have similar kind of performance that happened a few years ago really kind of underscores how weak the demand is. So we're just very disciplined about making sure that our marketing, that we're going to get paid for that. And it's partly why we're cautious about to suggesting to you how big that's going to be, because really want to validate every solicitation at every point what its return is. Definitely, Moshe, there's an awful lot of competition in the transactor space in particular, because the Rewards business, frankly, was the top performer during the downturn. And that's not lost on any of the other players there. So I think that -- so I don't want to at all declare that we see -- we see a level playing field. We don't see an open playing field, and I think that's an important difference."

It was really our point that, and I've been saying for some time now, we certainly think that one of the most important thing that's going to happen with the Great Recession is a tremendous amount of dislocation of competitors out there. So, Moshe, we have been looking at the gamut. I mean, things right in our core businesses that where we have distressed competitors, we have been looking at those, haven't bought any of those things yet. We've looked in some cases at growth platforms that would allow extension into a new business area that we've always been interested in, but didn't necessarily have an easy access to that. And we've been looking at distressed institutions on the banking side. The point I want to make here is that there are, I think, three aspects about the current acquisition environment that make it better than usual: one is that you have more and different types of things getting stirred up and things that might otherwise not be stirred up; secondly, there is profoundly less competition; and thirdly, is really result of the second one, and I forgot to mention it the first time I was talking about it. What interests us here is the chance to buy properties with significantly better pricing than would normally exist in the frenzied kind of acquisition environment that usually exists. Now again, we've been looking for years during this thing and have exactly one acquisition to show for it. So hopefully, you draw from that the discipline that we have. But we certainly have noticed as part of this process that the sort of market-clearing prices that things sort of go at is definitely lower than the frenzied days that we've seen in the past. So given that, I think that we want to make sure that we take a good look at what's out there."

This bottom line improvement",2343,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning to everyone listening on the call. Let me go straight to the income statement on Slide 3. Capital One earned $803 million or $1.76 per share in the second quarter, up 32% from the prior quarter. This bottom line improvement was driven by a 6% increase in pre-provision earnings as well as a $189 million after-tax improvement in discontinued operations. 
Revenue increased in the quarter by $112 million or nearly 3% despite a 1.5% decrease in average loans.  Net interest margin improved 12 basis points in the quarter, benefiting from the impact of improving credit and finance charge reversals as well as from lower funding costs. The majority of the improvement in revenue came from noninterest income, as the $16 million of continuing operations rep and warranty expense in the quarter was $79 million less than the prior quarter. I'll provide additional color on our rep and warranty position in a moment.
Noninterest expenses were down slightly in the linked quarter as a modest increase in marketing expense was more than offset by an improvement in operating expenses, which, you may recall, were inflated last quarter due to several nonrecurring items. Finally, underlying credit performance continues to improve across our businesses with charge-offs down almost $200 million in the quarter. Overall provision expense, however, was up $144 million as the third quarter allowance release of $624 million were some $382 million lower than the prior quarter.
Turning to Slide 4. I'll discuss our rep and warranty reserve. There have been several questions about our rep and warranty reserves, and so I'd like to spend some time this morning discussing how we establish reserves and how we think about our risks. First, let me explain how we have approach our rep and warranty reserves conceptually. In the aggregate, we have set up reserves with respect to our entire rep and warranty risk for all probable and reasonably estimable contingencies. We include both litigation and non-litigation rep and warranty risks within this reserves. 
To give you more transparency into how we determine probable and reasonably estimable risk, I'll walk you through how we approach reserves with respect to three groups of counterparties. First, the GSEs [government-sponsored enterprises] as purchasers of whole loans. Second, securitization trust wrapped by monoline bond insurers. And three, everything else. 
To the GSEs as purchasers of whole loans, we have established reserves that represent our best estimate of our total future liability, what I'll call lifetime reserves. We have established these reserves based on: our lifetime loss estimates for the underlying loans we sold to the GSEs; and our history of dealing with the GSEs, in terms of the percentage of loans that turn into repurchase request; and the percentage of those requests that ultimately lead to actual repurchases. To the GSEs, the process involves a loan-by-loan negotiation that has developed a rhythm over time that lends itself nicely to predictive models. That's not to say there's no risk to our GSE reserve number. The GSEs could change their approach to repurchase requests, and our estimate of the lifetime losses for the loans at issue are, of course, subject to macroeconomic trends, such as unemployment and home prices. But we think the risk of large movements within the GSE reserve is relatively small. 
To the monoline bond insurers, we have established lifetime reserves for transactions currently subject to repurchase requests. These reserves are based on our lifetime loss estimates of the loans in the securitization trust at issue and our anticipated buyback rate. Although we've establish lifetime reserves for this group, there is more uncertainty here than with the GSEs. This is because the monoline requests will largely be resolved through the judicial system. If the insurers have been active in suing both mortgage loan originators and our MBS securitizers after making what we believe are aggressive repurchase request. In addition, bond insurers may pursue repurchases in the future with respect to transactions not currently subject to repurchase requests and for which we have not established lifetime reserves. Their decision about whether to make repurchase requests on those transactions may depend on whether they expect to take losses.
Before we discuss the third category on Slide 4, the sold to unwrapped securitizations and other whole loan sales, or the everything-else category, it's helpful to understand why monoline insurers have been very active in the rep and warranty space as compared to investors within the non-wrapped deals. Securitization trust wrapped with bond insurance often allowed the bond insurer to act independently of the investors. Bond insurers typically have indemnity agreements directly with both the mortgage originators and the securitizers, and they often have super majority rights within the trust documentation that allow them to force trustees to pursue mortgage buybacks. 
By contrast, investors in non-wrapped securitizations often face a number of legal and procedural hurdles before they can force the deal trustees to pursue mortgage buybacks, including the need to coordinate with 25% to 50% of the securities holders. Indeed, often 25% to 50% of each affected tranche and to an indemnify the trustee for any litigation. We have faced very little repurchase activity from public securitizations not wrapped by bond insurers in the past year. 
We estimate that about half of our everything-else category consists of securitizations not wrapped with bond insurance. And because we have seen virtually no repurchase activity from this group in the past year, a very small amount of our reserve is held against this category. But to be clear, we have established reserves for all probable and reasonably estimable risk with respect to this everything-else category. If we begin to expect increased repurchase or litigation activity in this category and if those risks become probable and reasonably estimable, we would reevaluate our reserves to reflect those risks. 
You should also know that, except for a limited amount of Chevy Chase originated loans, our subsidiaries did not act as securitizers of mortgage loans. Instead, they largely sold whole mortgage loans to others who securitize them. So the legal risks around the securitization process itself are relatively small for us.
Now for the numbers. Our reserve in the third quarter stayed roughly flat at $836 million, down from $853 million. Our rep and warranty loss expense, including settlements for the quarter, was $16 million to $17 million. As you can see on Slide 4, between 2005 and 2008, our subsidiaries sold to non-affiliates about $111 billion in original principal balance mortgage loans. 
Our second quarter estimate of $122 billion in originations included some sales to our affiliates, which, of course, do not create rep and warranty risk. So $111 billion is the number we should start with. Of this amount, about $29 billion was sold either to GSEs or into wrapped securitizations, $11 billion to the GSEs, $13 billion into wrapped deals currently making repurchase requests and another $5 billion to wrapped deals where the bond insurers are not currently active in seeking repurchase requests.  In this last category, we believe bond insurers are not making repurchase requests because, in general, they're not experiencing significant insurance losses. 
Almost all of our $836 million reserve is based on risks, and the $24 billion in loans sold to GSEs and active wrapped securitizations and almost all of the repurchase request we have received in the past year are from these two groups. You'll also see from the slide a sizable build of the rep and warranty reserve in the second quarter when we almost doubled the reserve as we moved to capture expected lifetime losses in our reserving methodology. The build, based on lifetime loss estimates last quarter, helps explain why you're not seeing a large build this quarter. 
Because we don't service most of the loans we sold to others, we don't have complete visibility into where the remaining $82 billion of loans landed. But we know from proprietary databases that about half landed in unwrapped public securitizations. As we discussed, we have seen virtually no repurchase activity from this $82 billion, either from the identified unwrapped securitizations or the remainder, which explains why only a small amount of our reserves is held against those originations. 
Now let's quickly move to the balance sheet on Slide 5. End-of-period loans were down less than 1% in the quarter, the slowest pace of contraction since the second quarter of 2009. Excluding the impact of our runoff portfolios, total loan balances would've been up modestly in the quarter. Our Domestic Card portfolio was down approximately $800 million or 1.4%, driven largely by $750 million in continued runoff from our Installment Loan portfolio. The Commercial Banking loan portfolio remained essentially flat in the quarter at $29.5 billion as we're seeing some signs of stabilization in CRE [commercial real estate], particularly in the New York metro area.
Consumer Banking assets were stable in the quarter as $442 million of Auto Finance growth largely offset $559 million of expected runoff in our Home Loans business. We grew our Securities portfolio by approximately $500 million in the quarter, with the bulk of growth in agency MBS and floating rate ABS [asset-backed securities]. The portfolio performed in line with the broader market ,and our unrealized gain position is now $833 million, down $97 million in the second quarter level. 
In the liability side. We continue to leverage our banking platforms to take advantage of strong demand for deposits, with total deposits up $1.9 billion in the quarter. We drove down our cost of funds by another five basis points in the quarter to 1.64% by replacing over $2 billion of term wholesale funding with cheaper deposits. We continue to expect securitized assets to end 2010 at around $27 billion, which represents a 44% decline from year-end 2009. And our loan-to-deposit ratio is now 1.06, the lowest point in our company's history.
As we turn to Slide 6, I'll discuss the allowance. The company's charge-off rate fell 54 basis points in the quarter to 4.82% while delinquencies fell 10 basis points to 3.71%. The continued improvement in credit drove a $624 million release in the allowance, which now stands at $6.2 billion or 4.89% of loans. $569 million of the reduction in the allowance was in the Card business, driven by lower-than-anticipated losses, declining delinquencies and a modest decline in loan balances. Given the underlying credit trends we are experiencing, it's not unreasonable to assume that our corporate allowance levels will likely continue to decline. 
Let me now finish my section by covering capital on Slide 7. Strong earnings in the quarter led to a 50-basis-point increase to our tangible common equity, the tangible managed assets ratio, which now stands at 6.6%. It's worth noting that this level is higher than our TCE [tangible common equity] ratio prior to the implementation of FAS 167. And taking into account the allowance, our total risk-bearing capacity is now at 10%, well above the year-end 2009 level even as credit performance has improved materially. 
Strong earnings also bolstered our Tier 1 risk-based capital [RBC] ratio by 130 basis points. While on-boarding of risk-weighted assets due to consolidation of securitizations, which existed as of January 1, was due to begin regulatory phase-in in the third quarter, we effectively spread this effect over the first three quarters of this year by paying down our securitization liability. However, because the balance of the phase-in of risk-weighted assets will occur in the first quarter of 2011, we've modeled our expected capital trajectory for 2011 on Slide 8. 
We modeled expected future capital levels using analyst consensus earnings and reasonable balance sheet assumptions, consistent with current expectations, to provide an illustrative expected capital trajectory. It's important to note that we are neither endorsing consensus estimates nor providing capital guidance, and we do not intend to provide updates to this model in future periods. However, we thought it would be helpful to illustrate the expected near-term capital trajectory. 
In the upper left hand corner, you can see that our TCE experienced a temporary dip in the first quarter of 2010 as we built $4.3 billion of allowance associated with the implementation of FAS 167. Strong earnings and a declining intangible assets over subsequent quarters had helped drive that ratio above where it was at the end of last year. Because TCE only includes GAAP equity in the numerator and total assets in the denominator, it remains unaffected by changes in regulatory definitions. It's future trajectory will only be impacted by underlying business performance and balance sheet growth. 
And both the Tier 1 Common and Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital graphs, you can see how those ratios fell along with TCE in the first quarter of 2010 due to the allowance build upon GAAP consolidation. However, unlike TCE, those ratios will likely experience one more dip in the first quarter of 2011 as the result of two factors that affect regulatory ratio definitions: first, the remaining risk-weighted asset phase-in will affect the denominator; and second, we will likely see an increase in the amount of DTA [deferred tax assets] disallowed in the numerator of regulatory capital ratios. This disallowance is cyclical, owing to a two-year carryback limitation that now coincides with the period of recessionary losses. As loss levels abate, the extinguishment of this allowed DTA accelerates our regulatory capital accretion, since allowance release will flow to regulatory capital on a pretax basis. 
Recent announcements from the Basel committee will also impact future regulatory capital definitions and requirements. But because Capital One is not materially impacted by two of the largest changes to the regulatory capital calculations, namely the exclusion of mortgage-servicing rights and capital and an increased need to hold capital related to trading books, our expected regulatory capital trajectory after the first quarter of 2011 is fundamentally upward and we expect to reach the 7% Basel III Tier 1 common minimum, plus based conservation buffer level in 2011, using the fully phased-in Basel III definitions. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Rich to discuss the performance of our businesses. Rich?"

I'll begin with margins on Slide 9. Net interest margin improved in the quarter. Modest funding cost improvements continued, and asset yields benefited from a higher day count in the third quarter. Revenue margin",1710,"Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with margins on Slide 9. Net interest margin improved in the quarter. Modest funding cost improvements continued, and asset yields benefited from a higher day count in the third quarter. Revenue margin increased as the result of the lower reps and warranty reserve build that Gary discussed as well as higher Domestic Card revenue margins. 
Domestic Card revenue margin increased to about 16.8% for the third quarter. Favorable credit drove most of the increase. Improving credit means that more of our finance charge and fee billings will be collectible. This enabled us to recognize revenue for a greater portion of third quarter billings. In other words, we had lower revenue suppression in the third quarter than the second quarter. Improving credit and collectibility also allowed us to recognize revenue for prior finance charge and fee billings that had been suppressed from revenue in earlier quarters. In other words, third quarter revenues included a release of prior suppressions, consistent with improving results. 
Purchase volume in our Domestic Card business increased, due in part to seasonal pattern. The purchase volumes were also up strongly from the prior year quarter. Strong purchase volumes drove higher interchange revenue in the quarter. These positive forces were partially offset by the expected decline in late fee revenues with the mid-quarter implementation of the new CARD Act rules and by modest attrition of higher-margin loans. 
We've been indicating that we expect quarterly domestic revenue margin in the Card business to decline to a more normal historical level of around 15% by the end of this year, as the revenue impacts of the CARD Act play out. CARD Act revenue impacts have played out largely as we expected. And with the full quarter effect of reduced late fees next quarter, we expect CARD Act revenue impacts will be fully absorbed into revenue margin. 
But the revenue margin has remained higher than 15%, driven by two factors: revenue benefits from improving credit have proved more persistent than we had expected and weak demand has resulted in fewer-than-expected new balances at promotional rates. We expect both of these factors to normalize over time, causing revenue margin to decline from its current level. 
Looking forward, Domestic Card revenue margin trends will be determined predominantly by market pricing, the competitive environment and credit results. Purchase volume and loan growth will also impact revenue margins, whether growth comes through increasing origination, portfolio acquisition or partnerships, like the expected addition of Kohl's. We continue to expect the Domestic Card revenue margin will remain at a level consistent with very healthy overall returns for the Card business. 
Slide 10 shows credit results for our Consumer businesses. Charge-off in delinquencies were stable or improving across our Consumer businesses, with the exception of an expected seasonal uptick in Auto delinquencies and charge-offs. Auto Finance credit remains exceptionally strong, with significant improvements year-over-year. This is largely driven by the high quality of recent vintages which now represents over 2/3 of our auto portfolio. 
The overall economic recovery remains modest and fragile, which is consistent with the assumptions we've been applying in our provisioning and underwriting for some time now. Recent labor market statistics show continuing stagnation. We continue to see risk in the housing market as well, as the shadow inventory of homes and foreclosure over severely delinquent mortgages remained very high. And the foreclosure crisis is disrupting housing market, which is likely to extend the time it takes to begin a clear recovery. 
Our credit results have continued to improve even as the pace of economic recovery has faltered a bit over the last couple of quarters. Some of the improvement is due to the benefit of portfolio turnover, which as I noted a moment ago, is particularly important in our Auto business. Some of the improvement is due to consumer deleveraging, although one shouldn't overstate this effect. Most of the actual deleveraging, especially in Card, is due to charge-offs. That said, new borrowing is still very low by historical standards. And that's likely to help improve credit quality, albeit at the expense of growth. 
Much of the improvement in credit, particularly in Card is due to the nature of the labor market problems. Simply put, people who have been unemployed for a long time, we think, has already charged off. Therefore, we'd expect that long-term unemployment, which is unusually high right now would have a smaller impact on credit performance than shorter-term unemployment. In fact, shorter-term unemployment has started to fall in the last couple of quarters and seems to be more correlated to our delinquencies than overall unemployment.
Slide 11 shows credit results for our Commercial Banking business. Commercial Banking credit metrics remain elevated and somewhat uneven but are showing signs of improvement for the second quarter in a row. Nonperforming asset rates improved, except for a slight uptick in our middle market C&I [Commercial & Industrial] business. In addition to the improvement in nonperforming asset rates, we experienced a second consecutive quarter-over-quarter decline in the dollar amount of criticized loans, reflecting stabilization across our Commercial Banking businesses. 
During the quarter, we saw some continuing improvement in the CRE market. For the second quarter in a row, leasing activity increased and vacancies declined in New York, where we have our largest CRE exposure. Traditional CRE investors continue to reenter the market, providing needed liquidity. And sponsors are investing new equity into troubled transactions, which has allowed us to rightsize many of our troubled loans. We believe that the worst is behind us, but we expect a few more quarters of uncertainty and choppiness in Commercial charge-offs and nonperforming loans.
Slide 12 outlines continuing uncertainties and our expected near-term trends. Capital One continues to show considerable resilience through the Great Recession and ongoing legislative and regulatory changes, but economic and regulatory uncertainties remain high. While the modest economic recovery continues, recent labor and housing market data shows stagnation and uncertainty. Foreclosure issues are further disrupting housing markets. As Gary discussed, uncertainty around reps and warranties remains elevated. Consumer demands remains weak, and the banking industry faces the development of hundreds of regulatory rules over the next couple of years to actually implement new laws and new capital standards. 
Our businesses and our business model are relatively less impacted by many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act, as we are a ""main street"" bank rather than a Wall Street bank. Like all banks, we'll be subject to changing capital requirements that will evolve as U.S. and international regulators worked to coordinate the capital aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and the ongoing Basel III discussions. As Gary discussed, we're well positioned for this emerging capital definitions and requirements. 
We've been able to absorb the existing and anticipated CARD Act impacts with our Domestic Card revenue margin and business model largely intact. Of course, there is ongoing regulatory uncertainty. But as long as the impact of regulatory changes promote and preserve a truly level playing field for all banks and consumer lenders, we believe that our underwriting and marketing capabilities, as well as our customer practices, will continue to be competitive advantages. 
Against that backdrop, our near-term expectations remained consistent with what we've articulated throughout the year. We expect that quarterly pre-provision earnings will decline heading into 2011. As I discussed earlier, we expect that the Domestic Card revenue margin will decline from its current level, as the factors keeping it elevated normalize over time. We also expect marketing expense will continue to ramp toward more normal level. We expect that loan balances will find a bottom over the next several quarters as charge-off continue to improve, the decline in runoff portfolios abate and seasonal patterns play out. We expect loan balances to stabilize and begin to grow modestly in 2011. As a result of these trends, we expect pre-provision earnings to stabilize in 2011.
I'll close tonight on Slide 13. One of the biggest issues facing the banking industry is how to grow and create value if there's an extended period of deleveraging and weak loan demand. It's easy to focus on the growth pressures caused by deleveraging, but deleveraging also create significant credit benefits and strong returns that help bridge the gap to a resumption of loan growth. 
We're well-positioned to pursue a broad set of growth opportunities even if consumer demand remains weak for an extended period of time. Many banks are reeling from the financial crisis and from poorly performing assets generated over the last decade. Others are struggling to address revenue and growth challenges, resulting from legislative and revelatory reform and the new level playing field they create. As a result, we're seeing opportunities to acquire businesses, assets portfolios and origination platform with attractive economics. 
Our balance sheet remains strong and resilient. We've weathered the recession relatively well, and our business are generating profits and capital. Credit losses are returning to more normal levels. We have a leading brand and advantage customer access across multiple channels, and we've invested to improve our infrastructure and expertise to support growth opportunities, like partnerships and acquisitions. We have a strong and flexible card infrastructure platform. 
We've added talent and created a deeper and more focused team to develop and manage our partnership strategy. We're building a scalable banking infrastructure, and we continuously deepen the talent and bench strength of our banking leadership team. Our investments are paying off. We've started new partnerships with Sony in the U.S. and Delta Air Lines in Canada. We expect to launch our partnership with Kohl's in early 2011, and we've completed the smooth and successful conversion to the Capital One Bank brand at our metro Washington, D.C. franchise. 
As consumer demand returns, we're well positioned to take share organically as  well. Our Domestic Card business is well positioned to take share on the new level playing field created by the CARD Act. We continue to drive winning product innovations, like the Venture card and Rewards Checking, and we've seen the return of loan growth begin in our repositioned Auto Finance business. We remain well positioned to take advantage of emerging opportunities and to deliver significant shareholder value over the long term. 
And now, Gary and I would be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?"

But we believe that something around half ended up in unwrapped publicly issued private label securitizations. The other half have ended up perhaps in privately placed securitizations. They may have stayed as whole loans on the books of the original purchasers, where they may have been resold by those original purchasers, ones or many times over at various prices to other buyers, and so it is a more difficult universe to track. Certainly, we can make some broad assumptions about overall performance. But in order to comment to the reserve, we also need to take a look at a number of other factors that I described, and it would be hard to really break that down for you any more than we have."

On the U.S. revenue margin, I know we've been continually pointing to 15%, and with a lot of confidence in our voice. And we seem to be having trouble getting there. The reason we went out, for a number of quarters now, pointing at 15% is really it was trying to focus on the impact of the CARD Act, and the fact that we felt this kind of a -- that will take our revenue margin to 15%, which, strikingly, is kind of our equilibrium revenue margin we had before the Great Recession and all the legislation began. And the CARD Act has, in fact, played out very much as we would have expected, and so the underlying economics of our business as reflected in our 15% that we were targeting is very much as we expected. The revenue margin has continued to be buoyed by the better-than-expected credit and, to some extent, by the weakness in originations and fewer-than-expected teaser rates. So now that the CARD Act is most -- half quarter of the reasonable fees effect this quarter and the kind of the final effect now is to get the whole quarter of reasonable fees. We're kind of there with respect to the CARD Act effect, and we're probably going to get out of the business projecting revenue margins at this point. I would say though that the CARD Act -- so the Card business has very much the octane that we expected it to. The revenue margin, I think, will settle down off of its level right now because I think, at some point, we won't keep getting the boost from the fee and finance charge reserve effect. And at some point, growth is going to pick up, and that means more use of introductory rates and so on. The other impact that will start to happen on our Card revenue margin will be things like the Kohl's portfolio coming in. Pound-for-pound, the Kohl's portfolio actually lowers revenue margin and lowers charge-off rates as it is a very high-quality portfolio.

The swamping effect that's going on here is the credit effect in making the number substantially bigger than 15%. There have been some other effects, frankly just some good dynamics in the Card business. Few things, where revenue itself, has just come in a little bit stronger, frankly, in the business than we had expected and as things turned slightly positive for us with respect to how the reasonable fee conversation came out. So there's some kind of, sustainably, a number of small effects on the sustainable business aspects of the revenue margin as well.

Certainly, what the nature of the loan is may have an impact, but you have to take a look at a variety of other things. You've got to look at the loan underwriting quality, the actual losses on the loans. You'd have to take a look at the specific reps and warranties in the sales contracts, how they were assigned and so forth. So I think it would be wrong to believe that if you simply knew the nature of the structure of the loan that, that would somehow give you the decoder ring to figuring out where things go from there. And in terms of the actual actions on behalf of potential claimants, what I actually say is that the actual claims we received are not a particularly terribly accurate measure of risk because activity can show up in a bunch of different ways: discussions, file requests, litigation, saber rattling, all sorts of things. So I think it would be wrong to be able to point to any one item to identify what makes a claim and the potential loss, either probable and estimable. But no, there is no magic formula that something needs to get over a particular hurdle of activity in order to become probable and estimable. It can reach that stage beforehand, but there is a considerable amount of judgment that needs to be put into that."

So it is really solely, at this point, a weak demand that is holding us back. I think unlike a lot of players haven't really had to significantly redo and rebuild our business model in some of these parts of the Card business. So we are frustratingly, in a sense, ready for business. So demand has been pretty weak. It's not to say that it's not taking up because, in fact, in parts of the business, we can see more traction happening, and the fact that there's more marketing is a reflection that we see both actual and the prospect for more traction here. It is our expectation that marketing will go up in successive quarters. The fourth quarter has traditionally been a higher marketing level for us, just on a set of a seasonal basis with all of our sponsorship of bowls [bowl games] and different things. But if we look at the very good prospects we have to make money in the Card business under originations and that, combined with the weak demand, it's our expectation that originations are going to continue to increase quarter-over-quarter. And as that happens, partly as a leading indicator and partly following it, our marketing will continue to rise. It's still quite a bit lower level than the historical highs. But it's our expectation, we're going to return to pretty strong levels of marketing. But the demand needs to be there for that. We're not going to just go spend it, just ahead of the evidence in the demand."

As we move forward, provision levels will be based on the usual volumes, the actual credit performance and what we see kind of going forward. Certainly, we all know that FASB [Financial Accounting Standards Board] has out for exposure. It's draft on accounting for financial instruments, which would take people perhaps to a longer future view of losses. But at this point, most of our Consumer business is certainly in card.

I would predict there may be less of an effect than some people imagine here. I guess I've been around this business for a long period of time. Plus, believe it or not, in a prior life, in my consulting days, I did extensive work in the gasoline retailing business, ironically, and the big thing everybody was studying was discount for cash and the big debate, what do you do about that and so on. And remember the phase everybody went through for discount for cash and then finally, it came back to -- the problem is, discount for cash sounded to consumers like surcharge for paying with a credit card, and there was a lot of consumer resistance to that. So look, I don't want to go too far out on a limb here but what I would say is that I just add this to one of the many kind of risk factors that we all have to keep an eye out over time. But I think the overall impact, I would still expect to be modest. However, I just want to point out, of course, the macro trend of the success of debit cards in gaining a lot of share against cash and checks and other things and, ultimately, on some metrics passing the credit card, I think it's a macro trend that will continue. And the Card business is going to face a lot of competition from alternatives here. But I think, overall, Bruce, it's not at the top of our risk factors but we're certainly going to keep an eye on that. With respect to Kohl's, let me just make a comment about partnership. If you look at partnerships and just kind of pull way back on partnerships, co-brand, private label, partnerships in the credit card space, they have ranged in the industry from being smashingly successful to very big duds. And so our conclusion on this thing is it's all about the partner, and it's all about the nature of the agreement with the partner. And it's all about the commitment that the partner has, what's the partner trying to really get out of one of these partnerships. So take Kohl's as an example, because I think Kohl's is a great example of a partnership where you have a very strong retailer. You have a very strong retailer who's very committed to their private label business, not as a way to ""make a lot of money"" but really as a way to build very deep loyalty. And they are very committed to their partnership with their card player. It's extremely important to Kohl's, and it's extremely important to them that they get a partner that's going to be equally committed to them. So this has all the makings of a very good deep relationship with the partner and the creation of positively selected credit on the private label partnership side. So all of that, that's a classic exhibit A of the kind of things that we're going for. Along the way, we look at a lot of partnerships. And we show up but don't make the bids because they kind of are at the end of the spectrum. So what you will see out of Capital One at a time when a number of credit card issuers are kind of struggling a little bit and where the companies that they have partnered with are looking for something a little different, we are moving into this space on a selective basis, and I think it's the right conclusion, Bruce, to expect us to be doing more of these over time. But again, it's going to be very selective."

So if you can see on Slide 7, since the end of the fourth quarter, risk-weighted assets have gone up about $8 billion from $116 billion to $124 billion. We started out with about $48 billion of securitizations, and so you would think that about half of those, or $24 billion, would have to have been phased-in by this point in time. As it turns out, we had paid down almost that amount of securitization liabilities over the nine months, and so there was actually very little phase in of securitizations to do this quarter. And there has been, of course, shrinkage in -- but just because of the attrition and the runoff in some of the rest of our portfolio that's caused risk-weighted assets to go down. Looking forward, we have now two quarters to go until Q1 of '11 when we have to phase in the balance of the securitizations. It looks to us as though we paid down and so forth. We'll probably phase in something like $18 billion or $19 billion worth of securitizations between now and then. But I would be very surprised if the overall level of risk-weighted assets went up that much because, again, there are some natural attrition, both in the Card business and elsewhere in the portfolio. But I think the key thing to keep in mind is that because we had such a large amount of securitization paydown on our part over the course of the first three quarters of this year, you didn't see a big impact in the third quarter in terms of the on-boarding. You will see a more pronounced impact of the on-boarding of that last group of securitized assets in the first quarter of '11, which is why you see the projected view of regulatory ratios taking the path that they do on Slide 8."

What we are doing is -- if we look at the marketplace, consistent with our strategy for the last 20 years, we tend to massively de-average the market and look for pockets of opportunities. And in some places, the market is at price levels that are not sustainable on a risk-adjusted basis, and we stay out of those.

And we have a lot of tests that have been laid deep within the Great Recession that are starting to show insights about good business opportunities even in the context of, frankly, scared consumers and pretty dark times. And so we're finding more and more of the things that we've been testing were moving into rollout mode for. And I think that's why we feel a bullishness about our growth opportunities, and I think it will modestly show itself in the Card business. Of course, when you watch the Card business, that's also the segment, it has continued runoff of the Installment Loan business blended into the same thing. So you have to kind of keep that one in mind. So we feel very good about that and even at the same time while the partnership business opportunities are getting a lot of traction. Let me just make one more comment about the revenue margin. So the revenue margin, I mean, I think the credit effect has been the biggest thing that has cost this thing to be higher than 15%. But the net business, the way things have broken on the business side have been, on a positive side, outweighing the negative with respect to our revenue margin. I think it may take things like Kohl's, which comes in at a lot lower margin and a lot lower charge-offs, to actually get ""normalized margin"" down towards the kind of things that we pointed out, which is, I think, a reflection of the fact that, overall, there has been a -- the developments on margins have been slightly positive, I think, relative to our expectations. But where we see our business unfolding the amount of low-risk business that we think we're going to pick up, it probably gets you to the same place."

In other words, the concept is they don't want you to have your repriced back book to be running at a level very different from that which is being offered to the front book, if you will, to new customers. And we've said for some time that we expect industry pricing to move higher after the CARD Act, and this is important for the health of new originations. But actually now, interestingly, with this particular requirement that's kind of the last aspect of the CARD Act interpretation, it becomes now doubly important. The price levels that issuers have for their new originations is kind of doubly important. Now we have done, as you can imagine, a lot of analysis at this. And when we compare segment of the back book versus a segment of the front book and how they are priced, we are comfortable that we're going to be in a good place with respect to this ""unrepricing,"" if you will. There will be segments of the business that we do some unrepricing. But frankly, dynamically, we do that all the time. So I think that this is an important issue the industry is going to have to come to terms with. We've been all over this at Capital One. And frankly, because we are so focused on making sure in a world where repricing is a lot more constrained than it was before, as you've been hearing me say, Matthew, for a long time, it is very important that we underwrite the originations originally at price levels that are sustainable through the long term. And therefore, it's not surprising at Capital One that those price levels would be consistent with how the back book is priced, because it's really underwritten on the very same credit foundation."

Has there been a psychological change in the way that consumers view the teaser rate offers?"

First of all, when you said that it seems that you're doing quite a bit more teasers than you were before, I just want to clarify something that Moshe put out a report on. And Moshe was very correctly reading the data from the source he was getting, it was not an accurate reflection of Capital One. So let me actually just ground that for a second. It looked like Capital One was doing a dramatically increased amount of 0% balance transfer teasers. Moshe, when we saw your analysis, we went back and looked at the underlying data and so on. And I'm not sure what happened with respect to the source data, but we are not doing a lot of 0% balance transfer teasers. So I just wanted to clarify that. We, like the industry, does, for a certain segment, do 0% purchase teasers. So having clarified that, let me talk about teasers. I think teasers are something that is going to be with the card industry as a permanent fixture here. And in fact, teasers have been very explicitly allowed in all of the legislative and regulatory work as well. I think it's no different from sales at Bloomingdale's. It's just kind of how the business works, I think it will. So I don't think consumers are really turned off by teasers. I just think consumers are not buying a lot of credit card products right now. I think the other thing with teasers right now is that the teaser rates in an environment of very low interest rates are not nearly as costly for the card issuer. So I've been predicting for some time, you're going to see teaser rates as sort of a fixture of the Card business. What I've also said though is, for those of you who analyze the business, judge it not by it's 0% teasers, the purchase teasers, in particular, because rates are low right now and those, by definition, have limited time period. Judge it by the go-to rates, that is really the key. And when we look at what happened with respect to go-to rates -- I've been talking to you in virtually every call about the trend in pricing out there, so we can keep an eye on. Is the industry in a world where there's a lot less flexibility to do repricing? Is the industry building in appropriate margins here? And the good news is that if you look at, let's call it, go-to rate minus prime to sort of adjust for what's happened in the interest rate, that has gone up. Although it sort of stabilized now, but it's gone up about 200 basis points since basically the CARD Act was passed. However, I think the industry has done it the easy way, because they basically have kept pricing where it is while interest rates have gone down. So I'm not as confident that the industry is as robust in their pricing as they need to be when things go up. You had another question there, Chris?"

So that's kind of a core principle of ours. So let me make one structural point and one cyclical point. Let me start with the cyclical point. The auctions are happening, but let's put it this way, the pricing is radically different. I mean, we're talking about pricing that is, in some cases, in terms of premiums, a fraction of what it was a couple of years ago for the same portfolios that turned some years ago. So I'm okay with auctions, if I understand the nature of what part of the cycle I'm playing in, and so there's a cyclical effect here. The structural thing I want to talk about is, kind of goes back to that point that some private label businesses are actually really attractive. And I think, for us, there's a bit of a diversification benefit that also comes in a world where there's uncertainty about interchange, uncertainty about certain of some of the core ways that business has been done in the past, I think. That although it's not our primary motivation, I think there are benefits also just from sort of diversification that comes in the world of interchange risk. But primarily, what we have done is really -- what we're trying to do is take advantage of adversity, and the great adversity we all can seize here is the Great Recession. The Great Recession not only has changed supply and demand, but it allowed us to get a phenomenal window into how credit risk works, and so we try to be real students on how credit risk and positive and negative selection of work in every part of the market. And we're really on the hunt for the, shall we say, more positively selected partnership programs."

Let me go straight to the income statement on Slide 3 of the presentation. Capital One earned $636 million or $1.40 per share in the first quarter, up $0.57 per share or 70",1702,"Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon to everyone listening to the call this afternoon. Let me go straight to the income statement on Slide 3 of the presentation. Capital One earned $636 million or $1.40 per share in the first quarter, up $0.57 per share or 70% from the prior quarter, as modestly improved pre-provision earnings were bolstered by lower provision expenses.
Total revenue declined $79 million or 1.8%, as an improvement in margin partially offset a 2.9% decline in average loans. The margin benefited from a 17 basis point improvement in cost of funds.
Loan yields were also up slightly in the quarter despite somewhat lower fees as both were positively affected by higher collectability. Despite the slight decline in revenue, pre-provision earnings were up modestly as the $100 million reduction in our non-interest expenses more than offset the lower revenue. The largest contributor to the better quarter-over-quarter performance was the $369 million decrease in provision expense.
Total charge-offs in the quarter fell $170 million as lower charge-offs in our Commercial, Auto Finance and Retail Banking businesses more than offset a slight decrease in Domestic Card charge-offs.
We released $566 million of allowance through provision expense in the first quarter after posting an allowance build of $4.3 billion through retained earnings on January 1 in line with new accounting standards. More on the impact of FAS 167 and the drivers to the allowance in a moment.
Several other items impacted income in the quarter. First, we sold mortgage I/O bonds that were acquired through the purchase of Chevy Chase Bank, resulting in the deconsolidation of $1.5 billion of loans and a net P&L gain of $127 million. We also recognized a net gain on Securities of $65 million as we rebalanced the portion of our agency mortgage-backed Securities portfolio.
Lastly, we realized a $50 million benefit to tax expense in the quarter resulting from settlements during the quarter. These gains were partially offset by a $224 million cost associated with our rep [representation] and warranty exposure, about half of which is related to the run-off GreenPoint Mortgage portfolio and therefore, is in discontinued operations.
Let's turn to the balance sheet on Slide 4. Total lending assets declined by $11 billion in the quarter. Our Domestic Card portfolio was down $4 billion in the quarter driven by $1.5 billion of charge-offs, $1 billion of run-off in our Installment Loan portfolio, as well as expected seasonal paydowns in revolving credit. The Installment Loan portfolio will continue to pressure Card growth metrics as we expect approximately $2 billion more to run-off over the remainder of 2010.
The Commercial Banking portfolio remained largely flat versus fourth quarter levels, but we expect to see modest growth in this portfolio over the remainder of 2010 as good lending opportunities are beginning to emerge in our markets. On the Consumer Bank side, the nearly $2 billion decline in first quarter assets was primarily driven by two trends I mentioned on last quarter's call. First, in our Auto Finance business, our decision to pull back on origination volume in early 2008 is continuing to reduce the level of outstandings, although we are now beginning to approach the point in which new originations will equal the run-off of prior originations.
Auto assets were down $700 million in the first quarter, and we continue to expect ending loans will be down approximately $2 billion at year-end 2010 versus the end of 2009.
The second factor pressuring Consumer Bank outstandings is that our Mortgage portfolio largely remains in run-off mode, with a $900 million decline in assets in the first quarter. The decline in other assets in the quarter is related to FAS 167 as we reclassified securitization receivables to cash. More on FAS 167 in a minute.
Our $38 billion Securities portfolio shrank slightly in the first quarter as the non-agency book continue to run-off. The portfolio continues to perform well. Our total unrealized gain increased $191 million in the quarter, and now stands in an unrealized gain position of $482 million, even after booking net gains of $65 million.
Between the run-off of our Installment Loan portfolio and declining Consumer Loans in both Auto and Mortgage, we continue to expect these businesses will drive over $7 billion of loan shrinkage over the course of 2010, with $2.6 billion of debt decline already occurring during the first quarter.
While our other Lending businesses may have seen net growth this year despite elevated levels of charge-offs, we still believe our total ending loan balances will decline by mid-single digits in terms of percentage, or taking into account the rapid shrinkage we experienced in 2009, a high single-digit percentage decline in average loan balances year-over-year.
Now to the liability side of the balance sheet. Securitization liability was down sharply, as conduit paydowns and other maturities totaled about $9 billion in this quarter. By year-end 2010, securitization is expected to be down another $11 billion, representing a 43% decline from year-end 2009.
Funding costs declined in the quarter by 17 basis points due to favorable market rates and continued leveraging of our Commercial and Consumer Banking platforms to swap into lower-priced deposits. While on the subject of balance sheet composition, it's worth highlighting that the implementation of FAS 167 has largely eliminated the distinction between our managed and reported balance sheets caused by securitized assets.
I'll briefly discuss this consolidation in greater detail on Slide 5. On January 1, we brought $48 billion of previously off-balance sheet loans, the vast majority of which were securitized Domestic Card loans, onto our balance sheet as we implemented FAS 167. In line with the consolidation of these loans, we built about $4.3 billion in allowance, resulting in a $3 billion after-tax impact to retained earnings and the creation of a $1.6 billion deferred tax asset. So while our ending fourth quarter allowance stood at $4.1 billion, we began the first quarter with an allowance balance of $8.4 billion.
It's worth noting that this initial allowance build ran through retained earnings rather than through the income statement. However, the allowance released for the first quarter, as well as any future changes to the allowance balance, will run through the P&L.
Turning to Slide 6, I'll discuss the change in first quarter allowance in greater detail. We released $566 million from our allowance in the quarter driven largely by the Domestic Card business. There were three main drivers of the allowance release in Card. First, we continue to believe that the first quarter will be the high watermark for Card losses so swapping out the first quarter of 2010 for the first quarter of 2011 drives down our allowance needs. The second driver of the release is our moderating credit outlook for the remainder of 2010 compared to what we were projecting at the end of last quarter. And finally, the $5 billion of lower period-end assets requires lower allowance, all else being equal.
It's important to note that the absolute level of this quarter's Card allowance release was materially impacted by the addition of allowance coverage for the nearly 2/3 of Card assets that were previously off-balance sheet and, historically, did not carry an allowance. Had we not consolidated under FAS 167, the Card allowance release would've been approximately $290 million this quarter.
Similar to the improvement in underlying trends we've observed in the Card business, we continued to see strong credit performance in Auto. This performance, coupled with the approximately $700 million reduction in outstandings led to a $142 million release in allowance for that business. Unlike our Consumer Lending businesses, we continued to see an upward trend of nonperforming loans in Commercial. And as a result, we built $130 million of additional allowance. All told, despite the $566 million allowance release, we ended the first quarter with an allowance balance of $7.8 billion or nearly 6% coverage on our $130 billion Loan portfolio. Given the historically high levels of coverage and underlying business and economic trends, it's reasonable to assume that our total allowance levels will likely continue to decline over the course of the rest of the year.
Turning to Slide 7, I'll discuss our overall risk-bearing capacity. Our ratio of tangible common equity to tangible managed assets in the quarter increased 70 basis points to 5.5% versus the fourth quarter pro forma ratio of 4.8%. The increase in TCE was driven by strong earnings in the first quarter, as well as the $11 billion decline in managed assets. Coupling this level of TCE with the allowance built under FAS 167, our total risk-bearing capacity now stands at 9.7% of our total assets. We expect earnings and a smaller balance sheet to further increase our TCE ratio over the course of the year.
Given the timing and nature of implementation rules for FAS 167, I indicated last quarter that the trends in TCE and Tier 1 ratios would diverge in 2010 into early 2011. You'll see that happening in the first quarter results. Despite the fundamentally positive trends that helped TCE, our Tier 1 ratio decreased to 9.6% in the quarter, down 30 basis points from Q4 '09 pro forma levels.
The numerator of the Tier 1 ratio already declined in line with the large allowance build required by FAS 167 and is now also being affected by the disallowance of some related deferred tax assets. With consolidation phase-in guidance now established, we know that the risk-weighted denominator will increase through the first quarter of 2011. Actually, some of that impact was accelerated into the first quarter, in line with the reduced level of off-balance sheet securitizations I mentioned earlier.
In any event, our Tier 1 ratios are and will continue to remain comfortably above well-capitalized levels. And because regulatory capital ratios are more pro-cyclical, as loss levels normalize, our Tier 1 ratios should more than proportionately follow the fundamental upward trajectory of TCE. While there remains a fair amount of uncertainty about the future of bank capital requirements overall, I'm confident that our balance sheet strength and flexibility position us extremely well to grow profitably.
With that, I'll hand it over to Rich to talk about our financial performance and outlook in greater detail. Rich?"

Several factors drove the improvement in funding costs. Our funding mix shifted from higher cost wholesale sources to Consumer and Commercial Banking deposits.
Within our Banking businesses, our mix shifted from higher cost time deposits to lower cost and more relationship-driven liquid saving and transaction accounts. And favorable interest rates and disciplined pricing drove the decrease in deposit interest expense.
Two offsetting forces drove the modest increase in asset yields. Our asset mix shifted from loans to investment securities, which resulted in moderate downward pressure on yields. The effects of this mix shift were more than offset by strong revenue margin in our Domestic Card business.
First quarter Domestic Card revenue margin remained elevated largely as the result of better-than-expected credit results and lower-than-expected attrition of higher-yielding loans. The same credit results and outlook that contributed to the allowance release in the quarter had a parallel favorable impact on revenue.
Actual credit results were favorable to our prior expectations driving a more favorable assessment of the collectability of finance charges and fees that were previously build but not recognized as revenue. This allowed us to recognize some of these previously build fees as revenue in the first quarter and to recognize a larger portion of first quarter fee billings as well.
First quarter non-interest income declined. Overlimit fee revenues declined as the result of the February 22 implementation of CARD Act regulations. Interchange revenue also declined seasonally in the quarter.
Last quarter, we said that we expected the quarterly Domestic Card revenue margin to decrease somewhat in the first quarter on its way to settling in the mid-15% range for the subsequent quarters of 2010. However, better-than-expected credit results, the resulting improvement in the collectability of revenue and lower-than-expected attrition have kept that margin at elevated levels. As we have seen over the last several quarters, Domestic Card revenue margin for any specific quarter is subject to considerable uncertainty from credit trends, seasonality and consumer and competitor responses to the CARD Act.
But as these forces play out by the end of 2010 or early 2011, we still expect that the quarterly Domestic Card revenue margin will decline over the next few quarters. The credit related benefit to revenue we experienced in the first quarter is likely to diminish because we were able to recognize more of the finance charges and fees we build in the first quarter. We'll have a smaller backlog of first quarter billings that could be recognized in future quarters as credit improves.
Beginning in the second quarter, we will experience an additional modest decline in overlimit fee revenue resulting from the February 22 implementation of CARD Act regulations. It's still too early to precisely quantify the expected impact of the proposed reasonable and proportional fee regulations because we don't yet know the final rules. But we do know that they are set to be implemented on August 22. That means that the third quarter will include a half-quarter revenue impact from the regulations, and that the fourth quarter will include a full quarter effect. We'll need to see more specifics as the rule-making process continues through the comment period and revisions in the spring and summer.
Last quarter, we cited these regulations as a risk, and we're now incorporating a range of potential outcomes into our expectation for Domestic Card quarterly revenue margin. By the end of 2010 or early in 2011, we expect that quarterly Domestic Card revenue margin will be around 15%, which is a level consistent with very healthy overall returns for the Card business.
Slide 9 shows a history of the overall economics of our Domestic Card business. With all the noise surrounding the CARD Act, revenue margin trends and uncertainty about the future of the Card business, we believe that a look at this history provides a helpful context for our expectations of the future economics of the business. Over the last six years, changes in the components of Domestic Card ROA have generally offset each other, preserving strong ROA. The only exception over the last six years was, of course, the great recession. While ROA declined through this period, the graph shows that this was the result of elevated provision expense that could not be fully offset with revenue or expense levers. The graph also shows that our Domestic Card business remained profitable throughout the worst credit cycle in generations.
Looking forward, we expect revenue margin to decline for the next several quarters to around 15% by early 2011 as I just discussed. Over time, margins may experience further modest decline as credit improves.
We expect non-interest expense as a percentage of loans to increase in the near term, largely as the result of the declining loans and the denominator and the expected increase in marketing expenses. We expect that marketing will ramp back toward more normal levels over the next several quarters. The pace and extent of that ramp will depend upon consumer demand and the competitive landscape. We expect increased marketing and improving charge-offs will result in modest growth in our revolving Card balances over the remainder of 2010. But we expect that Domestic Card loan balances, the overall segment, will be relatively flat for the remaining quarters of 2010 as growth in revolving Cards is offset by elevated charge-offs and the continuing run-off of Installment Loans.
One issue of particular importance is equilibrium pricing in the industry following the CARD Act. Pricing for new customers has been increasing gradually. We're watching industry pricing trends carefully as they are a bellwether for the long-term health of the card industry. Go to APRs, they've risen about 300 basis points over the last year and have edged into the mid-teens in the last few months. We believe that industry pricing needs to continue to increase to provide appropriate resiliency for new originations since post the CARD Act, there is less repricing resilience of APRs than there was in the past.
Over time, we expect that higher marketing expenses will be partially offset by a decline in operating expense. We expect operating expense as a percentage of loans to decline as improving credit allows us to reduce collections intensity and as balances begin to rebuild. We expect provision expense to decline over the next several quarters. We believe that credit losses peaked in the first quarter of 2010. We expect modest improvement in charge-offs beginning in the second quarter of 2010. And as Gary discussed, we continue to see the potential for significant allowance releases in the Domestic Card business.
As a result of these revenue and expense trends, it's likely that pre-provision earnings as a percentage of loans will decline through 2010 and perhaps into early 2011. But we expect that this decline will be partially offset by the expected improvement in provision expense.
All these components of ROA will almost certainly move over time as the result of market conditions, competitor moves and consumer behavior. But history has shown that they often move in ways that naturally offset. We've been able to manage multiple levers to deliver solid pre-provision and bottom line ROA as the industry and the economy have gone through enormous changes.
In the long term, we still believe that the overall economics of the Domestic Card business are very attractive. We'd expect that growth and returns will lag marketing investments as they always have. But with healthy ROA and the return to loan growth, we expect that Domestic Card business will still be the most attractive Consumer Lending business in banking, and that it will continue to deliver returns that are well above hurdle over the cycle.
Slide 10 shows credit results for our Consumer Lending businesses. Domestic charge-off rate increased to 10.5% for the first quarter of 2010 driven by declining loan balances and a temporary increase in charge-offs as last year's pricing actions flowed through the charge-off. The charge-off increase was smaller than expected due to favorable bankruptcy trends and favorable performance in late-stage delinquencies.
The 30-plus delinquency rate improved nearly 50 basis points to 5.3% at the end of the quarter. Expected seasonal trends and the diminishing impact of last year's pricing actions drove the improvement. Based on first quarter charge-off and delinquency results, we now believe that the first quarter is likely to be the peak for both dollar charge-offs and charge-off rate in Domestic Card.
While we believe Q1 is the peak, we expect only modest improvement in second quarter, as seasonal improvements are offset by continuing declines in loan balances. We expect continuing modest improvement in charge-offs in the second half of 2010. We expect modest growth in Consumer Cards to offset Installment Loan run-off reducing the denominator effect. And although it's still early, in recent months we've seen further signs of stabilization, and even some modest improvements in labor and housing markets.
International charge-offs and delinquency trends remained stable to slightly improving. We've been retrenching the U.K. business for some time now, and we've been cautious in Canada. First quarter credit results reflect this cautious stance, as well as the fact that unemployment is improving in Canada and appears to be stabilizing in the U.K. Strong credit performance drove first quarter profit to the $117 million in our International Card business.
Charge-offs for the Mortgage portfolio were relatively stable. Early delinquencies improved, but non-performing and foreclosure inventories continue to increase due to a very slow resolution process. Modifications add several months to the process, and local jurisdictions face growing foreclosure backlogs that further slow resolution. Overall, our portfolio continues to perform better than industry averages.
Our Mortgage portfolio includes the challenged Chevy Chase portfolio that we acquired in 2009. Chevy Chase portfolio is protected by the credit mark we took at acquisition. This portfolio continues to perform in line with our expectations, and we remain comfortable with the mark.
Auto Finance charge-off rate and delinquency rate both improved in the first quarter. The improvements resulted from expected seasonal patterns, the strong performance of recent origination vintages and the stabilizing economic and auction price trends. These factors were partially offset by the impact of declining loan balances. Favorable consumer credit performance and credit outlook were key drivers to strong profitability in our Credit Card and Consumer Banking businesses in the first quarter.
Slide 11 shows credit performance in our Commercial Banking businesses. In the first quarter, Commercial Banking charge-off rate declined from elevated charge-off levels in the fourth quarter of 2009. We charged off fewer loans in the first quarter, and we experienced lower severities on the loans we charged off. Non-performing asset rate increased modestly in the quarter, but the pace of deterioration was slower than we have seen over the last several quarters. The pressure on non-performing asset rate and charge-off rate remains concentrated in our Commercial and Multi-family Real Estate business, about 70% of which is located in metro New York City.
Within this portfolio, the source of deterioration has shifted from the relatively small Construction portfolio to loans related to New York City office buildings. Sequential quarter charge-off comparisons were also impacted by actions we took in the fourth quarter in our Small Ticket CRE portfolio, which continues to run-off after we stopped originating these loans over two years ago.
Last quarter, we charged off a portfolio of non-performing Small Ticket CRE loans as we sold them in the distressed debt market. Selling non-performers is an ongoing part of our workout strategy for the Small Ticket CRE portfolio. The timing of such sales depends upon investor appetite and market conditions, and the volume of loan sales was much smaller in the fourth quarter.
Credit performance in the Middle Market portfolio remains relatively stable. Overall, we expect non-performers and charge-offs will continue to deteriorate in our Commercial business, but the pace of deterioration is slowing. It appears that the worst of the commercial credit cycle may be behind us. We continue to believe that our Commercial Banking Loan portfolio is well positioned to weather this downturn in Commercial Real Estate. We have a favorable loan mix with a relatively small exposure to construction lending. And our relatively small exposure to construction lending is a key reason that the absolute level of our CRE charge-off rate is lower than many other banks.
We also have a relatively large exposure to New York City Multi-family, which has been resilient to the recession because of rent controls and supply limitations. We have disciplined lending standards, and we underwrite to in-place cash flows in rents. And compared to most large banks, Commercial Loans are much smaller percentage of our total company-managed loans.
I'll conclude this afternoon on Slide 12. We've worked for years to position our company to be resilient, and we're demonstrating that resilience through the most challenging economic cycle we've seen in generations. We've delivered relatively resilient profitability through the downturn. We maintained the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet. We built strong and stable liquidity through careful management of our balance sheet and by growing deposits with disciplined pricing. We maintained healthy allowance coverage ratios throughout the downturn. And we maintained sufficient capital to address both the recession and the FAS 166/167 accounting changes.
We're now on the path to delivering normalized earnings. Over the next several quarters, we expect that quarterly margins will decline to more normal levels driven by the expected decline in Domestic Card revenue margin I described earlier, as well as the stabilization of funding costs. We expect that loans will continue to decline over the next few quarters before finding a bottom at the end of 2010 or early in 2011.
Continuing run-off of businesses we exited or repositioned earlier in the recession will drive loan declines even as some of our businesses begin to grow sooner. And we expect that expenses will increase over this timeframe as marketing expense will ramp toward more normal historical levels and we make investments in banking infrastructure to support future growth. The combination of these expected trends will result in lower quarterly pre-provision earnings in 2011.
We expect the decline in pre-provision expense will cushion the bottom line impact of falling pre-provision earnings. It should be expected the decline in provision expense will cushion the bottom line of falling pre-provision earnings. We expect continuing improvement in charge-offs. And the combination of declining loan balances and improving credit trends create the potential for significant allowance releases as well.
As we move past the early part of 2011, we believe that our path to normalized earnings will become more apparent in our quarterly results. We expect pre-provision earnings to establish a positive trend over the course of 2011. We remain well positioned to deliver significant shareholder value over the long term.
In our Commercial and Consumer Banking businesses, we have great market positions in some of the best local markets in the country. We can grow commercial relationships and loans as the commercial credit cycle improves. We can continue to grow deposits with disciplined pricing. And as we complete our investments and infrastructure, we expect our cost structure and bottom line profitability will improve over time.
Our Domestic Card business has delivered industry-leading profitability and returns through cycles, including the most significant recession in generations. We believe that our Domestic Card business is well positioned to compete on the new level playing field that's created because the CARD Act prohibits widely used industry practices, which we never relied on, like aggressive single-infraction penalty repricing. As a result, we expect that we'll be able to essentially restart the marketing of similar products to similar customer segments that we were doing before we pulled back during the recession.
The Credit Card business has always been characterized by significant near-term marketing investments, followed by a long-term payoff with very attractive risk-adjusted returns. Margins may moderate modestly over time as charge-offs normalize, but we're confident that returns will remain well above hurdle rate over cycles. We expect that returns will be more sustainable long term, with competitive practices cleaned up by the CARD Act. And as we've said before, we believe that the Domestic Card market and competitive environment following the implementation of the CARD law will play to our strengths.
Our balance sheet is emerging from the dual challenges of the recession and the FAS 166/167 accounting change with its resilience intact. As Gary described earlier, our balance sheet strength and flexibility put us in a strong position to grow profitably and to sustain above hurdle returns over the long term.
Now Gary and I will be happy to answer your questions. Jeff?"

In the first quarter, we were down nearly 5% or about $6.7 billion. So we're pretty close to where we said we thought we would be by the end of the year in terms of the overall balance shrinkage. Now to break that down into the segments, what we've said is that we expect another $4.5 billion worth of decline between now and the end of 2010 coming from a runoff in Installment Loans. That's a couple of billion dollars. In Mortgage, that's maybe another $1.5 billion, and the reduction in Auto outstandings would be another $0.5 billion or so. So that's the decline from here to the end of the year, about $4.5 billion. Just about offsetting that would be loan balances in our revolving Credit Card portfolio and in our Commercial book. Particularly in the revolving Credit Card portfolio, we'll continue to have an elevated level of charge-offs. So in effect, we're going to have to grow that both to cover the involuntary attrition that comes from the charge-offs, as well as to offset some of the decline in the other businesses. So all told, year-end 2009 to year-end 2010, down in the mid-single digits. Again, it'll be a little bit more in terms of average outstandings. And quite frankly, we'll probably remain near the bottom of the U for a couple of quarters before seeing that growth near the end of this year and then into next year."

Although of course, getting full resolution of that still awaits us, so that was that effect. So a lot of our competitors have given numbers saying the CARD Act, the cost of the CARD Act is x hundred million dollars. And I find when we listen to that, I'm not sure how to interpret that number because there's so many effects that go on. And so what we've tried to do, Sanjay, for you is just try to guide you to a destination because the destination incorporates all of the combined effects of impacts and counteractions and a lot of things that -- so I think it's most useful for us to really focus on that. And so again, kind of hitting the highlights of the revenue margin, we -- if you go all the way back to before all of these changes began, in some ways, our revenue margin was in the 15s. And then The Great Recession came along, the regulations came along, and we got to an unusually elevated level that you see at 17%, really because of three factors. So we're kind of at the peak here, and I want to kind of savor the three factors. One is repricing in advance of the CARD Act. One is revenue benefits from improving credit, so that's the fee and finance charge releases that we've been getting here. And the third is the decline in teaser rate percentage because during the recession, we haven't been doing very much marketing. So the margin is going to go down to 15% because of really three factors: The implementation of the CARD Act; not getting the reserve releases that we -- as much of it as we enjoyed say, in a quarter like this one; and the resumption of marketing with teaser rates. And the impact will be somewhat progressive in that things -- you start to get partial quarters of effects like we had the partial impact of the -- partial quarter of the impact on overlimits, then we get the full quarter impact and then in the third and fourth quarter, we're going to get a partial and then full impact of the reasonable fees. But we are pretty confident about the destination of being around 15%, obviously, subject to the final interpretation of reasonable fees."

On the supply side, I'm bullish about the impact of the CARD Act, because we've spent a decade feeling like we have one arm and one leg tied behind our back, choosing not to market in whole parts of the Card business because we were uncomfortable with the practices and both the market-clearing price from the credit point of view and especially the damage to franchise, building a franchise that we felt some of those practices entailed. So we are, from a supply of point of view, feel that the CARD Act is a very good thing for Capital One because it returns underwriting back to where it was in the '90s, which is it's all about upfront underwriting and not about the repricings that follow after the fact. So we feel good about our relative chances, and I also think that the CARD Act is going to put a much greater rationality to the nature of the competition.

It'll be still to be determined how much demand there is on the other side of this. And also, you do have the growth of debit cards causing some modest encroachment into card territory. On the other hand however, history shows deleveraging tend to be cyclical things. And also, we don't have one of the biggest factors that held us back in the last decade, and that was home equity loans were a massive cannibalizer of really good core card growth. So I look at it this way, I mean, while there is a big variance in our own view of the outcome in terms of demand, I'm just assuming it's going to be flattish. Industry growth would be flattish to positively negative, sort of as things stabilize, but I'm just making that up. The thing that makes me bullish is that while I'd love a rapidly growing industry, the most important thing is being able to have a relative competitive advantage in a level playing field in the industry, which paradoxically, The Great Recession and the great legislation, if you will, have sort of rendered that. So I'm very bullish about that, and we'll just have to see how demand comes out."

I think our view is that we'll take a differentiated approach in parts of our portfolio, just not offer them. In other cases, offer opt-in but it's a little premature to conclude where that comes out. But our overall expectation is that overlimit fees are substantially down versus the old days. And we put that into our planning so you should assume that as well, significant reductions in overlimit revenues. And for us, it's part of the redistribution of how the revenue model works in the card business, and it's between what's happened on the overlimit side and our expectation with respect to the CARD Act, with respect to reasonable and proportional fees. There is a shift in how the revenue model and pricing structure in the credit card works from away from back-end pricing toward front end, upfront, APR and in some cases, annual fees. And I think there's a lot of benefits to that model. One of the things that I most have my eye on is to make sure that the industry price is high enough for resilience, because the thing that I don't think's getting enough attention is some of the resilience diminishment in APR repricing that comes from the CARD Act. And so I'm bullish about the redistribution and the strength of the revenue model as the business changes, but we also are putting into our planning effect that the expectation that resilience will be somewhat diminished."

And as you suggest in the first quarter, pretty much all of the reduction in the suppression was in the finance charge and fee reserve, and think of that like an allowance. So we're definitely seeing those numbers come down. The big reasons for the big step change this quarter were twofold. First, we assessed many fewer fees, and we're not going to suppress unless we obviously are assessing the fees, and fees were down in terms of assessments because of lower overlimit fees assessed in line with the CARD Act. A continued decline in the overall balances, and frankly, continued general improvement in consumer behavior has had a downward impact on the assessment of penalty fees. So lower quantum of fees is driving that reserve down. Secondly, like with an allowance, the credit improvement that we're seeing in loan principal, we're also seeing in the delinquency rate on finance charges and fees. So with the improvement in the consumer credit behavior there, that's going to draw down the need for reserves. So in that case, we could see further declines going forward. I would be surprised if we saw a step change as large as this one. Again, it's being impacted by the one-time effect of a major change coming from the CARD Act, but it could continue to come down. Finally, in terms of where we're going, I would certainly believe that the finance charge reserve will always exist. In fact, the redistribution of income suggests that's going to be a larger portion of our business. So yes, that number will go down and go up over time. But I think going forward, we shouldn't expect to see a big step change like we did in this past quarter."

And so if you notice with the acquisitions that we've done, we have gone into attractive markets with a starting position that really has -- well, it's well beyond threshold scale and has a real shot at being one of the ultimate and large players in each market, and that's extremely important for an institution that's not of the scale of the really large banks. So our big focus right now is on pulling these banks together, building a scalable infrastructure and what the regulators would call, ""Top 10 bank capability,"" which is something that's really quite different from what any bank of the size of banks we buy. They're at a very different level of scalability. So it's a big effort to pull this together and create sort of truly scalable infrastructure, and that is -- we're well along in the process of doing that, and that's a very top priority. Along the way, we are really building up the capability to be able to grow our bank within our local markets and generate significant deposit growth, loan growth and ultimately, growing returns. So that's the top priority. Now it's not lost on us along the way that a lot of banks have been struggling around the country, and that there could be opportunities for particularly attractive deals. I mean, you saw that in fact, during The Great Recession, we bought Chevy Chase. We always take a look at things like that but I want you to know that it's not a sense of manifest destiny. We've got to get there to any particular market. The real sense is the manifest destiny we're pursuing is to make sure that we have a very well-running scalable bank that's able to take advantage of the considerably unique advantages Capital One brings to the table to leverage a large customer base, a huge national lending business, a national brand and the kind of information-based capabilities that we have."

Obviously, we need to have a view about where rates are going, and let's just assume that today's yield curve is giving an accurate reflection of future rates. Meaning that they're going to be going up. I think that means that there is a considerably less scope at this point for continued improvement in our cost of funds. I would say, again assuming the curve is a good predictor of where rates are going in the short run, I'd say there's some room for a modest decline in cost of funds over the balance of 2010. We do have some continued runoff of higher-cost term funding that would be in the form of auto securitizations and some of our retail time deposits. And at the margin as you can see, we're replacing all of these maturing funds with lower-cost liquid deposits. So I'd say in the short run, room for a modest decline in cost of funds compared to the improvements we've seen over the course over the last year or so. And from there on, it's really going to be a matter of what happens to the curve. Now in terms of operating expenses, what we've said at the top of the house that you should expect to see that operating expenses, that is non-interest expense minus marketing, should stay on an annual basis, with a little bit of quarterly up and down, should stay more or less constant from 2009 to 2010. And essentially, what you're seeing there is continued investment particularly in the infrastructure of our bank as we move towards full integration and really trying to get traction there. And that will be offset by continuing efficiencies that we're having throughout the company, continuing the benefits we've seen from some significant efficiency work over the course of the last couple of years. So top of the house, you should expect to see operating expenses stay in and around current levels with a little bit of quarterly variability as you saw up in the fourth quarter, down in the first, and we'll see a little bit more of that over the course of the year."

So there's a lot of -- I think everybody has a different strategy but in the end, I think the subprime percentage, interestingly, is fairly similar. Our mix over the last year or so, and probably consistent with my expectation, would be flattish to declining a little bit in that marketplace. So it's certainly not something we are planning to leap into and where you would see a big change. A thing that I said earlier was that after The Great Recession and the great regulation and legislation, in a sense, when we look at our business model, other than a redistribution of where pricing comes from, which generally by the way is a healthy redistribution that I embraced for the marketplace, the same strategies we were pursuing before in the same segments are pretty much what you should expect from us. And so the biggest wildcard to me is -- the two biggest uncertainties going forward, which really not about mix, because I think our mix, I would expect it to be pretty similar to what has been over the past number of years, and has been pretty stable for quite a long period of time. The biggest uncertainties to me are consumer demand like I talked about, and that one, we can argue all sides of it, so we'll just have to see. And the other very important one, Mike, is pricing in the revolver segment, go-to pricing. Because in this last past decade, the industry has slipped through its practices into a rather weak underwriting habit of originating at lower rate and letting repricing take care of it on the other end. It is profoundly important that our investors and our industry understand that this is not how it's going to work going forward. Will there never be -- there will still be repricing in the sense there can be forward repricing, and in its own natural way, that will always be a component of the business. But the defining issue is that while people can use TCE rates all they want, the go-to rate of APR has a very important destination importance to it that it used to have in the '90s but sort of didn't have so much in the last decade. We are watching that like a hawk. We're watching it in every single segment, every single subsegment. The good news is that it's going up from the beginning. The first couple of months of '09 to 2010 has gone up 300 basis points, that's a good thing, while the primary has basically stayed flat. So you can see the market moving. So the other thing that's going to impact our growth will be watching where that destination go-to rate goes to, and we are going to be managing our business, very much building resilience into our pricing. How much growth we have in particular segments is really going to be driven on whether the industry prices prudently, so that's the other one to watch. And when all the dust settles, Mike, I think, probably our mix of our business and the type of things we're marketing -- to the customers, we're marketing is going to be pretty much the same."

Our business practices in the NSF/OD space are in line compared with other banks. But because the size of our retail bank in comparison to our overall company versus that ratio for most of the people that we compete against, the impact of this legislation on our earnings is probably going to be less. I mean it's something less than 2% of our revenue that, in aggregate, it represents. So we've made important changes in our overdraft policies, which we disclosed on our website if you'd like to look at those, since -- frankly, right when we got into banking, one of our first meetings was we wanted to take a look in the same way we try to look at practices in the current business, we took a look and started letting some of the air out of those practices way back then. But we have made some other recent changes which you can find in our website. So if I pull way up, Moshe, I sort of philosophically feel the same way about this that I do about some of the card practices.
