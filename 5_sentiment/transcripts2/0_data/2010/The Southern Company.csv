As you can see from the information we released this morning, we had a good quarter and a solid year of business results. Despite the economic headwinds of 2009, we continued to",775,"Thanks, Glen and good afternoon, and thank you to all of you for joining us. As you can see from the information we released this morning, we had a good quarter and a solid year of business results. Despite the economic headwinds of 2009, we continued to build out high-quality infrastructure and provide high levels of customer service at affordable prices. We also continued to set operational, regulatory and financial milestones, which are the hallmarks of our commitment to our customers and our shareholders.On the Operational side of our business, our fossil and our hydro generation organization achieved an industry-leading peak season Equivalent Forced Outage Rate of 1.44% against the industry average E4 rate of approximately 7%. During 2009, we completed seven major environmental construction projects, including four scrubber installations and with an in-service cost of 29% below the industry average.On the Transmission & Distribution side of our business, 2009 was the best year in our history for reliability performance. We also made significant progress on the installation of automated meters, installing more than 1 million smart meters, bringing the total number deployed to over 1.9 million, against our target of 4.5 million meters by 2012.In our Nuclear business, the early site work for Units 3 and 4 plant Vogtle is well underway on support buildings, water pipe installation and concrete batch plant. We've removed more than 3 million cubic yards of dirt to an average depth of 54 feet for the reactor building.On the regulatory side of our Retail business, we had a constructive year. At Alabama Power, base rates in 2010 will begin to reflect the recovery of costs associated with the return of 1,200 megawatts of fossil capacity to retail service. This capacity had been previously dedicated to our wholesale business. Retail base rates in 2010 will also begin to reflect the in-service status of four large scrubbers. This increases in the retail base rates will be more than fully offset by fuel rate decreases, resulting in a net 7.4% decrease in retail rates. At Georgia Power, we received certification for the Vogtle 3 and 4 units. Both the Georgia Legislature and the public service commission authorized the use of construction work in progress and rate base for nuclear construction. In addition, Georgia Power avoided an early rate increase request in 2009 by receiving approval from the Public Service Commission to amortize a regulatory liability account. This partially offsets the decline of retail revenues in 2009 and 2010. Gulf Power Company received regulatory approval for the recovery of a major scrubber project at Plant Crist, and an 885-megawatt purchase power agreement. Rate impacts at Gulf Power in 2010 will be mitigated by a recently-approved fuel rate decrease of 3.5%.Finally, Mississippi Power received a favorable outcome on the need to request for additional generating capacity. We've proposed to meet this need with the Kemper County IGCC facility, and expect a decision by May 1 of this year. If approved by the commission, construction could begin later this year with an in-service date targeted for 2014.Turning now to Southern Power, in October, we announced that Southern Power agreed to acquire Nacogdoches Power LLC from American Renewables, the original developer of the project. We are moving forward with construction of the 100-megawatt biomass facility, with completion expected in 2012. The asset has a 20-year PPA with Austin Energy, which serves the city of Austin, Texas.Also in December 2009, Southern Power closed on the acquisition of the West Georgia generating assets from LS Power, in exchange for our DeSoto facility and $144 million in cash. In addition, Southern Power completed the construction of Stanton B, a 300-megawatt combined cycle plant for the Orlando Utilities Commission, bringing the unit in ahead of schedule. Finally at Southern Power, construction began last year on the Cleveland County Generation Plant in North Carolina, a 720-megawatt combustion turbine facility. Purchase power agreements are in place for the public power entities in North Carolina, and commercial operation is expected in early 2012.On the financial side of our business, we also performed well. First on the cost-containment initiatives throughout the company, our cost-containment initiatives throughout the company resulted in the $230 million reduction in operation and maintenance expenses compared to 2008. During 2009, we issued $1.3 billion in new equity through our various plans, including the continuous equity offering program or dribble. On the debt side, we issued $3 billion in long-term debt, with an average interest rate of 3.6% at an average maturity of 19 years. At this point, I'll turn the call over to Paul, who will continue to review our financial performance for 2009 and provide earnings guidance for 2010."

First, I'll review our fourth quarter and full year 2009 results. Then I'll discuss our capital budget, our financial results and requirements, our economic outlook, and conclude with guidance for the full year and the first quarter of 2010.In the fourth quarter of 2009, we reported $0.31 per share, that's an increase of $0.07 per share from the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding adjustments related to our leverage leases in 2008, we earned $0.31 per share in the fourth quarter of 2009 or an average increase of $0.05 per share, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year, we reported $2.07 per share, a decrease of $0.19 per share over the prior year. Excluding adjustments related to our leverage leases in 2008 and a merit settlement in 2009, we earned $2.32 per share in 2009, or a decrease of $0.05 per share over our results for 2008.Now let's turn to the major factors that drove our numbers for the full year compared with 2008, excluding leverage leases adjustment in 2008 and the merit settlement in 2009. First, I'll cover the negative factors, here's a breakdown. The reduction in retail sales had a negative impact of $0.19 per share on our earnings in 2009 compared to the full year in 2008. Lower usage in sales was particularly evident in the Industrial segment, which I will cover in more detail in a few minutes. Higher interest expense in 2009 reduced our earnings by $0.05 a share, compared to the prior year. Weather reduced our earnings by $0.02 per share in 2009 compared with 2008. Weather in 2009 was a negative $0.03 per share compared to normal, and weather in 2008 was a negative $0.01 per share, for a total of a minus $0.02 per share. Taxes other than income taxes reduced earnings $0.02 per share in 2009, compared to 2008.Increased depreciation and amortization due primarily to increased environmental, transmission and distribution investments reduced our earnings by $0.05 per share in 2009 compared with 2008. Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.06 per share in 2009, compared to the prior year. Now let's turn to the positive factors that drove our earnings in 2009. Lower, non-fuel O&M expenses added $0.15 per share to our earnings in 2009 compared to the prior year. We were able to reduce O&M spending in our traditional operating companies by $187 million compared to 2008, and as David said, $230 million in the overall business. Going forward, we expect to see a permanent O&M reduction of $100 million, which will affect the rate of growth in our O&M overtime. Other revenue effect, that is $0.11 per share in 2009 over 2008, primarily due to increased monthly service charges and revenues associated with the recovery of investment in environmental equipment, partially offset by lower market response rates to lower it's commercial and industrial customers, which had a negative impact of $0.25 per share, so the net effect was a positive $0.11 per share.Other income and deductions, mainly AFUDC, contributed $0.04 per share to our earnings in 2009, compared to 2008. Parent company and other added $0.03 a share compared to 2008. Finally, Southern Power added $0.01 per share to our earnings in 2009 compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to new contracts, energy margins and construction performance on the Stanton B                                                                                      project. So in conclusion, we had $0.39 per share of negative earnings drivers and $0.34 per share of positive earnings drivers, compared to 2008. Overall, excluding leverage lease adjustments in 2008 and the merit settlement in 2009, our year came in at $2.32 per share compared to $2.37 per share, or a decrease of $0.05 per share.Turning now to our capital budget. Our capital expenditures for the three-year period of 2010, 2011 and 2012 are expected to be $16.4 billion. In this budget, we have included $14.5 billion for our traditional operating company. The major categories in this budget are: $2.1 billion for the construction of Units 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle; $800 million for the completion of the three McDonough combined cycle units in Georgia; $1.8 billion for the construction of the Kemper County IGCC project in Mississippi; $4.2 billion for maintaining and expanding our transmission and distribution network, including Smart Grid investment; $2.4 billion for environmental controls, which includes weapon $1.4 billion for seven scrubber installations.As you can see, we've included $1.9 billion of capital at Southern Power. However of this amount, some $1.2 billion is targeted for potential acquisitions, so this should be considered discretionary capital. So the overall capital budget for 2010 through 2012 is $16.4 billion, reflecting the requirements needed to meet the long-term growth of the region plus environmental and reliability requirements.Our external financing needs continue to be driven, primarily by our capital expenditures. We expect to issue a mix of fixed income securities and equity that support our A-credit rating. As David mentioned earlier, we issued $1.3 billion of new equity in 2009. As we evaluate our overall 2010 cash flow forecast, including potential benefits, such as bonus depreciation which could arise from the stimulus legislation, there is a possibility that we will be able to meet our equity needs solely through our traditional employee and southern investment plan. These plans have historically provided $400 million to $500 million equity per year. However, we will keep our continuous equity offering program in place in order to provide flexibility in how we meet our needs in 2010 and beyond. On the debt side, we plan to issue approximately $6.9 billion in long-term debt over the three-year period, with $3.7 billion in new money and $3.2 billion in maturities. Turning now to a discussion of the economy. We'll begin with our customer sales data, which will all be reported as weather adjusted. Total sales decreased by 4.5% in 2009, compared to the full year in 2008. Industrial sales were down 11.7% in 2009 compared with 2008. We had an increase in industrial sales in the third quarter due largely to the Cash for Clunkers program. In the fourth quarter, sales declined by 6.8% as compared to the third quarter of 2009.Commercial sales declined 1.2% in 2009, compared to the prior year. As expected, sales in the commercial segment continued to weaken in the fourth quarter, declining by 1%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Residential sales in 2009 remained basically flat in relation to 2008, with a slight decrease in sales of 0.7%.Southern Company benefits from a strong customer mix with a good balance between residential, commercial and industrial sectors. On the industrial side, nearly two-thirds of our sales have derived from six major categories. Non-manufacturing, which is our largest segment, is driven by energy used from pipelines, coal mining and natural gas processing facilities. On the commercial side, office buildings and retail outlets account for nearly 40% of the sales.Traditionally, the Southeastern economy has been driven by vibrant and expanding industrial base that has been supported by relatively low cost of business, an excellent transportation network and a modern infrastructure. In turn, a growing economy has encouraged strong migration to the region, which has helped drive residential and commercial activity. The great recession, as it has been called, has interrupted these trends, but we do not believe it has permanently altered the competitive advantages of the region. For 2010, we are forecasting an increase in total retail sales of 1.8%, which reflects the continuing recovery in the economy. We are forecasting a 2.6% increase in industrial sales in 2010 compared to last year. This increase should outpace U.S. industrial activity, reflecting newer, more efficient manufacturing facilities in the Southeast, as well as an increase in export activity. Residential sales are expected to increase by 2.5% in 2010 over 2009, as we continue to work off excess housing inventory and see more inward migration to the region.The commercial sector will continue to be sluggish, but we expect to see a slight increase in 2010. In 2009, we focused on providing you with as much transparency on the economy as possible. We wanted you to know what our economic data and our customers were telling us. Earlier this month, we reconvened our panel of economists and industry representatives to get their latest perspective on the economic outlook for 2010. The observations of the panel can be summarized with four major conclusions. The economy seems to have stabilized over the past four to five months, sales of existing cones [ph] have increased and some industrial sectors such as primary metals and chemicals are seeing high rates of capacity utilization. Economic activity in 2010 will be muted with a GDP growth rate between 2% and 3%. Unemployment will continue to remain high as businesses are reluctant to hire new workers and consumers are hesitant to spend. As a result, there was little enthusiasm on the part of the panel for robust growth in the next six months, but more optimism over the next 12 to 18 months.  A sustained economic recovery will require the growth of the private-sector jobs who support consumer spending and industrial production. At least 3% GDP growth will be needed to increase employment. Worldwide, economic growth and the low value of the dollar are creating export opportunities for manufacturers, which means the Southeast is still better positioned than most other regions of the country. So in conclusion, as we've been saying, a slow recovery slope resembling a Nike swoosh is still the best way to describe this economic recovery.Turning now to our earnings guidance for 2010. I should note that despite the economic challenges we faced in 2009, we delivered on the guidance range of $2.30 to $2.45 per share. Last January, we expanded the range of our guidance due to the uncertainty of the depth and severity of the recession. Today, while we believe there is less uncertainty over the economy than there was at this time last year, it's important to remember that we are still in early stages of the recovering from this major recession.  In addition, we are in the final year of a three-year rate plan at our largest subsidiary, Georgia Power. So for 2010, our guidance range is $2.30 to $2.36 per share, and our earnings estimate for the first quarter of 2010 is $0.42 per share.Turning now to our financial goals. To achieve our objective of providing shareholders a superior risk-adjusted return over the long term, our financial plan assumes top quartile ROE performance, which in turn supports a strong stable dividend and industry-leading financial integrity. Our goal is to grow the dividend in a regular, predictable and sustainable manner consistent with a long-term target payout ratio of approximately 65% to 70%, since 2005, we've grown our dividend annually by 4%.  Finally in the long term, we remain focused on growing earnings-per-share at an average of 6%. At this point, I'll turn the call back over to David for his closing remarks."

As you've seen, despite 2009's economic challenges, it's a year of significant operational, regulatory and financial achievement. Furthermore, we budgeted some $14.5 billion over the next three years to continue investment at our traditional business, consistent with our vision of a cleaner fleet of existing facilities, more than 4,000 megawatts of new generation with a lower carbon footprint and a smarter, more efficient electric grid. This commitment reflects our strong and unwavering belief about the long-term future growth and development of our region.Finally, looking outside of our traditional business, you may have seen the announcement yesterday that we are partnering with a visionary business leader, well-known environmentalist, Ted Turner, to pursue the development of Renewable Energy projects in North America. Southern Company and Turner Renewable Energy, a company owned by Ted Turner, have signed a memorandum of understanding and formed an alliance for the development of Renewable Energy projects in the United States. The initial focus will be on large scale, solar photovoltaic projects. As you may know, that is the largest individual land owner in the United States, and owns approximately 2 million acres of land. The Southern Turner alliance will bring together the project development, financial and operating shrinks of Southern Company, with the land resources and constructive environmental leadership of Ted Turner. We believe the partnership unites two visionary parties in the goal to develop a new generation of energy projects. At this point, Paul and I are ready to take your questions, so Sarah, we will take the first question."

It has performance guarantees from the manufacturers that guarantee the output versus wind where it's more volumetric and you're taking a lot of risk in terms of any type of contract you get on the offtake.

You're right in that some of the effort was simply to postpone expenses, so that ultimately, you have to do maintenance or you have to do vegetation management. And if you look at our numbers that we've put together this year for O&M, as Paul said, we're returning for a normal levels of O&M. For example, we're moving back to normal salary increases, and we are also back to normal O&M levels on our fleet and on our transportation and distribution system. So we can postpone things for a while. We will continue to maintain our vigilance around the opportunities for productivity and efficiency and delaying or trying to avoid to travel and meeting expenses and things like that. So we want to be aggressive about cost containment. But the fact of the matter is that the O&M levels have to go back up to more normal levels."

Our excellent first quarter results were significantly influenced by weather and the slow but steady economic recovery here in the Southeast. On January 11, we set a new winter system peak demand of 37,224 megawatts. The average temperature across our service territory that day was 18 degrees. This winter peak surpassed our 2009 summer peak of 36,505 megawatts. As you know, our peak period on the southern system normally occurs in the summer.  I'm pleased to note that our generation and transmission system performed extremely well during this period for our 4.4 million customers.
Since our last earnings call in January, we've had some significant new developments related to our two new nuclear units under construction at plant Vogtle. In February, the Department of Energy announced that Georgia Power has been offered a conditional commitment for loan guarantees for the construction of Units 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle. Both the Georgia Public Service Commission and the Georgia Legislature have been very supportive of our plans to build the nation's first new nuclear plant in more than three decades. We believe that the administration support for the nuclear energy is vital in helping meet our nation's future energy requirements.
Under the current DOE schedule, we have until mid-May to accept the nonbinding conditional commitment. Discussions are underway to secure a one-month extension to the schedule, which will give us additional time for further due diligence.
The loans are expected to cover approximately 3.4 billion or 70% of Georgia Power's eligible projected cost for Plant Vogtle. It's important to note that the execution of the loan guarantees and actual borrowings will not occur before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issues the combined construction and operating license for the project. Although specific numbers cannot be determined yet, we expect the loans will save us approximately $15 million to $20 million per year. The loans will benefit our customers and the company through interest savings, as well as providing approximately $3.4 billion of committed debt financing.
At this point, I'll now turn the call over to Paul Bowers, our Chief Financial Officer, for a discussion of our financial highlights for the first quarter and our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2010."

In the first quarter of 2010, we reported $0.60 a share compared with $0.16 a share in the first quarter of 2009, or an increase of $0.44 a share. The 2009 result includes a merit  litigation charge of $0.26 per share. Excluding the 2009 merit charge, our earnings were $0.60 per share in the first quarter of 2010, compared with $0.42 per share in the first quarter of 2009, or an increase of $0.18 per share.
Let's turn now to the major factors that drove our first quarter numbers compared with the first quarter of 2009. First, the negative factors.  Non-fuel O&M reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the first quarter of 2009. Increased maintenance costs for our fossil hydro fleet , where five of our flagship units underwent scheduled maintenance in the first quarter of 2010, compared with one unit in the first quarter of 2009. Total plant outage days in the first quarter of 2010 were 94 compared to 11 outage days in 2009 for these large units.
At Southern Power, the expiration of contracts for two combined cycle units in Georgia reduced our earnings by $0.02 per share, compared with the first quarter of 2009. One of these units will be under contract beginning in June 2010, while the other unit will be sold into the spot-and-forward energy markets. It's important to note, however, that 84% of Southern Power's generation is currently under long-term contracts. Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the first quarter of 2009.
Now let's turn to the positive factors that drove our earnings for the first quarter of 2010. Colder-than-normal winter weather in the first quarter added $0.10 per share to our earnings for the period, compared with the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter of this year was the third coldest in more than 100 years for the southeast United States. The average temperature was 5.4 degrees lower than the 15-year average, resulting in a 10.3% increase in total energy sales as compared with the first quarter of 2009. Increased usage and better-than-expected economic activity, primarily in the industrial sector, added $0.03 a share to our earnings in the first quarter compared with the same period in 2009.
Other revenue effects in our Traditional business added a total of $0.04 a share to our earnings in the first quarter compared with the first quarter of 2009. This impact was driven primarily by revenue changes related to the recovery of environmental expenses and other investments at our operating companies.
Depreciation and amortization added $0.04 per share to our earnings in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the prior period. This increase was driven primarily by amortization of excess cost of removal obligations at Georgia Power approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission last year.
Increased wholesale sales and transmission revenues in our Traditional business added $0.03 a share to our earnings in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009. Recondition of certain State of Georgia tax credits added $0.02 a share to our earnings in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009.
In conclusion, we had $0.08 of negative items compared with $0.26 of positive items, or a positive change of $0.18 per share over the first quarter of 2009, excluding the 2009 merit settlement charge. So overall, our quarter came in at $0.60 per share.
Before I discuss our earnings estimate for the second quarter, I'd like to update you on the economy, our dividend policy and regulatory issues.  The improving economy saw industrial sales increase by 6.7% in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the first quarter of 2009. Quarter-over-quarter, the most significant increases were in primary metals, up 35.5%; transportation, up 13.6%; and chemicals, up 9.5% as compared to the first quarter of 2009. The increased consumption by the primary metals sector reflects an improved demand for rolled steel by the transportation sector, and steel piping for gas and oil exploration.
In addition, the new ThyssenKrupp steel facility in Alabama has begun receiving steel slabs from Germany for processing. All of the major automobile manufacturers in our service area are reporting stronger demand for their products. Year-over-year production at Honda has doubled. Hyundai has increased production by 65%, and Mercedes has increased output at its facility by 1/3.  The Kia plant in West Georgia is now in full operation, whereas in the first quarter of 2009, it was still preparing to start up production. 
Adjusting for weather, residential sales increased by 1.6% in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009.  Building permits are up by 4.5% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period last year. This increased activity showed influence in new connect, which we believe have bottomed-out at an annual rate of $24,000. This activity combined with the fact that household creation in our service area is outpacing the U.S. by 40%, and should result in positive customer growth for the future.
As expected, commercial sales remained our weakest sector, declining 0.3% on a weather basis in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the first quarter of 2009. Customer growth in the commercial sector had seen a year-over-year decline, as many small businesses have closed their doors as a result of this recession.
The vacancy rate for offices of 22.6% has increased slightly from the year ending 2009 rate of 21.5%, due in part to the opening of three new commercial high-rise buildings in Atlanta, adding to an already oversupply of market for office space.
On the positive side of commercial sales, electricity demand by data centers is up 6.9%, reflecting the decision to locate these businesses in the southeast due to lower costs and reliable supply of energy. In addition, electricity consumption by hotels increased by 11.2%, which indicate that convention activity and business travel has begun to increase.
In summary, the residential and commercial sectors are performing according to our forecast. Sales to the industrial sector in the first quarter are ahead of plan. However, it should be noted that a comparison to the first quarter of 2009 reflects a period in which industrial sales were experiencing a significant impact from the recession. 
Now I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss our dividend increase. As you may have seen last week, we announced a 4% annual dividend increase effective with our second quarter dividend payment in June. The dividend is now $0.00455 per share on a quarterly basis, and $1.82 per share annually. This marks the 250th consecutive quarter that Southern Company has paid a dividend to its common stockholders. In fact, every year for the past 62 years, Southern Company has paid a quarterly dividend equal to or higher than the previous quarter's dividend.  Our decision to raise the dividend this year reflects our confidence in the long-term future of our business. 
While we are comfortable operating in the 75% payout range, our long-term objective remains to achieve a payout ratio at or below 70%. Our dividend and our long-term earnings per share growth, coupled with the stable A credit rating, are key components of our overall value proposition.
Finally, the last item addresses two system regulatory issues. As you may know, Georgia Power's current three-year rate settlement will expire on December 31 of this year. Georgia Power will file a new rate case on July 1. We expect a six-month proceeding with a decision sometime in December. As always, we will keep you updated on the progress of this important matter.
In Mississippi, the Mississippi Public Service Commission is expected to issue an order by Monday on our proposal to construct a 582-megawatt coal gasification facility. The commission has already approved the need for the additional capacity. This decision concerns a type of generation that will be built to meet that they need. We will, of course, communicate that decision to you after we receive the commission's order.
Turning now to our earnings guidance for 2010. Our first quarter results exceeded our estimate by $0.18 a share. As we've discussed, the quarter was largely influenced by weather, and to a lesser extent, the gradual economic recovery we are seeing here in the southeast. We are to be sure off to a good start in 2010. However, questions remain about the strength and sustainability of the economic recovery. As you know, the majority of our earnings are derived in the warmer months during the second and third quarters. Therefore, our guidance will remain at $2.30 to $2.36 per share.  Finally, our estimate for the second quarter is $0.56 per share.
At this point, I'll turn the call back to David for his closing remarks."

While we're optimistic, we're still mindful that we're still in the early stages of this economic recovery.
In January, you might recall that we announced a strategic alliance between Southern Company and Ted Turner to proceed development of a renewable energy project in the United States. Last month, Southern-Turner partnership announced the Cimarron Project, a 30-megawatt facility capable of supplying electricity to 9,000 homes. That will be one of the nation's largest solar photovoltaic power plants. The plant will be built by First Solar Inc. and located in Northern New Mexico. The output from this facility will serve a 25-year power purchase agreement with the Tri-state Generation and Transmission Association. The Cimarron Project is an example of our entry into renewable energy projects, which fit our overall business strategy and risk profile. 
We will take a measured and disciplined approach to potential growth in this business, while remaining true to the business model that we use in Southern Power, that is long-term contract for output with credit-worthy counterparties.
At this point, Paul and I are ready to take your questions. So Rachel, we'll now take the first question."

I'd like to see the typical industrial supplies to the residential portion of our customer base begin to gear up. We think as Paul said, that the residential situation has bottomed-out, and we're back on the positive note. We talked about our rate of 24,000 reconnects. That's a long way from where we were several years ago, a couple of years ago. So I'd like to see a little more strengthening across the entire industrial -- I know that if we get the consumer re-engaged in automobiles and housing, then obviously that industrial sector will follow. We also know that the commercial sector typically is the last to go in and the last to come out.

Our excellent first quarter results were significantly influenced by weather and the slow, but steady economic recovery here in the Southeast. On January 11, we set a new winter system peak demand of 37, 224 megawatts. The average temperature across our service territory that day was 18 degrees. This winter peak surpassed our 2009 summer peak of 36,505 megawatts.
As you know, our peak period on the Southern system normally occurs in the summer. I'm pleased to note that our generation and transmission system performed extremely well during this period for our 4.4 million customers.
Since our last earnings call in January, we've had some significant new developments related to our two new nuclear units under construction at Plant Vogtle. In February, the Department of Energy announced that Georgia Power has been offered a conditional commitment for loan guarantees for the construction of units 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle.
Both the Georgia Public Service Commission and the Georgia Legislature have been very supportive of our plans to build the nation's first new nuclear plant in more than three decades. We believe that the administration support for the nuclear energy is vital in helping meet our nation's future energy requirements.
Under the current DOE schedule, we have until mid-May to accept the non-binding conditional commitment. Discussions are underway to secure a one month extension to the schedule, which will give us additional time for further due diligence.
The loans are expected to cover approximately $3.4 billion or 70% of Georgia Power's eligible projected cost for Plant Vogtle. It's important to note that the execution of the loan guarantees and actual borrowings will not occur before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issues the combined construction and operating license of the project.
Although specific numbers cannot be determined yet, we expect the loans will save us approximately $15 million to $20 million per year. The loans will benefit our customers and the company through interest savings as well as providing approximately $3.4 billion of committed debt financing.
At this point, I'll now turn the call over to Paul Bowers, our Chief Financial Officer, for a discussion of our financial highlights for the first quarter and our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2010.

In the first quarter of 2010, we reported $0.60 a share compared with $0.16 a share in the first quarter of 2009 or an increase of $0.44 a share. The 2009 result includes a Mirant litigation settlement charge of $0.26 per share. Excluding the 2009 Mirant charge, our earnings were $0.60 per share in the first quarter of 2010 compared with $0.42 per share in the first quarter of 2009 or an increase of $0.18 per share.
Let's turn now to the major factors that drove our first quarter numbers compared with the first quarter of 2009. First; the negative factors. Non-fuel O&M reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the first quarter of 2009. Increase in maintenance cost for our fossil and hydro fleet, where five of our flagship units underwent scheduled maintenance in the first quarter of 2010 compared with one unit in the first quarter of 2009. Total planned outage days in the first quarter of 2010 were 94 compared to 11 outage days in 2009 for these large units.
At Southern Power, the expiration of contracts for two combined-cycle units in Georgia reduced our earnings by $0.02 per share compared with the first quarter of 2009. One of these units will be under contract beginning in June 2010, while the other unit will be sold into the spot and forward energy markets. It's important to note, however, that 84% of Southern Power's generation is currently under long-term contract.
Finally, the increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the first quarter of 2009.
Now, let's turn to the positive factors that drove our earnings for the first quarter of 2010. Colder than normal winter weather in the first quarter added $0.10 per share to our earnings for the period, compared with the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter of this year was the third coldest in more than 100 years for the southeast United States. The average temperature was 5.4 degrees lower than the 15-year average, resulting in a 10.3% increase in total energy sales as compared with the first quarter of 2009.
Increased usage and better than expected economic activity, primarily in the industrial sector, added $0.03 a share to our earnings in the first quarter compared with the same period in 2009. Other revenue effects in our traditional business added a total of $0.04 a share to our earnings in the first quarter compared with the first quarter of 2009. This, in fact, was driven primarily by revenue changes related to the recovery of environmental expenses and other investments at our operating companies.
Depreciation and amortization added $0.04 per share to our earnings in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the prior period. This increase was driven primarily by amortization of excess cost of removal obligations at Georgia Power approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission last year.
Increased wholesale sales and transmission revenues in our traditional business added $0.03 a share to our earnings in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the same periods in 2009. Recognition of certain state of Georgia tax credits added $0.02 a share to our earnings in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009.
In conclusion, we had $0.08 of negative items compared with $0.26 of positive items or a positive change of $0.18 per share over the first quarter of 2009, excluding the 2009 Mirant settlement charge. So overall, our quarter came in at $0.60 per share.
Before I discuss our earnings estimate for the second quarter, I'd like to update you on the economy, our dividend policy and regulatory issues. The improving economy saw industrial sales increased by 6.7% in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the first quarter of 2009. Quarter-over-quarter, the most significant increases were in primary metals up 35.5%, transportation up 13.6% and chemicals up 9.5% as compared to the first quarter of 2009.
The increased consumption by the primary metal sector reflects an improved demand for rolled steel by the transportation sector and steel piping for gas and oil exploration. In addition, the new ThyssenKrupp steel facility in Alabama has begun receiving steel slabs from Germany for processing. All of the major automobile manufacturers in our service area are reporting stronger demand for their products. Year-over-year production at Honda has doubled. Hyundai has increased production about 65% and Mercedes has increased output at its facility by one-third. The Kia plant in West Georgia is now in full operation, whereas in the first quarter of 2009 it was still preparing to start up production.
Adjusting for weather, residential sales increased by 1.6% in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. Building permits are up by 4.5 % in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period last year. This increased activity should influence new connects, which we believe have bottomed out at an annual rate of 24,000. This activity, combined with the fact that household creation in our service area is outpacing the US by 40% and should result in positive customer growth for the future.
As expected, commercial sales remained our weakest sector, declining 0.3% on a weather normal basis in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the first quarter of 2009. Customer growth in the commercial sector has seen a year-over-year decline as many small businesses have closed their doors as a result of this recession.
The vacancy rate for offices of 22.6% has increased slightly from the year ending 2009 rate of 21.5% due in part to the opening of three new commercial high-rise buildings in Atlanta, adding to an already oversupplied market for office space.
On the positive side of commercial sales, electricity demand by data centers is up 6.9%, reflecting the decision to locate these businesses in the Southeast due to lower costs and reliable supply of energy. In addition, electricity consumption by hotels increased by 11.2%, which indicate that convention activity and business travel has begun to increase.
In summary, the residential and commercial sectors are performing according to our forecast. Sales to the industrial sector in the first quarter are ahead of plan. However, it should be noted that a comparison to the first quarter of 2009 reflects a period in which industrial sales were experiencing a significant impact from the recession.
Now, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss our dividend increase. As you may have seen last week, we announced a 4% annual dividend increase, effective with our second quarter dividend payment in June. The dividend is now $0.455 per share on a quarterly basis and $1.82 per share annually.
This marks the 250th consecutive quarter that Southern Company has paid a dividend to its common stockholders. In fact, every year for the past 62 years, Southern Company has paid a quarterly dividend equal to or higher than the previous quarter's dividend. Our decision to raise the dividend this year reflects our confidence in the long-term future of our business. While, we are comfortable operating in a 75% payout range; our long-term objective remains to achieve a payout ratios at or below 70%.
Our dividend and our long-term earnings per share growth, coupled with the stable A credit rating, are key components of our overall value proposition.
Finally, the last item addresses two systems regulatory issues. As you may know, Georgia Power's current three year rate settlement will expire on December 31 of this year. Georgia Power will file a new rate case on July 1. We expect a six month proceeding with a decision sometime in December. As always, we will keep you updated on the progress of this important matter.
In Mississippi, the Mississippi Public Service Commission is expected to issue an order by Monday on our proposal to construct a 582 megawatt coal gasification facility. The Commission has already approved the need for the additional capacity. This decision concerns the type for generation that will be built to meet that they need. We will, of course, communicate that decision to you after receipt of the Commission's order.
Turing now to our earnings guidance for 2010; our first quarter results exceeded our estimate by $0.18 a share. As we've discussed, the quarter was largely influenced by weather and to a lesser extent the gradual economic recovery we're seeing here in the Southeast. We are, to be sure, off to a good start in 2010. However, questions remain about the strength and sustainability of the economic recovery, as you know, the majority of our earnings are derived in the warmer months during the second and third quarters. Therefore, our guidance will remain at $2.30 to $2.36 per share. Finally, our estimate for the second quarter is $0.56 per share.
At this point, I'll turn the call back to David for his closing remarks.

The economy, as shown by sales to industrial customers, appears to be gaining strength and momentum. While we're optimistic, we're still mindful that we're still in the early stages of this economic recovery.
In January, you might recall that we announced a strategic alliance between Southern Company and Ted Turner to pursue development of a renewable energy project in the United States.
Last month, Southern-Turner partnership announced the Cimarron project, a 30-megawatt facility capable of supplying electricity to 9,000 homes. That will be one of the nation's largest solar photovoltaic power plants. The plant will be built by First Solar Incorporated and located in Northern New Mexico. The output from this facility will serve a 25-year power purchase agreement with Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association.
The Cimarron project is an example of our entry into renewable energy projects which fit our overall business strategy and risk profile. We will take a measured and disciplined approach to potential growth in this business while remaining true to the business model that we use in Southern Power, i.e., long-term contract for output with credit worthy counterparties.
At this point, Paul and I are ready to take your questions. So, Rachel, will now take the first question.

What I want to see is continued expansion of that into the rest of the industrial customer base.
I'd like to see the difficult industrial supplies to the residential portion of our customer base begin to gear up. We think as Paul said that the residential situation has bottomed out and we're back on a positive note. We talked about a rate of 24,000 [e-connect]. That's a long way from where we were several years ago, four years ago. So I'd like to see a little more strengthening across the entire industrial. I know that if we get the consumer reengaged in automobiles and housing, then obviously that industrial sector will follow. We also know that the commercial sector, typically, is the last to go in and the last to come out, so we would expect as we've said for it to continue to be fairly stagnant, even declines are more before we see it rebound hopefully late this year or early next year.

Our excellent first quarter results were significantly influenced by weather and the slow but steady economic recovery here in the Southeast. On January 11, we set a new winter system peak demand of 37,224 megawatts. The average temperature across our service territory that day was 18 degrees. This winter peak surpassed our 2009 summer peak of 36,505 megawatts. As you know, our peak period on the southern system normally occurs in the summer.  I'm pleased to note that our generation and transmission system performed extremely well during this period for our 4.4 million customers.
Since our last earnings call in January, we've had some significant new developments related to our two new nuclear units under construction at plant Vogtle. In February, the Department of Energy announced that Georgia Power has been offered a conditional commitment for loan guarantees for the construction of Units 3 and 4 at Plant Vogtle. Both the Georgia Public Service Commission and the Georgia Legislature have been very supportive of our plans to build the nation's first new nuclear plant in more than three decades. We believe that the administration support for the nuclear energy is vital in helping meet our nation's future energy requirements.
Under the current DOE schedule, we have until mid-May to accept the nonbinding conditional commitment. Discussions are underway to secure a one-month extension to the schedule, which will give us additional time for further due diligence.
The loans are expected to cover approximately 3.4 billion or 70% of Georgia Power's eligible projected cost for Plant Vogtle. It's important to note that the execution of the loan guarantees and actual borrowings will not occur before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issues the combined construction and operating license for the project. Although specific numbers cannot be determined yet, we expect the loans will save us approximately $15 million to $20 million per year. The loans will benefit our customers and the company through interest savings, as well as providing approximately $3.4 billion of committed debt financing.
At this point, I'll now turn the call over to Paul Bowers, our Chief Financial Officer, for a discussion of our financial highlights for the first quarter and our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2010."

In the first quarter of 2010, we reported $0.60 a share compared with $0.16 a share in the first quarter of 2009, or an increase of $0.44 a share. The 2009 result includes a merit  litigation charge of $0.26 per share. Excluding the 2009 merit charge, our earnings were $0.60 per share in the first quarter of 2010, compared with $0.42 per share in the first quarter of 2009, or an increase of $0.18 per share.
Let's turn now to the major factors that drove our first quarter numbers compared with the first quarter of 2009. First, the negative factors.  Non-fuel O&M reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the first quarter of 2009. Increased maintenance costs for our fossil hydro fleet , where five of our flagship units underwent scheduled maintenance in the first quarter of 2010, compared with one unit in the first quarter of 2009. Total plant outage days in the first quarter of 2010 were 94 compared to 11 outage days in 2009 for these large units.
At Southern Power, the expiration of contracts for two combined cycle units in Georgia reduced our earnings by $0.02 per share, compared with the first quarter of 2009. One of these units will be under contract beginning in June 2010, while the other unit will be sold into the spot-and-forward energy markets. It's important to note, however, that 84% of Southern Power's generation is currently under long-term contracts. Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the first quarter of 2009.
Now let's turn to the positive factors that drove our earnings for the first quarter of 2010. Colder-than-normal winter weather in the first quarter added $0.10 per share to our earnings for the period, compared with the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter of this year was the third coldest in more than 100 years for the southeast United States. The average temperature was 5.4 degrees lower than the 15-year average, resulting in a 10.3% increase in total energy sales as compared with the first quarter of 2009. Increased usage and better-than-expected economic activity, primarily in the industrial sector, added $0.03 a share to our earnings in the first quarter compared with the same period in 2009.
Other revenue effects in our Traditional business added a total of $0.04 a share to our earnings in the first quarter compared with the first quarter of 2009. This impact was driven primarily by revenue changes related to the recovery of environmental expenses and other investments at our operating companies.
Depreciation and amortization added $0.04 per share to our earnings in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the prior period. This increase was driven primarily by amortization of excess cost of removal obligations at Georgia Power approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission last year.
Increased wholesale sales and transmission revenues in our Traditional business added $0.03 a share to our earnings in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009. Recondition of certain State of Georgia tax credits added $0.02 a share to our earnings in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009.
In conclusion, we had $0.08 of negative items compared with $0.26 of positive items, or a positive change of $0.18 per share over the first quarter of 2009, excluding the 2009 merit settlement charge. So overall, our quarter came in at $0.60 per share.
Before I discuss our earnings estimate for the second quarter, I'd like to update you on the economy, our dividend policy and regulatory issues.  The improving economy saw industrial sales increase by 6.7% in the first quarter of 2010, compared with the first quarter of 2009. Quarter-over-quarter, the most significant increases were in primary metals, up 35.5%; transportation, up 13.6%; and chemicals, up 9.5% as compared to the first quarter of 2009. The increased consumption by the primary metals sector reflects an improved demand for rolled steel by the transportation sector and steel piping for gas and oil exploration. In addition, the new ThyssenKrupp steel facility in Alabama has begun receiving steel slabs from Germany for processing. 
All of the major automobile manufacturers in our service area are reporting stronger demand for their products. Year-over-year production at Honda has doubled. Hyundai has increased production by 65%, and Mercedes has increased output at its facility by 1/3. The Kia plant in West Georgia is now in full operation, whereas in the first quarter of 2009, it was still preparing to start up production. 
Adjusting for weather, residential sales increased by 1.6% in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the same period of 2009. Building permits are up by 4.5% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the same period last year. This increased activity showed influence in new connect, which we believe have bottomed out at an annual rate of 24,000. This activity combined with the fact that household creation in our service area is outpacing the U.S. by 40% and should result in positive customer growth for the future.
As expected, commercial sales remained our weakest sector, declining 0.3% on a weather-normal basis in the first quarter of 2010 compared with the first quarter of 2009. Customer growth in the commercial sector had seen a year-over-year decline as many small businesses have closed their doors as a result of this recession. The vacancy rate for offices of 22.6% has increased slightly from the year ending 2009 rate of 21.5%, due in part to the opening of three new commercial high-rise buildings in Atlanta, adding to an already oversupply of market for office space.
On the positive side of commercial sales, electricity demand by data centers is up 6.9%, reflecting the decision to locate these businesses in the southeast due to lower costs and reliable supplies of energy. In addition, electricity consumption by hotels increased by 11.2%, which indicate that convention activity and business travel has begun to increase.
In summary, the residential and commercial sectors are performing according to our forecast. Sales to the industrial sector in the first quarter are ahead of plan. However, it should be noted that a comparison to the first quarter of 2009 reflects a period in which industrial sales were experiencing a significant impact from the recession. 
Now I like to take a few minutes to discuss our dividend increase. As you may have seen last week, we announced a 4% annual dividend increase effective with our second quarter dividend payment in June. The dividend is now $0.455 per share on a quarterly basis and $1.82 per share annually. This marks the 250th consecutive quarter that Southern Company has paid a dividend to its common stockholders. In fact, every year for the past 62 years, Southern Company has paid a quarterly dividend equal to or higher than the previous quarter's dividend. Our decision to raise the dividend this year reflects our confidence in the long-term future of our business. 
While we are comfortable operating in its 75% payout range, our long-term objective remains to achieve a payout ratio at or below 70%. Our dividend and our long-term earnings per share growth, coupled with the stable A credit rating, are key components of our overall value proposition.
Finally, the last item addresses two system regulatory issues. As you may know, Georgia Power's current three-year rate settlement will expire on December 31 of this year. Georgia Power will file a new rate case on July 1. We expect a six-month proceeding with a decision sometime in December. As always, we will keep you updated on the progress of this important matter.
In Mississippi, the Mississippi Public Service Commission is expected to issue an order by Monday on our proposal to construct a 582-megawatt coal gasification facility. The commission has already approved the need for the additional capacity. This decision concerns a type of generation that will be built to meet that they need. We will, of course, communicate that decision to you after receipt of the commission's order.
Turning now to our earnings guidance for 2010. Our first quarter results exceeded our estimate by $0.18 a share. As we've discussed, the quarter was largely influenced by weather and, to a lesser extent, the gradual economic recovery we are seeing here in the southeast. We are, to be sure, off to a good start in 2010. However, questions remain about the strength and sustainability of the economic recovery. As you know, the majority of our earnings are derived in the warmer months during the second and third quarters. Therefore, our guidance will remain at $2.30 to $2.36 per share. Finally, our estimate for the second quarter is $0.56 per share.
At this point, I turn the call back to David for his closing remarks."

In January, you might recall that we announced a strategic alliance between Southern Company and Ted Turner to proceed development of a renewable energy project in the United States. Last month, Southern-Turner partnership announced the Cimarron Project, a 30-megawatt facility capable of supplying electricity to 9,000 homes. That will be one of the nation's largest solar photovoltaic power plants. The plant will be built by First Solar Inc. and located in Northern New Mexico. The output from this facility will serve a 25-year power purchase agreement with the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association. 
The Cimarron Project is an example of our entry into renewable energy projects, which fit our overall business strategy and risk profile. We will take a measured and disciplined approach to potential growth in this business, while remaining true to the business model that we use in Southern Power, that is, long-term contract for output with credit-worthy counterparties.
At this point, Paul and I are ready to take your questions. So, Rachel, we'll now take the first question."

I'd like to see the typical industrial supplies to the residential portion of our customer base begin to gear up. We think, as Paul said, that the residential situation has bottomed out, and we're back on a positive note. We talked about our rate of 24,000 new connects. That's a long way from where we were several years ago, a couple of years ago. So I'd like to see a little more strengthening across the entire industrial -- I know that if we get the consumer re-engaged in automobiles and housing, then obviously that industrial sector will follow. We also know that the commercial sector typically is the last to go in and the last to come out. So we would expect, as we've said, for it to continue to be fairly stagnant, even decline some more before we see it rebound, hopefully, late this year or early next year."

As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had a good second quarter, which was influenced by favorable weather and the continuing economic recovery here in the Southeast. Since our last earnings call in April. We've had three significant new regulatory developments in our Retail business, including a rate case filing by Georgia Power. Paul will cover the rate case filing in more detail in a few minutes.
First on May 26, the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved the construction of our 582-megawatt coal gasification project in Kemper County, Mississippi. Yesterday, the South Mississippi Electric Power Association signed an agreement to purchase 17.5% of the plant to fill the projected capacity requirements of its members. 
The plant, which will use Mississippi lignite coal is scheduled to be placed in service in May 2014. The facility has a construction cost estimate of $2.4 billion. The project, which will feature 65% carbon capture capability has qualified for nearly $700 million in federal incentives, including $412 million in investment tax credits and $270 million in clean coal power initiative funding.  In addition, we're in advanced due diligence discussions for federal loan guarantees.  
Mississippi Public Service Commission has also approved the construction work in progress mechanism, which will begin in 2012 and continue through the end of May 2014. We're pleased to now be under construction with the Kemper County project. We believe this plan is clearly the best choice for our customers. And to repeat what Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu, wrote recently and I quote, ""The project is of national importance because it provides a viable option for using our abundant coal resources in a cost-effective manner and reducing power plant emissions.""
My second update concerns our Vogtle nuclear project. Last month, we announced that Southern Company and the Department of Energy agreed to conditional terms on the nuclear loan guarantees in the 3 and 4 Plant Vogtle. Under the conditional agreement, the loan would not exceed 70% of the company's eligible projected cost or approximately $3.4 billion, and is expected to be funded by the Federal Financing Bank. The loan would be full recourse to Georgia Power and secured by lien on the company's 45.7% interest in the two new units. 
The loan is expected to save Georgia Power's customers between $15 million and $20 million annually in interest costs. The actual amount of the interest savings will depend upon the final terms and the timing of this specific borrowing. Final approval and issuance of the loan is subject to the receipt of the combined construction and operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and satisfaction of other conditions.
NRC's current schedule calls for finalization of its design-control document review by October 2011, and we would expect to receive the COL by the end of 2011. As you know, the company received an Early Site Permit and Limited Work Authorization from the NRC in 2009, and site work has been underway since that time.
At this point, I'll turn things over to Paul for a discussion of our financial highlights for the second quarter and our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2010."

First of all, let me say how much I've enjoyed working with all of you as CFO during the past two and a half years. 
Now as David said, our second quarter performance was good. The results continue to highlight the consistency of our business plan to provide regular, predictable and sustainable performance over the long term. In the second quarter 2010, we reported $0.62 a share compared with $0.61 a share in the second quarter of 2009 or an increase of $0.01 a share. Let's turn now to the major factors that drove our second quarter numbers compared to the second quarter of 2009.
First, the negative factors. Non-fuel O&M reduced our earnings by $0.07 a share in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009. This change is primarily due to a return to normal maintenance spending in 2010 for both our fossil and hydro generation fleet and our Transmission and Distribution network. On the generation side, approximately 3,000 more megawatts were involved in plant outages in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2009.
In the second quarter of 2009, we had the early termination of two of our international leveraged-lease investments which resulted in a gain. For the second quarter of 2010, we now show a reduction of $0.03 per share compared to the second quarter of 2009. Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of 2009.
Now let's turn to the positive factors that drove our earnings for the second quarter of 2010. Warmer than normal weather in the second quarter added $0.04 per share earnings for the period compared with the second quarter of 2009. While the first quarter of this year was the coldest winter in 20 years, the second quarter was the warmest spring in 20 years and the fourth warmest in more than a century. Clearly, weather has been a major factor this year and has added $0.14 per share to our earnings compared to the first six months of 2009.
Increased usage in better than expected economic activity primarily in the industrial sector, added $0.04 a earnings in the second quarter compared with the same period in 2009.
Other revenue effect in our Traditional business added a total of $0.02 a share to our earnings in the second quarter, compared with the second quarter of 2009. This impact was driven primarily by revenue changes related to the recovery of environmental expenses and other investments at our operating company.
Reduced depreciation and amortization added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the same period last year. This increase was driven primarily by the continued amortization of excess cost of removal obligations at Georgia Power, approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission beginning in the third quarter of last year. The increase was partially offset by additional depreciation from increased environmental, transmission and distribution investments.
Lower interest expense also added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Increased Transmission revenues in our Traditional business added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009. Investment tax credits at Georgia Power added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009.
In conclusion, we had $0.13 of negative items, compared with $0.14 of positive items or a positive change of $0.01 per share over the second quarter of 2009. So overall, our quarter came in at $0.62 per share.
Before I discuss our earnings estimates for the third quarter, I'd like to update you on the Georgia Power rate case filing, the economy and the impact of the oil spill.
On July 1, as required by its current accounting order, Georgia Power filed a retail rate case with the Georgia Public Service Commission. The requested increase is necessary to cover additional cost of required environmental control and continued investment in new generation, transmissions and distribution facilities to support growth and ensure reliability. 
During the past 15 years, Georgia Power has operated under three-year negotiated rate settlement. The 2010 rate case filing contains proposed enhancements to the current structure. The requested increase of $615 million or 8.2% will be effective January 1, 2011, and is based on a retail return on common equity of 11.95%. The increase would be recovered through Georgia Power's existing base rate tariff, including its environmental compliance cost recovery tariff, the demand side management tariff and the municipal franchise fee tariff.
The filing also proposes an alternative rate plan, which enhances the existing tariffs and proposes two additional base rate tariff. The first proposed new tariff is an Adjustable Cost Recovery Tariff or ACR. If approved, beginning January 1, 2012, the ACR will work to maintain Georgia Power's projected earnings within the ROE band established by the Public Service Commission in this proceeding. The ACR tariff proposal has a symmetrical sharing mechanism, should the company's actual earnings exceed or fall below the approved ROE band.
The second proposed new tariff is a Certified Capacity Cost Recovery Tariff. This tariff is designed to recover certified generation and associated transmission costs, as well as capacity costs of certified Power Purchase Agreement.
If approved, these new tariffs, along with the annual reset of the three existing cost recovery mechanisms would allow the company's rate to adjust more gradually in under another three-year accounting order. Testimony and hearings on the request will begin this fall, and the company expects the Georgia Public Service Commission to issue a final order on the matter during December. We will keep you updated as the case moves forward.
Last week, we had convened another Economic Summit with executives from several of our Industrial segments, including a real transportation company as well as economists from a major private bank and the Atlanta Federal Reserve to discuss the outlook of the economy. Even with a diverse spectrum of industries represented, there was a consensus of opinion in three main areas. 
First, a double-dip recession is unlikely. However, the momentum of the economic recovery is slowing. The general view is that the Southeast is still well positioned for economic growth outpacing the U.S.
Second, residential and commercial construction remains depressed, but the trend shows stabilization in the residential market. Apartment rental and unoccupied homes are moving in a positive direction.
Third, inventory restocking is slowing from the first quarter and is not expected to be a major economic driver going forward. Most economists, including those in our group, see modest growth in the second half of 2010. So the conclusion of our panel was that the recovery continues, but it is far from robust. Several of our participants mentioned that their industries will basically muddle through for the next six months.
Turning now to our own customer data. Industrial sales increased by 13% in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of 2009. Quarter-over-quarter, the most significant increases were in: primary metals, up 60.7%; chemicals, up 25.9%; transportation, up 14.5%; and paper, up 16% compared with the second quarter of 2009.  Year-to-date, we are seeing positive growth in every segment except Pipeline, Rubber and Apparel.
The ThyssenKrupp steel manufacturing facility in Alabama, hired approximately 1,000 people at its new facility and its continued commission production equipment which will acquire approximately 200 megawatts. In addition, Hyundai Heavy Industries announced a facility in Montgomery, Alabama to build high-voltage transformer, which is expected to add another 500 jobs. 
All of the major automobile manufacturers in our service area continue to report steady demand for their products with an increase in production in Alabama alone of 71%. Adjusting for weather, residential sales increased by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009. 
New connects have climbed to approximately 36,000 a year in the second quarter, which represents a 47% increase over the first quarter of 2010. In addition, we are seeing positive customer growth of more than 7,000 new residential customers. 
As expected, commercial sales remained our weakest sector, declining at 1% on a weather-normal basis in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of 2009. Year-to-date, 2010 commercial sales are down 0.7% on a weather-normal basis, which is in line with our forecast.
Commercial activity continues to lag with vacancy rates for offices of more than 22%. On the positive side, electricity demand by data centers increased by 7% in the second quarter, reflecting our most active account in the commercial sector.
In summary, the commercial and residential sectors are performing according to our forecast, while sales to the industrial sector in the second quarter are ahead of our plan.
Turning now to the impact of the oil spill in the Gulf. We know many of our customers along the Gulf Coast have been financially impacted by this accident. However, at this point from both an energy demand and operational standpoint, we have not seen a measurable impact on our company. 
From an energy sales standpoint, the major impact will be seen in the commercial sector, primarily in tourist-related businesses such as hotels and restaurants. Gulf Power in Northwest Florida has the largest exposure with some 125 miles of coast line along the Gulf.
While few beaches from Pensacola to Panama City have been affected by the oil, thus far, we have not been able to identify any impact to our energy-related sales, that's only at about 5% of Gulf Power sales are to Customers and Tourist-related segment.  Another factor is that oil spill workers are occupying hotel rooms, which otherwise would have been filled by tourists. On the generation side, our plants along the Gulf Coast are operating normally and coal shipments by barge have not been interrupted by the oil spill.
Turning now to our earnings guidance for 2010. Our second quarter results exceeded our estimates by $0.06 a share. As we discussed, the quarter was largely influenced by weather and the gradual economy recovery we are seeing here in the Southeast, particularly from certain segments in the industrial sector. While we ended the first six months at $1.22 per share, it's important to remember that $0.14 per share of those earnings were due to weather. 
In addition, for the remainder of the year, it's important to remember that three major factors will continue to have a delimiting effect on our earning. 
Number one, the third year of a modified accounting order at Georgia Power. Number two, a more than normal level of O&M spending. And three, an increase in the number of shares outstanding. 
Given these factors and since a significant portion of our earnings are derived in the third quarter, our guidance will remain at $2.30 to $2.36 per share with an emphasis on the top end of that range.  Finally, our estimate for the third quarter is $0.94 per share. At this point, I'll turn the call back over to David for his closing remarks."

But I think the biggest challenge remains trying to get the 60 votes that they need to pass anything of that magnitude in a clearly growing political season. So I wouldn't give it very high chances of coming back this Congress. I think it's jump ball until we get through the midterm elections and see what the new Congress will look like and whether or not there's an ability to move something in a new Congress."

And it is a difficult one to understand, because it has some complex provisions with regard to interstate and intra-state trading, whether you can use allowances and whether you can't. The bottom line of all of that is, as we lower these numbers, the ability for us to continue to backfit additional equipment is fairly limited. We've already made, as you know, significant investments. We've invested, by the time we finished in '12, I think about $10 billion. And you get to the point where there's not enough space and you can't continue to achieve reductions with existing technology.

Tom, Paul and Art are key members of our management team and are well prepared for their new assignments, and I know will do an outstanding job for us.
As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had a good second quarter, which was influenced by favorable weather and the continuing economic recovery here in the Southeast. Since our last earnings call in April. We've had three significant new regulatory developments in our Retail business, including a rate case filing by Georgia Power. Paul will cover the rate case filing in more detail in a few minutes.
First on May 26, the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved the construction of our 582-megawatt coal gasification project in Kemper County, Mississippi. Yesterday, the South Mississippi Electric Power Association signed an agreement to purchase 17.5% of the plant to fill the projected capacity requirements of its members. 
The plant, which will use Mississippi lignite coal is scheduled to be placed in service in May 2014. The facility has a construction cost estimate of $2.4 billion. The project, which will feature 65% carbon capture capability has qualified for nearly $700 million in federal incentives, including $412 million in investment tax credits and $270 million in clean coal power initiative funding.  In addition, we're in advanced due diligence discussions for federal loan guarantees.  
Mississippi Public Service Commission has also approved the construction work in progress mechanism, which will begin in 2012 and continue through the end of May 2014. We're pleased to now be under construction with the Kemper County project. We believe this plan is clearly the best choice for our customers. And to repeat what Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu, wrote recently and I quote, ""The project is of national importance because it provides a viable option for using our abundant coal resources in a cost-effective manner and reducing power plant emissions.""
My second update concerns our Vogtle nuclear project. Last month, we announced that Southern Company and the Department of Energy agreed to conditional terms on the nuclear loan guarantees in the 3 and 4 Plant Vogtle. Under the conditional agreement, the loan would not exceed 70% of the company's eligible projected cost or approximately $3.4 billion, and is expected to be funded by the Federal Financing Bank. The loan would be full recourse to Georgia Power and secured by lien on the company's 45.7% interest in the two new units. 
The loan is expected to save Georgia Power's customers between $15 million and $20 million annually in interest costs. The actual amount of the interest savings will depend upon the final terms and the timing of this specific borrowing. Final approval and issuance of the loan is subject to the receipt of the combined construction and operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and satisfaction of other conditions.
NRC's current schedule calls for finalization of its design-control document review by October 2011, and we would expect to receive the COL by the end of 2011. As you know, the company received an Early Site Permit and Limited Work Authorization from the NRC in 2009, and site work has been underway since that time.
At this point, I'll turn things over to Paul for a discussion of our financial highlights for the second quarter and our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2010."

The results continue to highlight the consistency of our bu",1871,"Thank you, David. First of all, let me say how much I've enjoyed working with all of you as CFO during the past two and a half years. 
Now as David said, our second quarter performance was good. The results continue to highlight the consistency of our business plan to provide regular, predictable and sustainable performance over the long term. In the second quarter 2010, we reported $0.62 a share compared with $0.61 a share in the second quarter of 2009 or an increase of $0.01 a share. Let's turn now to the major factors that drove our second quarter numbers compared to the second quarter of 2009.
First, the negative factors. Non-fuel O&M reduced our earnings by $0.07 a share in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009. This change is primarily due to a return to normal maintenance spending in 2010 for both our fossil and hydro generation fleet and our Transmission and Distribution network. On the generation side, approximately 3,000 more megawatts were involved in plant outages in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2009.
In the second quarter of 2009, we had the early termination of two of our international leveraged-lease investments which resulted in a gain. For the second quarter of 2010, we now show a reduction of $0.03 per share compared to the second quarter of 2009. Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of 2009.
Now let's turn to the positive factors that drove our earnings for the second quarter of 2010. Warmer than normal weather in the second quarter added $0.04 per share to our earnings for the period compared with the second quarter of 2009. While the first quarter of this year was the coldest winter in 20 years, the second quarter was the warmest spring in 20 years and the fourth warmest in more than a century. Clearly, weather has been a major factor this year and has added $0.14 per share to our earnings compared to the first six months of 2009.
Increased usage in better than expected economic activity primarily in the Industrial sector, added $0.04 a share to our earnings in the second quarter compared with the same period in 2009.
Other revenue effects in our Traditional business added a total of $0.02 a share to our earnings in the second quarter, compared with the second quarter of 2009. This impact was driven primarily by revenue changes related to the recovery of environmental expenses and other investments at our operating company.
Reduced depreciation and amortization added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the same period last year. This increase was driven primarily by the continued amortization of excess cost of removal obligations at Georgia Power, approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission beginning in the third quarter of last year. The increase was partially offset by additional depreciation from increased environmental, transmission and distribution investments.
Lower interest expense also added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Increased Transmission revenues in our Traditional business added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009. Investment tax credits at Georgia Power added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009.
In conclusion, we had $0.13 of negative items, compared with $0.14 of positive items or a positive change of $0.01 per share over the second quarter of 2009. So overall, our quarter came in at $0.62 per share.
Before I discuss our earnings estimates for the third quarter, I'd like to update you on the Georgia Power rate case filing, the economy and the impact of the oil spill.
On July 1, as required by its current accounting order, Georgia Power filed a retail rate case with the Georgia Public Service Commission. The requested increase is necessary to cover additional cost of required environmental control and continued investment in new generation, transmissions and distribution facilities to support growth and ensure reliability. 
During the past 15 years, Georgia Power has operated under three-year negotiated rate settlement. The 2010 rate case filing contains proposed enhancements to the current structure. The requested increase of $615 million or 8.2% will be effective January 1, 2011, and is based on a retail return on common equity of 11.95%. The increase would be recovered through Georgia Power's existing base rate tariff, including its environmental compliance cost recovery tariff, the demand side management tariff and the municipal franchise fee tariff.
The filing also proposes an alternative rate plan, which enhances the existing tariffs and proposes two additional base rate tariff. The first proposed new tariff is an Adjustable Cost Recovery tariff or ACR. If approved, beginning January 1, 2012, the ACR will work to maintain Georgia Power's projected earnings within the ROE band established by the Public Service Commission in this proceeding. The ACR tariff proposal has a symmetrical sharing mechanism, should the company's actual earnings exceed or fall below the approved ROE band.
The second proposed new tariff is a Certified Capacity Cost Recovery tariff. This tariff is designed to recover certified generation and associated transmission costs, as well as capacity costs of certified Power Purchase Agreement.
If approved, these new tariffs, along with the annual resets of the three existing cost recovery mechanisms would allow the company's rate to adjust more gradually in under another three-year accounting order. Testimony and hearings on the request will begin this fall, and the company expects the Georgia Public Service Commission to issue a final order on the matters during December. We will keep you updated as the case moves forward.
Last week, we had convened another Economic Summit with executives from several of our Industrial segments, including a rail transportation company as well as economists from a major private bank and the Atlanta Federal Reserve to discuss the outlook of the economy. Even with a diverse spectrum of industries represented, there was a consensus of opinion in three main areas. 
First, a double-dip recession is unlikely. However, the momentum of the economic recovery is slowing. The general view is that the Southeast is still well positioned for economic growth outpacing the U.S.
Second, residential and commercial construction remains depressed, but the trend shows stabilization in the residential market. Apartment rentals and unoccupied homes are moving in a positive direction.
Third, inventory restocking is slowing from the first quarter and is not expected to be a major economic driver going forward. Most economists, including those in our group, see modest growth in the second half of 2010. So the conclusion of our panel was that the recovery continues, but it is far from robust. Several of our participants mentioned that their industries will basically muddle through for the next six months.
Turning now to our own customer data. Industrial sales increased by 13% in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of 2009. Quarter-over-quarter, the most significant increases were in: primary metals, up 60.7%; chemicals, up 25.9%; transportation, up 14.5%; and paper, up 16% compared with the second quarter of 2009. Year-to-date, we are seeing positive growth in every segment except Pipeline, Rubber and Apparel.
The ThyssenKrupp steel manufacturing facility in Alabama, hired approximately 1,000 people at its new facility and its continued commission production equipment which will acquire approximately 200 megawatts. In addition, Hyundai Heavy Industries announced a facility in Montgomery, Alabama to build high-voltage transformer, which is expected to add another 500 jobs. 
All of the major automobile manufacturers in our service area continue to report steady demand for their products with an increase in production in Alabama alone of 71%. Adjusting for weather, residential sales increased by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009. 
New connects have climbed to approximately 36,000 a year in the second quarter, which represents a 47% increase over the first quarter of 2010. In addition, we are seeing positive customer growth of more than 7,000 new residential customers. 
As expected, commercial sales remained our weakest sector, declining at 1% on a weather-normal basis in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of 2009. Year-to-date, 2010 commercial sales are down 0.7% on a weather-normal basis, which is in line with our forecast.
Commercial activity continues to lag with vacancy rates for offices of more than 22%. On the positive side, electricity demand by data centers increased by 7% in the second quarter, reflecting our most active account in the commercial sector.
In summary, the commercial and residential sectors are performing according to our forecast, while sales to the industrial sector in the second quarter are ahead of our plan.
Turning now to the impact of the oil spill in the Gulf. We know many of our customers along the Gulf Coast have been financially impacted by this accident. However, at this point from both an energy demand and operational standpoint, we have not seen a measurable impact on our company. 
From an energy sales standpoint, the major impact will be seen in the commercial sector, primarily in tourist-related businesses such as hotels and restaurants. Gulf Power in Northwest Florida has the largest exposure with some 125 miles of coast line along the Gulf.
While few beaches from Pensacola to Panama City have been affected by the oil, thus far, we have not been able to identify any impact to our energy-related sales, that's only at about 5% of Gulf Power sales are to Customers and Tourist-related segment.  Another factor is that oil spill workers are occupying hotel rooms, which otherwise would have been filled by tourists. On the generation side, our plants along the Gulf Coast are operating normally and coal shipments by barge have not been interrupted by the oil spill.
Turning now to our earnings guidance for 2010. Our second quarter results exceeded our estimates by $0.06 a share. As we discussed, the quarter was largely influenced by weather and the gradual economic recovery we are seeing here in the Southeast, particularly from certain segments in the industrial sector. While we ended the first six months at $1.22 per share, it's important to remember that $0.14 per share of those earnings were due to weather. 
In addition, for the remainder of the year, it's important to remember that three major factors will continue to have a delimiting effect on our earning. 
Number one, the third year of a modified accounting order at Georgia Power. Number two, a more than normal level of O&M spending. And three, an increase in the number of shares outstanding. 
Given these factors and since a significant portion of our earnings are derived in the third quarter, our guidance will remain at $2.30 to $2.36 per share with an emphasis on the top end of that range.  Finally, our estimate for the third quarter is $0.94 per share. At this point, I'll turn the call back over to David for his closing remarks."

So those are the signals that we have demand for these products. On our Automobile segment, like I said in the opening statement, the production level of the unit is up 71%.

As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had a good second quarter, which was influenced by favorable weather and the continuing economic recovery here in the Southeast. Since our last earnings call in April. We've had three significant new regulatory developments in our Retail business, including a rate case filing by Georgia Power. Paul will cover the rate case filing in more detail in a few minutes.
First on May 26, the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved the construction of our 582-megawatt coal gasification project in Kemper County, Mississippi. Yesterday, the South Mississippi Electric Power Association signed an agreement to purchase 17.5% of the plant to fill the projected capacity requirements of its members. 
The plant, which will use Mississippi lignite coal is scheduled to be placed in service in May 2014. The facility has a construction cost estimate of $2.4 billion. The project, which will feature 65% carbon capture capability has qualified for nearly $700 million in federal incentives, including $412 million in investment tax credits and $270 million in clean coal power initiative funding.  In addition, we're in advanced due diligence discussions for federal loan guarantees.  
Mississippi Public Service Commission has also approved the construction work in progress mechanism, which will begin in 2012 and continue through the end of May 2014. We're pleased to now be under construction with the Kemper County project. We believe this plan is clearly the best choice for our customers. And to repeat what Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu, wrote recently and I quote, ""The project is of national importance because it provides a viable option for using our abundant coal resources in a cost-effective manner and reducing power plant emissions.""
My second update concerns our Vogtle nuclear project. Last month, we announced that Southern Company and the Department of Energy agreed to conditional terms on the nuclear loan guarantees in the 3 and 4 Plant Vogtle. Under the conditional agreement, the loan would not exceed 70% of the company's eligible projected cost or approximately $3.4 billion, and is expected to be funded by the Federal Financing Bank. The loan would be full recourse to Georgia Power and secured by lien on the company's 45.7% interest in the two new units. 
The loan is expected to save Georgia Power's customers between $15 million and $20 million annually in interest costs. The actual amount of the interest savings will depend upon the final terms and the timing of this specific borrowing. Final approval and issuance of the loan is subject to the receipt of the combined construction and operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and satisfaction of other conditions.
NRC's current schedule calls for finalization of its design-control document review by October 2011, and we would expect to receive the COL by the end of 2011. As you know, the company received an Early Site Permit and Limited Work Authorization from the NRC in 2009, and site work has been underway since that time.
At this point, I'll turn things over to Paul for a discussion of our financial highlights for the second quarter and our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2010."

First of all, let me say how much I've enjoyed working with all of you as CFO during the past two and a half years. 
Now as David said, our second quarter performance was good. The results continue to highlight the consistency of our business plan to provide regular, predictable and sustainable performance over the long term. In the second quarter 2010, we reported $0.62 a share compared with $0.61 a share in the second quarter of 2009 or an increase of $0.01 a share. Let's turn now to the major factors that drove our second quarter numbers compared to the second quarter of 2009.
First, the negative factors. Non-fuel O&M reduced our earnings by $0.07 a share in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009. This change is primarily due to a return to normal maintenance spending in 2010 for both our fossil and hydro generation fleet and our Transmission and Distribution network. On the generation side, approximately 3,000 more megawatts were involved in plant outages in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2009.
In the second quarter of 2009, we had the early termination of two of our international leveraged-lease investments which resulted in a gain. For the second quarter of 2010, we now show a reduction of $0.03 per share compared to the second quarter of 2009. Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of 2009.
Now let's turn to the positive factors that drove our earnings for the second quarter of 2010. Warmer than normal weather in the second quarter added $0.04 per share to our earnings for the period compared with the second quarter of 2009. While the first quarter of this year was the coldest winter in 20 years, the second quarter was the warmest spring in 20 years and the fourth warmest in more than a century. Clearly, weather has been a major factor this year and has added $0.14 per share to our earnings compared to the first six months of 2009.
Increased usage in better than expected economic activity primarily in the Industrial sector, added $0.04 a share to our earnings in the second quarter compared with the same period in 2009.
Other revenue effects in our Traditional business added a total of $0.02 a share to our earnings in the second quarter, compared with the second quarter of 2009. This impact was driven primarily by revenue changes related to the recovery of environmental expenses and other investments at our operating company.
Reduced depreciation and amortization added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the same period last year. This increase was driven primarily by the continued amortization of excess cost of removal obligations at Georgia Power, approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission beginning in the third quarter of last year. The increase was partially offset by additional depreciation from increased environmental, transmission and distribution investments.
Lower interest expense also added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Increased Transmission revenues in our Traditional business added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009. Investment tax credits at Georgia Power added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009.
In conclusion, we had $0.13 of negative items, compared with $0.14 of positive items or a positive change of $0.01 per share over the second quarter of 2009. So overall, our quarter came in at $0.62 per share.
Before I discuss our earnings estimates for the third quarter, I'd like to update you on the Georgia Power rate case filing, the economy and the impact of the oil spill.
On July 1, as required by its current accounting order, Georgia Power filed a retail rate case with the Georgia Public Service Commission. The requested increase is necessary to cover additional cost of required environmental control and continued investment in new generation, transmissions and distribution facilities to support growth and ensure reliability. 
During the past 15 years, Georgia Power has operated under three-year negotiated rate settlement. The 2010 rate case filing contains proposed enhancements to the current structure. The requested increase of $615 million or 8.2% will be effective January 1, 2011, and is based on a retail return on common equity of 11.95%. The increase would be recovered through Georgia Power's existing base rate tariff, including its environmental compliance cost recovery tariff, the demand side management tariff and the municipal franchise fee tariff.
The filing also proposes an alternative rate plan, which enhances the existing tariffs and proposes two additional base rate tariff. The first proposed new tariff is an Adjustable Cost Recovery tariff or ACR. If approved, beginning January 1, 2012, the ACR will work to maintain Georgia Power's projected earnings within the ROE band established by the Public Service Commission in this proceeding. The ACR tariff proposal has a symmetrical sharing mechanism, should the company's actual earnings exceed or fall below the approved ROE band.
The second proposed new tariff is a Certified Capacity Cost Recovery tariff. This tariff is designed to recover certified generation and associated transmission costs, as well as capacity costs of certified Power Purchase Agreement.
If approved, these new tariffs, along with the annual resets of the three existing cost recovery mechanisms would allow the company's rate to adjust more gradually in under another three-year accounting order. Testimony and hearings on the request will begin this fall, and the company expects the Georgia Public Service Commission to issue a final order on the matters during December. We will keep you updated as the case moves forward.
Last week, we had convened another Economic Summit with executives from several of our Industrial segments, including a rail transportation company as well as economists from a major private bank and the Atlanta Federal Reserve to discuss the outlook of the economy. Even with a diverse spectrum of industries represented, there was a consensus of opinion in three main areas. 
First, a double-dip recession is unlikely. However, the momentum of the economic recovery is slowing. The general view is that the Southeast is still well positioned for economic growth outpacing the U.S.
Second, residential and commercial construction remains depressed, but the trend shows stabilization in the residential market. Apartment rentals and unoccupied homes are moving in a positive direction.
Third, inventory restocking is slowing from the first quarter and is not expected to be a major economic driver going forward. Most economists, including those in our group, see modest growth in the second half of 2010. So the conclusion of our panel was that the recovery continues, but it is far from robust. Several of our participants mentioned that their industries will basically muddle through for the next six months.
Turning now to our own customer data. Industrial sales increased by 13% in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of 2009. Quarter-over-quarter, the most significant increases were in: primary metals, up 60.7%; chemicals, up 25.9%; transportation, up 14.5%; and paper, up 16% compared with the second quarter of 2009. Year-to-date, we are seeing positive growth in every segment except Pipeline, Rubber and Apparel.
The ThyssenKrupp steel manufacturing facility in Alabama, hired approximately 1,000 people at its new facility and its continued commission production equipment which will acquire approximately 200 megawatts. In addition, Hyundai Heavy Industries announced a facility in Montgomery, Alabama to build high-voltage transformer, which is expected to add another 500 jobs. 
All of the major automobile manufacturers in our service area continue to report steady demand for their products with an increase in production in Alabama alone of 71%. Adjusting for weather, residential sales increased by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009. 
New connects have climbed to approximately 36,000 a year in the second quarter, which represents a 47% increase over the first quarter of 2010. In addition, we are seeing positive customer growth of more than 7,000 new residential customers. 
As expected, commercial sales remained our weakest sector, declining at 1% on a weather-normal basis in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of 2009. Year-to-date, 2010 commercial sales are down 0.7% on a weather-normal basis, which is in line with our forecast.
Commercial activity continues to lag with vacancy rates for offices of more than 22%. On the positive side, electricity demand by data centers increased by 7% in the second quarter, reflecting our most active account in the commercial sector.
In summary, the commercial and residential sectors are performing according to our forecast, while sales to the industrial sector in the second quarter are ahead of our plan.
Turning now to the impact of the oil spill in the Gulf. We know many of our customers along the Gulf Coast have been financially impacted by this accident. However, at this point from both an energy demand and operational standpoint, we have not seen a measurable impact on our company. 
From an energy sales standpoint, the major impact will be seen in the commercial sector, primarily in tourist-related businesses such as hotels and restaurants. Gulf Power in Northwest Florida has the largest exposure with some 125 miles of coast line along the Gulf.
While few beaches from Pensacola to Panama City have been affected by the oil, thus far, we have not been able to identify any impact to our energy-related sales, that's only at about 5% of Gulf Power sales are to Customers and Tourist-related segment.  Another factor is that oil spill workers are occupying hotel rooms, which otherwise would have been filled by tourists. On the generation side, our plants along the Gulf Coast are operating normally and coal shipments by barge have not been interrupted by the oil spill.
Turning now to our earnings guidance for 2010. Our second quarter results exceeded our estimates by $0.06 a share. As we discussed, the quarter was largely influenced by weather and the gradual economic recovery we are seeing here in the Southeast, particularly from certain segments in the industrial sector. While we ended the first six months at $1.22 per share, it's important to remember that $0.14 per share of those earnings were due to weather. 
In addition, for the remainder of the year, it's important to remember that three major factors will continue to have a delimiting effect on our earning. 
Number one, the third year of a modified accounting order at Georgia Power. Number two, a more than normal level of O&M spending. And three, an increase in the number of shares outstanding. 
Given these factors and since a significant portion of our earnings are derived in the third quarter, our guidance will remain at $2.30 to $2.36 per share with an emphasis on the top end of that range.  Finally, our estimate for the third quarter is $0.94 per share. At this point, I'll turn the call back over to David for his closing remarks."

First on May 26, the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved the construction of our 582-megawatt coal gasification project in Kemper County, Mississippi. Yesterday, the South Mississippi Electric Power Association signed an agreement to purchase 17.5% of the plant to fill the projected capacity requirements of its members. 
The plant, which will use Mississippi lignite coal is scheduled to be placed in service in May 2014. The facility has a construction cost estimate of $2.4 billion. The project, which will feature 65% carbon capture capability has qualified for nearly $700 million in federal incentives, including $412 million in investment tax credits and $270 million in clean coal power initiative funding.  In addition, we're in advanced due diligence discussions for federal loan guarantees.  
Mississippi Public Service Commission has also approved the construction work in progress mechanism, which will begin in 2012 and continue through the end of May 2014. We're pleased to now be under construction with the Kemper County project. We believe this plan is clearly the best choice for our customers. And to repeat what Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu, wrote recently and I quote, ""The project is of national importance because it provides a viable option for using our abundant coal resources in a cost-effective manner and reducing power plant emissions.""
My second update concerns our Vogtle nuclear project. Last month, we announced that Southern Company and the Department of Energy agreed to conditional terms on the nuclear loan guarantees in the 3 and 4 Plant Vogtle. Under the conditional agreement, the loan would not exceed 70% of the company's eligible projected cost or approximately $3.4 billion, and is expected to be funded by the Federal Financing Bank. The loan would be full recourse to Georgia Power and secured by lien on the company's 45.7% interest in the two new units. 
The loan is expected to save Georgia Power's customers between $15 million and $20 million annually in interest costs. The actual amount of the interest savings will depend upon the final terms and the timing of this specific borrowing. Final approval and issuance of the loan is subject to the receipt of the combined construction and operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and satisfaction of other conditions.
NRC's current schedule calls for finalization of its design-control document review by October 2011, and we would expect to receive the COL by the end of 2011. As you know, the company received an Early Site Permit and Limited Work Authorization from the NRC in 2009, and site work has been underway since that time.
At this point, I'll turn things over to Paul for a discussion of our financial highlights for the second quarter and our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2010.

First of all, let me say how much I've enjoyed working with all of you as CFO during the past two and a half years. 
Now as David said, our second quarter performance was good. The results continue to highlight the consistency of our business plan to provide regular, predictable and sustainable performance over the long term. In the second quarter 2010, we reported $0.62 a share compared with $0.61 a share in the second quarter of 2009 or an increase of $0.01 a share. Let's turn now to the major factors that drove our second quarter numbers compared to the second quarter of 2009.
First, the negative factors. Non-fuel O&M reduced our earnings by $0.07 a share in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009. This change is primarily due to a return to normal maintenance spending in 2010 for both our fossil and hydro generation fleet and our Transmission and Distribution network. On the generation side, approximately 3,000 more megawatts were involved in plant outages in the second quarter compared to the second quarter of 2009.
In the second quarter of 2009, we had the early termination of two of our international leveraged-lease investments which resulted in a gain. For the second quarter of 2010, we now show a reduction of $0.03 per share compared to the second quarter of 2009. Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of 2009.
Now let's turn to the positive factors that drove our earnings for the second quarter of 2010. Warmer than normal weather in the second quarter added $0.04 per share to our earnings for the period compared with the second quarter of 2009. While the first quarter of this year was the coldest winter in 20 years, the second quarter was the warmest spring in 20 years and the fourth warmest in more than a century. Clearly, weather has been a major factor this year and has added $0.14 per share to our earnings compared to the first six months of 2009.
Increased usage in better than expected economic activity primarily in the Industrial sector, added $0.04 a share to our earnings in the second quarter compared with the same period in 2009.
Other revenue effects in our Traditional business added a total of $0.02 a share to our earnings in the second quarter, compared with the second quarter of 2009. This impact was driven primarily by revenue changes related to the recovery of environmental expenses and other investments at our operating company.
Reduced depreciation and amortization added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the same period last year. This increase was driven primarily by the continued amortization of excess cost of removal obligations at Georgia Power, approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission beginning in the third quarter of last year. The increase was partially offset by additional depreciation from increased environmental, transmission and distribution investments.
Lower interest expense also added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Increased Transmission revenues in our Traditional business added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009. Investment tax credits at Georgia Power added $0.01 per share to our earnings in the second quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009.
In conclusion, we had $0.13 of negative items, compared with $0.14 of positive items or a positive change of $0.01 per share over the second quarter of 2009. So overall, our quarter came in at $0.62 per share.
Before I discuss our earnings estimates for the third quarter, I'd like to update you on the Georgia Power rate case filing, the economy and the impact of the oil spill.
On July 1, as required by its current accounting order, Georgia Power filed a retail rate case with the Georgia Public Service Commission. The requested increase is necessary to cover additional cost of required environmental control and continued investment in new generation, transmissions and distribution facilities to support growth and ensure reliability. 
During the past 15 years, Georgia Power has operated under three-year negotiated rate settlement. The 2010 rate case filing contains proposed enhancements to the current structure. The requested increase of $615 million or 8.2% will be effective January 1, 2011, and is based on a retail return on common equity of 11.95%. The increase would be recovered through Georgia Power's existing base rate tariff, including its environmental compliance cost recovery tariff, the demand side management tariff and the municipal franchise fee tariff.
The filing also proposes an alternative rate plan, which enhances the existing tariffs and proposes two additional base rate tariff. The first proposed new tariff is an Adjustable Cost Recovery tariff or ACR. If approved, beginning January 1, 2012, the ACR will work to maintain Georgia Power's projected earnings within the ROE band established by the Public Service Commission in this proceeding. The ACR tariff proposal has a symmetrical sharing mechanism, should the company's actual earnings exceed or fall below the approved ROE band.
The second proposed new tariff is a Certified Capacity Cost Recovery tariff. This tariff is designed to recover certified generation and associated transmission costs, as well as capacity costs of certified Power Purchase Agreement.
If approved, these new tariffs, along with the annual resets of the three existing cost recovery mechanisms would allow the company's rate to adjust more gradually in under another three-year accounting order. Testimony and hearings on the request will begin this fall, and the company expects the Georgia Public Service Commission to issue a final order on the matters during December. We will keep you updated as the case moves forward.
Last week, we had convened another Economic Summit with executives from several of our Industrial segments, including a rail transportation company as well as economists from a major private bank and the Atlanta Federal Reserve to discuss the outlook of the economy. Even with a diverse spectrum of industries represented, there was a consensus of opinion in three main areas. 
First, a double-dip recession is unlikely. However, the momentum of the economic recovery is slowing. The general view is that the Southeast is still well positioned for economic growth outpacing the U.S.
Second, residential and commercial construction remains depressed, but the trend shows stabilization in the residential market. Apartment rentals and unoccupied homes are moving in a positive direction.
Third, inventory restocking is slowing from the first quarter and is not expected to be a major economic driver going forward. Most economists, including those in our group, see modest growth in the second half of 2010. So the conclusion of our panel was that the recovery continues, but it is far from robust. Several of our participants mentioned that their industries will basically muddle through for the next six months.
Turning now to our own customer data. Industrial sales increased by 13% in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of 2009. Quarter-over-quarter, the most significant increases were in: primary metals, up 60.7%; chemicals, up 25.9%; transportation, up 14.5%; and paper, up 16% compared with the second quarter of 2009. Year-to-date, we are seeing positive growth in every segment except Pipeline, Rubber and Apparel.
The ThyssenKrupp steel manufacturing facility in Alabama, hired approximately 1,000 people at its new facility and its continued commission production equipment which will acquire approximately 200 megawatts. In addition, Hyundai Heavy Industries announced a facility in Montgomery, Alabama to build high-voltage transformer, which is expected to add another 500 jobs. 
All of the major automobile manufacturers in our service area continue to report steady demand for their products with an increase in production in Alabama alone of 71%. Adjusting for weather, residential sales increased by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2010, compared with the same period in 2009. 
New connects have climbed to approximately 36,000 a year in the second quarter, which represents a 47% increase over the first quarter of 2010. In addition, we are seeing positive customer growth of more than 7,000 new residential customers. 
As expected, commercial sales remained our weakest sector, declining at 1% on a weather-normal basis in the second quarter of 2010 compared with the second quarter of 2009. Year-to-date, 2010 commercial sales are down 0.7% on a weather-normal basis, which is in line with our forecast.
Commercial activity continues to lag with vacancy rates for offices of more than 22%. On the positive side, electricity demand by data centers increased by 7% in the second quarter, reflecting our most active account in the commercial sector.
In summary, the commercial and residential sectors are performing according to our forecast, while sales to the industrial sector in the second quarter are ahead of our plan.
Turning now to the impact of the oil spill in the Gulf. We know many of our customers along the Gulf Coast have been financially impacted by this accident. However, at this point from both an energy demand and operational standpoint, we have not seen a measurable impact on our company. 
From an energy sales standpoint, the major impact will be seen in the commercial sector, primarily in tourist-related businesses such as hotels and restaurants. Gulf Power in Northwest Florida has the largest exposure with some 125 miles of coast line along the Gulf.
While few beaches from Pensacola to Panama City have been affected by the oil, thus far, we have not been able to identify any impact to our energy-related sales, that's only at about 5% of Gulf Power sales are to Customers and Tourist-related segment.  Another factor is that oil spill workers are occupying hotel rooms, which otherwise would have been filled by tourists. On the generation side, our plants along the Gulf Coast are operating normally and coal shipments by barge have not been interrupted by the oil spill.
Turning now to our earnings guidance for 2010. Our second quarter results exceeded our estimates by $0.06 a share. As we discussed, the quarter was largely influenced by weather and the gradual economic recovery we are seeing here in the Southeast, particularly from certain segments in the industrial sector. While we ended the first six months at $1.22 per share, it's important to remember that $0.14 per share of those earnings were due to weather. 
In addition, for the remainder of the year, it's important to remember that three major factors will continue to have a delimiting effect on our earning. 
Number one, the third year of a modified accounting order at Georgia Power. Number two, a more than normal level of O&M spending. And three, an increase in the number of shares outstanding. 
Given these factors and since a significant portion of our earnings are derived in the third quarter, our guidance will remain at $2.30 to $2.36 per share with an emphasis on the top end of that range.  Finally, our estimate for the third quarter is $0.94 per share. At this point, I'll turn the call back over to David for his closing remarks.

You've delivered outstanding results for the benefit of our customers in the Southeast, and you've done it in the right way. We wish you the best in the years ahead.
Now turning to those of you on the call. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had a solid quarter, which was influenced by warmer weather and the continuing industrial recovery here in the Southeast. 
As you know, we have a rate case proceeding underway in Georgia. Georgia Power's witnesses presented testimony earlier this month in the case. And you may have seen where the PSC staff and intervenor testimony was filed last week on October 22. The PSC staff and intervenor hearings will be held on November 8 through 10. The case appears to be moving forward on schedule, and we expect a decision on or about December 21. 
Finally, I'd like to mention how well our generating fleet performed the during the peak season from May 1 to September 30. During this peak season period, we experienced record customer demand for electricity of more than 97 million-megawatt hours. We also set a record for natural gas generation, producing 20% more electricity from our natural gas fleet than ever before.
Our fleet once again delivered exceptional reliability, producing a peak season equivalent forced outage rate, or EFOR, of 1.67%. This is the ninth time in the past 10 years that our EFOR has been below 2%. The industry average is 7%. This history of exceptional operational performance demonstrates our commitment to providing reliable service to our customers. 
At this point, I'll turn things over to Art for a discussion of our financial highlights for the third quarter and our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2010."

First of all, let me say that I've enjoyed meeting and getting to know many of you over the past few months, and I hope to meet many more of you in the weeks and months ahead. As Tom said, our third quarter performance was solid. The result",1855,"Thanks, Tom. First of all, let me say that I've enjoyed meeting and getting to know many of you over the past few months, and I hope to meet many more of you in the weeks and months ahead. 
As Tom said, our third quarter performance was solid. The results continue to highlight the consistency of our business plan to provide regular, predictable and sustainable performance over the long term, while keeping customers the central focus of everything we do. In the third quarter of 2010, we reported $0.98 a share compared with $0.99 a share in the third quarter of 2009 or a decrease of 1 cent per share. 
Before we turn to the financial highlights discussion, I'd like to discuss two important regulatory matters that affected our third quarter earnings.
First, as you probably recall, in August of last year, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved Georgia Power's request to amortize $324 million in a regulatory liability account related to cost of removal obligations as a reduction to expenses. Under terms of the order, Georgia Power was allowed to amortize up to $108 million in 2009 in achieving a retail return on equity of up to 9.75%. Georgia Power amortized $48 million under this quarter for 2009. In 2010, Georgia Power is allowed to amortize up to $216 million in achieving a retail ROE of no more than 10.15%. Due primarily to weather-related revenues, Georgia Power expects to only amortize approximately $150 million in 2010. Amortization in the third quarter of 2010 was reduced to reflect that lower expected level, with year-to-date amortization under the order for 2010 totaling approximately $113 million.
While this order eliminated the need to file a rate case in 2009, and we believe was the right thing to do for customers in the midst of a major recession, it did have the consequence of limiting the company's return on equity in 2009 and 2010, the low authorized levels. 
Turning now to the Alabama jurisdiction. In August of this year, the Alabama Public Service Commission granted Alabama Power the ability to increase accruals to its natural disaster reserve. Under the new order, Alabama Power is allowed to make additional accruals to the reserve regardless of the balance in the account. The intent is to use these additional accruals for storm-related expenses or reliability expenses and to differ, or perhaps even avoid, higher charges to customers. The Alabama Public Service Commission has oversight of both the additional accruals and the utilization of the accruals for reliability expenditures.
Given the better-than-expected recovery in the industrial sector and warmer weather, Alabama Power opted to accrue an additional $40 million into the reserve in the third quarter, which could be earmarked for future reliability improvements. The current balance in the natural disaster reserve at the end of the third quarter is approximately $118 million. 
The collective effect of these regulatory actions in Alabama and Georgia, which will both work to mitigate rate increases, reflect our continuing philosophy of operating our business for the long-term benefit of our customers and shareholders and working with our regulators to maintain a constructive regulatory environment.
Now let's turn to the major factors that drove our third quarter numbers compared with the third quarter of 2009. First, the negative factors. 
Non-fuel O&M reduced earnings by $0.15 a share in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009. This change is due primarily to a return to normal maintenance spending in 2010 for both our fossil hydro fleet and our transmission and distribution network. The expanded natural disaster reserve at Alabama Power was also a factor in this category, as were higher ANG cost in the third quarter compared to the third quarter of 2009. O&M spending in our traditional business year-to-date is 13.8% higher than it was in the same period of 2009, reflecting these higher levels of spending. Year-to-date for 2010 compared to the first nine months of 2008, our O&M spending on a compound growth rate basis increased by 2.5%, excluding the natural disaster accrual in Alabama Power made this year, showing that we have returned to more normal levels of O&M spending.
Higher depreciation and amortization in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009 reduced our earnings by $0.07 a share. This was driven primarily by reduced amortization of Georgia Power's regulatory liability, which I referred to earlier, as well as increased depreciation for environmental and transmission and distribution investments. 
Lower wholesale revenues in our Traditional business reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. These reductions were due primarily to the 1,200 megawatts of capacity of Plant Miller in Alabama returning to retail service in 2010 after the expiration of a long-term wholesale contract. Customers will benefit from the return of this facility to retail service, since it is one of our most efficient and lowest-cost facilities.
Taxes other than income taxes reduced our earnings by $0.01 a share in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009. Lower revenues at Southern Power reduced our earnings by $0.01 per share. This decline in revenues is due primarily to slightly lower levels of contracted capacity and reduced demand from full requirements customers as a result of the recession. Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.04 a share in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. 
Now let's turn to the positive factors that drove our earnings for the third quarter of 2010.
Warmer-than-normal weather in the third quarter added $0.15 per share to our earnings for the period compared with the third quarter of 2009. Retail revenue impacts in our Traditional business added a total of $0.11 per share to our earnings in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. This impact was driven primarily by non-fuel revenue changes related to the recovery of environmental expenses, a portion of Plant Miller in Alabama returning to retail service and other investments at our operating companies. Increased usage in industrial growth added $0.02 a share to our earnings in the third quarter compared with the third quarter of 2009. Finally, other operating revenues, primarily transmission revenues, added $0.02 a share to our earnings in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009. 
In conclusion, we had $0.31 of negative items compared with $0.30 of positive items or a negative change of $0.01 per share over the third quarter of 2009. So overall, our quarter came in at $0.98 per share. 
Before I discuss our earnings estimates for the fourth quarter, I'd like to update you on our outlook for the economy for the remainder of 2010.
We are continuing to see a gradual economic recovery here in the Southeast, which is being driven primarily by the industrial sector. Industrial activity in the Southeast continues to expand, driven by modest economic growth domestically and more robust growth internationally. Our analysis and recent updates from our economic summit panelists suggest that we are seeing an increase in manufacturing productivity, use of temporary employees and longer work hours without the addition of new permanent employees. Panel members tell us that this situation is likely to continue until employers are convinced that the recovery is sustainable. When productivity improvements and temporary labor can no longer sustain higher levels of production, then we will see job creation and a corresponding improvement in the wage growth and consumer confidence, the final stage of economic recovery cycle. Early signs of this transition are beginning to appear, as the unemployment rate in Alabama has fallen from 11.1% to 8.9% in the past nine months. 
Turning now to our own customer data. Industrial sales increased by 7.3% in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009. Industrial sales in the third quarter were 94% of pre-recession levels, and they continue to exceed our expectations. On a year-to-date basis, the most significant increases were in primary metals, up 37.7%; transportation, up 14%; and chemicals, up 15.5%. 
One of our major steel producers in Alabama reports growing demand for its products, which serve the auto industry. In conjunction with this trend, the steel industry is forecasting an 8% increase in demand for its products in 2011. ThyssenKrupp continues to ramp up its operations in Alabama, with stainless steel production scheduled to begin in 2012. 
In the transportation sector, all of the auto manufacturers in our service territory are operating five days a week, with some Saturday production. Kia Motors and Hyundai Motors have announced that they are consolidating all of their SUV production at the new Kia facility, adding 600 new jobs at their West Point, Georgia plant. Hyundai's facility in Alabama will be fully utilized for the production of models other than SUVs.
The exporting of goods produced in the Southeast continues to help support the region's economy. In the third quarter, the Port of Savanna, which is the fourth largest container port in the U.S., set an all-time record for product shipped to overseas markets, surpassing the previous records by more than 20%. Retail consumer goods, paper and paper products, food and automobiles were among the top 10 commodities shipped from ports in our territory. 
Continuing with customer category data. Adjusting for weather, residential sales increased by 0.1% in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. Commercial sales continued to contract, declining 0.8% on a weather-normal basis in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009. For the year-to-date 2010 compared with the same period in 2009, commercial sales are down 0.7% on a weather-normal basis.
Total year-to-date retail sales are better than we originally expected, led by the industrial sector. Thus far, these improvements have largely occurred without significant job creation. As the recovery continues and the economy expands, this is expected to translate into improved opportunities for growth in our Residential and Commercial sectors. 
Turning now to our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2010. Our third quarter results exceeded our estimate by $0.04 per share. As we've discussed, the third quarter was largely influenced by warmer-than-normal weather and an improving industrial sector, but offset by higher O&M expenses and the impact of these regulatory items that I discussed earlier. For the remainder of the year, it's important to remember that two major factors will have a limiting effect on our earnings: one, a more normal level of O&M spending; and two, an increased number of shares outstanding.
Given these factors, our earnings estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.16 per share, which means we expect to earn $2.36, which is at the top of our guidance range. It is also important to remember that in the long term, we remain focused on growing earnings per share at an average of 6% and in a range of between 5% and 7%. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to David for his closing remarks."

I think everybody would suggest or oppose or saying to indicate that the Republicans' stake over the House, as you suggest, probably not the Senate, which means the House is still pretty evenly divided and difficult to pass any complex legislation. Just as soon as you get the House seated, you got to remember that people will start focusing on presidential election in '12. So the likelihood that they'd take up something as complex as climate legislation or even a rewrite of clean air act would be a challenging proposition going into presidential race. Now what that means is if we can't do things legislatively, then we're destined to continue on a very difficult regulatory route with EPA. And as you have seen already, there will be continuing challenges to almost every rule-making whether that happens to be mercury or 316(a) on the water side or any of the other regulations.

We've laid plans for clean coal. We have brought back one of the most efficient and inexpensive coal plants in America for the benefit of Alabama's customers.

You've delivered outstanding results for the benefit of our customers in the Southeast, and you've done it in the right way. We wish you the best in the years ahead.
Now turning to those of you on the call. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had a solid quarter, which was influenced by warmer weather and the continuing industrial recovery here in the Southeast. 
As you know, we have a rate case proceeding underway in Georgia. Georgia Power's witnesses presented testimony earlier this month in the case. And you may have seen where the PSC staff and intervenor testimony was filed last week on October 22. The PSC staff and intervenor hearings will be held on November 8 through 10. The case appears to be moving forward on schedule, and we expect a decision on or about December 21. 
Finally, I'd like to mention how well our generating fleet performed the during the peak season from May 1 to September 30. During this peak season period, we experienced record customer demand for electricity of more than 97 million-megawatt hours. We also set a record for natural gas generation, producing 20% more electricity from our natural gas fleet than ever before.
Our fleet once again delivered exceptional reliability, producing a peak season equivalent forced outage rate, or EFOR, of 1.67%. This is the ninth time in the past 10 years that our EFOR has been below 2%. The industry average is 7%. This history of exceptional operational performance demonstrates our commitment to providing reliable service to our customers. 
At this point, I'll turn things over to Art for a discussion of our financial highlights for the third quarter and our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2010.

First of all, let me say that I've enjoyed meeting and getting to know many of you over the past few months, and I hope to meet many more of you in the weeks and months ahead. 
As Tom said, our third quarter performance was solid. The results continue to highlight the consistency of our business plan to provide regular, predictable and sustainable performance over the long term, while keeping customers the central focus of everything we do. In the third quarter of 2010, we reported $0.98 a share compared with $0.99 a share in the third quarter of 2009 or a decrease of 1 cent per share. 
Before we turn to the financial highlights discussion, I'd like to discuss two important regulatory matters that affected our third quarter earnings.
First, as you probably recall, in August of last year, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved Georgia Power's request to amortize $324 million in a regulatory liability account related to cost of removal obligations as a reduction to expenses. Under terms of the order, Georgia Power was allowed to amortize up to $108 million in 2009 in achieving a retail return on equity of up to 9.75%. Georgia Power amortized $48 million under this quarter for 2009. In 2010, Georgia Power is allowed to amortize up to $216 million in achieving a retail ROE of no more than 10.15%. Due primarily to weather-related revenues, Georgia Power expects to only amortize approximately $150 million in 2010. Amortization in the third quarter of 2010 was reduced to reflect that lower expected level, with year-to-date amortization under the order for 2010 totaling approximately $113 million.
While this order eliminated the need to file a rate case in 2009, and we believe was the right thing to do for customers in the midst of a major recession, it did have the consequence of limiting the company's return on equity in 2009 and 2010, the low authorized levels. 
Turning now to the Alabama jurisdiction. In August of this year, the Alabama Public Service Commission granted Alabama Power the ability to increase accruals to its natural disaster reserve. Under the new order, Alabama Power is allowed to make additional accruals to the reserve regardless of the balance in the account. The intent is to use these additional accruals for storm-related expenses or reliability expenses and to differ, or perhaps even avoid, higher charges to customers. The Alabama Public Service Commission has oversight of both the additional accruals and the utilization of the accruals for reliability expenditures.
Given the better-than-expected recovery in the industrial sector and warmer weather, Alabama Power opted to accrue an additional $40 million into the reserve in the third quarter, which could be earmarked for future reliability improvements. The current balance in the natural disaster reserve at the end of the third quarter is approximately $118 million. 
The collective effect of these regulatory actions in Alabama and Georgia, which will both work to mitigate rate increases, reflect our continuing philosophy of operating our business for the long-term benefit of our customers and shareholders and working with our regulators to maintain a constructive regulatory environment.
Now let's turn to the major factors that drove our third quarter numbers compared with the third quarter of 2009. First, the negative factors. 
Non-fuel O&M reduced earnings by $0.15 a share in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009. This change is due primarily to a return to normal maintenance spending in 2010 for both our fossil hydro fleet and our transmission and distribution network. The expanded natural disaster reserve at Alabama Power was also a factor in this category, as were higher ANG cost in the third quarter compared to the third quarter of 2009. O&M spending in our traditional business year-to-date is 13.8% higher than it was in the same period of 2009, reflecting these higher levels of spending. Year-to-date for 2010 compared to the first nine months of 2008, our O&M spending on a compound growth rate basis increased by 2.5%, excluding the natural disaster accrual in Alabama Power made this year, showing that we have returned to more normal levels of O&M spending.
Higher depreciation and amortization in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009 reduced our earnings by $0.07 a share. This was driven primarily by reduced amortization of Georgia Power's regulatory liability, which I referred to earlier, as well as increased depreciation for environmental and transmission and distribution investments. 
Lower wholesale revenues in our Traditional business reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. These reductions were due primarily to the 1,200 megawatts of capacity of Plant Miller in Alabama returning to retail service in 2010 after the expiration of a long-term wholesale contract. Customers will benefit from the return of this facility to retail service, since it is one of our most efficient and lowest-cost facilities.
Taxes other than income taxes reduced our earnings by $0.01 a share in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009. Lower revenues at Southern Power reduced our earnings by $0.01 per share. This decline in revenues is due primarily to slightly lower levels of contracted capacity and reduced demand from full requirements customers as a result of the recession. Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.04 a share in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. 
Now let's turn to the positive factors that drove our earnings for the third quarter of 2010.
Warmer-than-normal weather in the third quarter added $0.15 per share to our earnings for the period compared with the third quarter of 2009. Retail revenue impacts in our Traditional business added a total of $0.11 per share to our earnings in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. This impact was driven primarily by non-fuel revenue changes related to the recovery of environmental expenses, a portion of Plant Miller in Alabama returning to retail service and other investments at our operating companies. Increased usage in industrial growth added $0.02 a share to our earnings in the third quarter compared with the third quarter of 2009. Finally, other operating revenues, primarily transmission revenues, added $0.02 a share to our earnings in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009. 
In conclusion, we had $0.31 of negative items compared with $0.30 of positive items or a negative change of $0.01 per share over the third quarter of 2009. So overall, our quarter came in at $0.98 per share. 
Before I discuss our earnings estimates for the fourth quarter, I'd like to update you on our outlook for the economy for the remainder of 2010.
We are continuing to see a gradual economic recovery here in the Southeast, which is being driven primarily by the industrial sector. Industrial activity in the Southeast continues to expand, driven by modest economic growth domestically and more robust growth internationally. Our analysis and recent updates from our economic summit panelists suggest that we are seeing an increase in manufacturing productivity, use of temporary employees and longer work hours without the addition of new permanent employees. Panel members tell us that this situation is likely to continue until employers are convinced that the recovery is sustainable. When productivity improvements and temporary labor can no longer sustain higher levels of production, then we will see job creation and a corresponding improvement in the wage growth and consumer confidence, the final stage of economic recovery cycle. Early signs of this transition are beginning to appear, as the unemployment rate in Alabama has fallen from 11.1% to 8.9% in the past nine months. 
Turning now to our own customer data. Industrial sales increased by 7.3% in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009. Industrial sales in the third quarter were 94% of pre-recession levels, and they continue to exceed our expectations. On a year-to-date basis, the most significant increases were in primary metals, up 37.7%; transportation, up 14%; and chemicals, up 15.5%. 
One of our major steel producers in Alabama reports growing demand for its products, which serve the auto industry. In conjunction with this trend, the steel industry is forecasting an 8% increase in demand for its products in 2011. ThyssenKrupp continues to ramp up its operations in Alabama, with stainless steel production scheduled to begin in 2012. 
In the transportation sector, all of the auto manufacturers in our service territory are operating five days a week, with some Saturday production. Kia Motors and Hyundai Motors have announced that they are consolidating all of their SUV production at the new Kia facility, adding 600 new jobs at their West Point, Georgia plant. Hyundai's facility in Alabama will be fully utilized for the production of models other than SUVs.
The exporting of goods produced in the Southeast continues to help support the region's economy. In the third quarter, the Port of Savanna, which is the fourth largest container port in the U.S., set an all-time record for product shipped to overseas markets, surpassing the previous records by more than 20%. Retail consumer goods, paper and paper products, food and automobiles were among the top 10 commodities shipped from ports in our territory. 
Continuing with customer category data. Adjusting for weather, residential sales increased by 0.1% in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. Commercial sales continued to contract, declining 0.8% on a weather-normal basis in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009. For the year-to-date 2010 compared with the same period in 2009, commercial sales are down 0.7% on a weather-normal basis.
Total year-to-date retail sales are better than we originally expected, led by the industrial sector. Thus far, these improvements have largely occurred without significant job creation. As the recovery continues and the economy expands, this is expected to translate into improved opportunities for growth in our Residential and Commercial sectors. 
Turning now to our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2010. Our third quarter results exceeded our estimate by $0.04 per share. As we've discussed, the third quarter was largely influenced by warmer-than-normal weather and an improving industrial sector, but offset by higher O&M expenses and the impact of these regulatory items that I discussed earlier. For the remainder of the year, it's important to remember that two major factors will have a limiting effect on our earnings: one, a more normal level of O&M spending; and two, an increased number of shares outstanding.
Given these factors, our earnings estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.16 per share, which means we expect to earn $2.36, which is at the top of our guidance range. It is also important to remember that in the long term, we remain focused on growing earnings per share at an average of 6% and in a range of between 5% and 7%. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to David for his closing remarks.

So the likelihood that they'd take up something as complex as climate legislation or even a rewrite of clean air act would be a challenging proposition going into presidential race. Now what that means is if we can't do things legislatively, then we're destined to continue on a very difficult regulatory route with EPA.

We believe that the right national energy policy is one that has a balanced approach to the choice of fuels. So we believe and that's why we're investing in, new nuclear, 20% recall as we're doing in Kemper County. We believe that gas will play an important role, going forward and likely will increase in its percentage. We believe there must be an expansion of renewables, however, we all take into account the concerns about the cost effectiveness and reliability of those issues and in fact, energy efficiency, that is generation you don't have to produce. It's something that will be important in the future. So saying that, this notion of the rush to gas is something that you probably won't see us do. We've already laid plans for new nuclear. We've laid plans for clean coal. We have brought back one of the most efficient and inexpensive coal plants in America for the benefit of Alabama's customers. And with Plant McDonough in Georgia inside the perimeter highway for the city, we're in the process of retiring a coal plant 500 megawatts and building in its place 2,550 megawatts of highly efficient modern combined cycle gas. You will see us use all of those. The logical consequence is gas will be more important, but it will not be to the exclusion of the other fuels.

Finally, I'd like to mention how well our generating fleet performed the during the peak season from May 1 to September 30. During this peak season period, we experienced record customer demand for electricity of more than 97 million-megawatt hours. We also set a record for natural gas generation, producing 20% more electricity from our natural gas fleet than ever before.
Our fleet once again delivered exceptional reliability, producing a peak season equivalent forced outage rate, or EFOR, of 1.67%. This is the ninth time in the past 10 years that our EFOR has been below 2%. The industry average is 7%. This history of exceptional operational performance demonstrates our commitment to providing reliable service to our customers. 
At this point, I'll turn things over to Art for a discussion of our financial highlights for the third quarter and our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2010."
120623,114230439,82437,"Southern Company, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","The Southern Company","Executives","Thanks, Tom. First of all, let me say that I've enjoyed meeting and getting to know many of you over the past few months, and I hope to meet many more of you in the weeks and months ahead. As Tom said, our third quarter performance was solid. The result",1854,"Thanks, Tom. First of all, let me say that I've enjoyed meeting and getting to know many of you over the past few months, and I hope to meet many more of you in the weeks and months ahead. 
As Tom said, our third quarter performance was solid. The results continue to highlight the consistency of our business plan to provide regular, predictable and sustainable performance over the long term, while keeping customers the central focus of everything we do. In the third quarter of 2010, we reported $0.98 a share compared with $0.99 a share in the third quarter of 2009 or a decrease of $0.01 per share. 
Before we turn to the financial highlights discussion, I'd like to discuss two important regulatory matters that affected our third quarter earnings.
First, as you probably recall, in August of last year, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved Georgia Power's request to amortize $324 million in a regulatory liability account related to cost of removal obligations as a reduction to expenses. Under terms of the order, Georgia Power was allowed to amortize up to $108 million in 2009 in achieving a retail return on equity of up to 9.75%. Georgia Power amortized $48 million under this quarter for 2009. In 2010, Georgia Power is allowed to amortize up to $216 million in achieving a retail ROE of no more than 10.15%. Due primarily to weather-related revenues, Georgia Power expects to only amortize approximately $150 million in 2010. Amortization in the third quarter of 2010 was reduced to reflect that lower expected level, with year-to-date amortization under the order for 2010 totaling approximately $113 million.
While this order eliminated the need to file a rate case in 2009, and we believe was the right thing to do for customers in the midst of a major recession, it did have the consequence of limiting the company's return on equity in 2009 and 2010, below authorized levels. 
Turning now to the Alabama jurisdiction. In August of this year, the Alabama Public Service Commission granted Alabama Power the ability to increase accruals to its natural disaster reserve. Under the new order, Alabama Power is allowed to make additional accruals to the reserve regardless of the balance in the account. The intent is to use these additional accruals for storm-related expenses or reliability expenses and to defer, or perhaps even avoid, higher charges to customers. The Alabama Public Service Commission has oversight of both the additional accruals and the utilization of the accruals for reliability expenditures.
Given the better-than-expected recovery in the industrial sector and warmer weather, Alabama Power opted to accrue an additional $40 million into the reserve in the third quarter, which could be earmarked for future reliability improvements. The current balance in the natural disaster reserve at the end of the third quarter is approximately $118 million. 
The collective effect of these regulatory actions in Alabama and Georgia, which will both work to mitigate rate increases, reflect our continuing philosophy of operating our business for the long-term benefit of our customers and shareholders and working with our regulators to maintain a constructive regulatory environment.
Now let's turn to the major factors that drove our third quarter numbers compared with the third quarter of 2009. First, the negative factors. 
Non-fuel O&M reduced earnings by $0.15 a share in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009. This change is due primarily to a return to normal maintenance spending in 2010 for both our fossil hydro fleet and our transmission and distribution network. The expanded natural disaster reserve at Alabama Power was also a factor in this category, as were higher ANG [ph] costs in the third quarter compared to the third quarter of 2009. O&M spending in our traditional business year-to-date is 13.8% higher than it was in the same period of 2009, reflecting these higher levels of spending. Year-to-date for 2010 compared to the first nine months of 2008, our O&M spending on a compound growth rate basis increased by 2.5%, excluding the natural disaster accrual in Alabama Power made this year, showing that we have returned to more normal levels of O&M spending.
Higher depreciation and amortization in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009 reduced our earnings by $0.07 a share. This was driven primarily by reduced amortization of Georgia Power's regulatory liability, which I referred to earlier, as well as increased depreciation for environmental and transmission and distribution investments. 
Lower wholesale revenues in our Traditional business reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. These reductions were due primarily to the 1,200 megawatts of capacity at Plant Miller in Alabama returning to retail service in 2010 after the expiration of a long-term wholesale contract. Customers will benefit from the return of this facility to retail service, since it is one of our most efficient and lowest-cost facilities.
Taxes other than income taxes reduced our earnings by $0.01 a share in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009. Lower revenues at Southern Power reduced our earnings by $0.01 per share. This decline in revenues is due primarily to slightly lower levels of contracted capacity and reduced demand from full requirements customers as a result of the recession. Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.04 a share in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. 
Now let's turn to the positive factors that drove our earnings for the third quarter of 2010.
Warmer-than-normal weather in the third quarter added $0.15 per share to our earnings for the period compared with the third quarter of 2009. Retail revenue impacts in our Traditional business added a total of $0.11 per share to our earnings in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. This impact was driven primarily by non-fuel revenue changes related to the recovery of environmental expenses, a portion of Plant Miller in Alabama returning to retail service and other investments at our operating companies. Increased usage in industrial growth added $0.02 a share to our earnings in the third quarter compared with the third quarter of 2009. Finally, other operating revenues, primarily transmission revenues, added $0.02 a share to our earnings in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009. 
In conclusion, we had $0.31 of negative items compared with $0.30 of positive items or a negative change of $0.01 per share over the third quarter of 2009. So overall, our quarter came in at $0.98 per share. 
Before I discuss our earnings estimates for the fourth quarter, I'd like to update you on our outlook for the economy for the remainder of 2010.
We are continuing to see a gradual economic recovery here in the Southeast, which is being driven primarily by the industrial sector. Industrial activity in the Southeast continues to expand, driven by modest economic growth domestically and more robust growth internationally. Our analysis and recent updates from our economic summit panelists suggest that we are seeing an increase in manufacturing productivity, use of temporary employees and longer work hours without the addition of new permanent employees. Panel members tell us that this situation is likely to continue until employers are convinced that the recovery is sustainable. When productivity improvements and temporary labor can no longer sustain higher levels of production, then we will see job creation and a corresponding improvement in the wage growth and consumer confidence, the final stage of economic recovery cycle. Early signs of this transition are beginning to appear, as the unemployment rate in Alabama has fallen from 11.1% to 8.9% in the past nine months. 
Turning now to our own customer data. Industrial sales increased by 7.3% in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009. Industrial sales in the third quarter were 94% of pre-recession levels, and they continue to exceed our expectations. On a year-to-date basis, the most significant increases were in primary metals, up 37.7%; transportation, up 14%; and chemicals, up 15.5%. 
One of our major steel producers in Alabama reports growing demand for its products, which serve the auto industry. In conjunction with this trend, the steel industry is forecasting an 8% increase in demand for its products in 2011. ThyssenKrupp continues to ramp up its operations in Alabama, with stainless steel production scheduled to begin in 2012. 
In the transportation sector, all of the auto manufacturers in our service territory are operating five days a week, with some Saturday production. Kia Motors and Hyundai Motors have announced that they are consolidating all of their SUV production at the new Kia facility, adding 600 new jobs at their West Point, Georgia plant. Hyundai's facility in Alabama will be fully utilized for the production of models other than SUVs.
The exporting of goods produced in the Southeast continues to help support the region's economy. In the third quarter, the Port of Savannah, which is the fourth largest container port in the U.S., set an all-time record for product shipped to overseas markets, surpassing the previous records by more than 20%. Retail consumer goods, paper and paper products, food and automobiles were among the top 10 commodities shipped from ports in our territory. 
Continuing with customer category data. Adjusting for weather, residential sales increased by 0.1% in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. Commercial sales continued to contract, declining 0.8% on a weather-normal basis in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009. For the year-to-date 2010 compared with the same period in 2009, commercial sales are down 0.7% on a weather-normal basis.
Total year-to-date retail sales are better than we originally expected, led by the industrial sector. Thus far, these improvements have largely occurred without significant job creation. As the recovery continues and the economy expands, this is expected to translate into improved opportunities for growth in our Residential and Commercial sectors. 
Turning now to our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2010. Our third quarter results exceeded our estimate by $0.04 per share. As we've discussed, the third quarter was largely influenced by warmer-than-normal weather and an improving industrial sector, but offset by higher O&M expenses and the impact of these regulatory items that I discussed earlier. For the remainder of the year, it's important to remember that two major factors will have a limiting effect on our earnings: one, a more normal level of O&M spending; and two, an increased number of shares outstanding.
Given these factors, our earnings estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.16 per share, which means we expect to earn $2.36, which is at the top of our guidance range. It is also important to remember that in the long term, we remain focused on growing earnings per share at an average of 6% and in a range of between 5% and 7%. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to David for his closing remarks."

We've laid plans for clean coal. We have brought back one of the most efficient and inexpensive coal plants in America for the benefit of Alabama's customers.

 Now turning to those of you on the call. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had a solid quarter, which was influenced by warmer weather and the continuing industrial recovery here in the Southeast.
 As you know, we have a rate case proceeding underway in Georgia. Georgia Power's witnesses presented testimony earlier this month in the case. And you may have seen where the PSC staff and intervenor testimony was filed last week on October 22. The PSC staff and intervenor hearings will be held on November 8 through 10. The case appears to be moving forward on schedule, and we expect a decision on or about December 21.
 Finally, I'd like to mention how well our generating fleet performed the during the peak season from May 1 to September 30. During this peak season period, we experienced record customer demand for electricity of more than 97 million-megawatt hours. We also set a record for natural gas generation, producing 20% more electricity from our natural gas fleet than ever before.
 Our fleet once again delivered exceptional reliability, producing a peak season equivalent forced outage rate, or EFOR, of 1.67%. This is the ninth time in the past 10 years that our EFOR has been below 2%. The industry average is 7%. This history of exceptional operational performance demonstrates our commitment to providing reliable service to our customers.
 At this point, I'll turn things over to Art for a discussion of our financial highlights for the third quarter and our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2010.

120623,114230439,86636,"Southern Company, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","The Southern Company","Executives"," Thanks, Tom. First of all, let me say that I've enjoyed meeting and getting to know many of you over the past few months, and I hope to meet many more of you in the weeks and months ahead.

First of all, let me say that I've enjoyed meeting and getting to know many of you over the past few months, and I hope to meet many more of you in the weeks and months ahead.
 As Tom said, our third quarter performance was solid. The results continue to highlight the consistency of our business plan to provide regular, predictable and sustainable performance over the long term, while keeping customers the central focus of everything we do. In the third quarter of 2010, we reported $0.98 a share compared with $0.99 a share in the third quarter of 2009 or a decrease of 1 cent per share.
 Before we turn to the financial highlights discussion, I'd like to discuss two important regulatory matters that affected our third quarter earnings.
 First, as you probably recall, in August of last year, the Georgia Public Service Commission approved Georgia Power's request to amortize $324 million in a regulatory liability account related to cost of removal obligations as a reduction to expenses. Under terms of the order, Georgia Power was allowed to amortize up to $108 million in 2009 in achieving a retail return on equity of up to 9.75%. Georgia Power amortized $48 million under this quarter for 2009. In 2010, Georgia Power is allowed to amortize up to $216 million in achieving a retail ROE of no more than 10.15%. Due primarily to weather-related revenues, Georgia Power expects to only amortize approximately $150 million in 2010. Amortization in the third quarter of 2010 was reduced to reflect that lower expected level, with year-to-date amortization under the order for 2010 totaling approximately $113 million.
 While this order eliminated the need to file a rate case in 2009, and we believe was the right thing to do for customers in the midst of a major recession, it did have the consequence of limiting the company's return on equity in 2009 and 2010, the low authorized levels.
 Turning now to the Alabama jurisdiction. In August of this year, the Alabama Public Service Commission granted Alabama Power the ability to increase accruals to its natural disaster reserve. Under the new order, Alabama Power is allowed to make additional accruals to the reserve regardless of the balance in the account. The intent is to use these additional accruals for storm-related expenses or reliability expenses and to differ, or perhaps even avoid, higher charges to customers. The Alabama Public Service Commission has oversight of both the additional accruals and the utilization of the accruals for reliability expenditures.
 Given the better-than-expected recovery in the industrial sector and warmer weather, Alabama Power opted to accrue an additional $40 million into the reserve in the third quarter, which could be earmarked for future reliability improvements. The current balance in the natural disaster reserve at the end of the third quarter is approximately $118 million.
 The collective effect of these regulatory actions in Alabama and Georgia, which will both work to mitigate rate increases, reflect our continuing philosophy of operating our business for the long-term benefit of our customers and shareholders and working with our regulators to maintain a constructive regulatory environment.
 Now let's turn to the major factors that drove our third quarter numbers compared with the third quarter of 2009. First, the negative factors.
 Non-fuel O&M reduced earnings by $0.15 a share in the third quarter of 2010 compared to the third quarter of 2009. This change is due primarily to a return to normal maintenance spending in 2010 for both our fossil hydro fleet and our transmission and distribution network. The expanded natural disaster reserve at Alabama Power was also a factor in this category, as were higher ANG cost in the third quarter compared to the third quarter of 2009. O&M spending in our traditional business year-to-date is 13.8% higher than it was in the same period of 2009, reflecting these higher levels of spending. Year-to-date for 2010 compared to the first nine months of 2008, our O&M spending on a compound growth rate basis increased by 2.5%, excluding the natural disaster accrual in Alabama Power made this year, showing that we have returned to more normal levels of O&M spending.
 Higher depreciation and amortization in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009 reduced our earnings by $0.07 a share. This was driven primarily by reduced amortization of Georgia Power's regulatory liability, which I referred to earlier, as well as increased depreciation for environmental and transmission and distribution investments.
 Lower wholesale revenues in our Traditional business reduced our earnings by $0.03 a share in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. These reductions were due primarily to the 1,200 megawatts of capacity of Plant Miller in Alabama returning to retail service in 2010 after the expiration of a long-term wholesale contract. Customers will benefit from the return of this facility to retail service, since it is one of our most efficient and lowest-cost facilities.
 Taxes other than income taxes reduced our earnings by $0.01 a share in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009. Lower revenues at Southern Power reduced our earnings by $0.01 per share. This decline in revenues is due primarily to slightly lower levels of contracted capacity and reduced demand from full requirements customers as a result of the recession. Finally, an increase in the number of shares outstanding reduced our earnings by $0.04 a share in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009.
 Now let's turn to the positive factors that drove our earnings for the third quarter of 2010.
 Warmer-than-normal weather in the third quarter added $0.15 per share to our earnings for the period compared with the third quarter of 2009. Retail revenue impacts in our Traditional business added a total of $0.11 per share to our earnings in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. This impact was driven primarily by non-fuel revenue changes related to the recovery of environmental expenses, a portion of Plant Miller in Alabama returning to retail service and other investments at our operating companies. Increased usage in industrial growth added $0.02 a share to our earnings in the third quarter compared with the third quarter of 2009. Finally, other operating revenues, primarily transmission revenues, added $0.02 a share to our earnings in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009.
 In conclusion, we had $0.31 of negative items compared with $0.30 of positive items or a negative change of $0.01 per share over the third quarter of 2009. So overall, our quarter came in at $0.98 per share.
 Before I discuss our earnings estimates for the fourth quarter, I'd like to update you on our outlook for the economy for the remainder of 2010.
 We are continuing to see a gradual economic recovery here in the Southeast, which is being driven primarily by the industrial sector. Industrial activity in the Southeast continues to expand, driven by modest economic growth domestically and more robust growth internationally. Our analysis and recent updates from our economic summit panelists suggest that we are seeing an increase in manufacturing productivity, use of temporary employees and longer work hours without the addition of new permanent employees. Panel members tell us that this situation is likely to continue until employers are convinced that the recovery is sustainable. When productivity improvements and temporary labor can no longer sustain higher levels of production, then we will see job creation and a corresponding improvement in the wage growth and consumer confidence, the final stage of economic recovery cycle. Early signs of this transition are beginning to appear, as the unemployment rate in Alabama has fallen from 11.1% to 8.9% in the past nine months.
 Turning now to our own customer data. Industrial sales increased by 7.3% in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009. Industrial sales in the third quarter were 94% of pre-recession levels, and they continue to exceed our expectations. On a year-to-date basis, the most significant increases were in primary metals, up 37.7%; transportation, up 14%; and chemicals, up 15.5%.
 One of our major steel producers in Alabama reports growing demand for its products, which serve the auto industry. In conjunction with this trend, the steel industry is forecasting an 8% increase in demand for its products in 2011. ThyssenKrupp continues to ramp up its operations in Alabama, with stainless steel production scheduled to begin in 2012.
 In the transportation sector, all of the auto manufacturers in our service territory are operating five days a week, with some Saturday production. Kia Motors and Hyundai Motors have announced that they are consolidating all of their SUV production at the new Kia facility, adding 600 new jobs at their West Point, Georgia plant. Hyundai's facility in Alabama will be fully utilized for the production of models other than SUVs.
 The exporting of goods produced in the Southeast continues to help support the region's economy. In the third quarter, the Port of Savanna, which is the fourth largest container port in the U.S., set an all-time record for product shipped to overseas markets, surpassing the previous records by more than 20%. Retail consumer goods, paper and paper products, food and automobiles were among the top 10 commodities shipped from ports in our territory.
 Continuing with customer category data. Adjusting for weather, residential sales increased by 0.1% in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. Commercial sales continued to contract, declining 0.8% on a weather-normal basis in the third quarter of 2010 compared with the third quarter of 2009. For the year-to-date 2010 compared with the same period in 2009, commercial sales are down 0.7% on a weather-normal basis.
 Total year-to-date retail sales are better than we originally expected, led by the industrial sector. Thus far, these improvements have largely occurred without significant job creation. As the recovery continues and the economy expands, this is expected to translate into improved opportunities for growth in our Residential and Commercial sectors.
 Turning now to our earnings guidance for the remainder of 2010. Our third quarter results exceeded our estimate by $0.04 per share. As we've discussed, the third quarter was largely influenced by warmer-than-normal weather and an improving industrial sector, but offset by higher O&M expenses and the impact of these regulatory items that I discussed earlier. For the remainder of the year, it's important to remember that two major factors will have a limiting effect on our earnings: one, a more normal level of O&M spending; and two, an increased number of shares outstanding.
 Given these factors, our earnings estimate for the fourth quarter is $0.16 per share, which means we expect to earn $2.36, which is at the top of our guidance range. It is also important to remember that in the long term, we remain focused on growing earnings per share at an average of 6% and in a range of between 5% and 7%.
 At this point, I'll turn the call over to David for his closing remarks.

Clearly, weather and an improving industrial sector have influenced our results this year.
 Certainly the economy, primarily industrial sales, have exceeded our expectations for the first nine months of this year. We always plan for normal weather, but the weather in 2010 has been anything but normal. We believe that capturing some of these unexpected upside for the benefit of our customers as we were allowed to do in Alabama is absolutely the right thing to do for the long-term sustainability of our business. As we've said countless times, the customer is at the center of everything we do. If we operate our business with the customer in mind, we believe we can continue to deliver regular, predictable and sustainable results over the long term.
 At this point, we are ready to take your questions. So if Celeste will now take the very first question.

I think everybody would suggest or oppose or saying to indicate that the Republicans' stake over the House, as you suggest, probably not the Senate, which means the House is still pretty evenly divided and difficult to pass any complex legislation. Just as soon as you get the House seated, you got to remember that people will start focusing on presidential election in '12. So the likelihood that they'd take up something as complex as climate legislation or even a rewrite of clean air act would be a challenging proposition going into presidential race. Now what that means is if we can't do things legislatively, then we're destined to continue on a very difficult regulatory route with EPA. And as you have seen already, there will be continuing challenges to almost every rule-making whether that happens to be mercury or 316(a) on the water side or any of the other regulations. That will simply continue and it will be a slow, difficult process.

It's not a good number, but it hasn't gotten any worse. Sales tax collections have risen for the first time since 2007, and that's a good indicator that retail sales are picking up. But basically, the commercial market will follow the residential market. And until the consumer gets back into the game and we see some progress in the unemployment picture, the commercial market growth is probably going to lag. Now some of our economic panelist members have indicated that for 2011, GDP growth may not be any better than it was in '10. There's not a lot of strong drivers out there pushing it. But we believe that the Southeast still has an advantage here, mostly because of the industrial sector and our productivity and efficiency of the facilities in the Southeast. So we're hopeful for some bleed off of that performance into these other markets.

We believe that the right national energy policy is one that has a balanced approach to the choice of fuels. So we believe and that's why we're investing in, new nuclear, 20% recall as we're doing in Kemper County.

We believe there must be an expansion of renewables, however, we all take into account the concerns about the cost effectiveness and reliability of those issues and in fact, energy efficiency, that is generation you don't have to produce. It's something that will be important in the future. So saying that, this notion of the rush to gas is something that you probably won't see us do. We've already laid plans for new nuclear. We've laid plans for clean coal. We have brought back one of the most efficient and inexpensive coal plants in America for the benefit of Alabama's customers. And with Plant McDonough in Georgia inside the perimeter highway for the city, we're in the process of retiring a coal plant 500 megawatts and building in its place 2,550 megawatts of highly efficient modern combined cycle gas. You will see us use all of those. The logical consequence is gas will be more important, but it will not be to the exclusion of the other fuels.

 As all of you know, in July, we announced that I would retire from Southern Company on December 1 of this year. During my tenure as CEO, I've enjoyed getting to know you and working with those of you in the financial community. You have my sincere respect for the job you do, and I thank you for your analysis and coverage of our company, your investment in our securities, as well as your advice and counsel.
 For the past 40 years, it's been a privilege to work in this great company. And since 2004, it's been an even higher privilege and honor to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Southern Company. As I prepare to enter retirement, I know this company is in very capable hands. I know that Tom Fanning and his management team will do an outstanding job and will continue our long-standing tradition of excellence.
 Thank you for joining us today.
