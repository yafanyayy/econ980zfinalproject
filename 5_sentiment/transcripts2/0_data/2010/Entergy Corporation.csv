I'll start with what's in the news most these days. The New Orleans Saints are going to the Super Bowl. At least, that's what's in the news down here. For most of you and what's most relevant to our discussion of course, is Vermont Yankee. I",4138,"Good morning. I'll start with what's in the news most these days. The New Orleans Saints are going to the Super Bowl. At least, that's what's in the news down here. For most of you and what's most relevant to our discussion of course, is Vermont Yankee. In an official statement on January 27, Governor Douglas indicated recent events at Vermont Yankee have raised many questions that need answers and actions before any decisions on the spin-off or license renewal can be made in Vermont. Those events include the finding of tritium in groundwater monitoring well on the plant site, as well as conflicting information provided to state officials about the existence and the extent of underground piping that carries radionuclides at Vermont Yankee. In addition to the time-out, in order to allow investigations to be completed, Governor Douglas called for Entergy to make immediate necessary changes in management to begin the process of restoring trust and credibility. The governor also indicated that he can no longer ask legislators to vote this year on the issue of who should be allowed to decide the request for license renewal. First, let me say Entergy Corporation and the Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee management team, take, with utmost seriousness, the responsibility to provide complete and accurate information to regulators and other stakeholders. In conversations with Governor Douglas, I made a personal commitment to not only resolve the known inconsistencies but also to seek out and find any and all discrepancies or less than clear information supplied by anyone in this process and correct the record. This is how Entergy operates. We will be both thorough and fully transparent in our investigations and findings, and we will restore trust and credibility with our stakeholders. The inconsistencies that the Governor is referring to pertain to information provided by Entergy on underground piping systems and the reliability assessment that is performed and finalized as required by law, by the Vermont Public Service Board in the fourth quarter of 2008. The questions extend to review the report findings made in the first half of 2009, and may have influenced the contractor's final report that was presented to the legislature. A comprehensive internal investigation conducted by an independent counsel is now underway to get to the bottom of this matter. I cannot comment on all matters related to the ongoing investigation but I can tell you what I know that is already in the public record as it now stands. The report by the state contractor was issued on December 22, 2008, and indicated that there were no underground pipes carrying radioactive nuclides, at the same time that our report referenced 14 pages of documentation provided by Entergy that clearly indicated there were such pipes. To my knowledge, while we commented on the report, we did not note the discrepancy between the report findings and the data that we had provided about three months earlier in September of 2008.In January 2009, about a month after the report was first issued, we submitted a response to a discovery request that indicated no such pipes existed now or in the past. That response was not accurate. It has been corrected and refiled. In May 2009, an Entergy executive testified in a hearing on the state's report that he didn't think we had any such pipes but he would get back to them. He did not get back to them. He has issued a public apology and made clear that he failed to provide full and complete information, either on the witness stand or by failing to get back to them.He has been permanently relieved of his duties in Vermont and placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the full investigation. There are other allegations or statements that have been made in the press about what Entergy may have said or not said. Those are all part of the investigation process, which is examining computer records, e-mails, calendars, notebooks, press notes of any and all of those involved, including the attorneys who represented company witnesses in the proceeding. In a letter to David O'Brien, Rick Smith also pledged that the company will cooperate fully with the investigation of this matter, and assist the state's independent inspection of the applicable piping systems.Meanwhile, work of a multi-disciplined technical team continues to investigate the tritium matter, leaving no stone unturned and wasting no time on the clock. Based on the experience of the United States nuclear plants and an industry-wide program, Entergy has paid significant attention to this issue in the past and we will continue to do so. The concentration level of tritium in a well dug exactly for that purpose of finding any potential leaks in a timely fashion has varied. And over the weekend, we observed the first reading just above the threshold level requiring regulatory reporting. It's important to note that there had been no elevated tritium level found in any drinking water well samples. The existence of tritium in such low levels does not present a risk to public health or safety. We continue to believe Vermont Yankee represents a vital source of clean, economical power that is safe, secure and reliable. It is a model plant in many respects. We do not comment on specific ratings of specific plants, but Vermont Yankee is among the elite in operating performance. Further, we remain unwavering in our belief that Vermont Yankee should continue operations for at least another 20 years beyond March 2012. For that to happen, the plant has to be safe, and we will resolve questions related to that issue in the coming weeks.Secondly, it has to be possible, and today, it is simply not covering its cost to capital. In an effort to advance the license renewal process in the legislature in December, Enexus submitted a letter to the Vermont Public Service Board of its notice of intent to file a proposed power purchase agreement. The letter outlined the terms of the expected offer, whereby Vermont Yankee will offer the two Vermont utilities the opportunity to exchange their 55% interest in the existing 10-year value-sharing arrangement for a new 150-megawatt 20-year power purchase agreement. Using the Department of Public Service recently approved wholesale price forecast, this would be a below-market PPA, which could provide a benefit of approximately $500 million.Furthermore, the benefit of the PPA would be over $800 million if the PPA were to be replaced with new renewable sources of power, that have similar low carbon emissions as Vermont Yankee. Add in retention of 650 high quality jobs plus local and state revenues, and estimated total economic benefits to the state, quickly exceed the $1 billion mark for the year [ph] period. Despite the current turmoil, which I clearly acknowledge was of our own making and should never have happened, when all is said and done, the results of an independent and thorough investigation and corrective actions that will be put in place, should suffer [ph] the legislature and the Vermont Public Service Board to look beyond our missteps and focus on what is in the long-term best interest of the citizens of Vermont. Particularly, the economic benefits in excess of $1 billion and the value of a proven safe, secure, reliable and clean source of power. A plant with an exemplary operating record.While Vermont Yankee's license expires in March of 2012, we do not have anywhere near that long to make decisions on the future of Vermont Yankee. Key dates for substantial commitments may occur as early as the second quarter of 2011. The Governor has clearly put the ball in our court now, and we will do everything possible to give it back to Vermont as soon as possible, so no action doesn't result in the decision by default.Next, let's turn to the spin. It should come as no surprise that positively resolving a spin-off is a top priority of the company. We continue to believe that executing the spin is the best path forward for all stakeholders. Since we last met at EEI, the NRC  determined good cause has been shown and in January, extended the approval to execute the spin-off to August 1 of this year. In Vermont, the company responded to data requests submitted by the Vermont Public Service Board, in response to an earlier memorandum of understanding reached with the Vermont Department of Public Service resolving outstanding issues. Of course, that was before Governor Douglas directed the Department of Public Service to request a stay in the proceeding until Entergy resolved its current concerns about Entergy.In New York, remaining milestones outlined in the ALJ's procedural schedule were concluded. The procedural schedule established by the New York ALJ supports a potential decision by the New York Commission at its February 11 meeting. Many of you have asked what actions we might consider in the event we receive a decision from the New York Public Service Commission substantially different than what we are seeking. Given where we are in the proceeding, and the wide range of possible outcomes, we simply won't speculate on any specific what if. However, once the New York Commission acts, I can say that our Board of Directors has already committed to a timely schedule for briefing, evaluation and assessment on what comes next. An acceptable outcome in New York moves us back to Vermont to determine the ultimate path forward for the spin-off, either with or without Vermont Yankee. A path with an acceptable Vermont outcome by the end of the first quarter, enables Entergy to promptly undertake during the second quarter, the remaining activities to establish Enexus and EquaGen separate from Entergy. A path without Vermont would extend the time to spin into the second half of this year. If the New York ruling however, simply does not support moving forward in the best interest for stakeholders, we'll take decisive actions to eliminate dis-synergies and implement other plans to capture maximum benefits over time, some of which could be achieved in the near term with others requiring more time. In all cases, the Board will also evaluate the appropriate course of action for the dividend, which has remain unchanged since July of 2007 pending the spin-off. You may also recall last October the Board authorized the $750 million share repurchase program that will be considered for immediate implementation along with any changes in the dividend payout.Now let's turn to a discussion about the notable events during the quarter, and a discussion of other 2010 goals. I'll continue with Entergy Nuclear. The fleet continued its outstanding performance during the fourth quarter, running at an approximate 99% capacity factor. Our new Entergy Nuclear Chief Executive and Chief Nuclear Officer, John Herron, took over the top box on December 1 upon the retirement of Mike Kansler. Many of you know Mike well. Mike made invaluable contributions since showing Entergy in 1998, and planned well ahead for an orderly succession by selecting and developing an outstanding leader and operator, prepared and eager to continue the record of achievements set by Mike, Gary Taylor, Jerry Yelverton and Don Hintz before him. Mike remains involved in the consulting role to ensure an efficient transition and in particular, to assist in efforts related to the spin-off and license renewal at Indian Point. John Herron, who is on the call with us this morning, previously served as Entergy's Chief Senior Vice President for Nuclear Operations, handling the operational side of the entire fleet, bringing capability factors up to record levels. He has been the heir apparent to Mike for some time. Tutor in the same mold as Mike can [ph] for his predecessors, I'm sure he will enjoy visiting with him at future investor conferences. In other matters, Entergy Nuclear was pleased to report and has agreed to extend its nuclear services agreement with the Nebraska Public Power District's Cooper Nuclear Station for an additional 15 years. Nebraska Public Power's decision to extend the agreement was based on the significant improvements in regulatory and operational performance realized, since the beginning of the agreement in 2003 when Entergy took over operations. The Support Service contract is a model for the industry, demonstrating the fleet leverage that can add value as a single unit or single-flight operators. The contract is also an example of the opportunities John Herron will continue to pursue in his role as CEO designate of EquaGen. Regarding goals for 2010, the commitment to safety, security and operational excellence for the nuclear fleet remains at the forefront, followed by license renewal. We're expecting license renewal from the NRC in 2010, for both Vermont Yankee and Pilgrim. You may recall that both plants successfully completed the NRC license renewal process, including obtaining favorable rulings in hearings before the Atomic Safety Licensing Board. In both processes, appeals were ultimately filed with the NRC, by Pilgrim Watch for the Pilgrim renewal and the New England Coalition for Vermont Yankee renewal. Those appeals remain outstanding. At Indian Point, activities will continue in 2010, consistent with the NRC schedule, targeting a 2011 decision on license renewal.We were encouraged by the final energy plan recently adopted by the New York State Energy Planning Board. That plan incorporated modifications to the original draft that was somewhat dismissive of the magnitude of the problem of replacing Indian Point in New York with other sources of power. The report acknowledged that the Indian Point Energy Center is important from a reliability perspective, due to critical voltage support provided to the New York City-Hudson Valley regions, and further explains the risk the retirement of the Indian Point Energy Center would present, and substantial trade-offs such as higher electric prices and CO2 emissions. In a new addition to the final plan, the report goes a step further. It acknowledges that further studies must be done in order to ascertain the potential impacts of not having the Indian Point Energy Center on the ability to transfer power to downstate load areas, the transfer capability of transmission system into the area, reactive power sources in the lower Hudson Valley and overall system reliability. We agree and of course, we do have a strong point of view on what objective analysis of these issues will demonstrate.Turning to the utility. Destructive regulatory outcomes have dominated the quarter. Entergy Texas  concluded a storm recovery for Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, following successful issuances of $545.9 million of securitization bonds in November. In Louisiana, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana entered into a black-box stipulation agreement with the Louisiana Public Service Commission staff, that allows total recoverable storm costs for Hurricanes Gustav and Ike of $627.9 million, including carrying charges, through June 15, 2010. That represents over 98% of the company's request.Further, staff and the companies agreed that when Act 55 financing is accomplished, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will also establish securitized storm reserves in the collective amount of $290 million, bringing the total amount to be securitized to just under $700 million. Recall that the Louisiana companies previously accessed nearly $220 million from funded storm reserves, shortly after damage from the hurricane. That's how you get to the $700 million number.Also, at the end of the year, Entergy Texas continued to push forward in its 15-year quest to actually earn a fair return on its investment, in order to continue to attract capital to support substantial the investments that has greatly improved reliability and customer service in Texas since the acquisition of Gulf State's utilities in the mid-90s. For example, in the two years between April 2007 and June 2009, Entergy Texas completed $376.5 million in capital projects to improve and maintain transmission and distribution systems. Over $600 million of projects are planned for the next three years, bringing the company's infrastructure investments to $1.6 billion since 1999 alone. In addition, there is much more to the $198.7 million rate request in improving and maintaining the infrastructure. A large portion of the request should be indisputable, simply a recovery of purchase power to meet test for usage. There is no profit on these purchases for the company. And we have no mechanism to keep the company whole for these outlays at the present time. The rate case provides a rider to recover these costs consistent with protections under the law for prudently incurred costs on behalf of customers. In addition, the company is proposing a more streamlined rate-making process, while still providing for full regulatory oversight by the PUCT. Entergy Texas has proposed a cost of service adjustment or COSA rider, similar to the mechanism used by the Railroad Commission regulating gas utilities in Texas, and the formula rate plan mechanisms in place at other Entergy operating companies. This would serve to mitigate the need to what has been near back-to-back full rate filings and litigation before the commission. This rate case will also serve to establish the baseline value to be used in future annual updates, to the transmission cost recovery rider authorized by the Legislature for Entergy Texas last year. Entergy Texas is negotiating with the parties to develop a procedural schedule that will provide for a commission decision before the end of 2010.In Mississippi, a second fuel audit undertaken at the request of the commission, thoroughly investigated Entergy Mississippi's fuel and purchased energy cost. The audit result was very positive, as it did not recommend that any cost be disallowed. The report did suggest that some costs, in fact less than 1% of the 1.66 billion in fuel and purchased energy during the audit period, may have been more reasonably charged to customers to base rates rather than to fuel charge. More importantly, the report did not suggest that customers should not have paid for those costs. These audit findings were consistent with an earlier commission-ordered audit, that found to a great degree energy, fuel, transmission rights and access, and other related private products, are purchased on an integrated basis, meaning systemwide, as the lowest overall cost to all utility subsidiaries.For 2010, the utility has its usual full regulatory agenda. And let me assure you, they continue to work on the spin as not deflecting any attention or commitment away from achieving these important objectives. The top priority is to ensure each company has a real opportunity to earn fair ROEs that are comparable to alternative investments. You may recall that the Louisiana utility operating companies obtained constructive outcomes in 2009, with Entergy New Orleans entering into a definitive settlement agreement last spring, and Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana agreeing to extend formula rate plans last fall. Both Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana will continue efforts to obtain a rider to recover the costs of incremental investments in the transmission system.Despite obtaining a rate increase in 2009, Entergy Mississippi will continue to under-earn its allowed ROE, absent implementing modifications being sought to its formula rate plan or reducing the quality of service to its customers, and that, we will not do. Simply put, due to its particular cost structure and investment needs, Entergy Mississippi doesn't have the same return on capital opportunity as other Mississippi utilities it competes with for capital to service customers. Current base rates are also inadequate for Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas, with both seeking fair and reasonable outcomes in 2010 for rate cases initiated in 2009. Yesterday, Entergy Arkansas initiated a filing to pursue securitization of the 2009 ice storm as an alternative to the base rate recovery request in its rate base filing. You may recall, a securitization bill was enacted last year in Arkansas for any major storm from January 1, 2009 forward. A prudent decision considering another ice storm struck Arkansas just last week. Fortunately, the ice storm did far less damage than originally forecasted. Nonetheless, Entergy Arkansas was well prepared for the storm and has restored power as of yesterday to all the related 30,000 customer outages. In other regulatory matters, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana expect to close the book on Hurricanes Gustav and Ike by executing storm securitization and financing, before the peak storm season begins next summer. In addition, Entergy Louisiana expects to conclude its cost recovery efforts associated with the Little Gypsy project, will also take the necessary steps to gain approval for the Acadia power plant acquisition announced last October. The portfolio transformation strategy also remains a high priority, focused on both generation and transmission solutions. The utility operating companies will continue efforts to enhance the RFP process, considering market opportunities and system needs and will press forward on efforts to resolve outstanding issues associated with the system agreement. In fact, FERC has already acted to remove the uncertainties resulting from the differences of opinion on the issue of continuing obligations under the system agreement. In a November ruling, FERC accepted notices of cancellation to determine Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi are permitted to withdraw from the system agreement following the 96-month notice period, without payment of any exit fee or being required to otherwise compensate remaining operating companies, as a result of their withdrawal. Rehearing requests for this ruling from the Louisiana Public Service Commission and the City of Calfor [ph] at New Orleans are pending before FERC. Turning to transmission. The utility operating companies are working closely with the newly formed Entergy Regional State Committee, the E-RSC, to determine the appropriate path forward, following the expiration of the Independent Coordinator of Transmission approval this November. Again, that's the Entergy Regional State Committee, and that's a mouthful, so we will refer to it as the E-RSC, and you can probably expect to hear that many times in the coming months, and they will be very active. In a filing with FERC last November, the utility operating companies indicated that the two primary alternatives under consideration for adoption of certain modifications to the current ICT arrangements or transition to membership to the SPP RTO, a critical factor in our proposal will be the opinion and recommendation of the E-RSC. We expect the E-RSC will rely heavily on the cost-benefit analysis being jointly sponsored by both the E-RSC and FERC, comparing the current ICT arrangement to joining SPP. That analysis is anticipated to be finalized during the third quarter this year. In addition, the E-RSC is currently considering potential modifications to the ICT arrangement, including among others, providing the E-RSC with authority upon a unanimous vote, to propose modifications to cost allocation policy for transmission upgrades, and the ability to add projects to the operating companies transmission construction plan. Given the timing required to complete this work, an extension of the ICT for some period will likely be required under either scenario being considered. As the SPP RTO is ultimately deemed the preferred alternative, SPP has indicated the implementation process may take at least 12 to 18 months after the decision is made.Before closing, I would like to point out one of our proudest accomplishments for 2009. More specifically, it was the safest year in Entergy's history, yet our employees still aren't satisfied. As they continue their march toward reaching the ultimate goal of Target Zero Accidents. And this has been a march. 2009 was no aberration. In seven of the last 10 years, a new safety record was established. Zero accidents seems like an ideal to some but to Entergy, it is our annual goal. Persistence, perseverance and awareness are three qualities of an employee whose mind is focused on safety. Likewise, a parallel can be drawn to financial outcomes in 2009. Top-quartile shareholder return is not simply a vision but it is our annual goal. In 2009, we not only missed the target, we missed to size the bar incompletely, to mix metaphors. It was extremely disappointing, particularly in light of how much was actually accomplished relative to our ongoing goals, and they were consistent with our corporate values. Not only was 2009 the safest year in company history but also, Entergy was recognized as the best utility safety program in the world by Dow Jones Sustainability Index. 2009 was the second-best year on record for reliability of service as defined by outage frequency. 2009 was the best year ever for outlook from our collective nuclear fleet. Vermont Yankee, Fitzpatrick, River Bend and Grand Gulf all achieved or are on record runs. 2009 was the highest operational earnings and reported earnings per share in company history. That's new records in safety, operational excellence and profitability. But even given all that, total shareholder return was stunningly below our expectations and our aspirations. We still believe we're focused on the right things, the things that drive success and sustainability. Obviously, we still have some things to accomplish and to prove, not just in Vermont but to all of you, and we will. Now I'll turn the call over to Leo."
269764,84650614,48015,"Entergy Corporation, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2010",2010-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Entergy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Wayne, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results, our cash performance for the quarter and year-to-date periods and a review of our 2010 earnings guidance, including some c",1681,"Thank you, Wayne, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results, our cash performance for the quarter and year-to-date periods and a review of our 2010 earnings guidance, including some comments on the quarterly buildup. Looking first at our financial results for the quarter, Slide 2 shows an increase in fourth quarter 2009 as reported in operational earnings compared to one year ago. This increase came as a result of higher earnings at Utility, Parent & Other as well as the Non-nuclear Wholesale business, partially offset by lower results at Entergy Nuclear.Operational earnings continue to exclude special items related to the planned-for spin-off for incremental dis-synergies at Entergy Nuclear in 2009, and outside service expenses at the parent in 2008 and 2009. The third special item impacted 2008 results at each of the business segments, resulting from the change in the fully diluted EPS calculation that we described in our fourth quarter 2008 earnings release, due to the unsuccessful remarketing of the equity units earlier this year.In reviewing the overall quarterly results, two factors stand out. We saw positive sales trends in all utility customer classes and the non-utility nuclear fleet had a near-perfect run for the second quarter in a row. Slide 3 presents the factors that drove the quarter-on-quarter results in more detail. Starting with Entergy Nuclear, the non-utility Nuclear fleet delivered a solid quarter, posting a 99% capacity factor. However, results were down versus fourth quarter of 2008, due primarily to higher income taxes. An increase in non-fuel O&M expense also contributed to the lower earnings consistent with the quarter, with no refueling outages.Higher taxes were associated with the net effect of consolidated tax adjustments in 2009 compared to 2008. Entergy Nuclear received a significant benefit from the annual allocation last year. These adjustments typically made in the fourth quarter of each year, net to zero, on a consolidated basis.Entergy Nuclear received significant benefit from annual allocation last year. These adjustments typically made in the fourth quarter of each year net to zero on a consolidated basis.Looking at operational results on a pre-tax basis, Entergy Nuclear's earnings increased by approximately $70 million versus fourth quarter of 2008 were nearly 30% quarter-over-quarter. The factors driving this improvement in pre-tax income were higher net revenue, due to higher pricing and higher production as a result of no scheduled refueling outages in the current quarter and higher other income including realized earnings on decommissioning trust investments. Also contributing to the increase in other income was a smaller decommissioning impairment in the current quarter.Next at Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets business, fourth quarter 2009 earnings were higher compared to last year. Tax benefits were the primary drivers in both periods.Now turning to Utility, Parent & Other, operational earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 exceeded results last year. The major drivers for the higher earnings were lower income tax expense, a decline in non-fuel operational and maintenance expense due primarily to the absence of regulatory charges at Entergy Arkansas in 2008 and higher utility net revenue.With regard to tax expense, the primary factor producing the lower expense was the net effect of consolidated tax adjustments. Again these adjustments are made across the Entergy companies and net to zero on a consolidated basis. The lower income tax expense was also due to the absence of flow-through effects of last year's regulatory charges previously noted and a favorable tax reserve adjustment in the current quarter based on a private letter ruling from Louisiana taxing authority on securitization of Hurricane Katrina and Rita costs. Turning to sales, you'll notice on Table 4 of our earnings release, retail sales grew by 5% on a weather adjusted basis. Slide 4 shows the monthly trends in retail build sales since December 2008 for the utility in total and by customer class. Each data point represents the rolling three-month change in usage compared to the prior year adjusted for weather. We've seen a steady improvement in utility sales in 2009, that's the red line particularly in the Industrial segment, which is the blue line. As you know, however, a portion of this growth in 2009 is due to the recovery from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike last September. Slide 5 shows the same information adjusted for the hurricane effects.Two key points can be taken from the Slide . First, after adjusting for hurricanes industrial sales decline about 1% compared to fourth quarter of 2008 the significant improvement from the 7% drop at the end of September. This improvement in the most recent quarter was led by large industrial customers particularly in the hardest hit chemicals and refining sectors. Second, weather adjusted residential sales growth, the green line turned positive around the middle of the year ending the fourth quarter at 1.5% above last year on a weather and hurricane adjusted basis.While it's certainly too early to say the risk of further economic contraction is over, we are encouraged by the steady improvement in utility sales for all of our customer classes through most of 2009. Given the strong finish to last year, we now project 2010 retail sales growth between 2.5% and 3%, excluding industrial expansions and 4.5% when you add the expansions in.Moving to full year results on Slide 6, compares as reported and operational earnings in 2009 to 2008. Higher earnings at Utility, Parent & Other in the Non-Nuclear Wholesale Generation business were partially offset by lower results of Entergy Nuclear. On an operational basis, 2009 earnings ended the year at $6.67 per share, up to 2.5% over 2008. The main drivers for this increase were higher net revenue, including the absence of customer outages resulting from Gustav and Ike last year and results of rate actions, as well as higher other income.Items providing a partial offset including increase in other than temporary impairments on decommissioning trust investments, higher non-fuel O&M and depreciation expense, which was partially offset by the absence of the regulatory charges of Entergy Arkansas in 2008 and a higher income tax expense.Looking more closely at the factors that drove the year-over-year changes at each of the segments, Utility, Parent & Other earnings increased in 2009 due primarily to the increase in net revenue for the reasons noted before, the absence of regulatory charges in Entergy Arkansas in 2008 and a lower effective income tax rate. Higher depreciation and amortization expense due to increased plant and service partially offset these items. For Entergy Nuclear earnings fell primarily due to higher effective income tax rate driven by net effects of consolidated tax adjustments discussed earlier, an increase in O&M expense and an increase in impairments on decommissioning trust investments.Results for Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets business were higher in 2009 compared to last year due primarily to lower income tax expense. Slide 7 provides a recap of our cash flow performance this quarter which shows an increase compared to the same period last year. Operating cash flow was nearly $300 million higher due to the absence in the current quarter of the negative effects of Gustav and Ike in 2008, higher net revenue at the Utility Entergy Nuclear and a decrease in refueling outage cost and lower working capital requirements also at Entergy Nuclear. These were partially offset by lower deferred fuel collections at the utility.For the year 2009, operating cash flow was down by approximately $400 million. This is due primarily to the absence of just under $1 billion of securitization proceeds in Louisiana received in 2008 for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Other factors largely at the utility provided a partial offset.Slide 8 details our 2010 earnings guidance, which we are affirming today. 2010 guidance ranges from $6.40 to $7.20 per share on an operational basis and $6.15 to $6.95 per share on an as reported basis. Guidance assumes business as usual operations for the full year. Operational earnings guidance also excludes $0.25 per share in special items associated with the planned spin-off. The details shown on Slide 8 should be familiar to you as it has not changed since we initiated guidance last October. In keeping with past practice, we have however, adjusted a few line items in the Utility, Parent & Other section to reflect to 2009 actual results.As a reminder, earnings guidance ranges for Utility, Parent & Other now include the Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets business. We will be reporting actual results in this manner in our earnings releases starting next quarter.One last point on earnings guidance related to the build up on a quarterly basis as reflected on Slide 9. Key events to keep in mind when considering the quarters: The estimated increase in utility net revenue includes an expected decision in Arkansas, which has assumed to go into effect in midyear in our guidance. The estimated decrease in net revenue at Entergy Nuclear includes lower volume due to one additional refueling outages, four refueling outages are planned this year, two in the fall, two in the spring, compared to three in the spring of 2009. Entergy Nuclear's results in 2009 included $0.24 per share of impairments mostly in the second quarter.  Share repurchases of $750 million are assumed to occur ratably in guidance resulting in back-end loaded accretion effect purchases under this program will be dependent on the timing of the spin.Finally, tax items are lumpy by nature and significant tax benefits in 2009 were realized in the second and fourth quarters. One last comment before closing. As many of you may have noted, we did not include longer-term forward-looking information in our release this time. Given where we are in the spin-off process, we will defer until the appropriate time any discussion on post spin outlooks such as financial aspirations, earnings into our EBITDA for each company on a standalone basis and other similar forward-looking information. However, both the Utility and Nuclear businesses continue to have fundamental, operational and strategic opportunities to create value and drive growth regardless of the spin-off. Let me assure you, we have not lost sight on these objectives.And now the Entergy Senior team is available for your questions."

Tomorrow, I will get a full briefing of where we're at on the investigation. I think the investigation is actually drawing to a close with regard to all of our own people, on our own information. Of course, we are not at liberty at this point in time to seek out all the information that everyone else has, it might be involved in the process, which might be very helpful to complete the investigation. But all of our own people and all of our own data records and all those have been I think virtually complete. It's a matter of assimilating all of the information in a report, which again I will say, we have all day tomorrow reserved for an update on that. The Tridium [ph] issue itself like I said is huge in all this and our people -- this is one of the things that we are really, really good at as a fleet operator. We can put a lot of people with a lot of experience, we have seen a lot of different things on this and develop some pretty good plans and point ourselves in some pretty good directions and where and how this could happen. And that's what's happening. We are not in certainly a position at point in time to say that we know but we have a very good leads and we are known to down pretty quickly and I don't think that will be a hindrance either. We are hopeful that in the next few weeks that we will be able to present results, in Vermont where we are at and that we'll satisfy them that their worst fears are not real and we're taking care of the problems and the steps that we have and it won't happen again."

So from an economic perspective, that's a pretty big number when you're having a net income loss and you're not covering any return on your cost of capital, which is a real expense. So in the absence of a PPA, that greatly changes that situation. There is virtually no impact on Entergy at that point in time. If they kind of put it bluntly without some changes in the PPA it's fairly clear that Vermont has more to lose here than we do. This is a very valuable resource in Vermont. And I expect that we will come to an agreement given that fact. But the option of if not shutting it down is very distasteful. We have a lot of employees up there that are doing excellent job.

I'll start with what's in the news most these days. The New Orleans Saints are going to the Super Bowl. At least, that's what's in the news down here. For most of you and what's most relevant to our discussion of course, is Vermont Yankee. I",4136,"Good morning. I'll start with what's in the news most these days. The New Orleans Saints are going to the Super Bowl. At least, that's what's in the news down here. For most of you and what's most relevant to our discussion of course, is Vermont Yankee. In an official statement on January 27, Governor Douglas indicated recent events at Vermont Yankee have raised many questions that need answers and actions before any decisions on the spin-off or license renewal can be made in Vermont. Those events include the finding of tritium in groundwater monitoring well on the plant site, as well as conflicting information provided to state officials about the existence and the extent of underground piping that carries radionuclides at Vermont Yankee. In addition to the time-out, in order to allow investigations to be completed, Governor Douglas called for Entergy to make immediate necessary changes in management to begin the process of restoring trust and credibility. The governor also indicated that he can no longer ask legislators to vote this year on the issue of who should be allowed to decide the request for license renewal. First, let me say Entergy Corporation and the Entergy Nuclear Vermont Yankee management team, take, with utmost seriousness, the responsibility to provide complete and accurate information to regulators and other stakeholders. In conversations with Governor Douglas, I made a personal commitment to not only resolve the known inconsistencies but also to seek out and find any and all discrepancies or less than clear information supplied by anyone in this process and correct the record. This is how Entergy operates. We will be both thorough and fully transparent in our investigations and findings, and we will restore trust and credibility with our stakeholders. The inconsistencies that the Governor is referring to pertain to information provided by Entergy on underground piping systems and the reliability assessment that was performed and finalized as required by law, by the Vermont Public Service Board in the fourth quarter of 2008. The questions extend to a review of the report findings made in the first half of 2009, and may have influenced the contractor's final report that was presented to the legislature. A comprehensive internal investigation conducted by an independent counsel is now underway to get to the bottom of this matter. I cannot comment on all matters related to the ongoing investigation but I can tell you what I know that is already in the public record as it now stands. The report by the state contractor was issued on December 22, 2008, and indicated that there were no underground pipes carrying radioactive nuclides. At the same time our report referenced 14 pages of documentation provided by Entergy that clearly indicated there were such pipes. To my knowledge, while we commented on the report, we did not note the discrepancy between the report findings and the data that we had provided about three months earlier in September of 2008.In January 2009, about a month after the report was first issued, we submitted a response to a discovery request that indicated no such pipes existed now or in the past. That response was not accurate. It has been corrected and refiled. In May 2009, an Entergy executive testified in a hearing on the state's report that he didn't think we had any such pipes but he would get back to them. He did not get back to them. He has issued a public apology and made clear that he failed to provide full and complete information, either on the witness stand or by failing to get back to them.He has been permanently relieved of his duties in Vermont and placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the full investigation. There are other allegations or statements that have been made in the press about what Entergy may have said or not said. Those are all part of the investigation process, which is examining computer records, e-mails, calendars, notebooks, press notes of any and all of those involved, including the attorneys who represented company witnesses in the proceeding. In a letter to David O'Brien, Rick Smith also pledged that the company will cooperate fully with the investigation of this matter, and assist the state's independent inspection of the applicable piping systems.Meanwhile, work of a multi-disciplined technical team continues to investigate the tritium matter, leaving no stone unturned and wasting no time on the clock. Based on the experience of the United States nuclear plants and an industry-wide program, Entergy has paid significant attention to this issue in the past and we will continue to do so. The concentration level of tritium in a well dug exactly for that purpose of finding any potential leaks in a timely fashion has varied. And over the weekend, we observed the first reading just above the threshold level requiring regulatory reporting. It's important to note that there had been no elevated tritium level found in any drinking water well samples. The existence of tritium in such low levels does not present a risk to public health or safety. We continue to believe Vermont Yankee represents a vital source of clean, economical power that is safe, secure and reliable. It is a model plant in many respects. We do not comment on specific ratings of specific plants, but Vermont Yankee is among the elite in operating performance. Further, we remain unwavering in our belief that Vermont Yankee should continue operations for at least another 20 years beyond March 2012. For that to happen, the plant has to be safe, and we will resolve questions related to that issue in the coming weeks.Secondly, it has to be possible, and today, it is simply not covering its cost to capital. In an effort to advance the license renewal process in the legislature in December, Enexus submitted a letter to the Vermont Public Service Board of its notice of intent to file a proposed power purchase agreement. The letter outlined the terms of the expected offer, whereby Vermont Yankee will offer the two Vermont utilities the opportunity to exchange their 55% interest in the existing 10-year value-sharing arrangement for a new 150-megawatt 20-year power purchase agreement. Using the Department of Public Service recently approved wholesale price forecast, this would be a below-market PPA, which could provide a benefit of approximately $500 million.Furthermore, the benefit of the PPA would be over $800 million if the PPA were to be replaced with new renewable sources of power that have similar low carbon emissions as Vermont Yankee. Add in retention of 650 high quality jobs plus local and state revenues, and the estimated total economic benefits to the state quickly exceed the $1 billion mark for the year [ph] period. Despite the current turmoil, which I clearly acknowledge was of our own making and should never have happened, when all is said and done, the results of an independent and thorough investigation and corrective actions that will be put in place, should comfort the legislature and the Vermont Public Service Board to look beyond our missteps and focus on what is in the long-term best interest of the citizens of Vermont. Particularly, the economic benefits in excess of $1 billion and the value of a proven safe, secure, reliable and clean source of power. A plant with an exemplary operating record.While Vermont Yankee's license expires in March of 2012, we do not have anywhere near that long to make decisions on the future of Vermont Yankee. Key dates for substantial commitments may occur as early as the second quarter of 2011. The Governor has clearly put the ball in our court now, and we will do everything possible to give it back to Vermont as soon as possible so no action doesn't result in the decision by default.Next, let's turn to the spin. It should come as no surprise that positively resolving a spin-off is a top priority of the company. We continue to believe that executing the spin is the best path forward for all stakeholders. Since we last met at EEI, the NRC determined good cause had been shown and in January, extended the approval to execute the spin-off to August 1 of this year. In Vermont, the company responded to data requests submitted by the Vermont Public Service Board, in response to an earlier memorandum of understanding reached with the Vermont Department of Public Service resolving outstanding issues. Of course, that was before Governor Douglas directed the Department of Public Service to request a stay in the proceeding until Entergy resolved its current concerns about Entergy.In New York, remaining milestones outlined in the ALJ's procedural schedule were concluded. The procedural schedule established by the New York ALJ supports a potential decision by the New York Commission at its February 11 meeting. Many of you have asked what actions we might consider in the event we receive a decision from the New York Public Service Commission substantially different than what we are seeking. Given where we are in the proceeding, and the wide range of possible outcomes, we simply won't speculate on any specific what if. However, once the New York Commission acts, I can say that our Board of Directors has already committed to a timely schedule for briefing, evaluation and assessment on what comes next. An acceptable outcome in New York moves us back to Vermont to determine the ultimate path forward for the spin-off, either with or without Vermont Yankee. A path with an acceptable Vermont outcome by the end of the first quarter, enables Entergy to promptly undertake during the second quarter, the remaining activities to establish Enexus and EquaGen separate from Entergy. A path without Vermont would extend the time to spin into the second half of this year. If the New York ruling however, simply does not support moving forward in the best interest for stakeholders, we'll take decisive actions to eliminate dis-synergies and implement other plans to capture maximum benefits over time, some of which could be achieved in the near term with others requiring more time. In all cases, the Board will also evaluate the appropriate course of action for the dividend, which has remain unchanged since July of 2007 pending the spin-off. You may also recall last October the Board authorized the $750 million share repurchase program that will be considered for immediate implementation along with any changes in the dividend payout.Now let's turn to a discussion about the notable events during the quarter, and a discussion of other 2010 goals. I'll continue with Entergy Nuclear. The fleet continued its outstanding performance during the fourth quarter, running at an approximate 99% capacity factor. Our new Entergy Nuclear Chief Executive and Chief Nuclear Officer, John Herron, took over the top box on December 1 upon the retirement of Mike Kansler. Many of you know Mike well. Mike made invaluable contributions since showing Entergy in 1998, and planned well ahead for an orderly succession by selecting and developing an outstanding leader and operator, prepared and eager to continue the record of achievements set by Mike, Gary Taylor, Jerry Yelverton and Don Hintz before him. Mike remains involved in the consulting role to ensure an efficient transition and in particular, to assist in efforts related to the spin-off and license renewal at Indian Point. John Herron, who is on the call with us this morning, previously served as Entergy's Chief Senior Vice President for Nuclear Operations, handling the operational side of the entire fleet, bringing capability factors up to record levels. He has been the heir apparent to Mike for some time. Tutored in the same mold as Mike Kansler and his predecessors, I'm sure you will enjoy visiting with him at future investor conferences. In other matters, Entergy Nuclear was pleased to report and has agreed to extend its nuclear services agreement with the Nebraska Public Power District's Cooper Nuclear Station for an additional 15 years. Nebraska Public Power's decision to extend the agreement was based on the significant improvements in regulatory and operational performance realized, since the beginning of the agreement in 2003 when Entergy took over operations. The Support Service contract is a model for the industry, demonstrating the fleet leverage that can add value as a single unit or single-flight operators. The contract is also an example of the opportunities John Herron will continue to pursue in his role as CEO designate of EquaGen. Regarding goals for 2010, the commitment to safety, security and operational excellence for the nuclear fleet remains at the forefront, followed by license renewal. We're expecting license renewal from the NRC in 2010, for both Vermont Yankee and Pilgrim. You may recall that both plants successfully completed the NRC license renewal process, including obtaining favorable rulings in hearings before the Atomic Safety Licensing Board. In both processes, appeals were ultimately filed with the NRC, by Pilgrim Watch for the Pilgrim renewal and the New England Coalition for Vermont Yankee renewal. Those appeals remain outstanding. At Indian Point, activities will continue in 2010, consistent with the NRC schedule, targeting a 2011 decision on license renewal.We were encouraged by the final energy plan recently adopted by the New York State Energy Planning Board. That plan incorporated modifications to the original draft that was somewhat dismissive of the magnitude of the problem of replacing Indian Point in New York with other sources of power. The report acknowledged that the Indian Point Energy Center is important from a reliability perspective, due to critical voltage support provided to the New York City-Hudson Valley regions, and further explains the risk the retirement of the Indian Point Energy Center would present, and substantial trade-offs such as higher electric prices and CO2 emissions. In a new addition to the final plan, the report goes a step further. It acknowledges that further studies must be done in order to ascertain the potential impacts of not having the Indian Point Energy Center on the ability to transfer power to downstate load areas, the transfer capability of transmission system into the area, reactive power sources in the lower Hudson Valley and overall system reliability. We agree and of course, we do have a strong point of view on what objective analysis of these issues will demonstrate.Turning to the utility. Destructive regulatory outcomes have dominated the quarter. Entergy Texas  concluded a storm recovery for Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, following successful issuances of $545.9  million  of securitization bonds in November. In Louisiana, Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana entered into a black-box stipulation agreement with the Louisiana Public Service Commission staff, that allows total recoverable storm costs for Hurricanes Gustav and Ike of $627.9 million, including carrying charges, through June 15, 2010.  That represents over 98% of the company's request.Further, staff and the companies agreed that when Act 55 financing is accomplished, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana will also establish securitized storm reserves in the collective amount of $290 million, bringing the total amount to be securitized to just under $700 million. Recall that the Louisiana companies previously accessed nearly $220 million from funded storm reserves, shortly after damage from the hurricane. That's how you get to the $700 million number.Also, at the end of the year, Entergy Texas continued to push forward in its 15-year  quest to actually earn a fair return on its investment, in order to continue to attract capital to support substantial the investments that has greatly improved reliability and customer service in Texas since the acquisition of Gulf State's utilities in the mid-90s.  For example, in the two years between April 2007 and June 2009, Entergy Texas completed $376.5 million in capital projects to improve and maintain transmission and distribution systems. Over $600 million of projects are planned for the next three years, bringing the company's infrastructure investments to $1.6 billion since 1999 alone. In addition, there is much more to the $198.7 million rate request in improving and maintaining the infrastructure. A large portion of the request should be indisputable, simply a recovery of purchase power to meet test for usage. There is no profit on these purchases for the company. And we have no mechanism to keep the company whole for these outlays at the present time. The rate case provides a rider to recover these costs consistent with protections under the law for prudently incurred costs on behalf of customers. In addition, the company is proposing a more streamlined rate-making process, while still providing for full regulatory oversight by the PUCT. Entergy Texas has proposed a cost of service adjustment or COSA rider, similar to the mechanism used by the Railroad Commission regulating gas utilities in Texas, and the formula rate plan mechanisms in place at other Entergy operating companies. This would serve to mitigate the need to what has been near back-to-back full rate filings and litigation before the commission. This rate case will also serve to establish the baseline value to be used in future annual updates, to the transmission cost recovery rider authorized by the Legislature for Entergy Texas last year. Entergy Texas is negotiating with the parties to develop a procedural schedule that will provide for a commission decision before the end of 2010.In Mississippi, a second fuel audit undertaken at the request of the commission, thoroughly investigated Entergy Mississippi's fuel and purchased energy cost. The audit result was very positive, as it did not recommend that any cost be disallowed. The report did suggest that some costs, in fact less than 1% of the 1.66 billion in fuel and purchased energy during the audit period, may have been more reasonably charged to customers to base rates rather than to fuel charge. More importantly, the report did not suggest that customers should not have paid for those costs. These audit findings were consistent with an earlier commission-ordered audit, that found to a great degree energy, fuel, transmission rights and access, and other related private products, are purchased on an integrated basis, meaning system-wide, as the lowest overall cost to all utility subsidiaries.For 2010, the utility has its usual full regulatory agenda. And let me assure you, they continue to work on the spin as not deflecting any attention or commitment away from achieving these important objectives. The top priority is to ensure each company has a real opportunity to earn fair ROEs that are comparable to alternative investments. You may recall that the Louisiana utility operating companies obtained constructive outcomes in 2009, with Entergy New Orleans entering into a definitive settlement agreement last spring, and Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana agreeing to extend formula rate plans last fall. Both Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana will continue efforts to obtain a rider to recover the costs of incremental investments in the transmission system.Despite obtaining a rate increase in 2009, Entergy Mississippi will continue to under-earn it’s allowed ROE, absent implementing modifications being sought to its formula rate plan or reducing the quality of service to its customers, and that, we will not do. Simply put, due to its particular cost structure and investment needs, Entergy Mississippi doesn't have the same return on capital opportunity as other Mississippi utilities it competes with for capital to service customers. Current base rates are also inadequate for Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Texas, with both seeking fair and reasonable outcomes in 2010 for rate cases initiated in 2009. Yesterday, Entergy Arkansas initiated a filing to pursue securitization of the 2009 ice storm as an alternative to the base rate recovery request in its rate base filing. You may recall, a securitization bill was enacted last year in Arkansas for any major storm from January 1, 2009 forward. A prudent decision considering another ice storm struck Arkansas just last week. Fortunately, the ice storm did far less damage than originally forecasted. Nonetheless, Entergy Arkansas was well prepared for the storm and has restored power as of yesterday to all the related 30,000 customer outages. In other regulatory matters, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Gulf States Louisiana expect to close the book on Hurricanes Gustav and Ike by executing storm securitization and financing, before the peak storm season begins next summer. In addition, Entergy Louisiana expects to conclude its cost recovery efforts associated with the Little Gypsy project, will also take the necessary steps to gain approval for the Acadia power plant acquisition announced last October. The portfolio transformation strategy also remains a high priority, focused on both generation and transmission solutions. The utility operating companies will continue efforts to enhance the RFP process, considering market opportunities and system needs and will press forward on efforts to resolve outstanding issues associated with the system agreement. In fact, FERC has already acted to remove the uncertainties resulting from the differences of opinion on the issue of continuing obligations under the system agreement. In a November ruling, FERC accepted notices of cancellation and they determined Entergy Arkansas and Entergy Mississippi are permitted to withdraw from the system agreement following the 96-month notice period, without payment of any exit fee or being required to otherwise compensate remaining operating companies, as a result of their withdrawal. Rehearing requests for this ruling from the Louisiana Public Service Commission and the City Council of New Orleans are pending before FERC. Turning to transmission. Utility operating companies are working closely with the newly formed Entergy Regional State Committee, the E-RSC, to determine the appropriate path forward, following the expiration of the Independent Coordinator of Transmission approval this November. Again, that's the Entergy Regional State Committee, and that's a mouthful, so we will refer to it as the E-RSC, and you can probably expect to hear that many times in the coming months, and they will be very active. In a filing with FERC last November, the utility operating companies indicated that the two primary alternatives under consideration for adoption of certain modifications to the current ICT arrangements or transition to membership to the SPP RTO. A critical factor in our proposal will be the opinion and recommendation of the E-RSC. We expect the E-RSC will rely heavily on the cost-benefit analysis being jointly sponsored by both the E-RSC and FERC, comparing the current ICT arrangement to joining SPP. That analysis is anticipated to be finalized during the third quarter this year. In addition, the E-RSC is currently considering potential modifications to the ICT arrangement, including among others, providing the E-RSC with authority upon a unanimous vote, to propose modifications to cost allocation policy for transmission upgrades, and the ability to add projects to the operating company’s transmission construction plan. Given the timing required to complete this work, an extension of the ICT for some period will likely be required under either scenario being considered. If the SPP RTO is ultimately deemed the preferred alternative, SPP has indicated the implementation process may take at least 12 to 18 months after the decision is made.Before closing, I would like to point out one of our proudest accomplishments for 2009. More specifically, it was the safest year in Entergy's history, yet our employees still aren't satisfied. As they continue their march toward reaching the ultimate goal of Target Zero Accidents. And this has been a march. 2009 was no aberration. In seven of the last 10 years, a new safety record was established. Zero accidents seems like an ideal to some but at Entergy, it is our annual goal. Persistence, perseverance and awareness are three qualities of an employee whose mind is focused on safety. Likewise, a parallel can be drawn to financial outcomes in 2009. Top-quartile shareholder return is not simply a vision but it is our annual goal. In 2009, we not only missed the target, we missed to size the bar incompletely, to mix metaphors. It was extremely disappointing, particularly in light of how much was actually accomplished relative to our ongoing goals, and they were consistent with our corporate values. Not only was 2009 the safest year in company history but also, Entergy was recognized as the best utility safety program in the world by Dow Jones Sustainability Index. 2009 was the second-best year on record for reliability of service as defined by outage frequency. 2009 was the best year ever for outlook from our collective nuclear fleet. Vermont Yankee, Fitzpatrick, River Bend and Grand Gulf all achieved or are on record runs. 2009 was the highest operational earnings and reported earnings per share in company history. That's new records in safety, operational excellence and profitability. But even given all that, total shareholder return was stunningly below our expectations and our aspirations. We still believe we're focused on the right things, the things that drive success and sustainability. Obviously, we still have some things to accomplish and to prove, not just in Vermont but to all of you, and we will. Now I'll turn the call over to Leo."
269764,84650614,54368,"Entergy Corporation, Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2010",2010-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Entergy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Wayne, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results, our cash performance for the quarter and year-to-date periods and a review of our 2010 earnings guidance, including some c",1683,"Thank you, Wayne, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover fourth quarter and full year 2009 financial results, our cash performance for the quarter and year-to-date periods and a review of our 2010 earnings guidance, including some comments on the quarterly buildup. Looking first at our financial results for the quarter, Slide 2 shows an increase in fourth quarter 2009 as reported in operational earnings compared to one year ago. This increase came as a result of higher earnings at Utility, Parent & Other as well as the Non-nuclear Wholesale business, partially offset by lower results at Entergy Nuclear.Operational earnings continue to exclude special items related to the planned-for spin-off for incremental dis-synergies at Entergy Nuclear in 2009 and outside service expenses at the parent in 2008 and 2009. The third special item impacted 2008 results at each of the business segments, resulting from the change in the fully diluted EPS calculation that we described in our fourth quarter 2008 earnings release, due to the unsuccessful remarketing of the equity units earlier this year.In reviewing the overall quarterly results, two factors stand out. We saw positive sales trends in all utility customer classes and the non-utility nuclear fleet had a near-perfect run for the second quarter in a row. Slide 3 presents the factors that drove the quarter-on-quarter results in more detail. Starting with Entergy Nuclear, the non-utility Nuclear fleet delivered a solid quarter, posting a 99% capacity factor. However, results were down versus fourth quarter of 2008, due primarily to higher income taxes. An increase in non-fuel O&M expense also contributed to the lower earnings consistent with the quarter, with no refueling outages.Higher taxes were associated with the net effect of consolidated tax adjustments in 2009 compared to 2008. Entergy Nuclear received a significant benefit from the annual allocation last year. These adjustments typically made in the fourth quarter of each year, net to zero, on a consolidated basis.Entergy Nuclear received significant benefit from annual allocation last year. These adjustments typically made in the fourth quarter of each year net to zero on a consolidated basis.Looking at operational results on a pre-tax basis, Entergy Nuclear's earnings increased by approximately $70 million versus fourth quarter of 2008 were nearly 30% quarter-over-quarter. The factors driving this improvement in pre-tax income were higher net revenue, due to higher pricing and higher production as a result of no scheduled refueling outages in the current quarter and higher other income including realized earnings on decommissioning trust investments. Also contributing to the increase in other income was a smaller decommissioning impairment in the current quarter.Next at Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets business, fourth quarter 2009 earnings were higher compared to last year. Tax benefits were the primary drivers in both periods.Now turning to Utility, Parent & Other, operational earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 exceeded results last year. The major drivers for the higher earnings were lower income tax expense, a decline in non-fuel operational and maintenance expense due primarily to the absence of regulatory charges at Entergy Arkansas in 2008 and higher utility net revenue.With regard to tax expense, the primary factor producing the lower expense was the net effect of consolidated tax adjustments. Again these adjustments are made across the Entergy companies and net to zero on a consolidated basis. The lower income tax expense was also due to the absence of flow-through effects of last year's regulatory charges previously noted and a favorable tax reserve adjustment in the current quarter based on a private letter ruling from Louisiana taxing authority on securitization of Hurricane Katrina and Rita costs. Turning to sales, you'll notice on Table 4 of our earnings release, retail sales grew by 5% on a weather adjusted basis. Slide 4 shows the monthly trends in retail build sales since December 2008 for the utility in total and by customer class. Each data point represents the rolling three-month change in usage compared to the prior year adjusted for weather. We've seen a steady improvement in utility sales in 2009, that's the red line particularly in the Industrial segment, which is the blue line. As you know, however, a portion of this growth in 2009 is due to the recovery from Hurricanes Gustav and Ike last September. Slide 5 shows the same information adjusted for the hurricane effects.Two key points can be taken from the Slide. First, after adjusting for hurricanes industrial sales decline about 1% compared to fourth quarter of 2008 the significant improvement from the 7% drop at the end of September. This improvement in the most recent quarter was led by large industrial customers particularly in the hardest hit chemicals and refining sectors. Second, weather adjusted residential sales growth, the green line turned positive around the middle of the year ending the fourth quarter at 1.5% above last year on a weather and hurricane adjusted basis.While it's certainly too early to say the risk of further economic contraction is over, we are encouraged by the steady improvement in utility sales for all of our customer classes through most of 2009. Given the strong finish to last year, we now project 2010 retail sales growth between 2.5% and 3%, excluding industrial expansions and 4.5% when you add the expansions in.Moving to full year results on Slide 6, compares as reported and operational earnings in 2009 to 2008. Higher earnings at Utility, Parent & Other in the Non-Nuclear Wholesale Generation business were partially offset by lower results of Entergy Nuclear. On an operational basis, 2009 earnings ended the year at $6.67 per share, up to 2.5% over 2008. The main drivers for this increase were higher net revenue, including the absence of customer outages resulting from Gustav and Ike last year and results of rate actions, as well as higher other income.Items providing a partial offset including increase in other than temporary impairments on decommissioning trust investments, higher non-fuel O&M and depreciation expense, which was partially offset by the absence of the regulatory charges of Entergy Arkansas in 2008 and a higher income tax expense.Looking more closely at the factors that drove the year-over-year changes at each of the segments, Utility, Parent & Other earnings increased in 2009 due primarily to the increase in net revenue for the reasons noted before, the absence of regulatory charges in Entergy Arkansas in 2008  and a lower effective income tax rate. Higher depreciation and amortization expense due to increased plant and service partially offset these items. For Entergy Nuclear earnings fell primarily due to a higher effective income tax rate driven by the net effects of consolidated tax adjustments discussed earlier, an increase in O&M expense and an increase in impairments on decommissioning trust investments.Results for the Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets business were higher in 2009 compared to last year due primarily to lower income tax expense. Slide 7 provides a recap of our cash flow performance this quarter which shows an increase compared to the same period last year. Operating cash flow was nearly $300 million higher due to the absence in the current quarter of the negative effects of Gustav and Ike in 2008, higher net revenue at the Utility Entergy Nuclear and a decrease in refueling outage costs and lower working capital requirements also at Entergy Nuclear. These were partially offset by lower deferred fuel collections at the utility.For the year 2009, operating cash flow was down by approximately $400 million. This is due primarily to the absence of just under $1 billion of securitization proceeds in Louisiana received in 2008 for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Other factors largely at the utility provided a partial offset.Slide 8 details our 2010 earnings guidance, which we are affirming today. 2010 guidance ranges from $6.40 to $7.20 per share on an operational basis and $6.15 to $6.95 per share on an as reported basis. Guidance assumes business as usual operations for the full year. Operational earnings guidance also excludes $0.25 per share in special items associated with the planned spin-off. The details shown on Slide 8 should be familiar to you as it has not changed since we initiated guidance last October. In keeping with past practice, we have however, adjusted a few line items in the Utility, Parent & Other section to reflect 2009 actual results.As a reminder, earnings guidance ranges for Utility, Parent & Other now include the Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets business. We will be reporting actual results in this manner in our earnings releases starting next quarter.One last point on earnings guidance relates to the buildup on a quarterly basis as reflected on Slide 9. Key events to keep in mind when considering the quarters: The estimated increase in utility net revenue includes an expected decision in Arkansas, which is assumed to go into effect in midyear in our guidance. The estimated decrease in net revenue at Entergy Nuclear includes lower volume due to one additional refueling outages. Four refueling outages are planned this year, two in the fall, two in the spring, compared to three in the spring of 2009. Entergy Nuclear's results in 2009 included $0.24 per share of impairments mostly in the second quarter.  Share repurchases of $750 million are assumed to occur ratably in guidance resulting in back-end loaded accretion effect. Purchases under this program will be dependent on the timing of the spin.Finally, tax items are lumpy by nature and the significant tax benefits in 2009 were realized in the second and the fourth quarters. One last comment before closing. As many of you may have noted, we did not include longer-term forward-looking information in our release this time. Given where we are in the spin-off process, we will defer until the appropriate time any discussion on post spin outlooks such as financial aspirations, earnings into our EBITDA for each company on a standalone basis and other similar forward-looking information. However, both the Utility and Nuclear businesses continue to have fundamental, operational and strategic opportunities to create value and drive growth regardless of the spin-off.

Tomorrow, I will get a full briefing of where we're at on the investigation. I think the investigation is actually drawing to a close with regard to all of our own people, on our own information. Of course, we are not at liberty at this point in time to seek out all the information that everyone else has, it might be involved in the process, which might be very helpful to complete the investigation. But all of our own people and all of our own data records and all those have been I think virtually complete. It's a matter of assimilating all of the information in a report, which again I will say, we have all day tomorrow reserved for an update on that. The tritium issue itself like I said is huge in all this and our people -- this is one of the things that we are really, really good at as a fleet operator. We can put a lot of people with a lot of experience, we have seen a lot of different things on this and develop some pretty good plans and point ourselves in some pretty good directions and where and how this could happen. And that's what's happening. We are not in certainly a position at point in time to say that we know but we have a very good leads and we are known to down pretty quickly and I don't think that will be a hindrance either. We are hopeful that in the next few weeks that we will be able to present results, in Vermont where we are at and that we'll satisfy them that their worst fears are not real and we're taking care of the problems and the steps that we have and it won't happen again."

So from an economic perspective, that's a pretty big number when you're having a net income loss and you're not covering any return on your cost of capital, which is a real expense. So in the absence of a PPA, that greatly changes that situation. There is virtually no impact on Entergy at that point in time. To kind of put it bluntly without some changes in the PPA it's fairly clear that Vermont has more to lose here than we do. This is a very valuable resource in Vermont. And I expect that we will come to an agreement given that fact. But the option of if not – of shutting it down is very distasteful. We have a lot of employees up there that do an excellent job.

Consistent with our previously stated intent, we have now begun the process of unwinding the business infrastructure associated with Enexus and EquaGen. Under the direction of Rick Smith and the corporate steering committee, the project management office is aggressively eliminating duplicate functions and infrastructure created for the two new businesses that is no longer needed, while preserving options to restructure the business with consideration to everything we learned during the spin-off process. How the marketplace has changed and what our next step might be to capture the unrealized value of this business.
Turning to the utility, during the quarter progress continued on. (inaudible) always active regulatory agenda. With the 2010 hurricane season rapidly approaching, resolution of regulatory proceedings associated with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike from 2008 was essential for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana.
Earlier this month, Louisiana's Public Service Commission approved uncontested stipulated settlements resolving all issues pertaining to storm restoration recovery, the establishment of storm reserves and the plan for financing those costs using the same financing structure used for Katrina and Rita. That is Act 55 of the Louisiana legislature and through the Louisiana Utilities and Restoration Corporation.
Efforts are now focused on completing the financing for the balance of the system restoration costs and storm reserves, which is targeted to occur before the peak of the 2010 storm season. Due to the constructive actions of the LPSC both Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana will have as solid a financial standing as reasonably possible to face storms with $290 million of dedicated storm cash reserves in the bank after financing the curves.
Total financing proceeds are roughly $700 million. Just as 2005 repeatedly shattered numerous records with 28 tropical and subtropical storms of which a record 15 became hurricanes, 2009 was one of the quietest on record. With nine tropical storms, three becoming hurricanes and only one tropical storm Claudette making landfall in the United States.
Nonetheless with a service territory that stretches north and south just over 500 miles, we always seem to have the opportunity to prove our planning and execution process. We prepare for the worst and as a direct result of continuous process improvement, customers can count on Entergy to be there when it matters most.
In fact, our pre-hurricane season planning storm drill in 2008 has uncanny similarity to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. The storm drill scenario predicted a Labor Day category four hurricane strike west of New Orleans followed seven days later by a second strike. In fact, Hurricane Gustav was a Labor Day category two plus hurricane strike Southwest of New Orleans, followed 12 days later by Hurricane Ike.
Among other things, Entergy's drill efforts included evacuation of New Orleans, pressure restore major refineries, transition grade instability and idling of generation all of which had unfolded during Gustav and Ike.
Likewise, Entergy prepared for events very similar to what unfolded for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, including the flooding of New Orleans of about 20 feet in our drill event. This year, Entergy was recognized once again with the Edison Electric Institute recovery award for its work restoring power following the destructive ice storm in Arkansas last year.
Entergy is the only company to be honored every year since the inception of the EEI recognition, having earned the EEI recovery and/or EEI assistance awards for 12 consecutive years. And you thought all we did was run nuclear plants and sit in regulatory hearings. At least those things seem to dominate our conversations and for good reason. They have a big impact on whether we earn a fair return or not.
In fact as a utility, the able to earn mid point or allow returns across all jurisdictions may be the most significant thing we need to do to enhance the utility's operating company's financial prospects and efforts to do so continue during the quarter.
In Arkansas remaining testimony was filed in the Entergy Arkansas rate case. The LPSC staff position currently stands at a $49 million rate increase, reflecting an authorized 10.1% return on equity and including an annual revenue requirement of $10 million for the 2009 ice storm. While a clear improvement over the last rate case, we believe the staff position fails to meet the minimum test of the law, that the company has a reasonable opportunity to earn returns consistent with investments of equal revs during the period rates will be in effect.
You recall that in the last rate case, we were authorized a 9.9% ROE that actually had the ability to only earn something in the single digits and in many cases below 5%. This acquisition compares to the $168 million rate increase sought by Entergy Arkansas excluding ice storm recovery. Further the LPSC staff summarily recommended that the proposed formula rate plan be rejected.
However, in the event it was approved, staff believed Entergy Arkansas' ROE should be reduced further a 9.6%, a return to the absolute bottom of the industry for a vertically integrated utility. The commission has repeatedly expressed its interest in innovative rate making. I guess the staff took that to mean something different than we did.
Let's be clear, you cannot have it both ways. Entergy Arkansas is at a crossroads. In 2005, Entergy Arkansas provided its notice that it was exiting the system agreement and that day is rapidly approaching for clearing the path for Entergy Arkansas to exit, without any continuing obligations or fees on the part of Entergy Arkansas or the system.
In that regard, in the midst of a critical rate case for Entergy Arkansas's financial viability, the LPSC initiated a Show Cause Order pertaining to the system agreement and the future operation and control of Entergy Arkansas' generation transmission assets.
Practically on the basis of the current record and at preceding, we could easily conclude the proceeding is about why Entergy Arkansas should even consider a successor arrangement to the current agreement, understanding that FERC has ordered Entergy to pursue consideration of a successor arrangement.
In fact, just a couple of years ago, the LPSC said itself that it wanted Entergy Arkansas to proceed expeditiously with the development of a new acceptable system agreement and ordered Entergy Arkansas to file monthly reports detailing progress toward the development and finalization of a new system agreement. Much like in New York, where one branch of government has said Indian Point is too big to fail, another branch wants to shut the plant down if it cannot build cooling towers, which most likely they can't, because most likely they can't get the permits.
In 2013, Entergy Arkansas is going to leave the system agreement. While, it is the primary opinion of the LPSC is establishing Entergy Arkansas as a stand alone utility it may well be the best path out of the current unacceptable regulatory environment resulting from litigation surrounding the Entergy system agreement. The LPSC staff's position is inconsistent with the necessity of ensure that Entergy Arkansas has the financial wherewithal to do exactly what the commission seems to believe is in the best interest of our Arkansas customers.
Entergy Arkansas must be able to invest in the business and must be able to operate and standalone. And that's certainly true if they also want to join SPP. Like I said, you can't have it both ways. Nonetheless, after considering the system agreement matter further in early April, Entergy Arkansas and the Entergy Corporation and Entergy operating companies all of them determined in connection with our decision making process, that it is appropriate to agree and commit that no Entergy operating company will enter voluntarily into successor arrangements with the other Entergy operating companies if its regulator finds successor arrangements are not in the public interest of that jurisdiction or that state.
On a more constructive front, Entergy Texas was encouraged by the administrative law judge's action to issue an order approving the unanimous settlement regarding some key preliminary matters in the rate case. Specifically, the settlement authorizes an interim rate increase of $17.5 million to begin on May 1, 2010.
The settlement also established the rate case schedule, calling for a hearing in July 2010 with a final award to be issued November 1 and more importantly, for permanent rates to take effect back to service rendered and after September 13.
In Mississippi, a third fuel law undertaken at the request of the commission once again gave Entergy Mississippi a good report. Let me rephrase that, it gave Entergy Mississippi a report card that any parent would be proud of.
On March 30, the McFadden Consulting Group, a Colorado firm with extensive utility auditing experience, covering more than 40 utilities in 15 states presented their report on the management review of Entergy Mississippi's fuel practices and procedures for the two year period October 2007 through September 2009.
In the report, McFadden indicated that the fuel and purchase power costs for Mississippi are reasonable and at the lowest cost possible in the operations and design of the Entergy system. More specifically, the McFadden report states that the resulting Entergy RSP process are extensive, well structured and transparent to ensure proper consideration of market resource options.
Further McFadden believes Entergy's Mississippi's transmission system is quite robust and adequate to meet current and future needs. Put simply, the system is operated in the best interest of Entergy Mississippi's customers.
Further, during the quarter, the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved modification to Entergy's Mississippi's formula rate panel, including, among others aligning it more closely with the other RFPs in Mississippi, eliminating the current $14.5 million our revenue adjustment limit and increasing the 2% of revenue limits to 4%.
I think I said RFP, and I meant FRP as I can see I confused you. On March 15, Entergy Mississippi filed its first evaluation under its new FRP for the 2009 test year. The filing reflected a 10.66% ROE. By contrast the Mississippi's standard offers a reasonable opportunity to earn returns to administer with other investment opportunities all of you have.
Further in Mississippi the calculated FRP midpoint of 11.92% also reflects the benefit of a 76 basis point performance incentive. The FRP calls for new rates to be implemented in the June billing cycle subject to review and final approval by the Mississippi Public Service Commission.
All of the Louisiana utility companies will file formula rate plans in May, with Entergy Louisiana first by May 15 followed by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans by the end of the month. On a related note, earlier this month, the Louisiana Public Service Commission accepted the joint report of the LPSC staff and Entergy Louisiana indicating an agreement to implement a modest rate reduction and refund totaling less than $225,000 for the 2008 test year formula rate plan filing made late last fall.
At Entergy Nuclear, the fleet continued its outstanding performance running at approximately a 94% capacity factor in the first quarter, including 22 days associated with Indian Point 2's refueling outage. Specifically in New York, where our nuclear plants had been singled out as quote - too big to fail, Indian Point 2 was online 99.1% of the time before coming down for its refueling outage beginning in the first quarter. That was a generation record for Indian Point 2.
Just as an anecdote, incremental output from the Indian Point energy center as a result of operational improvements under Entergy Nuclear ownership has covered half of the low growth since 1995 in the Hudson Valley and New York City. Meanwhile Fitzpatrick continues its longest continuous run ever, consistent with the superior track record we've delivered since acquiring both Indian Point and Fitzpatrick.
In Vermont, where there have been various calls to close Vermont Yankee due to its age and design, the plant completed 532 days of continuous operation before it was taken offline on April 24 to begin its 28 refueling outage, the second longest run in its history. The longest run in its history ended in 2007, following 547 days of continuous operations. And Vermont Yankee remains one of the few liquid discharge plants in the country.
Zero liquid discharges, that didn't sound right, did it? Zero liquid discharge plants. To put this in context, Vermont Yankee has had only one unplanned shutdown during the last three operating cycles. With an operating cycle of 18 months that's one unplanned shutdown in four and a half years.
Likewise, Pilgrim remains online at nearly 350 consecutive days of safe continuous power operations since the last fueling outage performed in May 2009. And in fact, set a station capacity factor record in 2009 for a year with a refueling outage. Rounding out the fleet, our most recently acquired plant Palisades continues at over 360 days of uninterrupted power operation since returning to service from its last refueling outage in May 2009.
It's notable that Palisades completed 2009 with the best electric generation production ever in the plant's history in a refueling outage year. In fact, Palisades generated the most electricity in the past three years of Entergy ownership than in any other three-year period in the plant's entire history.
Before turning it over to Leo, I'd like to close by saying we hope to see you in New Orleans exactly one year from today when we will host our next analyst conference. A pre-conference event will take place Thursday evening followed by the conference itself on Friday. While, we will keep you updated over the next year, we intend to explore in far more depth how we will continue to seize opportunities in our utility business and manage the valuable option you own in the non-utility nuclear business.
We will host the event at one of the south's grand hotels recently brought back to its past grandeur following an extensive renovation by the Waldorf Astoria, including the legendary Blue Room. The Roosevelt Hotel was a revolving door of the time's most famous names, like Ray Charles, Jack Benny and Bob Hope. The hotel is as much a part of Louisiana legend as is Huey Long, Louie Armstrong or even Hurricane Katrina.
We invite you to come and enjoy and be part of the legend that continues to be written today at the Roosevelt. With any luck it may be a super natural experience for somebody. Regardless, it's coincident with the first weekend of Jazz Fest 2011 and outside of Super Bowl 2010 - we're still talking about that down here - you just can't beat that. Details will be forthcoming and we'll remind you frequently to reserve your flights early Jazz Fest continues to draw record crowds every year in New Orleans. Now let me turn the call over to Leo.

269764,99080892,59173,"Entergy Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Entergy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Wayne. And good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover quarterly financial results and cash performance followed by our 2010 earnings guidance. And then close with a review of our current longer term financial outlook.Starting w",1751,"Thank you, Wayne. And good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover quarterly financial results and cash performance followed by our 2010 earnings guidance. And then close with a review of our current longer term financial outlook.
Starting with our financial results on slide two, first quarter 2010 earnings were higher than one year ago at both the utility and parent, while they were lower at Entergy Nuclear. Current quarter earnings include a decretion from share repurchases executed in 2009. On an as-reported basis, quarter-over-quarter earnings were down due to the previously announced charge related to the business unwind of Enexus and EquaGen.
This reflects the initial charge to write off capitalized costs and certain other costs in the first quarter of 2010, as well as the spin-off dis-synergies and the expenses for outside services to pursue the spin that you've seen in prior quarters. As Wayne said earlier, we have already begun to take the steps necessary for unwinding these businesses to eliminate spin-off dis-synergies as soon as possible. Excluding these special items related to the spin operational earnings were up by 3% compared to the first quarter of 2009.
Operational results for the first quarter were better than originally projected due primarily to strong utility sales, which offset the lower results at Entergy Nuclear. Sales increased across all customer classes and included the effect of significantly colder weather. Absent weather, sales were about the level we projected for the quarter. And although, the lower price - power pricing weighed on the non-utility nuclear segment, the fleet once again delivered a great quarter of operational performance, as Wayne just reviewed.
Slide three provides more detail on the factors that drove the quarter-on-quarter results. First, that the utility higher net revenue was the primary factor driving the quarterly earnings increase. As you have probably already observed in table four of our investor release, overall utility retail sales grew by 11.7% including over 22% on residential sales.
The weather this past quarter ranked as the second coldest in Louisiana and the third coldest in Mississippi in 116 years with Texas and Arkansas not far behind ranking around the top ten coldest of record for January through March. On a weather adjusted basis, utility sales trends continue to provide evidence that an economic recovery is underway in our service territory.
Slide four illustrates this point, building on a chart we first showed you on last quarter's earnings call. As a reminder, this chart plots month by month the changing cumulative retail sales for a three month period versus the same three months in the prior year. After excluding the effects of weather and the 2008 hurricanes a trend of improving economic activity in our service territory clearly emerges for all customer classes.
For the industrial segment, the blue line sales continue to steadily rebound from the lows experienced in the first half of last year. Industrial sales ended the current quarter with a 7.3% growth rate versus the first quarter of 2009. In contrast, industrial sales were down by 13.2% in the first quarter of last year.
Small, midsize and large industrial customers contributed to this growth in 2010. Although overall our industrial sales were strong, weak fundamentals presented opportunities for refineries to take outages to catch up on maintenance. Also the quarterly increase in net revenue from higher industrial sales volume was tempered somewhat by the price effect associated with demand charges that as you'll recall had offset the negative impact of last year's lower volumes.
As a final note, FRP rate actions from 2009 at Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Mississippi also contributed to the quarterly variance.
Turning back to slide three, partially offsetting the increase in net revenue for the current quarter was higher operation and maintenance expenses and an increase in interest expense from higher debt balances mainly in Entergy Texas and Entergy Louisiana.
Moving on to Entergy Nuclear, the quarter-over-quarter decline in operational earnings was due primarily to three factors - lower net revenue on lower energy pricing for sales on both contracted and merchant positions, higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expenses and the effect of a change in tax law due to the recently enacted federal healthcare legislation. As a reminder, we consider effects of changes in tax law as part of our operational results.
Higher other income associated with decommissioning trust was partially offsetting given the absence of an impairment on these trust that was recorded in the first quarter of 2009 and higher investment earnings resulting from normal sales of securities held in the trusts as well as rebalancing of the portfolio.
Finally, parent and other results improved due primarily to lower interest expense on lower parent debt outstanding. Beginning in 2010, we've begun to report parent and other including the non-nuclear wholesale assets business separately from utility results.
Skipping to slide five, Entergy's operating cash flow performance for the first quarter of 2010 reflected an increase of nearly $300 million over the first quarter of last year. The net increase in OC up was driven mainly by three factors, all at the utility. The absence of storm spending that occurred in the first quarter of 2009, higher net revenues on strong quarterly sales, partially offset by lower deferred fuel collections.
Slide six details our current 2010 earnings guidance, which ranges from $5.95 to $6.80 per share on an as reported basis and $6.40 to $7.20 per share on an operational basis. The as-reported guidance range was updated earlier this month to reflect the total potential charge for the business unwind of Enexus and EquaGen which will be classified as a special item. The 2010 operational earnings guidance range which is based on the current business structure is not change from what we originally provided last fall.
As usual some things have gone for us like utility sales and others have gone against us since we set the earnings guidance in October of 2009. Obviously, pricing on Entergy's Nuclear unsold position is one of those things in the second category, where current power prices for the full year of 2010 have averaged around $16 per megawatt hour below the level assumed in guidance.
In addition, there are other key factors incorporated into the 2010 guidance range that have yet to unfold, including rate actions and share repurchases. The comment about share repurchases - each quarter at this time, we provide an update on the progress, if any under our share repurchase programs in the prior three months.
As you may have noted we did not make any share repurchases under the $750 million board authorization during the first quarter of 2010. Decisions on whether to buyback stock were made based on a number of factors including current business conditions, our liquidity and financial flexibility to quickly respond to changing conditions and our point of view on the value of our stock.
As we've clearly demonstrated before, we can implement our share repurchase programs quickly once we've satisfied all of our requirements to do so. For example, in the third quarter of 2009, we repurchased roughly $600 million worth of shares to close out the previous authorizations at that time.
One last point before moving on relates to the quarterly buildup of 2010 earnings, as discussed on slide seven. Factors to be considered in developing quarterly estimates for 2010 include - at the utility, the timing of potential rate actions at Entergy Nuclear, the number and timing of refueling outages in 2010 versus 2009 and the decommissioning impairments taken in the first half of last year, the timing of decretion from past to potential future share repurchases and the fact that tax items are lumpy by nature.
Looking beyond 2010, Entergy's current long-term financial outlook is summarized on slide eight. This outlook encompasses three broad inter related categories earnings, capital deployment and credit quality. Over the next five years, we believe the utility has opportunities to deliver compound average annual net income growth of 5 to 6% per year. Drivers include sales growth, improving ROEs consistent with earning at our authorized levels and making the productive investments that benefit customers through our portfolio transformation strategy, including generation and transmission investments.
At the same time, we believe Entergy Nuclear represents a valuable option given its low cost base load clean nuclear fleet located in attractive power markets. At Entergy Nuclear, the price of our products - both energy and capacity is the fundamental driver outside of our operational side of the business where our superior operational track record is the bedrock foundation.
The chart on slide nine provides daily forward energy prices for 2010 through 2013 since January of 2008, which as you can see have exhibited significant volatility.
Slide 10 shows the projected average portfolio prices for 2010 through 2014 on just one day April 5, the day we announced the Enexus unwind. At those forward power prices, the long-term outlook for adjusted EBITDA which showed a decline compared to 2010, the intrinsic value of the option. However the option premium is quite valuable. The option value derives from the potential future effects of the economic rebound, existing and new environmental legislation and/or regulation that could lead to an expansion of market heat rates, higher capacity prices and/or higher natural prices over the longer term.
In closing, we believe that Entergy combines a competitive utility investment opportunity plus a valuable option in its one of a kind non-utility nuclear fleet. Despite an increasing investment outlook at the utility and depressed commodity prices at Entergy Nuclear, we continue to see opportunities to increase the return of cash to our owners. A second quarter dividend increase to $3.32 per share on an annual basis and a $750 million stock buyback program are just the most recent actions.
Even in today's business environment and under Entergy's current structure we forecast that the combination of dividends and/or share repurchases could total as much as $5 billion over the next five years, absent other attractive investment opportunities. We aspire to fund our capital investment requirements without issuing traditional common equity.
We can assure you that we will address the risks and the opportunities today and in the future in the same disciplined manner, based on an analytically based point of view but with the same attention to liquidity and credit quality that we have always done in order to create sustainable value for our stakeholders. And now the Entergy senior team is available for your questions.

I'll start with hedging and then and then Gary can handle the Louisiana FRP. As far as hedging goes we - as part of Entergy, we haven't changed the hedging standards or the hedging limits around the nuclear business. And we never did change them specifically to match what the Enexus hedging policies may have been. We had a view of what the hedging standards with limit would be given the different financial policies and dividend profile and balance sheet and liquidities on Enexus. But we didn't institute that as part of Entergy.
As part of Entergy, we have continued to manage those assets from a risk management perspective - the same as we always have. With just the acknowledgement that we tried not to lock ourselves into something that would prohibit executing on the Enexus point of view and the Enexus risk limits going forward.
And so it hasn't changed and now it won't change versus what we've done in the past. Market activity could dictate changes in our limits. Our point of view could dictate selling more than the limits would say or less than the limits would say, based on the point of view that matches up to not only what's going on in the market. But then also keeping in mind that we still own some stilly subsidiaries, we still pay a dividend. We still have liquidities on both sides of the business.
So the things that would change it are the same things that would have in the past. But we haven't made any changes prior to now and we aren't planning on any big changes right now.

Certainly things like the Marcellus shale and other (inaudible) terminals and the like particularly with shale gas - obviously is having a big impact on the price of power in the near-term. And the basis differentials between the hub and the northeast have changed significantly because of that. But the other things that are going to have impact on the northeast particularly as it relates to heat rate. I think those have a lot of issues that just potentially haven't been built into the market.
Whether it's existing environmental regulations and legislation on existing things, like mercury and SOx and NOx or whether it's CO2. Also if you look at what's gone on with the demand side management in those regions. There's a significant amount of demand side management that's projected to show up in both New England and in New York as well as thousands of megawatts of wind development, of which not a lot of it is there yet and we're seeing some headwinds against some of that.
So really the gas price side of it is one that's difficult to predict - difficult to predict where it's going to happen with shale, difficult to predict what the marginal cost of that's going to be. But I think there is a lot of people looking at that and the market has a lot of that information built into it.
I think where you're going to find most of the information lacking in the market and where we'd probably be more bullish than on gas is on the heat rate side of the equation as it relates to what's going to happen with wind, what's going to happen transmission, what's going to happen with demand side programs, what's going to happen with coal retirements and what's going to happen in nonpayment areas.

We had an obviously - we had an obligation to serve on the regulatory side and we're going to meet that obligation to serve. In some places where we're not allowed a fair return on the business, we have to be very careful on how we make those investments and how much we spend. Because we obviously have a fiduciary obligation to all of you and we have to do and we have - as part of our obligations, we need to take self-help measures to make sure we don't bankrupt the company even though we have an obligation to serve.
So that may mean some impacts on service in order to meet our other obligations to maintain financial viability. Where we are getting a fair returns and timely returns then obviously we're going to err on the side like we've indicated of trying to comply to the best possible way with our regulators own desires and interests in how much transition we build and what type of resources we have - whether it's renewable or whether its something else or how much our portfolio looks like, whether we rely upon gas or whether we use other sources.
We've got a lot of flexibility to do those things consistent with public policy and which is what we much prefer to do. On the unregulated side, it's a lot more tricky because we're looking at these issues that you've all discussed and you're all concerned with, in terms of what the pipe is going to be, given the amount of uncertainty that we have here and that's much harder to predict. As hard as it is to predict regulatory actions they are at least bound by the law in many respects on the returns you're going to get.
And when you're in the marketplace, as particularly for environmental regulations today and with some of the new entrants in the market, like Leo mentioned the shale gas, that become much difficult. I won’t say that we are - we obviously have a point of view that environmental regulations are going to get tougher. Whatever it is - it's going to get tougher.
So we're very conscious of that and we do any analysis of adding to the portfolio in the northeast. But we do believe that the portfolio is valuable whether it's perfectly clean as it is today with all nuclear or whether it's added other resources to that it are almost clean. They're almost perfectly clean. So we continue to look at all options. There's a lot of assets still out there. Seems like there isn't, but there are in terms of consolidation, in terms of ideas on joint operation and in terms of ways to maximize the value of everyone's portfolio. And we're taking a hard look at those things.
Obviously, the rating agencies concerns in that regard mean something to us, but they're not going to be controlling the decisions that we make if they're in the best interest of our shareholders and we believe - and the market believes we're still on sound financial footing with whatever we do.

That's everyone from the governor's office to the legislature and anyone else involved. Through that process, we are moving forward as well with the Vermont Public Service Board and the Department of Public Service with everything they need.
Currently we have the reliability audit that we are following up and we will have a detailed conclusion here hopefully soon. We are also following up with the investigation. All of that's been turned over hopefully we'll see conclusion of that soon. Once we get that behind us, the legislature as well. We'll be going out of session pretty quickly.
As you know, the house side of the legislature has decided not to act as the senate did. There seems to be support that Vermont Yankee, especially giving a joint study that was recently handed out by the legislature that was asked for by the house and the senate. And in fact, paid for by the utilities, not asked for by Entergy. But that study, which set up different scenarios, specifically with regard to reliability energy costs and environmental showed under all four scenarios that Vermont Yankee was the clear winner and needed to be there.
So having said that and moving forward with discussions that Rick Smith is involved in on the PPAs, we have every reason to believe that we will move forward with a certificate of public good, get the license renewed at the NRC hopefully in the near-term. So that's where we are.

To date, some 35 days after the decision, we have yet to receive an order from the New York Public Service Commission. Since the ability to appeal or take legal action doesn't start until we actually receive an order, any legal recourse is automatically preserved. Consistent with our previously stated intent, we have now begun the process of unwinding the business infrastructure associated with Enexus and EquaGen. 
Under the direction of Rick Smith and a corporate steering committee, the Project Management Office is aggressively eliminating duplicate functions and infrastructure created for the two new businesses that is no longer needed, while preserving the options to restructure the business with consideration to everything we learned during the spin-off process, how the marketplace has changed and what our next step might be to capture the unrealized value of business. 
Turning to the Utility. During the quarter, progress continued on its always active regulatory agenda. With 2010 hurricane season rapidly approaching, resolution of regulatory proceedings associated with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike from 2008 was essential for Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana. 
Earlier this month, Louisiana Public Service Commission approved uncontested stipulated settlements resolving all issues pertaining to storm restoration recovery, the establishment of storm reserves and the plan for financing those costs using the same financing structure used for Katrina and Rita, that is Act 55 of the Louisiana legislature and through the Louisiana Utilities and Restoration Corporation.
Efforts are now focused on completing the financing for the balance of the system restoration costs and storm reserves, which was targeted to occur before the peak of the 2010 storm season. Due to the constructive actions of the LPSC, both Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana will have as solid financial a standing that's reasonably possible to face storms with $290 million of dedicated storm cash reserves in the bank after financing occurs. Total financing proceeds are roughly $700 million. 
Just as 2005 repeatedly shattered numerous records, with 28 tropical and subtropical storms, of which a record 15 became hurricanes; 2009 was one of the quietest on record, with nine tropical storms, three becoming hurricanes and only one tropical storm, Claudette, making landfall in the United States. Nonetheless, with a service territory that stretches north and south just over 500 miles, we always seem to have the opportunity to prove our planning and execution process. We prepare for the worst and as a direct result of continuous process improvement, customers can count on Entergy to be there when it matters most. 
In fact, our pre-hurricane season planning storm drill in 2008 has uncanny similarity to Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. The storm drill scenario predicted a Labor Day, Category 4 hurricane strike west of New Orleans, followed seven days later by a second strike. In fact, Hurricane Gustav was a Labor Day, Category 2-plus hurricane strike southwest of New Orleans, followed 12 days later by Hurricane Ike. 
Among other things, interviews, drill efforts included evacuation in New Orleans, pressure restore made to refineries, transmission grid instability and idling of generation, all of which had unfolded during Gustav and Ike. Likewise, Entergy prepared for events very similar to what unfolded for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, including the flooding of New Orleans of about 20 feet in our drill event. 
This year, Entergy was recognized once again with the Edison Electric Institute Recovery Award for its work restoring power following a destructive ice storm in Arkansas last year. Entergy is the only company to be honored every year since the inception of the EEI recognition, having earned the EEI recovery and/or EEI Assistance Awards for 12 consecutive years. And you thought all we did was run nuclear plants and sit in regulatory hearings. At least those things seem to dominate our conversations and for good reasons. 
We have a big impact on whether we earn a fair return or not. In fact at the Utility, the ability to actually earn mid-point or allow returns across all jurisdictions may be the most significant thing we need to do to enhance the utility's operating company's financial prospects, and efforts to do so continued during the quarter. 
In Arkansas, a remaining -- a testimony was filed in the Entergy Arkansas rate case. The APSC [Arkansas Public Service Commission] staff position currently stands at a $49 million rate increase, reflecting an authorized 10.1% return on equity and including an annual revenue requirement of $10 million for the 2009 ice storm. While a clearer improvement over the last rate case, we believe the staff position fails to meet the minimum test of the law, that the company have a reasonable opportunity to earn returns consistent with investments of equal risk during the period rates will be in effect. You recall in the last rate case, we were authorized a 9.9% ROE that actually has the ability to only earn something in the single digits and in many cases, below 5%. The staff position compares to the $168 million rate increase sought by Entergy Arkansas, excluding ice storm recovery.
Further, the APSC staff summarily recommended that the proposed formula rate plan be rejected. However, in the event it was approved, staff believes Entergy Arkansas' ROE should be reduced further to 9.6%, a return at the absolute bottom of the industry for a vertically integrated utility. The commission has repeatedly expressed its interest in innovative rate-making. I guess the staff took that to mean something different than we did. Let's be clear. You cannot have it both ways. 
Entergy Arkansas is at a crossroads. In 2005, Entergy Arkansas provided its notice that it was exiting the System Agreement. And that day is rapidly approaching, with FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] clearing the path for Entergy Arkansas to exit without ambient, continued obligations or fees on the part of Entergy Arkansas or the system. 
In that regard, in the midst of a critical rate case for Entergy Arkansas' financial viability, the APSC initiated a show-cause order pertaining to the System Agreement and the future operation and control of Entergy Arkansas' generation transmission assets. Practically, on the basis of the current record in that proceeding, we could easily conclude, the preceding is about why Entergy Arkansas should even consider a successor arrangement to the current agreement, understanding that FERC has ordered Entergy to pursue consideration of a successor arrangement. In fact, just a couple of years ago, the APSC said itself that it wanted Entergy Arkansas to proceed expeditiously with the development of a new accessible System Agreement, and ordered Entergy Arkansas to file monthly reports detailing progress toward the development and finalization of a new System Agreement. Much like in New York, our one branch of government has said Indian Point is too big to fail. Another branch wants to shut the plant down that they cannot build cooling towers, which most likely they can't because most likely, they can't get the permits. 
In 2013, Entergy Arkansas is going to leave the System Agreement. While it is the preliminary opinion of the APSC as establishing Entergy Arkansas as a stand-alone utility, may well be the best path out of the current unacceptable regulatory environment resulting from litigations surrounding the Entergy System Agreement. The APSC staff position is inconsistent with the necessity of ensuring that Entergy Arkansas has the financial wherewithal to do exactly what the commission seems to believe is in the best interest of Arkansas customers. Entergy Arkansas must be able to invest in the business and must be able to operate in stand-alone, and as certainly true if they also want to join SPP [Southwest Power Pool]. Like I said, you can't have it both ways. 
Nonetheless, after considering the System Agreement matter further, in early April, the Entergy Corporation and the Entergy operating companies, all of them determined, in connection with our decision-making process, that it is appropriate to agree and commit that no Entergy operating company will enter voluntarily into successor arrangements with the other Entergy operating companies, if its retail regulator finds successor arrangements are not in the public interest of that jurisdiction or that state. 
On a more constructive front, Entergy Texas was encouraged by the administrative law judge's action to issue an order approving the unanimous settlement regarding some key preliminary matters in the rate case. Specifically, the settlement authorizes an interim rate increase of $17.5 million to begin on May 1, 2010. The settlement also established the rate case schedule, calling for a hearing in July  2010, with the final order to be issued November 1; and more importantly, for permanent rates to take effect back to service rendered and after September 13. 
In Mississippi, a third fuel law that undertaken at the request of the commission, once again gave Entergy Mississippi a good report. Well, let me rephrase that. It gave Entergy Mississippi a report card that any parent would be proud of. 
On March 30, the McFadden Consulting Group,  a Colorado firm with extensive utility auditing experience covering more than 40 utilities in 15 states, presented their report on the management review of Entergy Mississippi's fuel practices and procedures for the two-year period, October 2007 through September 2009. In the report, McFadden indicated that the fuel and purchase power costs for Mississippi are reasonable and at the lowest cost possible, given the operations and design in the Entergy System. More specifically, the McFadden report states that the resulting Entergy RFP process are extensive, well structured and transparent to ensure proper consideration of market resource options. Further, McFadden believes Entergy Mississippi's transmission system is quite robust and adequate to meet current and future needs. Put simply, the system has operated in the best interest of Entergy Mississippi's customers. 
Further, during the quarter, the Mississippi Public Service Commission approved modification to Entergy  Mississippi's formula rate plan including, among others, aligning it more closely with the other RFPs in Mississippi, eliminating the current $14.5 million revenue adjustment limit and increasing the 2% of revenue limits to 4%. I think I said RFP and I meant FRP [formula rate plan], because that can confused you in Mississippi.
On March 15, Entergy Mississippi filed its first evaluation under its new FRP for the 2009 test year. The filing reflected a 10.66% ROE. By contrast, the Mississippi standard offers a reasonable opportunity to earn returns commensurate with other investment opportunities all you have. Further in Mississippi, the calculated FRP midpoint of 11.92% also reflects the benefit of a 76-basis-point performance incentive. The FRP calls for new rates to be implemented in the June billing cycle, subject to review and final approval by the Mississippi Public Service Commission. All the Louisiana Utility companies will file formula rate plans in May, with Entergy Louisiana first by May 15, followed by Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy New Orleans by the end of the month. 
On a related note, earlier this month, the Louisiana Public Service Commission accepted the joint report of the LPSC staff and Entergy Louisiana, indicating an agreement to implement a modest rate reduction and refund totaling less than $225,000 to the 2008 test year formula rate plan filing made late last fall. 
At Entergy Nuclear, the fleet continued its outstanding performance, running at approximately a 94% capacity factor in the first quarter, including 22 days associated with the Indian Point 2 refueling outage. Specifically in New York, where our nuclear plants have been singled out as ""too big to fail,"" Indian Point 2 was online 99.1% of the time before coming down for its refueling outage beginning in the first quarter. That was a generation record for Indian Point 2. 
This as an anecdote, incremental output from the Indian Point Energy Center, as a result of operational improvements under Entergy Nuclear ownership, has covered half of the low growth since 1995 in the Hudson Valley and New York City. Meanwhile, Fitzpatrick continues its longest continuous run ever, consistent with the superior track record we've delivered since acquiring both Indian Point and Fitzpatrick. 
In Vermont, where there have been various calls to close Vermont Yankee due to its Asian design, the plant completed 532 days of continuous operation before it was taken offline on April 24 to begin its 28th refueling outage, the second longest run in its history. The longest run in its history ended in 2007, following 547 days of continuous operations. And Vermont Yankee remains one of the zero-liquid discharge plants in the country. To put this in context, Vermont Yankee has had only one unplanned shutdown during the last three operating cycles. With an operating cycle of 18 months, that's one unplanned shutdown in four and a half years. 
Likewise, Pilgrim remains online at nearly 350 consecutive days of safe, continuous power operations since last refueling outage performed in May of 2009 and, in fact, set a station-capacity factor record in 2009 for a year with the refueling outage. 
Rounding out the fleet, our most recently acquired plant, Palisades, continues at over 360 days of uninterrupted power operations since returning to service from its last refueling outage in May 2009. It's notable the Palisades completed 2009 with the best electricity generation production ever in the plant's history in a refueling outage year. In fact, Palisades generated the most electricity in the past three years of Entergy ownership than in any other three-year period in the plant's entire history. 
Before we turn it over to Leo, I'd like to close by saying we hope to see you in New Orleans exactly one year from today, when we will host our next analyst conference. A pre-conference event will take place Thursday evening, followed by the conference itself on Friday. While we will keep you updated over the next year, we intend to explore in far more depth how we will continue to seize opportunities in our Utility business and manage the valuable option you own in the non-Utility Nuclear business. 
We intend to host the event at one of the South's grand hotels recently brought back to its past grandeur, following an extensive renovation by the Waldorf Astoria, including the legendary Blue Room. The Roosevelt Hotel is a revolving door of the time's most famous names like Ray Charles, Jack Benny and Bob Hope. The hotel is as much a part of Louisiana legend as is Huey Long, Louis Armstrong or even Hurricane Katrina. We invite you to come and enjoy and be part of the legend that continues to be written today at the Roosevelt. With any luck, it may be a supernatural experience for somebody. Regardless, it's coincident with the first weekend of Jazz Fest 2011 and outside of Super Bowl 2010, yes, we're still talking about that down here, you just can't beat that. Details will be forthcoming and we'll remind you frequently to reserve your flights early, as Jazz Fest continues to draw record crowds every year in New Orleans. 
Now let me turn the call over to Leo."
269764,99080892,61847,"Entergy Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Entergy Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Wayne, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover quarterly financial results and cash performance, followed by our 2010 earnings guidance, and then close with a review of our current longer-term financial outlook. Starting",1732,"Thank you, Wayne, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover quarterly financial results and cash performance, followed by our 2010 earnings guidance, and then close with a review of our current longer-term financial outlook. 
Starting with our financial results on Slide 2.  First quarter 2010 earnings were higher than one year ago at both the Utility and parent, while they were lower at Entergy Nuclear. Current quarter earnings included accretion from share repurchases executed in 2009. 
On an as-reported basis, quarter-over-quarter earnings were down due to the previously announced charge related to the business unwind of Enexus and EquaGen. This reflects the initial charge to write off capitalized costs and certain other costs in the first of 2010, as well as the spin-off to synergies and the expenses for outside services to pursue the spin that you've seen in prior quarters. As Wayne said earlier, we have already begun to take the steps necessary for unwinding these businesses to eliminate spin-off to synergies as soon as possible. 
Excluding these special items related to the spin, operational earnings were up by 3% compared to the first quarter of 2009. Operational results for the first quarter were better than originally projected due primarily to stronger utility sales, which offset the lower results at Entergy Nuclear. 
Sales increased across all customer classes and included the effect of significantly colder weather. Absent weather, sales were about the level we projected for the quarter. And although the lower power pricing weighed on the non-Utility Nuclear segment, the fleet once again delivered a great quarter of operational performance, as Wayne just reviewed. 
Slide 3 provides more detail on the factors that drove the quarter-on-quarter results. First, at the Utility, higher net revenue was the primary factor driving the quarterly earnings increase. As you have probably already observed in Table 4 of our investor release, overall Utility retail sales grew by 11.7%, including over 22% on residential sales. 
The weather this past quarter ranked as the second coldest in Louisiana and the third coldest in Mississippi in 116 years, with Texas and Arkansas not far behind, ranking around the top 10 coldest on record for January through March. On a weather-adjusted basis, Utility sales trends continue to provide evidence that an economic recovery is underway in our service territory. 
Slide 4 illustrates this point, filling on a chart we first showed you on last quarter's earnings call. As a reminder, this chart plots month-by-month the changing cumulative retail sales for a three-month period versus the same three months in the prior year. After excluding the effects of weather and the 2008 hurricanes, a trend of improving economic activity in our service territory clearly emerges for all customer classes. 
For the Industrial segment, the blue line, sales continued to steadily rebound from the lows experienced in the first half of last year. Industrial sales entered the current quarter, with a 7.3% growth rate versus the first quarter of 2009. 
In contrast, industrial sales were down by 13.2% in the first quarter of last year. Small, mid-size and large industrial customers contributed to this growth in 2010. Although overall, our industrial sales were strong, weak fundamentals presented opportunities for refineries to take outages to catch up on maintenance. 
Also, the quarterly increase in net revenue from higher industrial sales volume was tempered somewhat by the price effect associated with demand charges that, as you will recall, had offset the negative impact of last year's lower volumes. As a final note, FRP rate actions from 2009 at Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Mississippi also contributed to the quarterly variance. 
Turning back to Slide 3, partially offsetting the increase in net revenue for the current quarter was higher operation and maintenance expenses and an increase in interest expense from higher debt balances, mainly at Entergy Texas and Entergy Louisiana. 
Moving on to Entergy Nuclear, the quarter-over-quarter decline in operational earnings was due primarily to three factors: lower net revenue on lower energy pricing for sales in both contracted and merchant positions, higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expenses and the effect of a change in tax law due to the recently enacted federal healthcare legislation. As a reminder, we consider effects of changes in tax law as part of our operational results. 
Higher other income associated with decommissioning trust was partially offsetting, given the absence of an impairment on these trusts that was recorded in the first quarter of 2009 and higher investment earnings resulting from normal sales of securities held in the trust, as well as rebalancing of the portfolio. 
Finally, parent and other results improved due primarily to lower interest expense on lower parent debt outstanding. Beginning in 2010, we've begun to report parent and other, including the Non-Nuclear Wholesale Assets business separately from the Utility results. 
Skipping to Slide 5. Entergy's operating cash flow performance for the first quarter of 2010 reflected an increase of nearly $300 million over the first quarter of last year. The net increase in OCF was driven mainly by three factors, all at the Utility: the absence of storm spending that occurred in the first quarter of 2009, higher net revenues on strong quarterly sales, partially offset by lower deferred fuel collections. 
Slide 6 details our current 2010 earnings guidance, which ranges from $5.95 to $6.80 per share on an as-reported basis and $6.40 to $7.20 per share on an operational basis. The as-reported guidance range was updated earlier this month to reflect the total potential charge for the business unwind of Enexus and EquaGen, which will be classified as a special item. The 2010 operational earnings guidance range, which is based on the current business structure, has not changed from what we originally provided last fall. 
As usual, some things have gone for us, like Utility sales, and others have gone against us since we set the earning guidance in October of 2009. Obviously, pricing on Entergy Nuclear's unsold position is one of those things in the second category, where current power prices for the full year 2010 have averaged around $16 per megawatt hour below the level assumed in guidance. 
In addition, there are other key factors incorporated into the 2010 guidance range that have yet to unfold, including rate actions and share repurchases. The comment about share repurchases each quarter at this time we provide an update on the progress, if any, under our share repurchase programs in the prior three months. 
As you may have noted, we did not make any share repurchases under the $750 million board authorization during the first quarter of 2010. Decisions on whether to buy back stock remain based on a number of factors, including current business conditions, our liquidity and financial flexibility to quickly respond to changing conditions and our point of view on the value of our stock. As we've clearly demonstrated before, we can implement our share repurchase programs quickly once we've satisfied all of our requirements to do so. For example, in the third quarter of 2009, we repurchased roughly $600 million worth of shares to close out the previous authorizations at that time. 
One last point, before moving on, relates to the quarterly buildup of 2010 earnings as discussed on Slide 7. Factors to be considered in developing quarterly estimates for 2010 include: at the Utility, the timing of potential rate actions; at Entergy Nuclear, the number and timing of refueling outages in 2010 versus 2009; and the decommissioning impairments taken in the first half of last year; the timing of accretion from past and potential future share repurchases; and the fact that tax items are lumpy by nature. 
Looking beyond 2010, Entergy's current long-term financial outlook is summarized on Slide 8. This outlook encompasses three broad interrelated categories: earnings, capital deployment and credit quality. Over the next five years, we believe the Utility has opportunities to deliver compound average annual net income growth of 5% to 6% per year. Drivers include sales growth, improving ROEs consistent with earning at authorized levels and making the productive investments that benefit customers through our portfolio transformation strategy, including generation and transmission investments. 
At the same time, we believe Entergy Nuclear represents a valuable option, given its low-cost base load, clean nuclear fleet located in attractive power markets. At Entergy Nuclear, the price of our products, both energy and capacity, is the fundamental driver outside of our operational side of the business, where our superior operational track record is the bedrock foundation. 
The chart on Slide 9 provides daily forward energy prices for 2010 through 2013 since January of 2008 which, as you can see, have exhibited significant volatility. 
Slide 10 shows the projected average portfolio prices for 2010 through 2014 on just one day, April 5, the day we announced the Enexus unwind. At those forward power prices, the long-term outlook for adjusted EBITDA, which showed a decline compared to 2010, the intrinsic value of the option. However, the option premium is quite valuable. The option value derives from the potential future effects of the economic rebound, existing in new environmental legislation and/or regulation that could lead to an expansion of market heat rates, higher-capacity prices and/or higher natural gas prices over the longer term. 
In closing, we believe that Entergy combines a competitive utility investment opportunity, plus a valuable option in its one-of-a-kind non-utility nuclear fleet. Despite an increasing investment outlook at the Utility and depressed commodity prices at Entergy Nuclear, we continue to see opportunities to increase the return of cash to our owners. Second quarter dividend increased to $3.32 per share on an annual basis and a $750 million stock buyback program are just the most recent actions. 
Even in today's business environment and under Entergy's current structure, we forecast that the combination of dividends and/or share repurchases could total as much as $5 billion over the next five years, absent other attractive investment opportunities. We aspire to fund our capital investment requirements without issuing traditional common equity. 
We can assure you that we will address the risks and the opportunities today and in the future in the same disciplined manner, based on an analytically based point of view and with the same attention to liquidity and credit quality that we have always done in order to create sustainable value for our stakeholders. 
And now, the Entergy's senior team is available for your questions."

Certainly, things like the Marcellus Shale and other LNG terminals and the like, particularly the shale gas, obviously, is having a big impact on the price of power in the near term. And the basis differentials between the hub in the Northeast have changed significantly because of that. But the other things that are going to have impact on the Northeast, particularly as it relates to heat rate, I think those have a lot of issues that potentially haven't been dealt into the market, whether it's existing environmental regulations and legislation on existing things like mercury and SOx and NOx or whether it's CO2. Also, if you look at what's going on with the demand side management in those regions, there's a significant amount of demand side management that's projected to show up in both New England and in New York, as well as thousands of megawatts of wind development of which not a lot of it is there yet, and we're seeing some headwinds against some of that. So really, the gas price inside of it is one that's difficult to predict, difficult to predict what's going to happen with shale, difficult to predict what the marginal cost that's going to be. But I think there's a lot of people looking at that. And the market has a lot of that information built into it. I think we're going to find most of the information lacking in the market. And where we probably be more bullish than on gas is on the heat rate side of the equation as it relates to what's going to happen with wind, what's going to happen with transmission, what's going to happen with demand-side programs, what's going to with coal retirement and what's going to in non-attainment area?"

Obviously, we have an obligation to serve on the regulatory side and we're going to meet that obligation to serve. In some places where we're not allowed and on a fair return on the business, we have to be very careful on how we make those investments and how much we spend, because we obviously have a fiduciary obligation to all of you. As part of our obligations, we need to take self-help measures to make sure we don't bankrupt the company even though we have an obligation to serve. So that may mean some impact on service in order to meet our other obligations to maintain financial viability. Where we are getting fair returns and timely returns, then obviously we're going to air on the side like we've indicated, of trying to comply to the best possible way with our regulators' own desires and interests in how much transition we build or what type of resources we have, whether it's renewable or whether it's something else or how much our portfolio looks like, those rely upon gas or whether these other resources. We got a lot of flexibility to do those things consistent with state public policy and which is fully much preferred to do. On the unregulated side, it's a lot more tricky because we're looking at these issues that you've all discussed, and you're all concern with in terms of what's price going to be or given the amount of uncertainty that we have here. And that's much harder to predict. Part of this regulatory actions, they are at least bound by the law and many respects on returns that you're going to get. And when the marketplace has predicted for in our many regulations today and with some of the new entrants in the market like Leo mentioned, the shale gas, that becomes much more difficult. I wouldn't say that we're -- we obviously have a point of view that environmental regulations are going to get tougher. Whatever it is, it's going to get tougher. So we're very conscious of that when we're doing the analysis of adding to the portfolio in the Northeast. But we do believe that portfolio is valuable whether it's perfectly clean as it is today. With all the clear weather, it's added other resources to it that are almost clean. They're almost perfectly clean. So we would continue to look at all options. There's a lot of assets still out there. It seems like there isn't, but there are in terms of consolidation, in terms of ideas on joint operations, in terms of ways to maximize the value of everyone's portfolio. And we're taking a hard look at those things. Obviously, the ratings agencies' concerns in that regard means something to us. But they're not going to be controlling the decisions that we make if they're in the best interest of our shareholders.

I’m pleased to report our second solid quarter of financial and operational performance for advancing longer term goals and objectives outlined earlier this year.Leo will review the quarter’s financial results",3632,"Thanks, Paula. Good morning, everybody. I’m pleased to report our second solid quarter of financial and operational performance for advancing longer term goals and objectives outlined earlier this year.
Leo will review the quarter’s financial results, and even with severely depressed commodity prices affecting the non-utility business the highest second quarter operational earnings per share in Company history.
I’ll start with progress on our business and financial objectives. At the utility, one of the financial objectives which we have consistently come up short on is to receive a reasonable opportunity from regulators across the system to earn rates of return consistent with investments of equivalent risks, and then actually realize that opportunity when it is availed.
In that regard, we have started in Texas since we first entered the state with the Gulf States utilities acquisition in 1993 and more recently in Arkansas, with the FERC system agreement order on rough production cost equalization.
I can’t say that we turned the corner yet, but I do believe we are making meaningful progress at all of our retail regulators and developing agreements on the need to solid credit metrics particularly in uncertain financial markets with the need to track capital for the changing regulatory requirements in transmission, for the environment, for the potential new investments needed for the liability, and to meet other public policy objectives.
On June 23, the Arkansas Public Service Commission approved a unanimous settlement agreement in Entergy Arkansas rate case filed last year. The settlement allows $63.7 million base rate increase effective in the first billing cycle in July, and a 10.2% ROE, up from the 9.9% allowed in the previous case.
But more importantly, it allows a greater opportunity to actually earn closer to the allowed return. It was certainly not everything we asked for or needed, but it recognizes that implementing alternative operating structures at Arkansas such as a standalone entity within the Entergy family, but outside the system agreement. We’ll require constructive regulatory treatment to track needed capital.
We remain encouraged that the APSC has the authority to improve upon this outcome through things like formula rate plans and transmission riders. There are open dockets, where these issues have been raised and can be addressed if the Commission is still inclined.
The good news for Entergy Arkansas customers in the short term is that despite this rate action, the Arkansas residential electricity rates decreased 22% compared to levels in July 2009, after factoring in lower fuel costs, continued efficient operation of our power plants, and sizable reduction in the amount collected and paid to other jurisdiction under the rough production cost equalization formula established by the FERC.
In Texas, parties in the Entergy Texas rate case are working to complete a stipulation agreement resolving all but one issue in the case. The contested issue, the competitive generation of service tariff was the subject of a limited hearing conducted in July.
Regarding this issue, legislation enacted in 2009 that Entergy Texas’s obligation to establish a competitive framework for all retail customers required the Company to file this proposal and intended that Entergy Texas be made hold for program costs and any loss of revenues from participating customers. Entergy Texas helps to get the stipulation finalized in the near future, the procedural schedule calls for a final commission order by November 1, 2010.
In Louisiana and Mississippi, where formula rate plan have been the regulatory construct for many years, each company roughly earn close to a midpoint of the earnings we had in 2009 as indicated by filings in Louisiana and a settlement in Mississippi this past quarter. The Mississippi Public Service Commission has already approved the terms of that settlement.
While the Louisiana Companies earn within their bands, pursuance of the terms of the FRPs, both companies are requesting rate adjustment outside of the FRP or capacity cost of PPA is not covered under the fuel cost.
At the LPSC’s meeting last week, the Commission approved increases effective in September and nuclear de-commissioning funding of approximately $7.8 million at Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and $3.5 million for in retail rate for Entergy Louisiana also outside the FRP.
Entergy New Orleans recent formula rate plant filing reflected over-earning electric rates during the period and under-earning in the gas distribution business. The FRP’s direct implementation of rate adjustments in the first billing cycle on October. (inaudible) Chapter 11 in May of 2007, Entergy New Orleans has reduced its total residential rates to its customers by 16.5%.
This opportunity to reduce electric rates again is due in part to a 9% sales growth increase over the past two years as New Orleans recovery from Hurricane Katrina continues to exceed initial expectations. Along with substantial efforts on the part of our team, these are effective and efficient as possible in the rebuilding of the cities’ energy infrastructure.
While on the subject of storms, having just prepared for the threat of Tropical Storm Bonnie, which was headed towards service territory before dissipating in the Gulf around a week ago, our prediction are more to come from an active storm season due to the transition from El Nino to the predicted La Nina conditions, which hasn’t happened yet by the way and in the warm Atlantic sea surface temperatures which has happened.
The Louisiana Bond Commission recently acted to close out the very active 2008 storm season approving Act 55 financing for recovery of costs associated with the Gustav and Ike and the establishment of cash reserves for future storms. Under Act 55, if you don’t remember that act in particular, the bonds are issued on behalf of the Louisiana Utilities Restoration Corporation, not by Entergy.
The financings close on July 22, providing collectively over $400 million in proceeds for the balance of storm restoration cost to Entergy Gulf States Louisiana and Entergy Louisiana as well as $290 million in dedicated cash reserves in the bank for future storms at just under a 3.3% average coupon on a duration related basis.
These bonds have the lowest yields for any previous rate payer backlogs in its asset class, substantially benefiting the utility’ customers with this low cost financing source, particularly compared to the old rate base approach for refinance this obligation 10 to 15 years or longer these in utility’s balance sheets.
At Entergy Arkansas securitization for storm recovery was from an indirect legislation enacted in April 2009. In June, the APSC’s financing order authorized the issuance of approximately $126 million in storm recovery bonds for the January 2009 ice storm with closing anticipated in the third quarter.
Now I have to take a second here to remind everybody, particularly those who attended the EEI Financial Conference in 2005. I suspect many of you remember that day, it occurred shortly after we had completed storm restoration for all customers that could take service following Katrina and Rita. But I want to remind you just how far we’ve changed since those bleak days.
In 2005, we had negative account balances in storm reserves before the hurricanes hit. Since then utility regulators have taken actions to bolster storm reserves by over $640 million, including authorizing securitization of $570 million of storm reserves, and building a $75 million storm reserve for Entergy New Orleans over the next 10 years.
In addition, utility regulators authorized securitization of nearly $2.4 billion for actual restoration costs. Remembering back to that EEI meeting in 2005, I don’t think very many people in the audience saw that one coming. We didn’t predict it either, but we did state at the time that it was one of our objectives.
Staying with the balance sheet, potential new investment opportunities remain attractive to investors and customers. Even with resource additions over the past several years, utility operating companies remain in the short position relative to long term expected demand.
Last week the Entergy operating companies concluded the summer 2009 long-term request for proposals in which the system was initially targeting up to 1,000 megawatts of long-term resources targeting 2011 as well as 550 megawatts of despatchable capacity in 2015 localized in the unique south area to help meet specific reliability needs and then existent needs for capacity at Entergy.
Based on the evaluation of submitted proposals, RFP selections were increased to four acquisition proposals totaling approximately 2,800 megawatts including the self build-offs identified in the RFP at Entergy Louisiana’s Ninemile site and one PPA proposal totaling 500 megawatts.
Of course, all subject to completion of satisfactory negotiations and execution of definitive agreements, which is targeted for late this year or early next year. We also received FERC approval to acquire the 580 megawatts Acadia Unit 2. Closing is targeted for first quarter 2011 subject to receipt of LPSC approval, and Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust clearance.
At the end of July, the utility also provided notice of intent to conduct request for proposals for long-term renewable generation resources. More details will be made available in September on that initiative.
In addition, work began on the 178 megawatt extended power uprate at Grand Gulf. Certain activities were performed during Grand Gulf’s most recent refueling outage to lay the ground work for completion of the uprate project in 2012. Once the uprate is installed, the reactor at Grand Gulf will have the largest capacity of any single nuclear generator of its size in the nation.
Finally, regarding the proposed cancellation of Little Gypsy Repowering Project, currently in long-term suspension for over three or more years; the LPSC’s staff testimony filed in June agreed it was prudent to cancel the project and at Entergy’s recommendation to suspend on a longer term basis was finally made.
It indicated that except for $819,000 in compensation and related costs, the requested cost of $211 million incurred should be deem recoverable and allowed recovery of carrying costs and our return on project costs at a rate approximating the cost of debt, which the staff estimated at around 7%. The LPSC staff also recommended the project cost should be securitized if legally feasible and found to be in the public interest.
To that end, Louisiana legislature unanimously passed legislations, now signed by the governor for that and more to allow securitization for canceled construction of electric generating, transmission facilities, the purchase of long-term fuel supplies, and any other capital investment above $350 million that the LPSC deemed suitable for securitization.
The Little Gypsy quarterly monitoring process proved to be a model framework for working generally with utility regulators on long lead times, large capital projects, particularly in an uncertain economic climate. It allowed all parties to respond quickly as market conditions changed.
As particularly critical, given the capital-intensive investing days that the utility industry is facing, no one wants to repeat the 1970s’ and 1980s’ massive destruction of capital and utility’s credit capacity.
Clearly, Louisiana is setting the tone that this is a good state to invest in. Louisiana’s decision makers are eliminating the potential for the unhappy surprises that you all worry about and we worry about, and enhancing utility’s access to financial markets to things like Act 55 financing for storm damages.
To summarize, during the quarter, the utility made significant progress regarding better actual earnings and better earnings opportunities to more constructive regulatory orders governing existing assets and clear investment opportunities in new assets that will benefit our customers for years to come. While low growth is on track with expectations, utility’s 5% to 6% net income growth aspirations for 2014 remains in clear view.
Turning to the valuable options represented by the non-utility generation business. In early June, I announced my first major reorganization in more than 11 years. Internal restructuring is the first step to preserve the valuable options identified in a spin-off and ultimately to unlock that value.
The new Entergy Wholesale Commodities organization led by Rick Smith, or EWC as you may hear it say, will have P&L accountability for the non-utility business in the same manner that Gary Taylor has for the utility business, and in same manner that Rick had in the utility business before he moved over. This new structure is patterned after what a nexus would have looked like in the spin-off.
Rick’s new EWC organization places a clear focus on commercial opportunities, government and regulatory affairs, and financial and risk matters for the entire non-utility wholesale business. Mark Savoff, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, now has responsibility for the hour-to-hour, day-to-day accountability and focus for all of utility and non-utility generation operations, allowing us to maintain the scale and operational excellence for all of Entergy. Mark reports to me, but his metric is still Rick and Gary, the business unit Heads.
In other events related to this spin unwind, having still not received nod from the New York Public Service Commission, we’ve submitted a formal request in July to withdraw our petition in order to officially close out the spin-off proceedings in that state. It’s clearly time to move on from that failed effort. This action followed with Vermont Public Service Board’s order issued in June to close out the spin-off proceedings in that state.
Efforts continued in the second quarter on one of our top priorities for the new Entergy Wholesale Commodity business, license renewal.
At Pilgrim, as expected the NRC dismissed it, and Pilgrim launched a license renewal proceeding, remaining activities includes submittal of revised commitments and information to allow the NRC to supplement Pilgrim Safety Evaluation Report and resolution of a filed matter remanded for the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board for hearing. The hearing date has not yet been set, but could begin in late fall.
Likewise at Vermont Yankee, the NRC denied one appeal and it has remanded one issue back to the ASLB to give parties a chance to amend the challenge through the (inaudible) fatigue monitoring program, a very limited scope issue.
In addition, Vermont Yankee received the same request as Pilgrim to submit revised commitments and information to allow the NRC to supplement its Safety Evaluation Report.
In Vermont, in April findings from the initial comprehensive reliability assessment prepared at the direction of the legislature were reaffirmed by the Department of Public Services and its consultant NSA. More specifically findings at Vermont Yankee can be operated reliably for another 20 years.
In July, the Public Oversight Board previously empanelled by the legislature also issued its supplemental report, essentially reaffirming the central finding of its March report that is if the Company addresses several key concerns the panel’s fundamentals conclusions remains that Vermont Yankee can operate reliably for additional two decades.
Since the original comprehensive reliability testing was issued in December 2008, Entergy Vermont Yankee has resolved or developed plans to address all of the reports recommendation. Nonetheless, Entergy Vermont Yankee recognizes there is still much work ahead to secure both in Vermont for license renewal.
As we’ve said before, the key date for substantial commitments remains second quarter of 2011. We will make every reasonable or practical effort to satisfy the stakeholder in Vermont, the plant is safe, secure and critical, the clean energy future for the state. None one takes the safety of nuclear plants more seriously than we do.
But if for whatever reason the plant ceases operations beyond 2012, while we do not believe that will be the outcome. We do believe it is important for you to keep in mind, that Entergy’s financial aspirations are not dependent upon license renewal at this single plant.
We do have approximately 650 employees at that plant, but I do loosely bore, however, and we are working on how we fairly address that very real concern. We have a very broad organization as you all know, and we expect to be able to offer positions to those employees somewhere else in the system.
At Indian Point, the ASLB issued a detailed schedule order scheduled for the hearing process expected to be held in the third quarter 2011 followed by an ASLB decision in mid 2012. Also with Indian Point pre-trial hearing began on the water quality certification draft denial. Although raising a variety of issue, the way the petition is file and comments submitted with the ALJ prior to the hearing echoed Entergy’s concerns with any decision requiring cooling towers at that facility.
For example, the New York City Economic Development Corporation filed a petition for amicable status in the case, while they do not offer an opinion directly on the cooling tower question, their comments echoed statements made by the Public Service Commission in a spin-off proceedings on the importance of Indian Point, specifically to New York City’s electricity supply and meeting the air quality and greenhouse gas reduction goals.
The New York Department of Public Service and Institution for full party status raised concerns including the feasibility and affordability of cooling towers. Others were with similar issues, including independent power producers of New York and Central Hudson Gas & Electric.
During the public comment portion of the hearings, many interested parties also spoke in support of Indian Point and the importance of getting due consideration to Wedgewire screens as they are far less invasive and more environmentally friendly alternative.
At the Issues Conference, in response the DEC restated that in their draft denial of the water-quality certificates in April, they were not requiring cooling towers. Instead, hence we have stayed in their opinion that Wedgewire screens are not the best available control technology. But we certainly believe that cooling towers are not the right answer to Indian point, we also believe our reports clearly show how the Wedgewire screen alternative is a proven solution that will resolve concerns about the plant’s impact on the Hudson River.
The Issues Conference continues today and is scheduled for legal briefing that certain threshold legal issues that are expected to be issued soon. However, after the settlement we don’t expect full hearing earlier than around the middle of next year.
In addition to added focus on regulatory and community matters, the new EWC organization is designed to capture value to a greater commercial focus on pricing, hedging, managing risk and capitalizing on growth opportunities.
We will be talking with you more about that in the coming weeks and months as we continue to work to translate our vision to resolve the effective valuable option we own today in this wholesale commodities business.
Before closing, I’m pleased to report that once again In June, Entergy received GovernanceMetrics International’s highest global rating, a perfect 10.0 for best-in-class corporate performance, a rating entity has maintained since June 2006. Only 42 companies or just 1% achieved an overall global rating of 10.0 in GMI’s most recent release. That’s an all things that it’s worth doing for us doing well.
We hold ourselves a stringent corporate governance standards and its recognition reinforces the actions we’re taking to achieve that end and assure all of you that we understand that particularly in this day and age it’s critical that we’ll be above reproach in everything we do. As owners, we know you agree, it is what you expect and this is what our Board of Directors demand.
Before turning it over to Leo, I’d also like to note that we have two new participants on our call today. Paula Waters has stepped into the lead role as Vice President, Investor Relations. I can tell you that her background in Investor Relations and Strategic Planning along with her superior financial acumen makes her a perfect fit for that role. I can also assure you that she will continue to pursue the standard of (inaudible) strive to achieve in our disclosures and our relations with all of you.
At the same time, Michele is not going too far way. In fact, she is about four feet away from here right now. She has been given broader responsibilities, which include responsibilities four Investor Relations will continue to report to her.
Also joining us today is Rod West, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer. Rod has been on my radar screen since I joined the Company in 1998. At times, he’s tried my patience as we had moved Rod through the various chairs to prove his capabilities and he really learned the business first hand, and now it is paying off. We have a proven leader with the knowledge and experience that we rarely find in a senior management team, and as Chief Administrator Officer, Rod, is at the heart of our decision making process. His operational excellence in manage and rebuilding the New Orleans Electric Distribution System after Hurricane Katrina and Rita, as well as his financial and legal experience leading Entergy New Orleans out of bankruptcy into the successful business it is today will serve him well in his new role.
You may not know Rod as well as many outside the industry do. For those inside the industry, who have consistently and unsuccessfully tried to recruit Rod away from Entergy, he provided outstanding leadership as a President of the LSU Board of Trustees before being enticed to the Board of Trustees at Notre Dame, his alma mater. He also served and continued to serve in key roles in various national committees and organizations that promote and support the public good.
I know you’ll enjoy getting to know him better including at our Analyst Conference next year in New Orleans. And speaking about the 2011 Analyst Conference, in the appendix of the webcast presentation we’ve inserted our Save the Date notice. Since Jazz Fest is one of the most highly attended events in New Orleans, we will communicate often with you about logistics of the conference, and particularly encourage you to make arrangements well in advance to make sure adequate flight selections for travel.
Now I’ll turn the call over to Leo. Leo?

In my remarks today, I will cover quarterly financial results and cash performance followed by an update on our share repurchase program, our 2010 earnings guidance, and then close with some perspective on the",2367,"Thank you, Wayne, and good morning, everyone. In my remarks today, I will cover quarterly financial results and cash performance followed by an update on our share repurchase program, our 2010 earnings guidance, and then close with some perspective on the introduced value proposition.
Starting with our financial results on Slide #2, second quarter 2010 earnings were higher than one year ago at both the utility and nuclear, while they were lower at parents and other.
Second quarter earnings included accretion from our share repurchases mainly due to those executed in connection with authorized program completed in 2009. As reported results once again this quarter included charge associated with spin-off dis-synergies, and the expenses for outside services that are now focused on the spin unwind process.
As we’ve previously committed we have been aggressively working through the process of unwinding the spin infrastructure and we’ll meet these costs as soon as possible.
Excluding this special item related to the spin, operational earnings were up nearly 40% compared to the second quarter of 2009. The strong operational results for the second quarter came from robust growth in utility sales along with solid performance across the fleet at Entergy Nuclear.
Utility sales increased across all the customer classes and included the effect of warmer than normal weather in all of the jurisdictions we serve. However, each jurisdiction also had positive overall retail sales growth on a weather adjusted basis.
At Entergy Nuclear, where lower power pricing continued to affect that segment’s results, the fleet again this quarter delivered solid operational performance, including the second longest run in Vermont Yankee’s history and the second record breaker run in 4.5 years before the start of refueling outage in April, an ongoing record operation run at FitzPatrick and the second longest operational run at Pilgrim.
In addition, Palisades was recognized by the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations as achieving excellence in overall plant performance for the first time in the plant’s history. Employees at Palisades also received the highest honor given by the Nuclear Energy Institute, the Top Industry Practice Award.
Turning back now to factors driving quarter-on-quarter results, we’re referring to Slide #3, first, at the utility, higher net revenue was the primary factor driving the quarterly earnings increase.
Overall, utility retail sales grew by 8.6% led by double-digit performance in the industrial sector. For the second consecutive quarter, weather was a significant factor in residential sales growth. Our region experienced record weather once again.
With 116 years of data available, it was the warmest quarter on record in the Louisiana, the second warmest ever in Arkansas and the third warmest in Mississippi. However, we believe the real residential sales news here is that the sector achieved solid growth of 2.1% on a weather adjusted basis.
Turning back to the industrial sector, the positive effects of economic rebound we saw taking shape in the first quarter results continued through the second quarter. The national industrial recovery supported by the need to rebuild diminished inventories and re-enforced by a comeback in the auto industry and stronger exports is clearly benefiting our customer base. This rebound is magnified when the comparable period is the first half of last year and the worst of the economic recession was affecting our region.
Looking at specific Industrial segments, the results are mixed and tied directly to trends in both the national and global economies. For example, an improving global industrial picture has provided a boost to the Chemical segment. This occurred while the weakened national demand for gasoline and high natural gas inventory levels have pressured the Pipeline segment.
The decrease in demand for gasoline also created some resistance to recovery among our refining customers, who are relying more on export opportunities. Primary metals are experiencing rebound due to some bounce in the auto industry, while a soft housing market continues to depress the Wood Products business segment.
Further evidence of the mixed nature of the recovery can be seen in Arkansas, where some industrial sales are benefiting from recovery among small manufacturers tied to global industrial expansion.
Slide #4, which we’ve used for a few quarterly calls now, clearly reflects this rebound. As a reminder, this chart plots month-by-month the change in cumulative retail sales for a three-month period versus the same three-month period in the prior year.
After excluding the effects of weather and the 2008 hurricanes, we once again can see the effect of an economy that has clearly shown improvement in our service territory. There were some tampering effects included in our industrial sales results this quarter.
As was true last quarter, the increase in net revenue from higher industrial sales volume was somewhat offset by the price effect associated with demand charges. You’ll recall that last year these charges had offset the negative impact of lower volume.
In addition, late in the second quarter, we saw indications that the pace of recovery was slowing, adjusting that while recovery may hold we could see the improvement moderate in future months. The key takeaway from all of this is that our weather-adjusted sales results to date aligned well with the assumptions used in our full year guidance numbers.
Finally, regulatory actions in 2009 produced results that benefited this quarter, including FRP actions at Entergy Gulf States Louisiana, Entergy Louisiana and Entergy Mississippi and the absence in the current quarter of a May 2009 FERC order, which resulted in a charge in Entergy Texas.
Turning back for a moment to Slide #3; we see that an increase in interest expense at the utility partially offset the positive effect of higher net revenue for the current quarter.
Moving to Entergy Nuclear, the quarter-over-quarter increase in operational earnings was due primarily to higher net revenue associated with higher generation due to fewer planned and unplanned outage days and the absence of impairments associated with decommissioning trust recorded in the second quarter of last year.
Fewer plant refueling outage days reflect the timing of our refueling schedule for the fleet. Our schedule for ‘09 included all three refueling outages in the spring, what is scheduled this year has two spring and two fall refuelings.
The reduction in unplanned days reflect strong performance of a 23% decrease in the number of unplanned outage days this quarter compared to a year ago. Partially offsetting the positive results coming from a solid operating quarter at Entergy Nuclear, a lower net revenue on lower energy pricing for sales on a contracted basis, and higher non-fuel operation and maintenance expense, due primarily to tritium remediation work at the Vermont Yankee, the effect of fewer refueling outage days during the quarter, and higher benefits expense.
Finally, Parent and other’s results were lower due primarily to higher income tax expense because of the absence of increases in valuation allowances on loss carryovers that were recorded in the second quarter of 2009.
Moving now to Slide #5, Entergy’s operating cash flow performance for the second quarter 2010 reflected an increase of approximately $150 million over the second quarter of last year. This net increase in OCF was driven mainly by three factors.
Higher net revenues at both utility and Entergy nuclear, the absence of storm spending that occurred in the second quarter of 2009, and lower refueling outage costs due to fewer scheduled outages in the second quarter 2010 at Entergy Nuclear. Partially offsetting these positive contributors to cash flow was higher working capital requirements at the utility.
In closing the topic of cash, I believe it’s important to emphasize that as we enter the height of hurricane season, our liquidity position remain solid. We have $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand, and another $1.3 billion of available liquidity should we need to call on such funds as of the end of June. In addition, we have the ability to access $290 million in cash storm damage reserves on Louisiana securitizations that were funded in July.
Now turning to an update on our share repurchase program. As reflected on Slide #6, during the second quarter, we completed roughly $138 million of share repurchases. We purchased a total of 1.8 million shares at an average price of $76 per share. About 55% of the repurchases were made through the existing $750 million Board Authorized Program. The balance was repurchased to offset the dilutive effects of stock options exercises.
We continue to expect to complete repurchases under the current program by year end. However consistent with past practice decision on whether to buy back stock are made based on a number of factors including current business conditions and investments, our liquidity and financial flexibility to quickly respond to changing conditions, and our point of view on the value of our stock.
Slide seven details our current 2010 earnings guidance, which ranges from $5.95 to $6.80 per share on an as reported basis and $6.40 to $7.20 per share on an operational basis. The as reported and operational guidance ranges remained unchanged from the numbers we shared at our first quarter earnings call. As we assess our earnings performance today we believe we have good progress through the first half of 2010 and are well positioned relative to our full year guidance range.
Utilities have experienced consecutive quarters of strong sales growth bolstered by positive performance across all of our jurisdictions particularly among residential and industrial customers. The economic rebound both nationally and globally has yielded benefits to our business is reflected in our utility sales number.
Our efforts in the regulatory arena produced constructive great actions in 2009 which also contributed to improved results. It is noteworthy to recognize that weather has been a significant contributor to results over the first six months of this year.
Clearly, you could not predict, nor control the effect of weather at any given period. In addition third quarter is historically our most significant earnings quarter. We’re only about one third of the way through that period. The point here is that there is more work to do in order to achieve the level of financial success we targeted for this year at the utility.
At Entergy Nuclear, the fleet continues to perform well and posting a capacity factor of 90% this quarter, while working through two planned refueling outages. In addition, there are more planned refuelings in the fall.
Also, pricing on the portfolio’s unsold position continues to work against this relative to our guidance assumption, although we’ve seen it slightly down since we updated you last quarter. While the power markets may not be as unpredictable as weather, many factors beyond our control will drive prices for the uncontracted power we sell over the remainder of the year.
In summation, we are pleased with our financial performance for the first half of the year. Our efforts will focus on continuing to produce positive financial results through strong operational performance, and consistent with our past practice, we will not revise our guidance range given the uncertainty of key earnings drivers such as weather, outage schedules, and market prices among other uncertainties unless we see factors moving us out of our overall guidance range.
Change direction just for a moment. As Wayne mentioned earlier, we have a couple of new players on today’s call with Paula Waters and Rod West. I would also like to point out that today is the last earnings call for someone that many of you know and had interaction with over the last decade.
During the third quarter, Paul LaRosa will be retiring. Paul has been key part of the IR team for over 10 years and has been with Entergy for 33 years. I know that many of you have developed a relationship with Paul, and I can tell you that for the last six years, he has provided you with great counsel on a number of wide-ranging initiatives.
As you all know, Paul was slated to lead the Investor Relations team at Enexus. I know that you all want to wish Paul well in your dealings with him over the next couple of months.
So in closing the last script that Paul will help me write, we recognize that current economic environment has created widespread uncertainty for many of our stakeholders. However, we also recognize that the unsteady drawn up pace with the economic recovery offers an opportunity for those who remained focus.
At Entergy, we maintain our focus through the tireless pursuit of our aspirations. As we’ve discussed with you in the past, our aspirations include 5% to 6% growth at the utility driven by sales growth, improving ROEs, and making productive investments through portfolio transformation.
Our focus has produced measurable results against these aspirations, as indicated by strong sales growth including sales on a weather adjusted basis, constructive regulatory outcomes, including meaningful progress in our most challenging jurisdictions, and continued progress in our efforts to identify productive investments as demonstrated by the promising results of this utility supply plan RFP. These results include four acquisition proposals totaling nearly 3000 megawatts, and include one self-build option.
In Nuclear, our aspirations continue to focus on preserving the valuable option of this low cost base load running fleet through superior operational performance. Again, this quarter, our fleet turned in strong performance, achieving a 90% capacity factor despite client outage time for two refuelings. Finally, we know that retaining focus in our business produces the financial outcomes you expect, like solid liquidity in credit and value that is returned to you through dividends and/or share repurchases.
As noted earlier, our liquidity stands at more than $2.5 billion, which excludes nearly $300 million of storm cash reserves, a very solid position for us. With regard to getting value to you, we plan on competing share repurchases through our $750 million program by year-end.
These repurchases are an important element of our program forecasted to return to you as much as $5 billion in dividends or share repurchases over the next five years absent additional attractive investment opportunities.
I can ensure you that Entergy remains committed at good times and at bad to create value through focus on those things most important to you. And now the Entergy senior team is available for your questions.

As we go forward, we’re going to move past what we would have been with the spin, and the current debt levels will remain reasonably modest, but we will continue to carry some debt there. We’ve just made change in terms of the nature of how it’s placed versus what we used to have as term debt which now sits potentially in the revolver of the cash that we have. We’ll work through maintaining a pretty consistent level of debt there for the time being, but maybe in a different form.

I mean the context we put that in, there’s always an argument for consolidation in this industry just because of the very dispersed nature of the talent across the board. I think it is very, very tough sell to Boards and to regulators on consolidation right now.
But with the rules have developed, the antitrust rules it’s merged with somebody, it’s constantly you are in divestment mode, or things that you need to serve your customers, and then you’re giving most of the benefits to your customers and not much to your shareholders to contain a premium and then it’s a emerging with somebody very far away, it’s hard to develop a strategic rationale, other than I just want to get bigger, which doesn’t really work for us.
As a strategic rationale, it’s got to produce better cash flows unless we’re asked to do something. I think that the consolidation is something on Mr. Rogers mind for a long time and he has been successful at it. They may well continue to pursue it. Then we like everybody and we said before, I think last year that we looked at a lot of stuff, and at the end of the day, nothing ever seems really make sense once you count the cost of the premiums and things.
I don’t think you’re going to see a lot of consolidation in this industry. I think you may see something, but it would be unique. I think once you get through this building phase with some of the plans people have, that there will be maybe some forced consolidations that’s like occurred as in last building phase, just through financial distress, but I don’t see it today.

I think it’s really a question of a lot of people are taking a wait and see approach right now.
These moratoriums are working their way either through the court process and that’s probably longer term as to how it impacts drilling in that year. There were about 33 deepwater wells, and so I think it could be a little bit longer term impact, but in the timeframe you’re talking about, I don’t think we’ll see a large impact to this Company; obviously, to the people that are affected, it is significant.

We looked at those plans, we talked a lot about managing them as a business, but we continue to manage them functionally without a P&L Head, without all of the functions in the Northeast that you would have, for example, at the utility.
It was clear in the spin-off process that most of the states viewed it’s so different than a utility and we did not have the functions in place in that area to provide the answers and understand their positions and to explain our positions and come to some agreements. That’s a big part now with much more a part of the communities and we’ll a lot better job in terms of execution by being kind of the business units up there instead of just functions. So I’ll let Rick talk specifically about some of the things in a different way?

Though we have been thinking about years ‘12, ‘13 and ‘14, and what we might do as it relates to the capacity additions in the area that allow us to kind of change the product mix from pretty much totally contingent to firm capacity.
So I mean, we’re just jumping into that at the mid, what we dealt with the spin kind of bogged us down on the regulatory process. So I think, we’ll be able to provide you with some better thoughts over the next couple of quarter. But I mean, it is in the back of our mind to look at the portfolio more broadly and see what we can do around the existing base load of units to really sell different products.
