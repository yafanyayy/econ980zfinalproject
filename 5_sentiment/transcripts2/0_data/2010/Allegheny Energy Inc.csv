For the fourth quarter of 2009, adjusted results were $0.66 per share, compared to $0.51 in the prior year. Adjusted net income increased by $26 million. Both segments, Regulated Operations and Merchant Generation, contributed to the higher quarterly earnings. This breakout of segments is a little different than in the past. A new segment, Regulated Operations, now includes the generation of the Monongahela Power, which is our West Virginia regulated subsidiary, as well as transmission and distribution operations in all four states and our transmission expansion projects.Earnings from these regulated operations nearly doubled in the quarter, increasing from $19 million a year ago to $35 million. The improvement was largely due to increased recovery of purchased power cost in Virginia, thanks to the settlement approved by the commission in November 2008, and higher earnings from transmission expansion projects. This improvement was achieved despite lower megawatt-hour sales, which were down 6% from the comparable period last year. Weather was milder than normal, and milder than last year as well, contributing to reduced residential usage. Sales to industrial customers were down 11%, continuing the trend we've seen throughout 2009.At our Merchant Generation segment, we were hurt by weak demand and low natural gas and power prices. Both natural gas and power prices were down about 30% compared to a year ago. As a result, output was down 22% from last year's quarter, and our supercritical capacity factor dropped to a record low 58% in the quarter. Despite all of this, adjusted earnings in the Merchant Generation business went up by $10 million. Our hedges, including the Pennsylvania POLR contract and financial hedges, provided substantial protection from the decline in market prices, as they have throughout 2009. And earnings were further bolstered by higher capacity revenues, a gain on the purchase of two hydro facilities and a tax law change in Pennsylvania.Turning to plant reliability. Supercritical was 83% in the fourth quarter, down from 91% a year ago. Planned outages were up. We had four planned outage weeks in the quarter, as compared to virtually none in the same period a year ago. Unplanned outages due to equipment problems also hurt availability. For the full year 2009, adjusted earnings per share were $2.33, up slightly from a year ago. Improved cost recovery in Virginia increased revenues from our transmission expansion projects, and our favorable power hedges offset the adverse impacts of low power prices, weak demand and the recession.While the economy hurt us, we stayed focused on running our business well, and we accomplished a lot in many important areas. Let me review some of these achievements with you. First, safety. Our performance last year was outstanding on both sides of the business. At Allegheny Power, we posted the best safety performance in the history of the company, placing us in the top quartile. And in Generation, we saw a significant improvement, and now rank in the top decile in the industry. Second, we completed our scrubber construction projects on time and under budget. This $1.3 billion investment program added scrubbers to five supercritical units at two sites, Fort Martin and Hatfieldâ€™s Ferry. This will reduce our sulfur dioxide emissions from these plants by more than 95%. Our entire supercritical fleet is now scrubbed.Third, we focused intently on controlling costs and spending throughout the organization. We succeeded in holding operations in maintenance expenses flat. This is now the fourth year in a row we've held O&M flat, and we've done this while improving most measures of performance and maintaining high marks for customer satisfaction. Fourth, we maintained our investment-grade credit rating, and strengthened our financial condition and liquidity position. We refinanced $843 million of indebtedness, increased our credit facilities and extended maturities. And in December, we securitized the remaining Fort Martin scrubber cost. Fifth, we moved forward on our transmission expansion project, the Trans-Allegheny Interstate Line, or TrAIL. We remained on schedule for a June 2011 in-service. We have more than 90% of the right of way acquired, and significant progress has been made on the two substations. Construction of all segments of the line is underway, and we have about half of the tower foundation and around 40% of the towers themselves completed.Our other major transmission project, the Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline project, or PATH, however, has been delayed. PJM informed us at the end of December that their latest work indicates the line may not be needed in 2014 as planned. They'll set a new date when they complete their comprehensive planning process in June. Sixth, we made meaningful progress on a number of regulatory fronts. We settled in both West Virginia and Virginia on our fuel and purchased power recovery costs. We filed a base rate case in West Virginia during 2009. The commission staff subsequently filed a motion to delay the case, to give them more time to understand the tax selection that we are planning to make. This election is a result of the change in federal tax rules that allow us to deduct repair costs previously capitalized. It will create a cash flow benefit of about $120 million this year. And as a result, we won't be a cash taxpayer in 2010. We reached agreements with the parties in our case on a procedural schedule that sets evidentiary hearings in early April.Seventh, we launched several energy efficiency and conservation programs in Maryland and in Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania, a large portion of our residential program focuses on the installation of Smart Meter. Our implementation plan was filed with the public utility commission in August '09 and is still pending approval. We'll continue to work with the commission to move this forward in order to meet the requirements of Pennsylvania Act 129. And eighth and finally, our transmission to market-based rates in Pennsylvania continues to go smoothly, while Pennsylvania utility, West Penn Power, has now held four auctions to procure power for the period as the rate caps expire at the end of this year. In the most recent West Penn auction held last month, the average retail generation price was $62 per megawatt hour for residential customers. This includes energy, capacity, gross receipts, taxes and line losses. We now have 2/3 of next year's residential power under contract. Based on these results, residential customers would see an increase of 8.5% in their electric bills in January 2011. For small and mid-sized non-residential customers, the typical increase would be even less, 0.6% and 2.0% respectively, assuming similar results in future auctions.So overall, we made substantial progress in a number of fundamental areas in 2009. Before I discuss our 2010 priorities, let me give you an update on the status of our hedging program, including the success of our merchant generation unit in the recent POLR auctions. As I said on the last quarterly call, by the end of the given year, we want to have 80% to 90% of the next year's output hedged, 30% to 50% of the second year and up to 30% of the third year. As of year-end '09, we achieved those targets. But we stayed at the low end of these ranges to maintain our leverage to an economic recovery. Now in the January, last month West Penn auctioned. There were seven contracts awarded. Allegheny Energy Supply won three of them, for a total of about 1.25 million megawatt-hours. A Maryland utility, Potomac Edison, also conducted an auction in January, awarding six contracts. Allegheny Energy won one contract for $500,000 megawatt-hours. As of today, we now have hedged about 82% of our merchant output in '10, 33% '11 and 6% in '12.Turning now to our priorities for 2010. We're anticipating a slow economic recovery. So maintaining a strong financial position and solid liquidity remains a top priority for us. And we'll be vigilant in our efforts to control costs and spending. Our plan is to keep non-formulatic OEM flat, marking the fifth consecutive year of no increase in costs, an accomplishment I think few can match. Other priorities include keeping our TrAIL project on schedule for in-service in June of next year, resolving our West Virginia base case successfully, completing the sale of our Virginia territory and keeping our transition to market-based rates on track in Pennsylvania. And of course, we'll continue to monitor closely potential environmental legislation and regulations. With respect to climate change, I think the probability of a bill passing this year has been greatly diminished. We'll also be reviewing any new federal regulations regarding coal combustion byproducts including fly ash. We use predominantly dry landfills to store fly ash. We have no wet storage facilities of the type that failed at TVA, but we do own wet storage facilities of a different design at two of our locations Pleasants and R. Paul Smith. And both of these facilities are regularly inspected by federal and state agencies, as well as independent third parties.So in closing, I'd say 2009 was a tough year. We faced a long and deep recession that affected our businesses. We experienced low energy prices, both current and forward. And we had a capacity auction in May that hit our regions sharply. No one can feel good about these developments. But as I indicated earlier, we did make great progress on what we could control. We focused on keeping intact the fundamental drivers of long-term value, and we had an array of accomplishments during the year. We'll continue that focus in 2010. And we remain very well-positioned for strong growth when the economy recovers. For example, on an unhedged basis, a $10 change in realized energy prices in 2011 should increase pretax income by approximately $360 million, and we fully expect that power prices will increase over time. I thank you all for your interest and support. And now let to turn the call over to Kirk."

Adjusted e",2318,"Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported GAAP net income of $109 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $16 million a year ago. Earnings were $0.64 per share compared to $0.10 in the same period a year ago. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.66 per share, as compared to $0.51 per share for the same period last year. Adjusted earnings exclude net unrealized gains and losses associated with hedging activities and $13 million of expense associated with the debt tender offer. Last year's adjustments were primarily driven by unrealized losses associated with FTRs.Adjusted pretax earnings increased $17 million for the quarter, compared to the same period a year ago. I'd like to summarize some of the key factors that drove the increase. In our Merchant Generation business for the quarter, unhedged net revenues were worse by $76 million. This reflects lower volume and a reduction in realized energy prices, partially offset by a decrease in fuel costs. The decrease in unhedged net revenues was more than offset by a gain of $78 million in power hedge margin, which is the difference between our hedges' contract price and the estimated market value of the volumes hedged. And $11 per megawatt-hour improvement in the contribution from our power hedges more than offset an $11 decrease in realized energy prices. Merchant generation EBITDA above also includes a $17 million benefit from a gain on the purchase of a hydro facility and the cancellation of a related contract. You'll find details on the fourth quarter performance of Merchant Generation in the appendix.Our regulated operations benefited by $20 million, due to our 2008 settlement for recovery of Virginia purchase power. In addition, we continue to make progress on our transmission expansion projects, which increased EBITDA by $14 million quarter-over-quarter. Interest expense for the entire company was higher by $19 million. Of this amount, $9 million was primarily due to the fact that we stopped capitalizing interest costs when the Hatfield scrubbers went into service in 2009, and $9 million relates to an increase in average debt outstanding, of which $3 million is related to TrAIL, which has been formulaic recovery.Depreciation increased by $8 million, primarily due to the Hatfield scrubbers being placed in service. In total, adjusted pretax earnings were $17 million higher than the fourth quarter last year. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 30%, which compares to 40% for the same period a year ago. We benefited by $18 million in the fourth quarter 2009, due to a change in the Pennsylvania tax law that will allow us to recover a larger portion of our net operating loss carry-forward benefits in future years. This brings our effective tax rate in at 38% for the full-year 2009.Cash flow from operations was $329 million after adjusting for the tender offer premium payment in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $293 million for the quarter. Free cash flow netting the securitization proceeds used to fund the Fort Martin scrubbers and project financing for TrAIL was a positive $185 million for the quarter. Adjusting for the same items for the full year, we had positive free cash flow of $233 million. We'll go into more detail on 2010 later, but we expect the adjusted free cash flow before dividends for 2010 to be between $125 million to $175 million. We've completed several financings since our last call. Long Tower has completed an $86 million securitization, entered into a $110 million revolving credit facility and repaid $110 million medium-term note. In January, TrAILCo issued $450 million of 4% notes, and also entered into a $350 million revolving credit facility. As a result of these transactions, the company's liquidity profile continues to improve, with more than $2 billion of liquidity at year end. There are no other maturities in 2010 except for securitization amortizations.Now, let's turn to the outlook. As a reminder, for the Merchant Generation business, we are providing forward-looking information on hedging, generation output and other data that will facilitate modeling of the business. For the regulated businesses, we're providing some projections of rate base. Depreciation and interest expense are shown on a consolidated basis. Our estimates are based on forward power prices at December 31, which were $48 for 2010 at the western hub. Forward prices are subject to highly variable market factors outside of our control, and our estimates may change due to fluctuations in those prices and other factors. We're presenting our 2009 results, and estimated increase or decrease in pretax earnings in 2010 over 2009. We'll now go through the drivers of each of these line items.Since our last call, we've significantly revised our estimates for transmission expansion EBITDA and interest expense, which I'll address shortly. Moving to Slide 41, for merchant generation, we estimate 2010 EBITDA to be down slightly from last year. As the following slides will show, this is driven a contraction in the benefit of our power hedges, offset by growth in our unhedged energy margin and increased capacity revenues. Slide 42 summarizes among other things what we include in unhedged energy margin, the contribution of capacity, other revenues, including ancillaries and operating expenses bringing us down to unhedged EBITDA. Generation volumes are forecasted using an industry-standard dispatch model. Estimates of generation volume are based upon various inputs such as forward commodity prices, estimated cost and our expected planned outages. We are forecasting a significant increase in our generation volumes in 2010 relative to 2009. Our 2009 generation volumes were impacted by lower plant dispatch, driven by depressed spot power prices that frequently fell below our cost to generate. For 2010, forward commodity markets imply a recovery of power and gas prices to levels that return our coal generation dispatch to levels that are more in line with historical results. For example, generation volumes in 2007 and 2008 were both slightly above 34 million megawatt-hours.To estimate unhedged entity revenues, we start with around the clock pricing at the PJM Western Hub. We then adjust this price to derive an estimated Bus bar price at our power plants. We realized energy price is primarily impacted by estimates of basis and shaping. The basis differential results from transmission constraints between our plants and the Western Hub. The premium for shaping accounts for the fact that our plants produce more output when prices are higher. A $223 million forecasted increase in unhedged energy margin is primarily due to an increase of $5 per megawatt-hour in forecasted realized energy prices and it's effect on dispatch, partially offset by increased fuel costs. Coal expense reflects the forecasted tons of coal burn at our delivered coal price. This includes coal a contracted prices and the estimated delivery cost of our small open coal position. We're estimating an increase in other fuel due to a full year of operations of the Hatfield scrubbers and increased pumping costs at our Bath County station, offset by a decrease in natural gas expense.$49 million increase in capacity is due to a $27 per megawatt-day increase in capacity prices. Operating expenses, primarily O&M and state and local taxes, will increase by about $5 million, and are subtracted from unhedged net revenues to get to unhedged EBITDA. So in summary, our unhedged EBITDA is better by $269 million, primarily due to an increase in generation prices and volume, as well as an increase in capacity revenues.Adjusted EBITDA is calculated on Slide 43 by starting with the unhedged EBITDA from the prior slide and adjusting for the impact of our power hedge position. These hedges include financial hedges, our West Penn POLR contract, which expires at the end of 2010 and other marketing contracts. The margin contribution on these hedges has contracted versus 2009, reducing our forecast of adjusted EBITDA by $277 million. Please note that the average contact price and contract market value include energy, capacity and ancillary services. The contract market value represents a replacement cost of these contracts as of December 31.Moving on to the next slide, we're showing additional information you might find useful in modeling our Merchant Generation business. The generation volumes shown on this slide are based upon market information and other factors as of December 31, 2009, and as mentioned earlier, will change every time we update our projections as forward market prices and other modeling inputs change. As previously noted, we intend to update this information on a quarterly basis. Coal prices and volumes reflect estimates for delivered coal. Capacity revenues reflect the actual results of PJM auctions, including supplemental auctions.On this slide, we're providing you with forward market pricing data as of December 31. This data is derived from different sources, and is used in our internal modeling. The coal prices are based on broker estimates, and do not include transportation costs and are not necessarily reflective of what we might pay the contract for coal at our plants. Slide 46 provides a high-level estimate of Merchant Generation's pretax income sensitivity to commodity price moves. These are simplified calculations, where each sensitivity is derived by holding all other variables constant. Everything we have shown you up to this point has been as of December 31. Since that time, supplies entered into some additional marketing contractors, which are summarize here. Moving on to Slide 48, utility operations. Keep in mind that consistent with our new segment reporting, we are including the Regulated Generation business of Mon Power in these results. Our estimates are virtually the same as our last call. EBITDA for utility operations is estimated to grow by $58 million. Please note here that the West Virginia rate case driver reflects the full amount requested in our case, and assumes that the increase is granted midyear. After adjusting for the effect of the Fort Martin securitization that we closed in December and recent adjustments due to supplemental tax information, we're requesting an annual increase of $106 million, of which about $40 million relates to full recovery of income tax expense.We expect to incur capital and operating cost in 2010 for Pennsylvania Act 129, and assume these costs will be passed onto customers in an annually adjusted surcharge. We'll earn a return on our investment that is expected to increase EBITDA by $11 million. Recovery of securitized interest and depreciation related to the Fort Martin scrubbers and the remaining West Penn securitization is being reflected at the EBITDA level. While this benefits EBITDA, it does not affect earnings, because there are offsetting impacts in depreciation and interest. Despite additional costs attributable to Fort Martin scrubber operations, O&M expenses that are not formulaically recovered are decreasing by $16 million, reflecting the company's cost reduction efforts. Finally, we have assumed here that the Virginia asset sale closes in the second quarter of 2010, which would reduce EBITDA by $29 million. There will also be offsetting effects of the sale on depreciation, interest and income tax expense. We estimate that after using the proceeds from the sale to reduce debt, the net effect of the sale on earnings will be flat year-to-year.Slide 49 shows estimated growth in rate base for the utility operations. Please note that these are estimates only, and our plans are always subject to change. Not included here are additional transmission investment opportunities that we've identified, some of which will be subject to the PJM planning process. A portion of these projects would be owned by our utility companies, and the remainder by our transmission expansion company. We intend to pursue regulatory approval for passthrough of these projects' cost. Assuming appropriate cost recovery, we expect to invest $600 million to $900 million in these projects in 2011 through 2014.Our transmission expansion EBITDA will continue to grow as we invest in the TrAIL and the PATH lines. TrAIL is expected to be in-service in mid-2011. And for purposes of this forecast, PATH is assumed to be in-service in 2016. We've reduced the estimate for our transmission expansion EBITDA, primarily because of reduced financing costs that will lower our revenue requirement. Decreased costs are due to lower than previously projected interest rates for TrAIL financing and the movement of estimated PATH capital expenditures to future periods. We are now projecting Allegheny share of spending for the transmission expansion business to be about $380 million for 2010.The rate base in our Transmission Expansion business is expected to grow to over $1.3 billion by 2014. We collect the return on this business as capital expenditures are made. At the consolidated level, depreciation expense will increase by $47 million in 2010, due primarily to the scrubbers going into service in 2009. Transmission expansions, Smart Meters installed pursuant to Pennsylvania Act 129 and Fort Martin scrubbers will increase depreciation but will not affect earnings, because these items are recovered through formulaic rates.The outlook for capital expenditures is reflected on Slide 53. Spending in the Merchant Generation business is expected to decline now that we have completed the Hatfield scrubbers. In utility operations, we expect to spend about $275 million in 2010 through 2011 for investments driven largely by Pennsylvania Act 129, subject to commission approval. Moving back to the income statement, 2010 current estimated interest expense for transmission is $34 million lower than our last call, primarily due to lower interest rates in our TrAIL financing and less financing needs for PATH for in 2010. Interest expense changes for transmission expansion will not affect earnings because it's recovered in formula rates. The Hatfield scrubbers have come online, and interest that was previously being capitalized will not be expensed.Throughout this presentation, we have focused on EBITDA for the three businesses. We expect O&M, excluding amounts recoverable under formulaic rate-making to be flat versus 2009. Finally, while not reflected here, we expect our effective tax rate 2010 to be about the same as our 2009 rate, which was 38%. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

So if you think back, 2008 was a pretty strong year on power price, but we had coal piles that were running down, so we put in a higher replacement. We don't bid our accounting cost for coal. So we bid in a higher economic value for the coal in 2008. And emissions costs were higher as well. Then you get to 2009, and we were bidding in more aggressive and lower cost, something much closer to what our accounting costs are. But power prices were very low. And in fact, too low to even dispatch on occasion. And now, you get to 2010, and power prices are up a bit, but we're also projecting the dispatch at lower cost for a number of reasons. Some of it is coal, some of it's emissions, some of it's the way we've adjusted some of the derating of the plants.

For the fourth quarter of 2009, adjusted results were $0.66 per share, compared to $0.51 in the prior year. Adjusted net income increased by $26 million. Both segments, Regulated Operations and Merchant Generation, contributed to the higher quarterly earnings. This breakout of segments is a little different than in the past. A new segment, Regulated Operations, now includes the generation of the Monongahela Power, which is our West Virginia regulated subsidiary, as well as transmission and distribution operations in all four states and our transmission expansion projects.Earnings from these regulated operations nearly doubled in the quarter, increasing from $19 million a year ago to $35 million. The improvement was largely due to increased recovery of purchased power cost in Virginia, thanks to the settlement approved by the commission in November 2008, and higher earnings from transmission expansion projects. This improvement was achieved despite lower megawatt-hour sales, which were down 6% from the comparable period last year. Weather was milder than normal, and milder than last year as well, contributing to reduced residential usage. Sales to industrial customers were down 11%, continuing the trend we've seen throughout 2009.At our Merchant Generation segment, we were hurt by weak demand and low natural gas and power prices. Both natural gas and power prices were down about 30% compared to a year ago. As a result, output was down 22% from last year's quarter, and our supercritical capacity factor dropped to a record low 58% in the quarter. Despite all of this, adjusted earnings in the Merchant Generation business went up by $10 million. Our hedges, including the Pennsylvania POLR contract and financial hedges, provided substantial protection from the decline in market prices, as they have throughout 2009. And earnings were further bolstered by higher capacity revenues, a gain on the purchase of two hydro facilities and a tax law change in Pennsylvania.Turning to plant reliability. Supercritical availability was 83% in the fourth quarter, down from 91% a year ago. Planned outages were up. We had four planned outage weeks in the quarter, as compared to virtually none in the same period a year ago. Unplanned outages due to equipment problems also hurt availability. For the full year 2009, adjusted earnings per share were $2.33, up slightly from a year ago. Improved cost recovery in Virginia increased revenues from our transmission expansion projects, and our favorable power hedges offset the adverse impacts of low power prices, weak demand and the recession.While the economy hurt us, we stayed focused on running our business well, and we accomplished a lot in many important areas. Let me review some of these achievements with you. First, safety. Our performance last year was outstanding on both sides of the business. At Allegheny Power, we posted the best safety performance in the history of the company, placing us in the top quartile. And in Generation, we saw a significant improvement, and now rank in the top decile in the industry. Second, we completed our scrubber construction projects on time and under budget. This $1.3 billion investment program added scrubbers to five supercritical units at two sites, Fort Martin and Hatfieldâ€™s Ferry. This will reduce our sulfur dioxide emissions from these plants by more than 95%. Our entire supercritical fleet is now scrubbed.Third, we focused intently on controlling costs and spending throughout the organization. We succeeded in holding operations and maintenance expenses flat. This is now the fourth year in a row we've held O&M flat, and we've done this while improving most measures of performance and maintaining high marks for customer satisfaction. Fourth, we maintained our investment-grade credit rating, and strengthened our financial condition and liquidity position. We refinanced $843 million of indebtedness, increased our credit facilities and extended maturities. And in December, we securitized the remaining Fort Martin scrubber cost. Fifth, we moved forward on our transmission expansion project, the Trans-Allegheny Interstate Line, or TrAIL. We remained on schedule for a June 2011 in-service. We have more than 90% of the right of way acquired, and significant progress has been made on the two substations. Construction of all segments of the line is underway, and we have about half of the tower foundation and around 40% of the towers themselves completed.Our other major transmission project, the Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline project, or PATH, however, has been delayed. PJM informed us at the end of December that their latest work indicates the line may not be needed in 2014 as planned. They'll set a new date when they complete their comprehensive planning process in June. Sixth, we made meaningful progress on a number of regulatory fronts. We settled in both West Virginia and Virginia on our fuel and purchased power recovery costs. We filed a base rate case in West Virginia during 2009. The commission staff subsequently filed a motion to delay the case, to give them more time to understand the tax selection that we are planning to make. This election is a result of the change in federal tax rules that allow us to deduct repair costs previously capitalized. It will create a cash flow benefit of about $120 million this year. And as a result, we won't be a cash taxpayer in 2010. We reached agreements with the parties in our case on a procedural schedule that sets evidentiary hearings in early April.Seventh, we launched several energy efficiency and conservation programs in Maryland and in Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania, a large portion of our residential program focuses on the installation of Smart Meter. Our implementation plan was filed with the public utility commission in August '09 and is still pending approval. We'll continue to work with the commission to move this forward in order to meet the requirements of Pennsylvania Act 129. And eighth and finally, our transmission to market-based rates in Pennsylvania continues to go smoothly, while Pennsylvania utility, West Penn Power, has now held four auctions to procure power for the period as the rate caps expire at the end of this year. In the most recent West Penn auction held last month, the average retail generation price was $62 per megawatt hour for residential customers. This includes energy, capacity, gross receipts, taxes and line losses. We now have 2/3 of next year's residential power under contract. Based on these results, residential customers would see an increase of 8.5% in their electric bills in January 2011. For small and mid-sized non-residential customers, the typical increase would be even less, 0.6% and 2.0% respectively, assuming similar results in future auctions.So overall, we made substantial progress in a number of fundamental areas in 2009. Before I discuss our 2010 priorities, let me give you an update on the status of our hedging program, including the success of our merchant generation unit in the recent POLR auctions. As I said on the last quarterly call, by the end of the given year, we want to have 80% to 90% of the next year's output hedged, 30% to 50% of the second year and up to 30% of the third year. As of year-end '09, we achieved those targets. But we stayed at the low end of these ranges to maintain our leverage to an economic recovery. Now in the January, last month West Penn auctioned. There were seven contracts awarded. Allegheny Energy Supply won three of them, for a total of about 1.25 million megawatt-hours. A Maryland utility, Potomac Edison, also conducted an auction in January, awarding six contracts. Allegheny Energy won one contract for $500,000 megawatt-hours. As of today, we now have hedged about 82% of our merchant output in '10, 33% '11 and 6% in '12.Turning now to our priorities for 2010. We're anticipating a slow economic recovery. So maintaining a strong financial position and solid liquidity remains a top priority for us. And we'll be vigilant in our efforts to control costs and spending. Our plan is to keep non-formulatic OEM flat, marking the fifth consecutive year of no increase in costs, an accomplishment I think few can match. Other priorities include keeping our TrAIL project on schedule for in-service in June of next year, resolving our West Virginia base case successfully, completing the sale of our Virginia territory and keeping our transition to market-based rates on track in Pennsylvania. And of course, we'll continue to monitor closely potential environmental legislation and regulations. With respect to climate change, I think the probability of a bill passing this year has been greatly diminished. We'll also be reviewing any new federal regulations regarding coal combustion byproducts including fly ash. We use predominantly dry landfills to store fly ash. We have no wet storage facilities of the type that failed at TVA, but we do own wet storage facilities of a different design at two of our locations Pleasants and R. Paul Smith. And both of these facilities are regularly inspected by federal and state agencies, as well as independent third parties.So in closing, I'd say 2009 was a tough year. We faced a long and deep recession that affected our businesses. We experienced low energy prices, both current and forward. And we had a capacity auction in May that hit our regions sharply. No one can feel good about these developments. But as I indicated earlier, we did make great progress on what we could control. We focused on keeping intact the fundamental drivers of long-term value, and we had an array of accomplishments during the year. We'll continue that focus in 2010. And we remain very well-positioned for strong growth when the economy recovers. For example, on an unhedged basis, a $10 change in realized energy prices in 2011 should increase pretax income by approximately $360 million, and we fully expect that power prices will increase over time. I thank you all for your interest and support. And now let to turn the call over to Kirk."

Adjusted e",2320,"Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported GAAP net income of $109 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $16 million a year ago. Earnings were $0.64 per share compared to $0.10 in the same period a year ago. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.66 per share, as compared to $0.51 per share for the same period last year. Adjusted earnings exclude net unrealized gains and losses associated with hedging activities and $13 million of expense associated with a debt tender offer. Last year's adjustments were primarily driven by unrealized losses associated with FTRs.Adjusted pretax earnings increased $17 million for the quarter, compared to the same period a year ago. I'd like to summarize some of the key factors that drove the increase. In our Merchant Generation business for the quarter, unhedged net revenues were worse by $76 million. This reflects lower volume and a reduction in realized energy prices, partially offset by a decrease in fuel costs. The decrease in unhedged net revenues was more than offset by a gain of $78 million in power hedge margin, which is the difference between our hedges' contract price and the estimated market value of the volumes hedged. An $11 per megawatt-hour improvement in the contribution from our power hedges more than offset an $11 decrease in realized energy prices. Merchant generation EBITDA above also includes a $17 million benefit from a gain on the purchase of a hydro facility and the cancellation of a related contract. You'll find details on the fourth quarter performance of Merchant Generation in the appendix.Our regulated operations benefited by $20 million, due to our 2008 settlement for recovery of Virginia purchase power. In addition, we continue to make progress on our transmission expansion projects, which increased EBITDA by $14 million quarter-over-quarter. Interest expense for the entire company was higher by $19 million. Of this amount, $9 million was primarily due to the fact that we stopped capitalizing interest costs when the Hatfield scrubbers went into service in 2009, and $9 million relates to an increase in average debt outstanding, of which $3 million is related to TrAIL, which has been formulaic recovery.Depreciation increased by $8 million, primarily due to the Hatfield scrubbers being placed in service. In total, adjusted pretax earnings were $17 million higher than the fourth quarter last year. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 30%, which compares to 40% for the same period a year ago. We benefited by $18 million in the fourth quarter 2009, due to a change in the Pennsylvania tax law that will allow us to recover a larger portion of our net operating loss carry-forward benefits in future years. This brings our effective tax rate in at 38% for the full-year 2009.Cash flow from operations was $329 million after adjusting for the tender offer premium payment in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $293 million for the quarter. Free cash flow netting the securitization proceeds used to fund the Fort Martin scrubbers and project financing for TrAIL was a positive $185 million for the quarter. Adjusting for the same items for the full year, we had positive free cash flow of $233 million. We'll go into more detail on 2010 later, but we expect the adjusted free cash flow before dividends for 2010 to be between $125 million to $175 million. We've completed several financings since our last call. Long Tower has completed an $86 million securitization, entered into a $110 million revolving credit facility and repaid $110 million medium-term note. In January, TrAILCo issued $450 million of 4% notes, and also entered into a $350 million revolving credit facility. As a result of these transactions, the company's liquidity profile continues to improve, with more than $2 billion of liquidity at year end. There are no other maturities in 2010 except for securitization amortizations.Now, let's turn to the outlook. As a reminder, for the Merchant Generation business, we are providing forward-looking information on hedging, generation output and other data that will facilitate modeling of the business. For the regulated businesses, we're providing some projections of rate base. Depreciation and interest expense are shown on a consolidated basis. Our estimates are based on forward power prices at December 31, which were $48 for 2010 at the western hub. Forward prices are subject to highly variable market factors outside of our control, and our estimates may change due to fluctuations in those prices and other factors. We're presenting our 2009 results, and estimated increase or decrease in pretax earnings in 2010 over 2009. We'll now go through the drivers of each of these line items.Since our last call, we've significantly revised our estimates for transmission expansion EBITDA and interest expense, which I'll address shortly. Moving to Slide 41, for merchant generation, we estimate 2010 EBITDA to be down slightly from last year. As the following slides will show, this is driven a contraction in the benefit of our power hedges, offset by growth in our unhedged energy margin and increased capacity revenues. Slide 42 summarizes among other things what we include in unhedged energy margin, the contribution of capacity, other revenues, including ancillaries and operating expenses bringing us down to unhedged EBITDA. Generation volumes are forecasted using an industry-standard dispatch model. Estimates of generation volume are based upon various inputs such as forward commodity prices, estimated cost and our expected planned outages. We are forecasting a significant increase in our generation volumes in 2010 relative to 2009. Our 2009 generation volumes were impacted by lower plant dispatch, driven by depressed spot power prices that frequently fell below our cost to generate. For 2010, forward commodity markets imply a recovery of power and gas prices to levels that return our coal generation dispatch to levels that are more in line with historical results. For example, generation volumes in 2007 and 2008 were both slightly above 34 million megawatt-hours.To estimate unhedged entity revenues, we start with around the clock pricing at the PJM Western Hub. We then adjust this price to derive an estimated Bus bar price at our power plants. The realized energy price is primarily impacted by estimates of basis and shaping. The basis differential results from transmission constraints between our plants and the Western Hub. The premium for shaping accounts for the fact that our plants produce more output when prices are higher. A $223 million forecasted increase in unhedged energy margin is primarily due to an increase of $5 per megawatt-hour in forecasted realized energy prices and its effect on dispatch, partially offset by increased fuel costs. Coal expense reflects the forecasted tons of coal burn at our delivered coal price. This includes coal at contracted prices and the estimated delivery costs of our small open coal position. We are estimating an increase in other fuels due to a full year of operations of the Hatfield scrubbers and increased pumping costs at our Bath County station, offset by a decrease in natural gas expense.$49 million increase in capacity is due to a $27 per megawatt-day increase in capacity prices. Operating expenses, primarily O&M and state and local taxes, will increase by about $5 million, and are subtracted from unhedged net revenues to get to unhedged EBITDA. So in summary, our unhedged EBITDA is better by $269 million, primarily due to an increase in generation prices and volume, as well as an increase in capacity revenues.Adjusted EBITDA is calculated on Slide 43 by starting with the unhedged EBITDA from the prior slide and adjusting for the impact of our power hedge position. These hedges include financial hedges, our West Penn POLR contract, which expires at the end of 2010 and other marketing contracts. The margin contribution on these hedges has contracted versus 2009, reducing our forecast of adjusted EBITDA by $277 million. Please note that the average contact price and contract market value include energy, capacity and ancillary services. The contract market value represents a replacement cost of these contracts as of December 31.Moving on to the next slide, we're showing additional information you might find useful in modeling our Merchant Generation business. The generation volumes shown on this slide are based upon market information and other factors as of December 31, 2009, and as mentioned earlier, will change every time we update our projections as forward market prices and other modeling inputs change. As previously noted, we intend to update this information on a quarterly basis. Coal prices and volumes reflect estimates for delivered coal. Capacity revenues reflect the actual results of PJM auctions, including supplemental auctions.On this slide, we're providing you with forward market pricing data as of December 31. This data is derived from different sources, and is used in our internal modeling. The coal prices are based on broker estimates, and do not include transportation costs and are not necessarily reflective of what we might pay the contract for coal at our plants. Slide 46 provides a high-level estimate of Merchant Generation's pretax income sensitivity to commodity price moves. These are simplified calculations, where each sensitivity is derived by holding all other variables constant. Everything we have shown you up to this point has been as of December 31. Since that time, supplies entered into some additional marketing contractors, which are summarize here. Moving on to Slide 48, utility operations. Keep in mind that consistent with our new segment reporting, we are including the Regulated Generation business of Mon Power in these results. Our estimates are virtually the same as our last call. EBITDA for utility operations is estimated to grow by $58 million. Please note here that the West Virginia rate case driver reflects the full amount requested in our case, and assumes that the increase is granted midyear. After adjusting for the effect of the Fort Martin securitization that we closed in December and recent adjustments due to supplemental tax information, we're requesting an annual increase of $106 million, of which about $40 million relates to full recovery of income tax expense.We expect to incur capital and operating cost in 2010 for Pennsylvania Act 129, and assume these costs will be passed onto customers in an annually adjusted surcharge. We'll earn a return on our investment that is expected to increase EBITDA by $11 million. Recovery of securitized interest and depreciation related to the Fort Martin scrubbers and the remaining West Penn securitization is being reflected at the EBITDA level. While this benefits EBITDA, it does not affect earnings, because there are offsetting impacts in depreciation and interest. Despite additional costs attributable to Fort Martin scrubber operations, O&M expenses that are not formulaically recovered are decreasing by $16 million, reflecting the company's cost reduction efforts. Finally, we have assumed here that the Virginia asset sale closes in the second quarter of 2010, which would reduce EBITDA by $29 million. There will also be offsetting effects of the sale on depreciation, interest and income tax expense. We estimate that after using the proceeds from the sale to reduce debt, the net effect of the sale on earnings will be flat year-to-year.Slide 49 shows estimated growth in rate base for the utility operations. Please note that these are estimates only, and our plans are always subject to change. Not included here are additional transmission investment opportunities that we've identified, some of which will be subject to the PJM planning process. A portion of these projects would be owned by our utility companies, and the remainder by our transmission expansion company. We intend to pursue regulatory approval for pass through of these projects' cost. Assuming appropriate cost recovery, we expect to invest $600 million to $900 million in these projects in 2011 through 2014.Our transmission expansion EBITDA will continue to grow as we invest in the TrAIL and the PATH lines. TrAIL is expected to be in-service in mid-2011. And for purposes of this forecast, PATH is assumed to be in-service in 2016. We've reduced the estimate for our transmission expansion EBITDA, primarily because of reduced financing costs that will lower our revenue requirement. Decreased costs are due to lower than previously projected interest rates for TrAIL financing and the movement of estimated PATH capital expenditures to future periods. We are now projecting Allegheny share of spending for the transmission expansion business to be about $380 million for 2010.The rate base in our Transmission Expansion business is expected to grow to over $1.3 billion by 2014. We collect the return on this business as capital expenditures are made. At the consolidated level, depreciation expense will increase by $47 million in 2010, due primarily to the scrubbers going into service in 2009. Transmission expansions, Smart Meters installed pursuant to Pennsylvania Act 129 and Fort Martin scrubbers will increase depreciation but will not affect earnings, because these items are recovered through formulaic rates.The outlook for capital expenditures is reflected on Slide 53. Spending in the Merchant Generation business is expected to decline now that we have completed the Hatfield scrubbers. In utility operations, we expect to spend about $275 million in 2010 through 2011 for investments driven largely by Pennsylvania Act 129, subject to commission approval. Moving back to the income statement, 2010 current estimated interest expense for transmission is $34 million lower than our last call, primarily due to lower interest rates in our TrAIL financing and less financing needs for PATH for in 2010. Interest expense changes for transmission expansion will not affect earnings because it's recovered in formula rates. The Hatfield scrubbers have come online, and interest that was previously being capitalized will not be expensed.Throughout this presentation, we have focused on EBITDA for the three businesses. We expect O&M, excluding amounts recoverable under formulaic rate-making to be flat versus 2009. Finally, while not reflected here, we expect our effective tax rate 2010 to be about the same as our 2009 rate, which was 38%. With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

So if you think back, 2008 was a pretty strong year on power price, but we had coal piles that were running down, so we put in a higher replacement. We don't bid our accounting cost for coal. So we bid in a higher economic value for the coal in 2008. And emissions costs were higher as well. Then you get to 2009, and we were bidding in more aggressive and lower cost, something much closer to what our accounting costs are. But power prices were very low. And in fact, too low to even dispatch on occasion. And now, you get to 2010, and power prices are up a bit, but we're also projecting the dispatch at lower cost for a number of reasons. Some of it is coal, some of it's emissions, some of it's the way we've adjusted some of the derating of the plants. So we have a little bit slower dispatch cost and a little bit higher expected realized price, then that's would results basically and output being up."

We can tell you that our gas plants dispatch quite a bit more during the quarter than what you might typically see, but we can't. I think in the back of the earnings release, we have some capacity factor information. Could you go to the second to the last page of the press release? You can see our supercritical capacity factor was like 58%, down from 78% in the prior year. And if you look at gas, you can see that the gas -- we don't have the capacity factor but you can see the gas output is 321,000 megawatt hours versus 44,000 in the prior period, up over 600%. So clearly, there's some gas displacement of coal. And as prices move up and gas prices move up, which the forwards implied they will do next year, we would expect to see a lot of that turn around."

For the fourth quarter of 2009, adjusted results were $0.66 per share, compared to $0.51 in the prior year. Adjusted net income increased by $26 million.Both segments, Regulated Operations and Merchant Generation, contributed to the higher quarterly earnings. This breakout of segments is a little different than in the past. A new segment, Regulated Operations, now includes the generation of the Monongahela Power, which is our West Virginia regulated subsidiary, as well as transmission and distribution operations in all four states and our transmission expansion projects.Earnings from these regulated operations nearly doubled in the quarter, increasing from $19 million a year ago to $35 million. The improvement was largely due to increased recovery of purchased power cost in Virginia, thanks to the settlement approved by the commission in November 2008, and higher earnings from transmission expansion projects.This improvement was achieved despite lower megawatt-hour sales, which were down 6% from the comparable period last year. Weather was milder than normal, and milder than last year as well, contributing to reduced residential usage. Sales to industrial customers were down 11%, continuing the trend we've seen throughout 2009.At our Merchant Generation segment, we were hurt by weak demand and low natural gas and power prices. Both natural gas and power prices were down about 30% compared to a year ago. As a result, output was down 22% from last year's quarter, and our supercritical capacity factor dropped to a record low 58% in the quarter.Despite all of this, adjusted earnings in the Merchant Generation business went up by $10 million. Our hedges, including the Pennsylvania POLR contract and financial hedges, provided substantial protection from the decline in market prices, as they have throughout 2009. And earnings were further bolstered by higher capacity revenues, a gain on the purchase of two hydro facilities and a tax law change in Pennsylvania.Turning to plant reliability. Supercritical availability was 83% in the fourth quarter, down from 91% a year ago. Planned outages were up. We had four planned outage weeks in the quarter, as compared to virtually none in the same period a year ago. Unplanned outages due to equipment problems also hurt availability. For the full year 2009, adjusted earnings per share were $2.33, up slightly from a year ago. Improved cost recovery in Virginia increased revenues from our transmission expansion projects, and our favorable power hedges offset the adverse impacts of low power prices, weak demand and the recession.While the economy hurt us, we stayed focused on running our business well, and we accomplished a lot in many important areas. Let me review some of these achievements with you. First, safety. Our performance last year was outstanding on both sides of the business. At Allegheny Power, we posted the best safety performance in the history of the company, placing us in the top quartile. And in Generation, we saw a significant improvement, and now rank in the top decile in the industry.Second, we completed our scrubber construction projects on time and under budget. This $1.3 billion investment program added scrubbers to five supercritical units at two sites, Fort Martin and Hatfieldâ€™s Ferry. This will reduce our sulfur dioxide emissions from these plants by more than 95%. Our entire supercritical fleet is now scrubbed.Third, we focused intently on controlling costs and spending throughout the organization. We succeeded in holding operations and maintenance expenses flat. This is now the fourth year in a row we've held O&M flat, and we've done this while improving most measures of performance and maintaining high marks for customer satisfaction.Fourth, we maintained our investment-grade credit rating, and strengthened our financial condition and liquidity position. We refinanced $843 million of indebtedness, increased our credit facilities and extended maturities. And in December, we securitized the remaining Fort Martin scrubber cost.Fifth, we moved forward on our transmission expansion project, the Trans-Allegheny Interstate Line, or TrAIL. We remained on schedule for a June 2011 in-service. We have more than 90% of the right of way acquired, and significant progress has been made on the two substations. Construction of all segments of the line is underway, and we have about half of the tower foundation and around 40% of the towers themselves completed.Our other major transmission project, the Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline project, or PATH, however, has been delayed. PJM informed us at the end of December that their latest work indicates the line may not be needed in 2014 as planned. They'll set a new date when they complete their comprehensive planning process in June.Sixth, we made meaningful progress on a number of regulatory fronts. We settled in both West Virginia and Virginia on our fuel and purchased power recovery costs. We filed a base rate case in West Virginia during 2009. The commission staff subsequently filed a motion to delay the case, to give them more time to understand the tax selection that we are planning to make.This election is a result of the change in federal tax rules that allow us to deduct repair costs previously capitalized. It will create a cash flow benefit of about $120 million this year. And as a result, we won't be a cash taxpayer in 2010. We reached agreements with the parties in our case on a procedural schedule that sets evidentiary hearings in early April.Seventh, we launched several energy efficiency and conservation programs in Maryland and in Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania, a large portion of our residential program focuses on the installation of Smart Meter. Our implementation plan was filed with the public utility commission in August '09 and is still pending approval. We'll continue to work with the commission to move this forward in order to meet the requirements of Pennsylvania Act 129.And eighth and finally, our transmission to market-based rates in Pennsylvania continues to go smoothly, while Pennsylvania utility, West Penn Power, has now held four auctions to procure power for the period as the rate caps expire at the end of this year. In the most recent West Penn auction held last month, the average retail generation price was $62 per megawatt hour for residential customers. This includes energy, capacity, gross receipts, taxes and line losses. We now have 2/3 of next year's residential power under contract. Based on these results, residential customers would see an increase of 8.5% in their electric bills in January 2011. For small and mid-sized non-residential customers, the typical increase would be even less, 0.6% and 2.0% respectively, assuming similar results in future auctions.So overall, we made substantial progress in a number of fundamental areas in 2009. Before I discuss our 2010 priorities, let me give you an update on the status of our hedging program, including the success of our merchant generation unit in the recent POLR auctions.As I said on the last quarterly call, by the end of the given year, we want to have 80% to 90% of the next year's output hedged, 30% to 50% of the second year and up to 30% of the third year. As of year-end '09, we achieved those targets. But we stayed at the low end of these ranges to maintain our leverage to an economic recovery.Now in the January, last month West Penn auctioned. There were seven contracts awarded. Allegheny Energy Supply won three of them, for a total of about 1.25 million megawatt-hours. A Maryland utility, Potomac Edison, also conducted an auction in January, awarding six contracts. Allegheny Energy won one contract for $500,000 megawatt-hours. As of today, we now have hedged about 82% of our merchant output in '10, 33% '11 and 6% in '12.Turning now to our priorities for 2010. We're anticipating a slow economic recovery. So maintaining a strong financial position and solid liquidity remains a top priority for us. And we'll be vigilant in our efforts to control costs and spending. Our plan is to keep non-formulatic OEM flat, marking the fifth consecutive year of no increase in costs, an accomplishment I think few can match.Other priorities include keeping our TrAIL project on schedule for in-service in June of next year, resolving our West Virginia base case successfully, completing the sale of our Virginia territory and keeping our transition to market-based rates on track in Pennsylvania. And of course, we'll continue to monitor closely potential environmental legislation and regulations.With respect to climate change, I think the probability of a bill passing this year has been greatly diminished. We'll also be reviewing any new federal regulations regarding coal combustion byproducts including fly ash. We use predominantly dry landfills to store fly ash. We have no wet storage facilities of the type that failed at TVA, but we do own wet storage facilities of a different design at two of our locations Pleasants and R. Paul Smith. And both of these facilities are regularly inspected by federal and state agencies, as well as independent third parties.So in closing, I'd say 2009 was a tough year. We faced a long and deep recession that affected our businesses. We experienced low energy prices, both current and forward. And we had a capacity auction in May that hit our regions sharply. No one can feel good about these developments.But as I indicated earlier, we did make great progress on what we could control. We focused on keeping intact the fundamental drivers of long-term value, and we had an array of accomplishments during the year. We'll continue that focus in 2010. And we remain very well-positioned for strong growth when the economy recovers.For example, on an unhedged basis, a $10 change in realized energy prices in 2011 should increase pretax income by approximately $360 million, and we fully expect that power prices will increase over time. I thank you all for your interest and support. And now let to turn the call over to Kirk."

Adjusted e",2304,"Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we reported GAAP net income of $109 million for the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to $16 million a year ago. Earnings were $0.64 per share compared to $0.10 in the same period a year ago. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.66 per share, as compared to $0.51 per share for the same period last year. Adjusted earnings exclude net unrealized gains and losses associated with hedging activities and $13 million of expense associated with a debt tender offer. Last year's adjustments were primarily driven by unrealized losses associated with FTRs.Adjusted pretax earnings increased $17 million for the quarter, compared to the same period a year ago. I'd like to summarize some of the key factors that drove the increase. In our Merchant Generation business for the quarter, unhedged net revenues were worse by $76 million. This reflects lower volume and a reduction in realized energy prices, partially offset by a decrease in fuel costs. The decrease in unhedged net revenues was more than offset by a gain of $78 million in power hedge margin, which is the difference between our hedges' contract price and the estimated market value of the volumes hedged. An $11 per megawatt-hour improvement in the contribution from our power hedges more than offset an $11 decrease in realized energy prices. Merchant generation EBITDA above also includes a $17 million benefit from a gain on the purchase of a hydro facility and the cancellation of a related contract. You'll find details on the fourth quarter performance of Merchant Generation in the appendix.Our regulated operations benefited by $20 million, due to our 2008 settlement for recovery of Virginia purchase power. In addition, we continue to make progress on our transmission expansion projects, which increased EBITDA by $14 million quarter-over-quarter.Interest expense for the entire company was higher by $19 million. Of this amount, $9 million was primarily due to the fact that we stopped capitalizing interest costs when the Hatfield scrubbers went into service in 2009, and $9 million relates to an increase in average debt outstanding, of which $3 million is related to TrAIL, which has been formulaic recovery.Depreciation increased by $8 million, primarily due to the Hatfield scrubbers being placed in service. In total, adjusted pretax earnings were $17 million higher than the fourth quarter last year.Our effective tax rate this quarter was 30%, which compares to 40% for the same period a year ago. We benefited by $18 million in the fourth quarter 2009, due to a change in the Pennsylvania tax law that will allow us to recover a larger portion of our net operating loss carry-forward benefits in future years. This brings our effective tax rate in at 38% for the full-year 2009.Cash flow from operations was $329 million after adjusting for the tender offer premium payment in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $293 million for the quarter. Free cash flow netting the securitization proceeds used to fund the Fort Martin scrubbers and project financing for TrAIL was a positive $185 million for the quarter.Adjusting for the same items for the full year, we had positive free cash flow of $233 million. We'll go into more detail on 2010 later, but we expect the adjusted free cash flow before dividends for 2010 to be between $125 million to $175 million.We've completed several financings since our last call. Long Tower has completed an $86 million securitization, entered into a $110 million revolving credit facility and repaid $110 million medium-term note. In January, TrAILCo issued $450 million of 4% notes, and also entered into a $350 million revolving credit facility. As a result of these transactions, the company's liquidity profile continues to improve, with more than $2 billion of liquidity at year end. There are no other maturities in 2010 except for securitization amortizations.Now, let's turn to the outlook. As a reminder, for the Merchant Generation business, we are providing forward-looking information on hedging, generation output and other data that will facilitate modeling of the business. For the regulated businesses, we're providing some projections of rate base.Depreciation and interest expense are shown on a consolidated basis. Our estimates are based on forward power prices at December 31, which were $48 for 2010 at the western hub. Forward prices are subject to highly variable market factors outside of our control, and our estimates may change due to fluctuations in those prices and other factors. We're presenting our 2009 results, and estimated increase or decrease in pretax earnings in 2010 over 2009. We'll now go through the drivers of each of these line items.Since our last call, we've significantly revised our estimates for transmission expansion EBITDA and interest expense, which I'll address shortly. Moving to Slide 41, for merchant generation, we estimate 2010 EBITDA to be down slightly from last year. As the following slides will show, this is driven a contraction in the benefit of our power hedges, offset by growth in our unhedged energy margin and increased capacity revenues.Slide 42 summarizes among other things what we include in unhedged energy margin, the contribution of capacity, other revenues, including ancillaries and operating expenses bringing us down to unhedged EBITDA. Generation volumes are forecasted using an industry-standard dispatch model. Estimates of generation volume are based upon various inputs such as forward commodity prices, estimated cost and our expected planned outages.We are forecasting a significant increase in our generation volumes in 2010 relative to 2009. Our 2009 generation volumes were impacted by lower plant dispatch, driven by depressed spot power prices that frequently fell below our cost to generate. For 2010, forward commodity markets imply a recovery of power and gas prices to levels that return our coal generation dispatch to levels that are more in line with historical results. For example, generation volumes in 2007 and 2008 were both slightly above 34 million megawatt-hours.To estimate unhedged entity revenues, we start with around the clock pricing at the PJM Western Hub. We then adjust this price to derive an estimated Bus bar price at our power plants. The realized energy price is primarily impacted by estimates of basis and shaping. The basis differential results from transmission constraints between our plants and the Western Hub. The premium for shaping accounts for the fact that our plants produce more output when prices are higher.A $223 million forecasted increase in unhedged energy margin is primarily due to an increase of $5 per megawatt-hour in forecasted realized energy prices and its effect on dispatch, partially offset by increased fuel costs. Coal expense reflects the forecasted tons of coal burn at our delivered coal price. This includes coal at contracted prices and the estimated delivery costs of our small open coal position. We are estimating an increase in other fuels due to a full year of operations of the Hatfield scrubbers and increased pumping costs at our Bath County station, offset by a decrease in natural gas expense.$49 million increase in capacity is due to a $27 per megawatt-day increase in capacity prices. Operating expenses, primarily O&M and state and local taxes, will increase by about $5 million, and are subtracted from unhedged net revenues to get to unhedged EBITDA. So in summary, our unhedged EBITDA is better by $269 million, primarily due to an increase in generation prices and volume, as well as an increase in capacity revenues.Adjusted EBITDA is calculated on Slide 43 by starting with the unhedged EBITDA from the prior slide and adjusting for the impact of our power hedge position. These hedges include financial hedges, our West Penn POLR contract, which expires at the end of 2010 and other marketing contracts.Themargin contribution on these hedges has contracted versus 2009, reducing our forecast of adjusted EBITDA by $277 million. Please note that the average contact price and contract market value include energy, capacity and ancillary services. The contract market value represents a replacement cost of these contracts as of December 31.Moving on to the next slide, we're showing additional information you might find useful in modeling our Merchant Generation business. The generation volumes shown on this slide are based upon market information and other factors as of December 31, 2009, and as mentioned earlier, will change every time we update our projections as forward market prices and other modeling inputs change. As previously noted, we intend to update this information on a quarterly basis. Coal prices and volumes reflect estimates for delivered coal. Capacity revenues reflect the actual results of PJM auctions, including supplemental auctions.On this slide, we're providing you with forward market pricing data as of December 31. This data is derived from different sources, and is used in our internal modeling. The coal prices are based on broker estimates, and do not include transportation costs and are not necessarily reflective of what we might pay the contract for coal at our plants.Slide 46 provides a high-level estimate of Merchant Generation's pretax income sensitivity to commodity price moves. These are simplified calculations, where each sensitivity is derived by holding all other variables constant. Everything we have shown you up to this point has been as of December 31. Since that time, supplies entered into some additional marketing contractors, which are summarize here.Moving on to Slide 48, utility operations. Keep in mind that consistent with our new segment reporting, we are including the Regulated Generation business of Mon Power in these results. Our estimates are virtually the same as our last call. EBITDA for utility operations is estimated to grow by $58 million. Please note here that the West Virginia rate case driver reflects the full amount requested in our case, and assumes that the increase is granted midyear. After adjusting for the effect of the Fort Martin securitization that we closed in December and recent adjustments due to supplemental tax information, we're requesting an annual increase of $106 million, of which about $40 million relates to full recovery of income tax expense.We expect to incur capital and operating cost in 2010 for Pennsylvania Act 129, and assume these costs will be passed onto customers in an annually adjusted surcharge. We'll earn a return on our investment that is expected to increase EBITDA by $11 million.Recovery of securitized interest and depreciation related to the Fort Martin scrubbers and the remaining West Penn securitization is being reflected at the EBITDA level. While this benefits EBITDA, it does not affect earnings, because there are offsetting impacts in depreciation and interest.Despite additional costs attributable to Fort Martin scrubber operations, O&M expenses that are not formulaically recovered are decreasing by $16 million, reflecting the company's cost reduction efforts. Finally, we have assumed here that the Virginia asset sale closes in the second quarter of 2010, which would reduce EBITDA by $29 million. There will also be offsetting effects of the sale on depreciation, interest and income tax expense. We estimate that after using the proceeds from the sale to reduce debt, the net effect of the sale on earnings will be flat year-to-year.Slide 49 shows estimated growth in rate base for the utility operations. Please note that these are estimates only, and our plans are always subject to change. Not included here are additional transmission investment opportunities that we've identified, some of which will be subject to the PJM planning process.A portion of these projects would be owned by our utility companies, and the remainder by our transmission expansion company. We intend to pursue regulatory approval for pass through of these projects' cost. Assuming appropriate cost recovery, we expect to invest $600 million to $900 million in these projects in 2011 through 2014.Our transmission expansion EBITDA will continue to grow as we invest in the TrAIL and the PATH lines. TrAIL is expected to be in-service in mid-2011. And for purposes of this forecast, PATH is assumed to be in-service in 2016. We've reduced the estimate for our transmission expansion EBITDA, primarily because of reduced financing costs that will lower our revenue requirement. Decreased costs are due to lower than previously projected interest rates for TrAIL financing and the movement of estimated PATH capital expenditures to future periods. We are now projecting Allegheny share of spending for the transmission expansion business to be about $380 million for 2010.The rate base in our Transmission Expansion business is expected to grow to over $1.3 billion by 2014. We collect the return on this business as capital expenditures are made. At the consolidated level, depreciation expense will increase by $47 million in 2010, due primarily to the scrubbers going into service in 2009. Transmission expansions, Smart Meters installed pursuant to Pennsylvania Act 129 and Fort Martin scrubbers will increase depreciation but will not affect earnings, because these items are recovered through formulaic rates.The outlook for capital expenditures is reflected on Slide 53. Spending in the Merchant Generation business is expected to decline now that we have completed the Hatfield scrubbers. In utility operations, we expect to spend about $275 million in 2010 through 2011 for investments driven largely by Pennsylvania Act 129, subject to commission approval.Moving back to the income statement, 2010 current estimated interest expense for transmission is $34 million lower than our last call, primarily due to lower interest rates in our TrAIL financing and less financing needs for PATH for in 2010. Interest expense changes for transmission expansion will not affect earnings because it's recovered in formula rates. The Hatfield scrubbers have come online, and interest that was previously being capitalized will not be expensed.Throughout this presentation, we have focused on EBITDA for the three businesses.

So if you think back, 2008 was a pretty strong year on power price, but we had coal piles that were running down, so we put in a higher replacement. We don't bid our accounting cost for coal. So we bid in a higher economic value for the coal in 2008. And emissions costs were higher as well. Then you get to 2009, and we were bidding in more aggressive and lower cost, something much closer to what our accounting costs are. But power prices were very low. And in fact, too low to even dispatch on occasion. And now, you get to 2010, and power prices are up a bit, but we're also projecting the dispatch at lower cost for a number of reasons. Some of it is coal, some of it's emissions, some of it's the way we've adjusted some of the derating of the plants.

Today, we reported that adjusted earnings, excluding costs related to our proposed merger with FirstEnergy and unrealized losses on hedges, were $103 million or $0.61 per sha",1158,"Good afternoon, everyone, and I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today. Today, we reported that adjusted earnings, excluding costs related to our proposed merger with FirstEnergy and unrealized losses on hedges, were $103 million or $0.61 per share. 
Both our Merchant Generation and Regulated Operations  earned a solid profit, but earnings were down due to storm-related costs. 
The snowstorms that struck our territory in early February required the largest service restoration in the company's history. Nearly one out of every three of our customers lost power, and this cost us nearly $30 million pretax or about $0.11 per share. 
Turning aside the storm costs, our regulated operations had a good quarter, due in large part to higher revenues from our transmission expansion. Retail sales were up 2.3%, the first year-over-year increase in megawatt-hour sales in two years. Sales to industrial customers were up even more, increasing almost 6% versus the same period last year. We're pleased to see these signs of an economic recovery. 
In the Merchant Generation segment, our supercritical plant availability and capacity factors improved over the first quarter of last year. However, the segment reported a decrease in net income, due in large part to interest and depreciation on the new scrubbers at the Hatfield plant. 
The continuing decline in power prices was largely offset by our hedges. We're now 87% hedged for 2010, 47% in 2011 and 16% in 2012, all of which are consistent with the targets we've communicated in the past. That is, by the end of a given year, we want to have hedged 80% to 90% of next year's output, 30% to 50% of year two and 0% to 30% of year three. 
We remained on track for a smooth transition to market base rates in Pennsylvania, where our rate caps expire at the end of this year. Our regulated business has already contracted for 2/3 of the power needed to serve residential customers and nearly 50% to serve small and medium commercial and industrial customers for the full year 2011. The next option to procure generation will be held later this month and results should be announced by May 21. And another auction for a substantially larger block will be held in October.
Turning now to other priorities for the year. The 500-kilovolt Trans-Allegheny Interstate Line, or TrAIL, remains on schedule for in-service in June 2011. Nearly 60% of the towers have been constructed and about 20% of the wire has been installed. In mid-April, we energized a new Pennsylvania 502 Junction substation where TrAIL will interconnect with several existing transmission lines. 
Regarding our second transmission project, the Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline, or PATH, PJM is expected to announce the revised in-service date at the completion of its Regional Transmission Expansion Planning or RTEP process in June. On the sale of the Virginia distribution territory, we reached a settlement agreement with most of the parties last week. The original contract price of the sale was approximately $340 million, and we agreed to contribute $62.5 million over a four-year period to help reduce rates for customers. The settlement still requires approval by the Virginia Commission, and we now expect the closing by the middle of the year. 
In West Virginia, we also reached a settlement agreement with the staff, consumer advocate and other parties for a base rate increase of $60 million, $40 million of which will be effective on June 29 of this year and the balance of $20 million will be effective on June 1, 2011. Also, our current rates for fuel and purchased power cost recovery will decrease on January 1, 2011 by $20 million. But this amount will be recovered in future filings, so there's no impact on earnings. We expect the Public Service Commission to issue an order on the settlement by the end of June.
In other regulatory developments, we are re-evaluating our plan in Pennsylvania that emphasize the installation of smart meters to meet the energy conservation and demand management requirements of Act 129. Our original plan necessitated significant expenditures associated with advanced metering and its related customer information systems. 
As part of the merger integration process, we have been looking at FirstEnergy's Act 129 plan, which was recently approved by the commission and which relies much less on smart meters in the early years. We now hope to develop a less-costly program that will still allow us to meet the necessary reductions. This remains a work in progress.  Of course, our top priority for the year is to work towards approval for the merger we announced with FirstEnergy in early February. This merger should significantly enhance value for Allegheny shareholders. 
First, our shareholders will receive a significant premium, more than 30% based on the stock prices of both companies when the merger was announced. And shareholders will receive a dividend increase of almost 150% based on FirstEnergy's current dividend payout.  Second, and very importantly, combining with FirstEnergy will diversify our fuel mix by adding significant nuclear capacity, something we couldn't have done on our own given our size and capabilities. And furthermore, the combination with FirstEnergy provides greater operational scale and scope. 
Our contiguous service territories make a perfect fit. We'll be a major player in distribution, transmission and generation, with 24,000 megawatts of generating capacity, most of which merchant. With increased size should come increased efficiencies of all kinds. Also, we expect the combined company will have a solid balance sheet and strong operating cash flows. It will have the financial strength and capital to invest in core business initiatives and growth opportunities, and the company will retain upside leverage to a future increase in power prices. 
As for the approval process, the preliminary S-4 Registration Statement has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Special shareholder meetings through each company are likely to take place in the third quarter. This month, we should be filing for approval with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, followed by filings in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Maryland and then later in Virginia. Based on this timetable, we expect to complete the merger sometime in the first half of 2011. 
While we work on the filing, the integration teams from both companies have kicked off their efforts, and FirstEnergy's CEO Tony Alexander and I have been visiting stakeholders throughout our service territories. These meetings have generally been positive and constructive. 
As with any transaction of this kind, however, issues will emerge along the way, but I'm confident we can work through those issues and bring the merger to a successful completion. Until then, we continue to operate our business as usual, that is, focusing on our core generation and regulated operations and executing on our goals and objectives for the year. In doing that, we'll keep the fundamental drivers of our long-term value intact and remain positioned for strong growth in the future.  Now let me turn the call over to Kirk."
249126,100671297,59924,"Allegheny Energy Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 05, 2010",2010-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Allegheny Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. As Paul has already discussed, adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $0.61 per share as compared to $0.67 per share for the first quarter of last year. This is not adjusted for the effect of February s",1837,"Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. As Paul has already discussed, adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $0.61 per share as compared to $0.67 per share for the first quarter of last year. This is not adjusted for the effect of February storms, which reduced 2010 earnings by $0.11 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude net unrealized losses associated with hedging activities and $13 million of expense associated with the proposed merger with FirstEnergy. 
Adjusted pretax earnings decreased by $34 million in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. EBITDA for merchant generation was flat compared to the first quarter last year. Unhedged net revenue decreased but was offset by an improvement in our power hedge margin. You'll find details in the Appendix, but let me give you an overview of what drove these items.
Unhedged net revenue decreased by $15 million due to lower realized prices and higher fuel expense, which was partially offset by an increase in capacity revenue. Our power hedge margin improved by $16 million. Power hedge margin compares the average contract price on our hedges to the current period cost of serving those contracts, including the cost of energy, capacity, ancillary services and congestion. 
Regulated operations benefited from the continued progress on our transmission expansion projects, and as Paul has mentioned, the increase in load, which we've seen across all customer classes. However, these benefits were offset by the increased operating costs we incurred for restoration efforts during the February storms. We expensed $29 million for storm a restoration costs this quarter versus $9 million in the first quarter of last year. As a point of reference, our storm costs historically have averaged around $14 million per year. 
Operating expenses included a non-recurring charge of $10 million related to employee benefits. This charge affected both segments. Both interest and depreciation expense were consistent with our expectations. Interest expense for the entire company was higher by $20 million. About $11 million was due to the fact that we stopped capitalizing interest cost on certain projects that went into service in 2009, principally the Hatfield Scrubber Project. Another $6 million relates to financing for transmission expansion, which is recovered in rates. Depreciation expense increased by $11 million, primarily due to the Hatfield and Fort Martin scrubbers being placed in service. 
Moving on to the next slide, our effective tax rate improved for the quarter due to the $9.5 million charge that we took in 2009 for a change in the valuation of our Pennsylvania net operating loss carryforward.  Cash flow from operations excluding merger costs was $185 million. This was a $178 million improvement over the first quarter of 2009, where we were negatively impacted by changes in collateral obligations, coal inventories and West Virginia deferred energy costs. 
Capital expenditures were $268 million. Free cash flow, netting the securitization proceeds used to fund the Fort Martin scrubbers and financing for TrAIL, was a positive $5 million for the quarter. In aggregate, our current liquidity including cash on hand totals more than $2 billion. 
There are no remaining debt maturities in 2010 except for securitization and amortizations. We've completed several financings this year to better align the capital structure to the individual businesses. Notably, TrAILCo received an investment-grade rating and refinanced its construction credit facility by issuing medium-term notes and entering into a new credit facility.
Now let's turn to the outlook. This slide summarizes our most recent estimate of the changes from last year in EBITDA for each of the businesses and for consolidated depreciation and interest expense. We'll now go through the drivers of each of these line items.
Moving to Slide 32, for Merchant Generation, we estimate a $55 million decrease in 2010 EBITDA, which is a $46 million decrease from our estimate on the last call. Our estimates are based on, among other things, forward power prices at March 31, 2010. 
For the full year 2010, we are using a PJM Western Hub energy price of $40 per megawatt-hour, which is a combination of three months actual and nine months of forwards. You may recall that on our last call, our estimates were based on forward prices of $48 per megawatt-hour for 2010.  The decrease in our projected merchant generation result is consistent with the downward price trend for commodities. 
Forward prices are subject to highly-variable market factors outside of our control, and our estimates will continue to change due to fluctuations in those prices and other factors. Since our last call, the decrease in forward energy prices has resulted in a projected decline in unhedged energy margin of $220 million and resulted in an increase in power hedge margin of $178 million.
Turning to Slide 33, we are expecting to generate 7 million more megawatt hours than in 2009. However, the contribution to unhedged energy margin from these additional megawatt hours is low. 
Total expense includes the cost of both contracted coal and our small open position. We are estimating an increase in other fuel-related costs, primarily due to a full year of operation of the Hatfield scrubbers, offset by a decrease in natural gas expense.  $56 million increase in capacity reflects a $25 per megawatt day increase in capacity prices. 
Operating expenses, primarily O&M and state and local taxes will increase by about $10 million. 
So in summary, our unhedged EBITDA is better by $44 million primarily due to an increase in capacity revenues, partially offset by increased operating costs. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated on Slide 34 by starting with the unhedged EBITDA from the prior slide and adjusting for the impact of our power hedge position. These hedges include financial hedges, our West Penn Power contract, which expires at year-end 2010 and other marketing contracts. 
Projected margin contribution of our hedges is expected to contract versus 2009. Please note that the average contract price and contract market value include energy, capacity, ancillary services and congestion. Our contract market value represents the estimated cost to serve or replacement costs of these contracts as of March 31, 2010. 
Finally, for the Merchant Generation business, we also provide additional information in the Appendix on Slides 47 through 54. These slides contain additional data for analyzing the business, some high-level pretax income sensitivities and information on hedging activity that has occurred post March 31.
Moving on to Slide 35, utility operations. Please remember that we are including the Regulated Generation business of Mon Power in these results. EBITDA for utility operations is expected to grow by $4 million. This is $54 million worse than our estimate on the last call. The West Virginia rate case driver reflects the results of our recent settlement, which is yet to be approved by the West Virginia Commission. 
Our West Virginia settlement provides for a $40 million annualized rate increase effective June 29, 2010 and an additional $20 million increase in base rates effective January 1, 2011. As a result, if the settlement is approved, we'll see a $20 million increase in EBITDA due to rate increases in 2010 and an additional $40 million increase in 2011, for a total increase of $60 million annually. 
As part of the settlement, we will defer recovery of $20 million of deferred energy costs from 2011 to 2012. This complement of the settlement does not affect earnings in either year. 
As stated earlier, operations and our maintenance expense increased by $20 million to restore service after the February snowstorms. Our West Virginia rate settlement includes recovery of the West Virginia portion of the first quarter storms. A net benefit for this recovery of $5 million will be reflected in 2010 O&M expense. 
Recovery of securitized interest and depreciation related to the Fort Martin scrubbers and the remaining West Penn securitization is being reflected at the EBITDA level. While this benefits EBITDA, it does not affect earnings because they are offsetting impacts in depreciation and interest. 
As Paul discussed, we are evaluating a less-costly compliance program for Pennsylvania Act 129. Accordingly, we have slowed down spending and have eliminated the projected $10 million benefit. 
Finally, we have assumed here that the Virginia asset sale closes in June of 2010 instead of April, which would reduce EBITDA from ongoing operations by $24 million. There will also be offsetting effects of the sale on depreciation, interest and income tax expense.
Slide 38 shows estimated growth in rate base for utility operations. Please note that these are estimates only and our plants are always subject to change. Until we have finalized our plan, we will continue to reflect Pennsylvania Act 129 expenditures that were included in our original filing. 
We've also included $275 million, primarily in the out-years in transmission projects approved through the PJM RTEP process and continue to work with PJM on identifying additional projects. We intend to pursue FERC formulaic treatment for these transmission investments and expanded state regulatory approvals for pass-through of FERC transmission rates. 
In 2010, Transmission Expansion EBITDA should more than double. TrAIL is expected to be in service in mid-2011. We are increasing our estimated capital expenditures for the TrAIL project by $75 million to $925 million. PJM has not yet furnished us with a revised in-service date for PATH. We are now projecting Allegheny's share of spending for the Transmission Expansion business to be about $480 million in 2010.  Rate base in our Transmission Expansion business is expected to grow to over $2 billion by 2014. With TrAIL and PATH, we earn a return in this business as capital expenditures are made. 
In addition to the increase in TrAIL capital of $75 million, rate base has also increased as a result of $115 million in additional PJM-approved RTEP projects that will be constructed in our Transmission Expansion business. For purposes of this forecast, PATH is assumed to be in service in 2016.
At the consolidated level, depreciation expense will increase by $46 million in 2010, due primarily to the scrubbers going into service in 2009. Fort Martin scrubbers will increase depreciation expense but will not affect earnings because this expense is recovered through a surcharge. 
The outlook for capital expenditures is reflected on Slide 42. Spending in the Merchant Generation business is expected to decline now that we have completed the Hatfield scrubbers. Also included here are the originally-filed amounts for Pennsylvania Act 129 capital costs, which we've covered, and the additional $390 million of PJM RTEP projects that I mentioned earlier.
Moving back to the income statement. 2010 current estimated interest expense is $49 million worse than 2009. This total is virtually unchanged from our February call. Interest expense changes for Transmission Expansion will not affect earnings because it is recovered in formula rates. The Hatfield scrubbers have been placed in service and interest that was previously being capitalized will now be expensed. 
Finally, while not reflected here, we expect our effective tax rate in 2010 to be about the same as or 2009 rate, which was 38%. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions."

I mean, it obviously has to be taken into account or considered. But I think the issue was even before the merger was announced because we had this entered into this last year, the staff particularly thought a premium of $125 million on $250 million of rate base was a big premium. And they didn't like the idea that we were getting it and leaving the state and had much rather have seen it all go to customers. So that was kind of part of the pushback from the staff and from customers, obviously, because they want to ensure that they have low rates for a long time. And as you know, we kind of pride ourselves on having low rates throughout our system. So that was a little bit of a push-pull with the merger, over time, being in the background, and was basically when you look at it, giving up have the premium. Because as you say, $35 million came off the purchase price immediately that [indiscernible] to the benefit of the co-op customers. And then another $27.5 million over the next three years or so, four years, will go to our own customers that we had served in Virginia. So it's taking half of the premium, it split the premium in half. We still walk away with a $62.5 million premium, which is you'd have to say pretty good, and some might consider it pretty good for regulated sale."

And so you sort of assumed, if I recall, agreed to give credit risk for a lot of NPV on price. Are these mines that you buy from, are they right on the cusp of being, as Phil would say, upside down on their cost structure relative to the price? Or is there a substantial amount of headroom in their cost structure still relative to the price at which they sell, and then there isn't really sort of looming upward pressure in the cost structure? And then related to that, how are these contracts defined under the merger agreement? And given their economic materiality, are they company-material contracts underwriting Section 325 of the merger agreement, or are they not?

Today, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.57 per share for the second quarter, up substantially from $0.41 a year ago.

Today, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.57 per share for the second quarter, up substantially from $0.41 a year ago. These results exclude costs related to our proposed merger with FirstEnergy, unrealized losses on hedges and a $45 million gain on the sale of our Virginia territory.
A number of factors affected our results but a major factor was lower operations and maintenance expense. These lower costs were primarily due to timing of special maintenance expenses at the merchant power plants. Such costs were down $34 million in the quarter over the prior year period. We had less than one week of planned outages in this quarter compared to 21 weeks in same period last year, when we were doing maintenance at three supercritical plants.
Results in the second quarter also benefited from a 41% increase in Merchant Generation output reflecting the fewer planned outages, higher power crisis and stronger demand. The capacity factor of the supercriticals was back to a more normal 76% in the quarter. The higher revenues were partially offset by the roll off of favorable power hedges.
In our regulated business overall sales were up 3.5% in the second quarter this year. Industrial sales increased 9% continuing the trend that we saw in the first quarter. These figures exclude sales in Virginia. We completed the sale of our Virginia distribution operations on June 1 of this year.
In addition, we reversed $9 million of West Virginia storm costs booked in the first quarter because of the favorable commission ruling. Finally, earnings from our transmission projects benefited results in the quarter.
Now looking at key areas of focus for the year, weâ€™ve made good progress on our top priority completing the merger with FirstEnergy. On July 16, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared our registration statement effective and we mailed our proxy material. A special meeting to approve the merger is set for September 14. FirstEnergy will also hold its shareholder meeting at the same day.
In addition, weâ€™ve filed all required applications for regulatory approval, both federal and state. Procedural schedules are now in place in all jurisdictions. As you would expect with the merger of this size and scope, a number of parties have intervened in the proceedings.
Based on the schedules, we think itâ€™s reasonable to expect decisions in Virginia as early as September from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the fourth quarter, and in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia in the first quarter of next year.
Turning now to our other priorities, we remain on track for a smooth transition to market-bases rates in Pennsylvania, where rate caps expire at the end of this year. Our regulated business has contracted about 70% of the power needed to serve residential and small and medium commercial and industrial customers for the full year 2011.
Based on the contracts in place and assuming future prices are similar to the most recent auction, average monthly residential electric bills would only increase 4%, while small commercial and industrial bills would actually decrease by 2%. The next auction will be held in October and is heavily weighted toward commercial and industrial load.
Moving now to our transmission projects, the 500-kV Trans-Allegheny Interstate Line or TrAIL remains on schedule for in-service in June 2011. Right-of-way acquisition and substation construction are nearly complete. 83% of the towers have been constructed and 48% of the wire has been installed.
Regarding our second transmission project, the 765-kV Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline or PATH, in June PJM reaffirmed the need for the project and set the new in-service date for June 1, 2015.This confirmation is a major step forward for the project.
Weâ€™ve already begun to reengage the state regulatory approval process. Weâ€™ve made additional regulatory filings in Maryland and weâ€™ll re-file in Virginia, where we withdrew our application last year. In West Virginia, we anticipate a decision in May 2011.
Weâ€™ve also revisited the budget for the project since itâ€™s been three year since we first put it together. With increases in the cost of materials and services as well as new government agency requirements, we now estimate Allegheny share of the revised PATH budget as $1.4 billion, thatâ€™s up $200 million from the original estimate.
Another accomplishment during the second quarter was the regulatory approval of our West Virginia base rate case. The first phase, a $40 million increase went into effect on June 29. In the second phase, a 20 million increase will go into effect in January.
In other developments, Allegheny Energy Supply recently won power supply contracts in Maryland and Pennsylvania, and has entered into some commercial and industrial marketing contracts. As a result, we are now 89% hedged for the remainder of 2010, 59% in 2011, 23% in 2012, and 5% in 2013.
All of which is consistent with the targets weâ€™ve communicated in the past, that is by the end of a given year we want to have hedged 80% to 90% of the next yearâ€™s output, 30% to 50% of year two and 0% to 30% of year three.
The capacity auction for 2013, â€˜14 was held in mid-May. The clearing price was $28 per megawatt day in our region, an increase over the previous auction but still well below results of prior years and well below whatâ€™s needed to stimulate new investment.
On the environmental front, Allegheny is reviewing the impact of the Clean Air Transport Rule that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed in early July. The new rule substantially replaces the Clean Air Interstate Rule that a Federal Court overturned. The rule imposes state-by-state limits for sulfur dioxide and NOx emissions and restricts interstate trading, thereby limiting our ability to trade emission allowances to comply.
Itâ€™s also a different approach in Washington to proposed climate change legislation. When it became clear, an economy-wide Carbon bill did not have sufficient support in the Senate; utilityâ€™s only versions began to be discussed, that is the bill would regulate greenhouse gases for the utility industry only. It seems unlikely that even this limited version will be enacted this year.
Finally, Iâ€™m happy to report that Allegheny won second place in the American Society for Qualityâ€™s 2010 international team competition. More than 400 applicants worldwide competed on how they have used the quality process to improve operations.
The Allegheny team reported on a project that improved order fulfillment within supply chain. To finish second is really quite an accomplishment. Improving quality of service and reducing costs, thatâ€™s what I call high performance.
So to summarize, while we continue to face a tough economy, we are making solid progress on meeting our goal and objectives for the year. While working hard to complete our merger with FirstEnergy, we remain focused on our core business, especially controlling costs and looking for value-added opportunities.
Now, let me turn the call over to Kirk.
"
249126,109141671,72218,"Allegheny Energy Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Allegheny Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. As Paul has already discussed, adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $0.57 per share as compared to $0.41 per share for the second quarter of last year.Adjusted earnings for the quarter exclude net",1742,"Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. As Paul has already discussed, adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $0.57 per share as compared to $0.41 per share for the second quarter of last year.
Adjusted earnings for the quarter exclude net unrealized losses associated with hedging activities, expenses associated with the proposed merger with FirstEnergy, and the $45 million gain from the sale of our Virginia distribution business.
Adjusted earnings for the six months ended June 30 were $1.17 per share compared to $1.08 per share for the same period a year ago. Adjusted pre-tax earnings increased $40 million in the second quarter compared to the same period last year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the merchant generation business was $50 million higher than the second quarter last year. Unhedged net revenue increased by $55 million. Youâ€™ll find details in the appendix, but let me give you an overview of what drove this increase.
The improvement in unhedged net revenue was driven by an increase in realized energy price at our generating stations of $3 per megawatt hour. Round-the-clock price at the PJM Western Hub increased by $10 per megawatt hour, but basis and shaping expanded by $7 per megawatt hour resulting in the $3 price increase at our generation stations.
Generation volume increased 2.5 million megawatt hours quarter-over-quarter. The higher generation volume was due to higher prices, reduced planned outages, and higher demand.
In addition, capacity revenues increased $24 million reflecting an average increase in capacity price of $44 per megawatt day. These increases were partially offset by increased coal costs of approximately $5 per ton and the higher coal burned due to increased generation output.
We also experienced a $40 million reduction in power hedge margin, which is the difference between the average contract price on our hedges and the current period cost of serving those contracts, including the cost of energy, capacity, ancillary services, and congestion.
Favorable contracts in the second quarter 2009 have rolled off and since market prices have increased, the margin contribution of our hedges in the second quarter of 2010 was $40 million or $7 per megawatt hour less than last year.
O&M expenses improved significantly quarter-over-quarter. $34 million was related to the timing of special maintenance for our Merchant Generation plans. We had significant planned outages in the second quarter of 2009 and very little this quarter.
As shown on slide number 29, our 2010 special maintenance expense will be higher in both the third and fourth quarters compared to 2009, but will be lower for the whole year.
Moving back to the EBITDA summary, regulated operations benefited primarily from our transmission expansion projects. We reversed $9 million of O&M expense to record a regulatory asset related to the February storm costs. We also experienced an increase in industrial and residential load, excluding the Virginian distribution business.
The primary driver of operating expenses and other is the effect of the Virginia sale. Interest expense for the quarter was higher by $21 million; about $9 million was primarily due to the fact that we stopped capitalizing interest cost on the Hatfield scrubber project. We also had an $8 million increase in interest cost due to transmission expansion and higher borrowing rates.
Depreciation increased by $13 million, primarily due to the Hatfield and Fort Martin scrubbers being placed in service in the second half of last year.
While not shown here, our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 38% compared to about 40% for the same period last year. Adjusted cash flow from operations was $191 million, a $143 million decrease from the second quarter last year. This was due to changes in working capital, primarily related to returns of collateral deposits in accordance with changes at PJM in the second quarter of 2009.
Capital expenditures were $246 million. Free cash flow, netting the securitization proceeds used to fund the Fort Martin scrubbers and financing for TrAIL was a positive $49 million for the quarter.
In aggregate, our liquidity, including cash on hand, totals approximately $2.3 billion. In July, AE Supply redeemed 151 million of its medium term notes with cash on hand. We have no remaining debt maturities through 2011 except for securitization and amortizations.
Now, letâ€™s turn to the outlook. This slide summarizes our most recent estimate of changes in EBITDA for 2010 compared to 2009 for each business and for consolidated depreciation and interest expense. Weâ€™re also reflecting changes in the 2010 outlook from the last call. Weâ€™ll now go through the drivers of each one of these line items.
Moving to slide number 34, for Merchant Generation, we estimate a $12 million decrease in 2010 EBITDA compared to 2009, which is a $43 million improvement compared to our estimate on the last call. Not included in these estimates is an unplanned outage at Unit 1 of our Hatfield plant which began on July 23.
We expect the outage to last about 30 days. This will result in an estimated average impact including the effect of loss margin of about $5 million to $10 million pre-tax.
Our estimates are based on among other things forward power prices at June 30, 2010. For the full year 2010, we are using a PJM Western Hub energy price of $46 per megawatt hour, which is the combination of six months actual and six months of forward prices. You may recall that on our last call, our estimates were based on forward prices of $40 per megawatt hour for 2010.
Forward prices are subject to highly variable market factors and our estimates will continue to change due to fluctuations in those prices and other factors. Since our last call, the increase in forward energy prices has contributed to a projected increase in unhedged energy margin of $90 million and a decrease in power hedge margin of $49 million.
Turning to slide number 35, we are expecting to generate 8 million more megawatt hours than in 2009. This is an increase of 1 million megawatt hours from our last call. We have generated 17 million megawatt hours year-to-date through June. Our estimated realized price for the year is $38 per megawatt hour.
Coal expense includes the cost of both contracted coal and our small open position. We are estimating an increase in coal expense of $18 million from the last call, due primarily to increased generation volume. $56 million increase in capacity reflects a $26 per megawatt day increase in capacity prices.
Operating expenses, primarily O&M and state and local taxes will increase by about $4 million. So in summary, weâ€™re expecting our unhedged EBITDA to be better by $137 million.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated on slide number 36 by starting with the unhedged EBITDA from the prior slide and adjusting for the impact of our power hedge position. These hedges include financial hedges, our West Penn PLR contract, which expires at the end of the year and other marketing contracts.
The projected margin contribution of our hedges has decreased from our last call reflecting higher energy prices. In the appendix, we provide additional information for analyzing the business and some high level pre-tax income sensitivities.
Moving on to slide number 37, utility operations, please remember that weâ€™re including the regulated generation business of Mon Power in these results. EBITDA for utility operations is now expected to decrease by $24 million. This is $28 million worse than our estimate on the last call.
Weâ€™ve adjusted our winter storms driver to reflect the increased amount of the West Virginia regulatory asset associated with the storm. Weâ€™re reflecting the effect of moving internal resources from Pennsylvania Act 129 projects to non-capital projects. This results in an additional O&M expense of $7 million.
Weâ€™re projecting a decrease in other regulated revenues. While this reflects an increase in customer load in 2010 driven by higher industrial sales, we are expecting lower commercial usage and lower average customer rates to more than offset this benefit.
We are increasing other non-formulaic O&M by $3 million to reflect allocation of cost to this segment. Other includes among other items increases in expected third-party transmission expenses in this segment of the business.
Slide 38 shows estimated growth in rate base for utility operations. Please note that these are only estimates and our plans are always subject to change. In Pennsylvania, we have received an administrative law judge order recommending approval of our previously submitted smart meter plan.
Weâ€™re reflecting that plan in our estimated rate base amount. We expect to submit the revised plan later this year that would result in a slower smart meter-related spend. We will keep you informed on this matter.
We have also included $340 million, primarily in the outer years in transmission projects approved through the RTEP process. Weâ€™re increasing our estimate for 2010 transmission expansion EBITDA primarily based on the accelerated timing of capital expenditures in 2010. TrAIL is expected to be in service in mid 2011, PATH is expected to be in service 2015.
The rate base in our transmission expansion business is expected to grow to about $2.5 billion by 2014. For TrAIL and PATH, we earn a return in this business as capital expenditures are made. In addition to TrAIL and PATH, our estimate includes $170 million in additional PJM-approved RTEP projects that will be constructed in our transmission expansion business.
At the consolidated level, depreciation expense will increase by $44 million in 2010 due primarily to the scrubbers going into service in the second half of 2009. Fort Martin scrubbers will increase depreciation expense, but will not affect earnings because this expense is recovered through a surcharge.
Our capital forecast is reflected on slide number 42. It includes the changes to the PATH budget and in service dates. Spending in the Merchant Generation business is expected to decline now that we have completed the Hatfield scrubbers. Also included are the $510 million of PJM RTEP projects that I mentioned earlier.
Moving back to the income statement, 2010 current estimated interest expense is $47 million worse than 2009. Remember that interest expense for transmission expansion is recovered in formula rates. The Hatfield scrubbers have been placed in service and interest that was previously being capitalized will now be expensed.
Finally, while not reflected here, we expect our effective tax rate in 2010 to be about the same as our 2009 rate which was 38%. With that, Iâ€™ll turn the call over to the operator of questions.

Well, itâ€™s really primarily because of the special maintenance costs that we incurred this year relative to last year. Weâ€™ve 10 supercritical units, so on average weâ€™re doing a little more than three every year. Last year we had all three in the second quarter and this year we really had none. So there was a big difference in cost. Last year also we were doing the tie-in of our first major scrubber unit as part of a planned outage. So the difference is $5 million this year versus $41 million last year, so itâ€™s $37 million less special maintenance in the second quarter.
But I think, Brian, you should realize that this year itâ€™s kind of a normal quarter. I think in Kirkâ€™s slide it shows maybe $59 million as the total special maintenance costs for the year. Next year weâ€™re planning the same thing about three planned outages on the major units and the cost will be around the same in that whole $16 million range. So it just happened to be the timing on this quarter. Part of that reverses because last year, as Iâ€™ve said, we did everything in the second quarter, so there is very little expenses in the third and fourth quarter of last year and they are more this year.

So the PJM RTEP is looking at it, but it is really focused on one line only. This is Mt. Storm to Doubs line, which is a rebuild of an existing line. So itâ€™s not very easy and simple to do. We have to take out the line at certain periods, put it back. It solves one issue.
I think PATH is certainly the more robust long-term solution creating an entirely additional high voltage corridor that will help power flow throughout the whole system providing capacity for the whole system. So weâ€™re going forward full speed ahead with PATH, and PJM, weâ€™ll look at that one. It might be a nice supplemental one, but to me itâ€™s really not a threat and the PJM hasnâ€™t even decided what to do with that particular line even though Dominion makes some comments perhaps suggesting something otherwise.

Today, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.57 per share for the second quarter, up substantially from $0.41 a year ago. These results exclude costs related to our proposed merger with F",1158,"Thanks, Max, and good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.57 per share for the second quarter, up substantially from $0.41 a year ago. These results exclude costs related to our proposed merger with FirstEnergy, unrealized losses on hedges and a $45 million gain on the sale of our Virginia territory. 
A number of factors affected our results, but a major factor was lower operations and maintenance expense. These lower costs were primarily due to timing of special maintenance expenses at the merchant power plants. Such costs were down $34 million in the quarter over the prior period. We had less than one week of planned outages in this quarter compared to 21 weeks in the same period last year, when we were doing maintenance at three supercritical plants. 
Results in the second quarter also benefited from a 41% increase in Merchant Generation output, reflecting the fewer planned outages, higher power prices and stronger demand. The capacity factor of the supercriticals was back to a more normal 76% in the quarter. The higher revenues were partially offset by the roll off of favorable power hedges. 
In our Regulated business, overall sales were up 3.5% in the second quarter this year. Industrial sales increased 9%, continuing the trend that we saw in the first quarter. These figures exclude sales in Virginia. We completed the sale of our Virginia Distribution operations on June 1 of this year. 
In addition, we reversed $9 million [$8.9 million] of West Virginia storm costs booked in the first quarter because of a favorable commission ruling. Finally, earnings from our transmission projects benefited results in the quarter. 
Now looking at key areas of focus for the year, we've made good progress on our top priority, completing the merger with FirstEnergy. On July 16, the Securities and Exchange Commission declared our registration statement effective, and we mailed our proxy material. A special meeting to approve the merger is set for September 14. FirstEnergy will also hold it's shareholder meeting that same day. 
In addition, we filed all required applications for regulatory approval, both federal and state. Procedural schedules are now in place in all jurisdictions. As you would expect with the merger of this size and scope, a number of parties have intervened in the proceedings. Based on the schedule, we think it's reasonable to expect decisions in Virginia as early as September from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the fourth quarter and in Pennsylvania, Maryland and West Virginia in the first quarter of next year. 
Turning now to our other priority. We remain on track for a smooth transition to market-based rates in Pennsylvania, where rate caps expire at the end of this year. Our Regulated business has contracted about 70% of the power needed to serve residential and small and medium commercial and industrial customers for the full year 2011. Based on the contracts in place and assuming future prices are similar to the most recent auction, average monthly residential electric bills would only increase 4%, while small commercial and industrial bills would actually decrease by 2%. The next auction will be held in October, and is heavily weighted toward commercial and industrial load. 
Moving now to our transmission projects. The 500-kV Trans-Allegheny Interstate Line or TrAIL remains on schedule for in service in June 2011. The right-of-way acquisition and substation construction are nearly complete. 83% of the towers have been constructed, and 48% of the wire has been installed. 
Regarding our second transmission project, the 765-kV, Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline or PATH. In June PJM reaffirmed the need for the project and set the new in-service state for June 1, 2015. This confirmation is a major step forward for the project. 
We've already begun to reengage the state regulatory approval process. We've made additional regulatory filings in Maryland, and we'll refile in Virginia, where we withdrew our application last year. In West Virginia, we anticipate a decision in May 2011. 
We've also revisited the budget for the project, since it's been three year since we first put it together. With increases in the cost of materials and services, as well as new government agency requirements, we now estimate Allegheny share of the revised PATH budget as $1.4 billion. That's up $200 million from the original estimate. 
Another accomplishment during the second quarter was the regulatory approval of our West Virginia base rate case. The first phase, a $40 million increase, went into effect on June 29, and the second phase, a $20 million increase will go into effect in January. 
In other developments. Allegheny Energy Supply recently won power supply contracts in Maryland and Pennsylvania and has entered into some commercial and industrial marketing contracts. As a result, we are now 89% hedged for the remainder of 2010, 59% in 2011, 23% in 2012 and 5% in 2013, all of which is consistent with the targets we've communicated in the past. That is, by the end of the given year, we will only have had 80% to 90% of the next year's output, 30% to 50% of year two and 0% to 30% of year three. 
The capacity auction for 2013, '14 was held in mid May. The clearing price was $28 per megawatt-day in that region, an increase over the previous auction but still well below results for prior years and well below what's needed to stimulate new investment. 
On the environmental front, Allegheny is reviewing the impact of the clean air transport rule at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed in early July. The new rule substantially replaces the Clean Air Interstate Rule that the federal court overturned. The rule imposes state-by-state limits for sulfur dioxide and NOx emissions and restricts interstate trading, thereby limiting our ability to trade emission allowances to comply. 
There's also a different approach in Washington to propose climate change legislation. When it became clear, an economy-wide carbon bill did not have sufficient support in the Senate, the utilities-only version began to be discussed. That is, the bill would regulate greenhouse gases for the utility industry only. It seems unlikely that even this limited version will be enacted this year. 
And finally, I'm happy to report that Allegheny won second place in the American Society for Quality's 2010 international team competition. More than 400 applicants worldwide competed on how they have used the quality process to improve operations. The Allegheny team reported on a project that improved order fulfillment within supply chain. To finished second is really quite an accomplishment. Improving quality of service and reducing costs, that's what I call high performance. 
So to summarize, while we continue to face a tough economy, we're making solid progress on meeting our goals and objectives for the year. While working hard to complete our merger with FirstEnergy, we remained focused on our core business, especially controlling costs and looking for value-added opportunities. Now let me turn the call over to Kirk."
249126,109141671,72324,"Allegheny Energy Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Aug-04-2010",2010-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Allegheny Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. As Paul has already discussed, adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $0.57 per share as compared to $0.41 per share for the second quarter of last year. Adjusted earnings for the quarter exclude net u",1715,"Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. As Paul has already discussed, adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $0.57 per share as compared to $0.41 per share for the second quarter of last year. Adjusted earnings for the quarter exclude net unrealized losses associated with hedging activities, expenses associated with the proposed merger with FirstEnergy and a $45 million gain from the sale of the Virginia Distribution business. 
Adjusted earnings for the six months ended June 30 were $1.17 per share compared to $1.08 per share for the same period a year ago. Adjusted pretax earnings increased $40 million in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the Merchant Generation business was $50 million higher than the second quarter last year. Unhedged net revenue increased by $55 million. You'll find details in the Appendix, but let me give you an overview of what drove this increase. 
The improvement in unhedged net revenue was driven by an increase in realized energy price at our generating stations, up $3 per megawatt-hour. The round-the-clock price at the PJM Western Hub increased by $10 per megawatt-hour, but basis and shaping expanded by $7 per megawatt-hour,  resulting in the $3 price increase at our generation stations. 
Generation volume increased 2.5 million megawatt-hours quarter-over-quarter. The higher generation volume was due to higher prices, reduced planned outages and higher demand. In addition, capacity revenues increased $24 million, reflecting an average increase in capacity price of $44 per megawatt-day. These increases were partially offset by increased coal costs of approximately $5 per ton and the higher coal burn due to increased generation output. 
We also experienced a $40 million reduction in power hedge margin, which is the difference between the average contract price on our hedges and the current period cost of serving those contracts, including the cost of energy, capacity, ancillary services and congestion. Favorable contracts in the second quarter 2009 have rolled off, and since market prices have increased, the margin contribution of our hedges in the second quarter of 2010 was $40 million or $7 per megawatt-hour less than last year. 
O&M expenses improved significantly quarter-over-quarter. $34 million was related to the timing of special maintenance for our Merchant Generation plants. We had significant plant outages in the second quarter of 2009 and very little this quarter. As shown on Slide 29, our 2010 special maintenance expense will be higher in both the third and fourth quarters compared to 2009, but will be lower for the whole year. 
Moving back to the EBITDA summary. Regulated Operations benefited primarily from our transmission expansion projects. We reversed $9 million of O&M expense to record a regulatory asset related to the February storm cost. We also experienced an increase in industrial and residential load, excluding the Virginia Distribution business. The primary driver of operating expenses and other is the effect of the Virginia sale. 
Interest expense for the quarter was higher by $21 million. About $9 million was primarily due to the fact that we stopped capitalizing interest cost on the Hatfield scrubber project. We also had an $8 million increase in interest cost due to transmission expansion and higher borrowing rates.  Depreciation increased by $13 million primarily due to the Hatfield and Fort Martin scrubbers being placed in service in the second half of last year. While not shown here, our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 38% compared to about 40% for the same period last year. 
Adjusted cash flow from operations was $191 million, a $43 million decrease from the second quarter last year. This was due to changes in working capital, primarily related to returns of collateral deposits in accordance with changes at PJM in the second quarter of 2009. Capital expenditures were $246 million. Free cash flow, netting the securitization proceeds used to fund the Fort Martin scrubbers and financing for TrAIL was a positive $49 million for the quarter. 
In aggregate, our liquidity, including cash on hand, totals approximately $2.3 billion. In July, AE Supply redeemed $151 million of its medium-term notes with cash on hand. We have no remaining debt maturities through 2011 except for securitization amortizations. 
Now let's turn to the outlook. This slide summarizes our most recent estimate of changes in EBITDA for 2010 compared to 2009 for each business and for consolidated depreciation and interest expense. We're also reflecting changes in the 2010 outlook from the last call. We'll now go through the drivers of each one of these line items. 
Moving to Slide 34 for Merchant Generation. We estimate a $12 million decrease in 2010 EBITDA compared to 2009, which is a $43 million improvement compared to our estimate on the last call. Not included in these estimates is an unplanned outage at Unit 1 of our Hatfield plant, which began on July  23. We expect the outage to last about 30 days. This will result in an estimated adverse impact, including the effect of loss margin of about $5 million to $10 million pretax. 
Our estimates are based on, among other things, forward power prices at June 30, 2010. For the full year 2010, we are using a PJM Western Hub energy price of $46 per megawatt-hour, which is the combination of six months actual and six months of forward prices. 
You may recall that on our last call, our estimates were based on forward prices of $40 per megawatt-hour for 2010. Forward prices are subject to highly variable market factors, and our estimates will continue to change due to fluctuations in those prices and other factors. Since our last call, the increase in forward energy prices has contributed to a projected increase in unhedged energy margin of $90 million and a decrease in power hedge margin of $49 million. 
Turning to Slide 35. We are expecting to generate 8 million more megawatt-hours than in 2009. This is an increase of 1 million megawatt-hours from our last call. We have generated 17 million-megawatt hours year-to-date through June. Our estimated realized price for the year is $38 per megawatt-hour. 
Call expense includes cost of both contracted coal in our small open position. We're estimating an increase in coal expense of $18 million from the last call due primarily to increased generation volume. The $56 million increase in capacity reflects a $26 per megawatt-day increase in capacity prices. Operating expenses, primarily O&M and state and local taxes will increase by about $4 million. 
So in summary, we're expecting our unhedged EBITDA to be better by $137 million. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated on Slide 36 by starting with the unhedged EBITDA from the prior slide and adjusting for the impact of our power hedge position. These hedges include financial hedges, our West Penn POLR contract, which expires at the end of the year and other marketing contracts. The projected margin contribution of our hedges has decreased from our last call, reflecting higher energy prices. In the Appendix, we provide additional information for analyzing the business and some high-level pretax income sensitivities. 
Moving on to Slide 37, utility operations. Please remember that we are including the Regulated Generation business of Mon Power in these results. EBITDA for utility operations is now expected to decrease by $24 million. This is $28 million worse than our estimate on the last call. We've adjusted our winter storm's driver to reflect the increased amount of the West Virginia regulatory asset associated with the storm. We're reflecting the effect of moving internal resources from Pennsylvania Act 129 projects to non-capital projects. This results in an additional O&M expense of $7 million. 
We're projecting a decrease in other regulated revenues. While this reflects an increase in customer load in 2010 driven by higher industrial sales, we are expecting lower commercial usage and lower average customer rates to more than offset this benefit. We are increasing other non-formulated O&M $3 million to reflect allocation of cost to this segment. Other includes, among other items, increases in expected third-party transmission expenses in this segment of the business. 
Slide 38 shows estimated growth in rate base for utility operations. Please note that these are only estimates, and our plans are always subject to change. In Pennsylvania, we have received an administrative law judge order recommending approval of our previously submitted Smart Meter plan. We're reflecting that plan in our estimated rate base amount. We expect to submit a revised plan better this year that would result in a slower Smart-Meter-related spend. We will keep you informed on this matter. We have also included $340 million, primarily in the outer years in transmission projects approved through the RTEP process. 
We're increasing our estimate for 2010 Transmission Expansion EBITDA, primarily based on the accelerated timing of capital expenditures in 2010. TrAIL is expected to be in service in mid 2011. PATH is expected to be in service, 2015. 
The rate base in our Transition Expansion business is expected to grow to about $2.5 billion by 2014. For TrAIL and PATH, we earn a return in this business as capital expenditures are made. In addition to TrAIL and PATH, our estimate includes $170 million and additional PJM-approved RTEP projects that will be constructed in our Transmission Expansion business. 
At the consolidated level, depreciation expense will increase by $44 million in 2010 due primarily to the scrubbers going in service in the second half of 2009. Fort Martin scrubbers will increase depreciation expense but will not affect earnings, because these expenses recover through a surcharge. 
Our capital forecast is reflected on Slide 42. It includes the changes to PATH budget and in-service dates. Spending in the Merchant Generation business is expected to decline now that we have completed the Hatfield scrubbers. Also included are the $510 million of PJM RTEP projects that I mentioned earlier. 
Moving back to the income statement. 2010 current estimated interest expense is $47 million worse than 2009. Remember that interest expense for Transmission Expansion has recovered in formula rates. The Hatfield scrubbers have been placed in service, and interest that was been capitalized will now be expensed. 
Finally, while not reflected here, we expect our effective tax rate in 2010 to be about the same as our 2009 rate, which was 38%. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions."

We're doing a little more than three every year. And last year, we had all three in the second quarter, and this year, we really had none. So there was a big difference in cost. And last year also, we were doing the tie-ins of our first major scrubber unit as part of a planned outage. So the difference is $5 million this year versus $41 million last year. So it's $37 million less special maintenance in the second quarter. But, I think, Brian, you should realize that this year is kind of a normal quarter. So we -- I think in Kirk's slide, it shows maybe $59 million as the total special maintenance costs for the year. And next year, we're planning the same thing, about three planned outages on the major units, and the cost will be around the same in that old $60 million range, though it just happened to be the timing on this quarter. And part of that reverse is because last year, as I said, we did everything in the second quarter, so there's very little expenses in the third and fourth quarter of last year, and there are more this year."

So that's some of the impact there. Plus last year, we sold a couple of small businesses, one of which, we booked again on last, last year that we're not getting this year. So those are the kind of the bigger-ticket items, then there's a whole bunch of other cats and dogs in there."

Dominion has made now some changes to what they have reproposed, so the PJM RTEP is looking at it but it's really focused on one line only. This is the Mt. Storm to Doubs line, which is a rebuild of an existing line. So it's not very easy and simple to do. You have to take out the line in certain periods, put it back. And it's solves one issue. I think PATH is certainly the more robust long-term solution creating an entirely additional high-voltage corridor that will help power flow throughout the whole system, providing capacity for the whole system. So we're going forward full speed ahead with PATH and PJM will look at that one. It might be a nice supplemental one. But to me, it's really not a threat and the PJM hasn't even decided what to do with that particular line even though Dominion make some comments, perhaps suggesting something otherwise."

Good afternoon, everyone, thanks for being with us today. I am pleased to report that we had strong financial results for the third quarter.

I am pleased to report that we had strong financial results for the third quarter. Adjusted earnings were $0.73 per share up substantially from $0.59 in the third quarter a year ago. These figures exclude costs related to our proposed merger with FirstEnergy, unrealized gains on hedges and the cost of debt tend to offers.
Our Merchant Generation business earned a solid profit, but most of our earnings growth came from regulated operations. Results from regulated operations benefited from increased earnings at our transmission expansion projects, a rate increase in West Virginia and higher retail sales.
Total retail electric sales increased by 11% compared to the same period last year and industrial sales were up 8% continuing the trend weâ€™ve seen this year. Increased sales were also driven by the hot summer weather, cooling degree-days were up nearly 50% compared to the prior year and also were well above normal.
Increased demand helped our generation business as well. Merchant plan output was up almost 50% for the quarter most of which came from our supercritical coal units.
As you may recall, in the third quarter of last year our supercritical capacity factor was under 50% due largely to weak demand and competition from gas-fired generation.
In the quarter just ended, the higher generation volume reflects both stronger demand and higher power prices. Realized energy prices in TJM increased to $44 per megawatt hour, up over 30% compared to the same period a year ago.
However, since most of our output was hedged at or near market levels, those hedges didnâ€™t help earnings as they did last year when they were above market prices and benefited earnings by $63 million pre-tax.
So overall, our third quarter results were strong for both segments of the business and indicate continued economic recovery in our service territory.
Letâ€™s now turn to our key areas of focus for the year. We continued to make good progress with our top priority merger with FirstEnergy.
On September 14, we achieved a major milestone. The shareholders of both companies overwhelmingly approved the merger. We were extremely pleased with the significant show of support from our shareholders. 99% of the votes cast were in favor of the merger.
As for the regulatory review process, we received merger approval from the Virginia State Corporation Commission on September 9. Although, hearings were held in mid-October in Pennsylvania and weâ€™ve already reached the settlement with many of the parties including the Office of Consumer Advocate and the trial staff of the Public Utility Commission. Hearings begin West Virginia and Maryland within the next two weeks.
On the Federal level, we are awaiting the completion of reviews by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Department of Justice. We donâ€™t expect either of these reviews to delay the closing which remains on schedule for the first half of 2011.
Now as per our transmission projects, the 500-kV Trans-Allegheny Interstate Line or TrAIL as we call it, is nearing completion. The right of way acquisition and substation construction are essentially finished and construction of the line itself is headed down the home stretch.
97% of the towers are complete and 76% of the wire is installed. The line remains scheduled for in service in June 2011 five years after we were directed to build it by PJM and frankly much faster than almost anyone thought possible.
Our second transmission project, the 765-kV Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline or PATH, is also moving forward following PJMâ€™s affirmation that the line is needed by June 1, 2015.
We had a favorable development in Virginia last week when the State Corporation Commission denied a staff motion that said the case should be held in abeyance. The Commission instead set a procedural schedule that includes an evidentiary hearing in April of next year.
We expect the Virginia Commission to make a decision on PATH no later than September 2011. West Virginia, has also scheduled hearings in March of next year and is expected to make a decision by late July. Procedural schedules should be set in Maryland in the near future. We expect the Maryland Commission to make a decision no later than next September.
Also we opened our new transmission headquarters building near Fairmont, West Virginia last week. The new $60 million environmentally friendly facility will bring 150 jobs to West Virginia when fully staffed, and is a major economic development boost to the area.
The facility will serve as the nerve center for our multi-state transmission function that includes a state-of-the-art transmission operation center that will manage the grid 24-hours a day, seven-days a week. Itâ€™s an appropriate facility to have Allegheny growing transmission business which is just so critical in the PJM regions.
On the legal front, the federal trial has concluded in the loss of over alleged New Source Review violations of the Clean Air Act at our three Pennsylvania power plants. Alleghenyâ€™s position remains that all planned outage work at the plants did not trigger New Source Review or related state law. The Judgesâ€™ decision is not expected until sometime next year.
Since our last call, Allegheny Energy Supply has won additional power supply contracts and has entered into some direct contracts with retail customers. As a result, our Merchant Generation business is now 74% hedged in 2011, 29% in 2012, and 7% in 2013.
This is consistent with the targets weâ€™ve communicated in the past, and that is, by the end of a given year we want to have hedged 80% to 90% of the next yearâ€™s output, 30% to 50% of the year two, and 0% to 30% of year three.
In preparation for the exploration of rate caps at the end of this year, West Penn Power a Pennsylvania utility held its final option to procure power for 2011. The Maryland supply contract is in place for the full year to serve the needs of 80% of our residential customers, 90% of our small and mid-sized non residential customers, and all of our largest commercial and industrial customers through selected fixed price option.
The remainder of West Pennâ€™s needs through 2011 will be procured through daily spot purchases. Based on the prices power under contract, average monthly residential electric bills will increase only $3 per month or about 3% next year. Electric bills for small to mid-sized non residential customers will actually decrease between 3% and 4%.
Now, Iâ€™m also happy to report that Allegheny Power continues to rank in the top-quartile of utilities nationwide for overall customer satisfaction among large commercial and industrial customers according to the recently published 2010 TQS survey.
In the same survey, Allegheny also continued to rank number one among utilities into North East region for the sixth consecutive year.
So, in summary, Allegheny Energy had a strong third quarter and weâ€™re making solid progress on meeting our goals and objectives for the year. As we look out over the next few months, we remained very focused on running our core business well and completing the merger with FirstEnergy.
Now, let me turn the call over to Kirk.

249126,114142896,82345,"Allegheny Energy Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2010",2010-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Allegheny Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. As Paul has already discussed, adjusted earnings for the third quarter was $0.73 per share as compared to $0.59 per share for the third quarter of last year.Adjusted earnings for the quarter exclude net unreali",1842,"Thank you, Paul. Good afternoon, everyone. As Paul has already discussed, adjusted earnings for the third quarter was $0.73 per share as compared to $0.59 per share for the third quarter of last year.
Adjusted earnings for the quarter exclude net unrealized gains associated with hedging activities, expenses associated with the proposed merger with FirstEnergy, and tender offer costs.
Adjusted earnings for the nine months ended September 30 were $1.91 per share compared to $1.67 per share for the same period a year ago. Adjusted pre-tax earnings increased by $29 million in the third quarter compared to the same period last year.
Adjusted EBITDA for the merchant generation was $3 million higher than the third quarter last year. Unhedged net revenue increased by $81 million. Youâ€™ll find details in the appendix, but let me give you an overview of what drove this increase. The improvement in unhedged net revenue was driven by an increase in both price and volume.
Round the clock price at the PJM Western Hub increased by $18 per megawatt hour, but basis and shaping expanded by $7 per megawatt hour resulting in an $11 price increase at our generation stations.
Generation volume increased 3 million megawatt hours quarter-over-quarter. A higher generation volume was due primarily to higher realized prices and higher demand.
Capacity revenues decreased $12 million. This reflects a decrease in the PJM base auction price from the $191 to $174 per megawatt day. Balancing auction activity certainly affects the plant availability. Coal expense increased by $59 million, primarily due to higher coal burn related to increase generation output.
We also experienced $66 million reduction in power hedge margins, which is the difference between the average contract price on our hedges and the current period cost of serving those contracts, including the cost of energy, capacity, ancillary services, and congestion.
This quarter the contract prices of our hedges were roughly equal to market prices and had little impact on the quarter.
In the third quarter of 2009, contract prices of our hedges exceeded the cost to serve these hedge obligations by $9 per megawatt hour resulting in a $63 million benefit for the quarter a year ago.
Operating expenses were $12 million whereas quarter-over-quarter as we estimated on our last call special maintenance expense was up $10 million quarter-over-quarter. The duration of planned outages were flat year-versus-year, but last yearâ€™s outages were related to tying in our scrubbers and as such more costs were capitalized.
As shown on slide #23, our 2010 special maintenance expense will also be higher in the fourth quarter compared to 2009, but will be lower for the full year. Moving back to the EBITDA summary, regulated operations benefited primarily from higher retail load, our transmission expansion projects and the West Virginia rate increase.
Our T&D retail revenue increased quarter-over-quarter driven primarily by $22 million related to load growth and favorable weather. Continued progress on TrAIL and PATH contributed to $19 million increase for transmission expansion. The West Virginia rate increase provided $10 million benefit. These results were partially offset by the effect of the sale of the Virginia distribution business.
Interest expense for the quarter was higher by $11 million primarily due to an $8 million increase in interest costs due to transmission expansion. About $4 million was due to the fact that we stopped capitalizing interest costs on the Hatfield scrubber project.
Depreciation increased by $10 million, primarily due to the Hatfield and Fort Martin scrubbers being placed in service in the second half of last year.
While not shown here, our effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 34% compared to about 37% for the same period last year. The decrease is due primarily to a change in tax reserves.
Adjusted cash flow from operations was $304 million, a $42 million increase from the third quarter last year, and is due primarily to an increase in pre-tax income. Capital expenditures were $218 million, free cash flow, netting the securitization proceeds used to fund the Fort Martin scrubbers and financing for TrAIL was a positive $187 million for the quarter.
In aggregate, our liquidity, including cash balances, totals approximately $2.3 billion. In September, we increased the credit facility for TrAIL from $350 million to $450 million to finance forecasted increases in project costs. We have no remaining debt maturities through 2011, except for securitization and amortizations.
Now, letâ€™s turn to the outlook. Slide 27 summarizes our most recent estimate of the changes in EBITDA for each business and consolidated depreciation and net interest expense for 2010 compared to 2009.
Weâ€™re also reflecting changes in the 2010 outlook since the last call. The biggest change since the last call is in utility operations, and as I mentioned earlier, this was primarily due to increased load in weather.
For those of you who are thinking about the fourth quarter, Iâ€™d like to note significant items that benefited 2009 versus 2010 results. As shown on side 23, weâ€™ll have higher special maintenance expense versus the fourth quarter of last year. We had a $17 million pre-tax gain related to the purchase of a hydro facility last year.
Finally, we recognized an $18 million income tax benefit in the fourth quarter last year due to a change in the Pennsylvania tax law concerning net operating losses, which was an after tax benefit. Weâ€™ll now go through the drivers for 2010, highlighting items that have changed since our last call.
Moving to slide #28, for Merchant Generation, we estimate a $4 million decrease in 2010 EBITDA compared to 2009, which is an $8 million improvement compared to our estimate on the last call. Our estimates are based on among other things, forward power prices at September 30, 2010.
For the full year 2010, we are using a PJM Western Hub energy price of $45 per megawatt hour, which is the combination of nine months actual and three months forward prices.
You may recall that on our last call our estimates were based on forward prices of $46 per megawatt hour for 2010. Forward prices are subject to highly variable market factors and our estimates will continue to change due to fluctuations in those prices and other factors.
Realized energy prices for 2010 have not changed since our last call, but we have seen a decrease in volume of 1 million megawatt hours due to plant performance in the third quarter.
As I mentioned on the last call, one of our Hatfield units had a 26-day unplanned outage. Decrease in volume has contributed to a projected decrease in unhedged energy margin of $24 million. However, this should be more than offset by a projected increase in power hedge margin of $36 million.
Turning to slide #29, we are expecting to generate $7 million more megawatt hours than in 2009. We have generated $25 million megawatt hours year-to-date through September. Our estimated realized price for the year is $38 per megawatt hour.
We are estimating a $27 million decrease in coal expense compared to the last call, due primarily to decreased generation volume. $47 million increase in capacity reflects $22 per megawatt day increase in capacity prices.
Other net revenues include $30 million for our Kern River hedge which ends this year. So in summary, weâ€™re expecting our merchant generation unhedged EBITDA to be better by $108 million versus last year.
Adjusted EBITDA is calculated on slide #30 by starting with the unhedged EBITDA from the prior slide and adjusting for the impact of our power hedge position. These hedges include financial hedges, our West Penn PLR contract, which expires at the end of the year and other marketing contracts.
The projected margin contribution of our hedges has increased from our last call reflecting lower energy prices. In the appendix, we provide additional information for analyzing the business and some high level pre-tax income sensitivities.
Moving on to slide #31, utility operations; EBITDA for utility operations is now expected to increase by $8 million. This is $32 million better than our estimate on the last call.
As previously mentioned we experienced an increase in customer load due to weather and growth in the third quarter of $22 million. For year-to-date, weâ€™ve experienced an increase of $27 million.
Slide 32 shows estimated growth in rate base for utility operations. Please note that these are only estimates and our plans are always subject to change. Our rate base forecast reflects the capital expenditures associated with the smart meter plan we filed with the Pennsylvania Commission on October 19. This represents a substantial reduction in the rate base for 2010 and 2011 compared to what we showed you on our last call.
We have also included $360 million, primarily in the outer years in transmission projects approved through the PJM RTEP process. Weâ€™re increasing our estimate for 2010 transmission expansion EBITDA primarily based upon the accelerated timing of TrAIL capital expenditures in 2010. TrAIL is expected to be in service in mid 2011, PATH is expected to be in service in 2015.
The rate base in our transmission expansion business is expected to grow to about $2.4 billion by 2014. In TrAIL and PATH, we earn a return in this business as capital expenditures are made. In addition to TrAIL and PATH, our estimate includes $155 million in additional PJM approved RTEP projects that will be constructed in our transmission expansion business.
Forecast for 2011 has changed from our last call because weâ€™ve reduced the TrAIL rate base by deferred taxes to reflect the recent extension of bonus depreciation for federal income tax purposes. This would reduce the rate base at TrAIL but would provide a cash benefit to Allegheny of $200 million over two years.
At the consolidated level, depreciation expense will increase by $43 million in 2010 due primarily to the scrubbers going into service in the second half of 2009. Fort Martin scrubbers will increase depreciation expense, but will not affect earnings because this expense is recovered through a surcharge.
Our capital forecast is reflected on slide #36. Weâ€™ve included the $515 million of PJM RTEP projects that I mentioned earlier.
Moving back to the income statement, 2010 current estimated interest expense is $51 million worse than 2009. Remember net interest expense for transmission expansion is recovered in formula rates. The Hatfield scrubbers have been placed in service and interest that was previously being capitalized will now be expensed.
Finally, while not reflected here we expect our effective tax rate in 2010 to be about 37% which is a little lower than our long-term expected run rate of about 38%. Additionally, in our third quarter update, weâ€™ve provided a detailed outlook for the next year.
Given our focus on completing the merger with FirstEnergy early next year, weâ€™re not providing a detailed outlook for 2011. We have provided information regarding the rate base investment for our utility operations and transmission expansion and information concerning commodity prices and our hedging activities as well as other information.
With that Iâ€™ll turn the call over to the operator for questions.

The biggest change by far in the generation is capacity revenues which we do lay out pretty clearly on page 45, itâ€™s close to $100 million, I mean, everything else. I think when you put it through I doubt youâ€™re going to find some significant reductions other than that under it. Weâ€™re also not providing any guidance, Iâ€™m saying just look through the volumes and look through the pricing, and what weâ€™ve sold since our hedges, weâ€™re kind of breakeven this year.
When you look at the unrealized margin, youâ€™re not seeing much change in either price or in volume. Well, I think that says a lot on that side. We do give rate base on transmission. We give rate base on regulated. I think Kirk mentioned, we got a further West Virginia rate increase coming in at $40 million.
