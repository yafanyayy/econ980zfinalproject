I'm pleased to be here and to have such good news to share with you this quarter. As you saw from our earnings press release, we had a very good quarter and an even stronger finish to the year. Revenue compari",1415,"Thanks, Gracia, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to be here and to have such good news to share with you this quarter. As you saw from our earnings press release, we had a very good quarter and an even stronger finish to the year. Revenue comparisons improved as the year progressed with fourth quarter comparisons being absolutely the best of the year. The last couple of weeks of the fourth quarter are important for any year and the momentum we had in early December continued as revenue came in even stronger than we had anticipated. We generated operating cash flow of $363 million for the quarter and $1.1 billion for the year. Quite an accomplishment in this troubled economy. We used the free cash flow to reduce our debt during the quarter by approximately $250 million and by $755 million for the year. Earnings per share were better than anticipated due to improved revenue trends, combined with the progress made on our cost structure and efficiency efforts. Of greater importance was our ability to increase income despite lagging revenue. I will go into more detail on that in just a few moments.To put these results in perspective, it's important to recall how the year began. At this point, in 2009, we knew that the year would have substantial challenges. That's certainly was the case. At the same time, however, we knew an unwavering focus on both executing on our strategic plan and fundamentally changing our cost structure were the keys to a stronger and well-positioned Gannett Co. in the wake of enormous economic uncertainty. We executed on both of these fronts and ended the year even stronger than when we've began. We highlighted several of our strategic in efficiency and initiatives in our presentations over the past year. Before we move to our fourth quarter results, I think it's important to review some of them in the context of content, cost restructuring and sales. Engaging relevant content is the keystone to successfully positioning the company for the future and an integral part of this has been our ContentOne initiative. The focus here is threefold: Efficient gathering and distribution of engaging content; driving collaboration among our businesses for both content and sales; and finally, finding new ways to deliver and monetize content. The content they are helping to create aggregate and share is being used by the majority of our sites and many of them have generated several million pages. At the same time, we are coordinating sales opportunities with potential advertisers. The power of ContentOne was evident as content around the crisis in Haiti was developed and delivered in just a few hours. Over the course of 2010, we expect ContentOne, not only to be intricately involved with day-to-day content generation and sharing, but also to be the center of our coverage efforts for major sporting events such as the Olympics, NCAA playoffs and spring training. But also for back-to-school, the Hollywood awards season and later on in the year, Halloween, Black Friday and the holiday shopping season.Another driver of success has been our efforts to permanently change our cost structure. This, as you can understand was a huge undertaking and a difficult one that impacts a lot of people. And there are employees deserve the credit and the right recognition for our success here. This is particularly important in our Publishing segment. As we have noted, consolidation of printing operations as well as centralization of some production operations has had a very significant, in fact, permanent impact on our expenses. We will achieve additional efficiencies as we centralize ad production in two centers over the course of this year. While creating greater efficiencies is a key driver of this effort, of equal importance, is our focus on rising quality and service for advertisers across all of our markets.We also have made good progress on our efforts to transform our approach to advertising from transactional to solutions-based marketing. We know the value of local advertising and are working to capture more of the local ad spend through this approach to marketing. A great example of this is the regional client solutions group we are developing in the U.S. Community Publishing and will launch this year. These groups will operate like advertising agencies and create customized marketing solutions and campaigns for our local advertisers. Testing has gone well with positive results in all of the test markets.In the Broadcasting segment, we are focused here as well on local coverage and content and generating local sales. This year, we are preparing for the Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver on our NBC stations and we'll approach our coverage with cross-divisional, cross-platform execution. Political and issue spending will, of course, be a tremendous opportunity for us to some degree early in the year but primarily in the latter half. Cross-divisional efforts are also critical component of the Gannett Digital network. We have a unique set of assets across the company that offer a wide reach as well as customized solutions bringing the breadth and diversity of all these customers touch points together. To benefit advertisers provides us a potentially significant opportunity as we return to a more stable or growing economic environment. As is evidenced in our results this quarter, progress made on the cost front, both here and in the U.K. have resulted in a higher level of free cash flow and significant debt reduction. At the UBS conference, we told you that we were very comfortable with the high end of consensus estimates and we achieved these results that significantly exceeded those expectations. So let me briefly cover key results from today's quarterly announcement and then turn the call over to Gracia.Earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis were $0.56 per share. Earnings per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes special items were $0.72 per share. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2008 on a comparable non-GAAP basis were $0.85 per share. We generated total revenue in the quarter of $1.5 billion, a decline of approximately 14%. However, this is the best year-over-year comparison quarter in 2009 by a wide margin, almost nine percentage points better than the third quarter on a pro forma basis. Sequential improvement for each month in the quarter resulted in a decline in total revenue in December of just 4% on a pro forma basis easily the best comparison month of the year.Comps got a little easier. We are not in positive territory yet, but we are absolutely seeing improving trends and firmer advertising demand across our businesses. In publishing, the strong finish was led by greatly improving trends in national as well as classified advertising. Broadcasting revenue comparisons were hindered by the relative lack of political advertising this quarter. However, excluding political, television revenues were up solidly in the quarter as were Captivate's revenues. PointRoll and ShopLocal delivered strong double-digit revenue growth in digital. Companywide, our digital metrics were up in December and total digital revenue topped $245 million in the quarter, or about 17% of the revenues.Total operating expenses, excluding special items declined over 17%, reflecting the impact of numerous cost-efficiency efforts that were undertaken last year and continue to be a focus. We benefited from significantly lower newsprint expense in the quarter due to a sharp decline in usage prices combined with lower consumption. As I noted earlier, perhaps the most important outcome for the quarter is the operating leverage we created. Expense reductions outpaced revenue decline in the quarter. And as a result, our pretax income adjusted for special items increased about 1% despite the declines in revenues and substantially lower political related ad demand. Similarly, in our Publishing segment, operating income, excluding special items from both quarters was 5.5% higher this year than 2008's quarter. And in broadcasting, operating income, excluding special items, which is $19 million lower in the quarter despite a decline in politically related ad demand of $47 million. Our goal was to permanently restructure our costs given the constrained revenue we faced. As our results indicate, we are successfully bringing more revenue to the bottom line and we are a leaner, stronger company as we move into 2010. Gracia will go into our results in some detail, but before I hand the call over to her, I once again would like to thank the outstanding efforts of all of our employees in an extremely challenging year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gracia."

As Craig noted, we are realizing operating leverage as a result of the cost restructurings we've done and ad trend improvement",1863,"Thanks, Craig. I'll provide a little more detail on our operating segments and cover some non-operating and balance sheet items. As Craig noted, we are realizing operating leverage as a result of the cost restructurings we've done and ad trend improvements. We are more profitable on a pretax basis, excluding special items this quarter than we were a year ago even though revenues were lower especially political. In each of our business segments, moderating revenue declines and lower expense levels are favorably impacting the bottom line. There were several special items in both quarters and so assessing the performance, excluding those items can be a little bit challenging. So let me provide some additional detail to make those comparisons easier. And as a reminder, all of the revenue category stats have been included in the release this morning. So I'll focus on the highlights for each of the segments and primarily the changes in year-over-year comparisons quarter-to-quarter.Let me begin with publishing. Revenue trends, they were very similar to the total trends Craig covered. Total revenues in publishing lagged last year but we're almost eight percentage points better than the third quarter comparison. Total advertising revenue was over 10 percentage points better. Ad revenue results in December were the best comparison month of the year, 10% lower. All publishing category comparisons were better in the quarter led by national and classified, both of which improved 15 percentage points against the third quarter comparison. National advertising had a particularly strong finish and was up in the high single digits in December. And I'll just stress that a little bit more later. The trend of moderating declines occurred both here and in the U.K. In the U.S., ad revenue was down 18% although again, eight percentage points better than the third quarter. Classified improved 12 percentage points relative to the third quarter comparison as auto and employment declines improved 15% and 17 percentage points, respectively. Classified advertising was down 15% in December in the U.S.At Newsquest, similar trends occurred particularly in classified advertising, which although down about 23% in pounds improved 11 percentage points from the third quarter decline. In December, due in part to an absolute increase in real estate of over 4%, classified advertising was 17% lower. Retail and national advertising, both improved well over several percentage points relative to the third quarter decline. As I noted, national advertising for the Publishing segment finished the quarter on a strong note, advancing from a mid-20s percentage decline in October to an increase of almost 9% in December. The primary drivers were a significant ad growth at USA WEEKEND as well as positive results for national advertising at U.S. Community Publishing sites. Ad revenue at USA TODAY was down an approximately 22% in the quarter but just 2% lower in December. The slowdown in business travel and the lodging industry has continued to impact USA TODAY. We did see growth in several categories in the quarter but it was offset by softness in the travel, retail and financial areas. Turning to expenses, our efforts to permanently restructure our cost base and create efficiencies have taken hold in a meaningful way. In publishing, pro forma operating expenses, excluding special items in both quarters dropped 18%, reflecting the impact of workforce restructuring as well as facility consolidations in 2009 and the prior year. These consolidation efforts still remain a focus as the division presidents indicated at the UBS conference as we move into 2010. The decline also represents significantly lower newsprint expense, down over 50% for the quarter. Sharply lower usage prices as well as lower consumption drove the decline. And let me just give you a quick update on newsprint given recent pricing trends. For a variety of reasons, including exchange rates and pricing below cash flow break-even levels for producers, producers have made lots of price increase announcements. But their price recovery efforts have struggled as these increases have been delayed and altered. Current industry price indexes confirmed this trend, which is further challenged by regional price fragmentation. We have budgeted conservatively for 2010 in the event that newsprint production is adjusted to keep pace with demand. In the U.K., where fixed prices are negotiated on an annual basis, 2009 represented a bit of an anomaly as prices were adjusted downward at mid-year due to lower usage. Newsquest prices will decline in the low double digits in 2010. Publishing operating income was higher in the quarter, excluding special items, reflecting the faster pace of expense reductions and moderating revenue declines. Publishing segment operating cash flow was also higher, adjusted for workforce restructuring charges of about $43 million last year and over $3 million in the fourth quarter this year. So despite a revenue decline of over $208 million, adjusted operating income was $11 million higher in the quarter.In our Broadcasting segment, the challenge again this quarter was overcoming the politically related advertising we so successfully achieved last year over $58 million. However, the underlying ad demand for television is encouraging as core revenues in the quarter, which exclude political were up about 11%. Double-digit growth in the medical immediate categories drove much of the improvement. Retail, which has replaced auto as our largest single category was up a few percentage points. And while the auto category lagged last year, the year-over-year comparison in the quarter improved significantly relative to previous quarters and is pacing up nicely in the first quarter. Higher retransmission revenues totaling $14 million and a 21% increase in revenue growth at Captivate partially offset the impact of political advertising. On the expense side, total expenses in broadcasting declined 9.4%, again excluding special items, reflecting efficiency and cost control efforts. As Craig noted, broadcast operating income, excluding those special items was down just $19 million despite a decline in revenue of about 14%, driven primarily by $47 million lower political revenue. Looking to the first quarter, we will have the benefit of the Winter Olympics Games in Vancouver on our NBC affiliates and overall firming of ad demand. So at this point, we expect the percentage increase in first quarter television revenues to be up in the very, very high single digits, if not touch the double digits and that's early in the quarter, obviously. One note about first quarter television revenue growth, six of our CBS affiliates will have ad demand associated with the Super Bowl. However, because we are going up against last year's Super Bowl on our 12 NBC affiliates, we won't generate as much revenue on that event.Turning to the Digital segment, total revenues were $158 million in the quarter, down about 7%. Strong double-digit growth by both PointRoll and ShopLocal over 40% and 30%, respectively, partially offset the impact of lower employment ad demand on CareerBuilder's results. Operating expenses were about 3% lower and excluding special items, they were down over 8%. In addition, expenses were impacted by accrued costs for an employee incentive comp plan that is tied to the performance of certain digital businesses over a several year period. Excluding both the special items and the incentive comp plan charge, operating expenses would have been down more than 10%, again outpacing the revenue decline. So operating income would have been up in the high teens as a percentage and operating cash flow would have increased in the high single digits on a percentage basis. In addition, CareerBuilder is cycling substantial cost reductions done in the fourth quarter of '08. The adjusted cash flow margin for the Digital segment for the fourth quarter was in the mid-20s as a percentage, up several percentage points from a year ago. Focusing for a second on CareerBuilder, North American network revenue was about 20% lower in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter a year ago and totaled about $131 million. CareerBuilder's own sales efforts represent about 85% of that number and the balance is the revenue from the network of owner-affiliated newspapers. As we noted earlier, lagging demand from employment advertising had an impact on CareerBuilder's revenue results as did limited upsell opportunities for the publishing affiliates. As Craig mentioned, digital revenues companywide were approximately $245 million in the quarter and $925 million in '09. The metrics we track, such as unique visitors, page views and visits were all up in the month of December compared to December of 2008 and sequentially month-over-month to November of this year. At U.S. Community Publishing, online employment was lower in the quarter as we await job stability and growth in the country. Excluding online employment, online at our domestic community publishing sites would have been up in the low single digits. The national auto and retail categories almost 60% of U.S. Community Publishing's online revenues were all up in the quarter. USATODAY.com also turned in a strong performance with revenues up in the high teens. Improved results from certain digital investments in the quarter drove a substantial increase in our equity income. Excluding special items in both years, equity income was actually $8 million this quarter compared to $3.6 million last year. And then moving quickly to the balance sheet, we reduced long-term debt during the quarter $250 million to $3.06 billion. For the year, we reduced debt by about $755 million or 20%. Our own cost of debt is about 5%, which reflects the change and the mix of debt with the issuance of our new long-term bonds in the fourth quarter. Balances under our revolving credit agreements now total approximately $1.3 billion. We have much more than ample capacity under our revolving credit facilities and a significant amount of free cash to pay our maturities in 2011 and beyond. And with a senior leverage ratio of just 2.63x, we are very well positioned relative to the sole financial covenant, which has a ceiling of 3.5x. Cash and cash equivalents at year end totaled about $99 million. Finally, capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $22 million and $68 million for the year, a bit lower than we indicated in early December. And as always, CareerBuilder's capital expenditures, now that they are consolidated, are included in this number although they are entirely self-funding. Before I turn the call back to Craig, I always need to throw in my cautions for the upcoming quarter and remind you of several factors, which will impact it typically our smallest quarter of the year. We believe the economy, while on the mend clearly is still tenuous. We previously announced the furlough for the first quarter. It will affect fewer employees than the first quarter of '08, so the impact on expenses will be less significant. I mentioned the Super Bowl and more modest expectations there given our station's affiliate weightings [ph]. And finally, we are hearing from our folks in the U.K. that the winter snowy weather there had an impact on commerce and advertising demand in January. That being said, we are very pleased with the momentum we enjoyed coming out of the fourth quarter. And with some help from the economy, look forward to a continuing in a meaningful way. And now, I'll turn the call back to Craig before we take your questions."

Similarly with our television side, I'm feeling good about, again, the momentum we saw and looking at even a little bit better results than we were even anticipating in early December. As I mentioned at Newsquest, a little bit of bad weather there. I guess it snowed for about three weeks standing.

And when we take a look at political, I have to say this; although, as I commented earlier, probably the bulk of this is going to go into the back half. But when you take a look at it, we will have issue money going continuously through the year in 15 of the U.S. Senate races will take place in 19 of our markets. When you take a look at the gubernatorial, 18 of our 19 markets will have opportunity. So I am very enthusiastic and positive and certainly with the Supreme Court ruling a couple of weeks ago now, there could also be some other directions that political or issue does come to the table. Gracia, you want to talk on free cash flow?"

I'd say on the digital side, we're seeing some firming plus maybe better actual rates on the digital side. But overall, I think what we're trying to do is focus on putting together packages for advertisers that really move the needle by utilizing all of our various platforms that we have. And then on the circulation side, I think we'll have just get back to you with those specific numbers. I think the trend was a little bit better than the third quarter. I know that Bob Dickey indicated in December at UBS that we were spending additional dollars in that area on stock pressure, particularly in those days that matter a great deal to advertisers such as Sunday. And I think he reported that there were several newspapers where our Sunday circulation actually was above 2008 circulation.

I think that the big surprise, if you will, the low end of this thing being in that $499 or less range, was quite a surprise. Now typically, what we can look at from history is after the first six months, there'll be another price decline. I don't know if that's going to be the case, but if it is I think it would then certainly become a more mainline opportunity. And certainly, as you get into that kind of situation, I think we're going to very quickly know what direction that can point us. And I think at this point, because all of the old apps, I shouldn't say old, but the previously written ones for the iPhone itself will certainly work on this, but I think a lot of format changes will help make it a far better user experience as they reformat them for the new device. So we're taking a very, very close look at this and you never want to suggest or rule out anything that Apple would put out.

We announced furloughs for the first quarter this year in some areas where so the impact will be a smaller impact in the first quarter of 2010 than it was in the first quarter of 2009. And with regard to future furloughs, again, those are not things that you want to do. We'll just have to see how the economy is faring and business conditions are as we get closer to the second quarter. On the newsprint side, we would have gotten more benefit from newsprint in the third and fourth quarters than we got in the first and second quarters. We expect to continue to have favorable newsprint comparisons in both the first and the second quarters, at least of 2010. So there's a variety of pieces at work here that go in a variety of different directions. And then, of course, CareerBuilder, as we mentioned earlier, they took a number of actions in the fourth quarter of 2008 that we would have cycled in part in 2009.

So we'll continue to do that. We're pleased, though, that the momentum that we got out of the fourth quarter was very much on the revenue side.

Revenue compari",1416,"Thanks, Gracia, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to be here and to have such good news to share with you this quarter. As you saw from our earnings press release, we had a very good quarter and an even stronger finish to the year. Revenue comparisons improved as the year progressed with fourth quarter comparisons being absolutely the best of the year. The last couple of weeks of the fourth quarter are important for any year and the momentum we had in early December continued as revenue came in even stronger than we had anticipated. We generated operating cash flow of $363 million for the quarter and $1.1 billion for the year. Quite an accomplishment in this troubled economy. We used the free cash flow to reduce our debt during the quarter by approximately $250 million and by $755 million for the year. Earnings per share were better than anticipated due to improved revenue trends, combined with the progress made on our cost structure and efficiency efforts. Of greater importance was our ability to increase income despite lagging revenue. I will go into more detail on that in just a few moments.To put these results in perspective, it's important to recall how the year began. At this point, in 2009, we knew that the year would have substantial challenges. That's certainly was the case. At the same time, however, we knew an unwavering focus on both executing on our strategic plan and fundamentally changing our cost structure were the keys to a stronger and well-positioned Gannett Co. in the wake of enormous economic uncertainty. We executed on both of these fronts and ended the year even stronger than when we've began. We highlighted several of our strategic in efficiency and initiatives in our presentations over the past year. Before we move to our fourth quarter results, I think it's important to review some of them in the context of content, cost restructuring and sales. Engaging relevant content is the keystone to successfully positioning the company for the future and an integral part of this has been our ContentOne initiative. The focus here is threefold: Efficient gathering and distribution of engaging content; driving collaboration among our businesses for both content and sales; and finally, finding new ways to deliver and monetize content. The content they are helping to create aggregate and share is being used by the majority of our sites and many of them have generated several million pages. At the same time, we are coordinating sales opportunities with potential advertisers. The power of ContentOne was evident as content around the crisis in Haiti was developed and delivered in just a few hours. Over the course of 2010, we expect ContentOne, not only to be intricately involved with day-to-day content generation and sharing, but also to be the center of our coverage efforts for major sporting events such as the Olympics, NCAA playoffs and spring training. But also for back-to-school, the Hollywood awards season and later on in the year, Halloween, Black Friday and the holiday shopping season.Another driver of success has been our efforts to permanently change our cost structure. This, as you can understand was a huge undertaking and a difficult one that impacts a lot of people. And there are employees deserve the credit and the right recognition for our success here. This is particularly important in our Publishing segment. As we have noted, consolidation of printing operations as well as centralization of some production operations has had a very significant, in fact, permanent impact on our expenses. We will achieve additional efficiencies as we centralize ad production in two centers over the course of this year. While creating greater efficiencies is a key driver of this effort, of equal importance, is our focus on rising quality and service for advertisers across all of our markets.We also have made good progress on our efforts to transform our approach to advertising from transactional to solutions-based marketing. We know the value of local advertising and are working to capture more of the local ad spend through this approach to marketing. A great example of this is the regional client solutions group we are developing in the U.S. Community Publishing and will launch this year. These groups will operate like advertising agencies and create customized marketing solutions and campaigns for our local advertisers. Testing has gone well with positive results in all of the test markets.In the Broadcasting segment, we are focused here as well on local coverage and content and generating local sales. This year, we are preparing for the Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver on our NBC stations and we'll approach our coverage with cross-divisional, cross-platform execution. Political and issue spending will, of course, be a tremendous opportunity for us to some degree early in the year but primarily in the latter half. Cross-divisional efforts are also critical component of the Gannett Digital network. We have a unique set of assets across the company that offer a wide reach as well as customized solutions bringing the breadth and diversity of all these customers touch points together. To benefit advertisers provides us a potentially significant opportunity as we return to a more stable or growing economic environment. As is evidenced in our results this quarter, progress made on the cost front, both here and in the U.K. have resulted in a higher level of free cash flow and significant debt reduction. At the UBS conference, we told you that we were very comfortable with the high end of consensus estimates and we achieved these results that significantly exceeded those expectations. So let me briefly cover key results from today's quarterly announcement and then turn the call over to Gracia.Earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis were $0.56 per share. Earnings per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes special items were $0.72 per share. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2008 on a comparable non-GAAP basis were $0.85 per share. We generated total revenue in the quarter of $1.5 billion, a decline of approximately 14%. However, this is the best year-over-year comparison quarter in 2009 by a wide margin, almost nine percentage points better than the third quarter on a pro forma basis. Sequential improvement for each month in the quarter resulted in a decline in total revenue in December of just 4% on a pro forma basis, easily the best comparison month of the year.Comps got a little easier. We are not in positive territory yet, but we are absolutely seeing improving trends and firmer advertising demand across our businesses. In publishing, the strong finish was led by greatly improving trends in national, as well as classified advertising. Broadcasting revenue comparisons were hindered by the relative lack of political advertising this quarter. However, excluding political, television revenues were up solidly in the quarter as were Captivate's revenues. PointRoll and ShopLocal delivered strong double-digit revenue growth in digital. Companywide, our digital metrics were up in December and total digital revenue topped $245 million in the quarter, or about 17% of the revenues.Total operating expenses, excluding special items declined over 17%, reflecting the impact of numerous cost-efficiency efforts that were undertaken last year and continue to be a focus. We benefited from significantly lower newsprint expense in the quarter due to a sharp decline in usage prices combined with lower consumption. As I noted earlier, perhaps the most important outcome for the quarter is the operating leverage we created. Expense reductions outpaced revenue decline in the quarter. And as a result, our pretax income adjusted for special items increased about 1% despite the declines in revenues and substantially lower political related ad demand. Similarly, in our Publishing segment, operating income, excluding special items from both quarters was 5.5% higher this year than 2008's fourth quarter. And in broadcasting, operating income, excluding special items, which is $19 million lower in the quarter despite a decline in politically related ad demand of $47 million. Our goal was to permanently restructure our costs given the constrained revenue we faced. As our results indicate, we are successfully bringing more revenue to the bottom line and we are a leaner, stronger company as we move into 2010. Gracia will go into our results in some detail, but before I hand the call over to her, I once again would like to thank the outstanding efforts of all of our employees in an extremely challenging year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gracia."

I'll provide a little more detail on our operating segments and cover some non-operating and balance sheet items. As Craig noted, we are realizing operating leverage as a result of the cost restructurings we've done and ad trend improvements. We are more profitable on a pretax basis, excluding special items this quarter than we were a year ago even though revenues were lower especially political. In each of our business segments, moderating revenue declines and lower expense levels are favorably impacting the bottom line. There were several special items in both quarters and so assessing the performance, excluding those items can be a little bit challenging. So let me provide some additional detail to make those comparisons easier. And as a reminder, all of the revenue category stats have been included in the release this morning. So I'll focus on the highlights for each of the segments and primarily the changes in year-over-year comparisons quarter-to-quarter.Let me begin with publishing. Revenue trends, they were very similar to the total trends Craig covered. Total revenues in publishing lagged last year but we're almost eight percentage points better than the third quarter comparison. Total advertising revenue was over 10 percentage points better. Ad revenue results in December were the best comparison month of the year, 10% lower. All publishing category comparisons were better in the quarter led by national and classified, both of which improved 15 percentage points against the third quarter comparison. National advertising had a particularly strong finish and was up in the high single digits in December. And I'll just stress that a little bit more later. The trend of moderating declines occurred both here and in the U.K. In the U.S., ad revenue was down 18% although again, eight percentage points better than the third quarter. Classified improved 12 percentage points relative to the third quarter comparison as auto and employment declines improved 15% and 17 percentage points, respectively. Classified advertising was down 15% in December in the U.S.At Newsquest, similar trends occurred particularly in classified advertising, which although down about 23% in pounds improved 11 percentage points from the third quarter decline. In December, due in part to an absolute increase in real estate of over 4%, classified advertising was 17% lower. Retail and national advertising, both improved well over several percentage points relative to the third quarter decline. As I noted, national advertising for the Publishing segment finished the quarter on a strong note, advancing from a mid-20s percentage decline in October to an increase of almost 9% in December. The primary drivers were a significant ad growth at USA WEEKEND as well as positive results for national advertising at U.S. Community Publishing sites. Ad revenue at USA TODAY was down an approximately 22% in the quarter but just 2% lower in December. The slowdown in business travel and the lodging industry has continued to impact USA TODAY. We did see growth in several categories in the quarter but it was offset by softness in the travel, retail and financial areas. Turning to expenses, our efforts to permanently restructure our cost base and create efficiencies have taken hold in a meaningful way. In publishing, pro forma operating expenses, excluding special items in both quarters dropped 18%, reflecting the impact of workforce restructuring as well as facility consolidations in 2009 and the prior year. These consolidation efforts still remain a focus as the division presidents indicated at the UBS conference as we move into 2010. The decline also represents significantly lower newsprint expense, down over 50% for the quarter. Sharply lower usage prices as well as lower consumption drove the decline. And let me just give you a quick update on newsprint given recent pricing trends. For a variety of reasons, including exchange rates and pricing below cash flow break-even levels for producers, producers have made lots of price increase announcements. But their price recovery efforts have struggled as these increases have been delayed and altered. Current industry price indexes confirmed this trend, which is further challenged by regional price fragmentation. We have budgeted conservatively for 2010 in the event that newsprint production is adjusted to keep pace with demand. In the U.K., where fixed prices are negotiated on an annual basis, 2009 represented a bit of an anomaly as prices were adjusted downward at mid-year due to lower usage. Newsquest prices will decline in the low double digits in 2010. Publishing operating income was higher in the quarter, excluding special items, reflecting the faster pace of expense reductions and moderating revenue declines. Publishing segment operating cash flow was also higher, adjusted for workforce restructuring charges of about $43 million last year and over $3 million in the fourth quarter this year. So despite a revenue decline of over $208 million, adjusted operating income was $11 million higher in the quarter.In our Broadcasting segment, the challenge again this quarter was overcoming the politically related advertising we so successfully achieved last year over $58 million. However, the underlying ad demand for television is encouraging as core revenues in the quarter, which exclude political were up about 11%. Double-digit growth in the medical and media categories drove much of the improvement. Retail, which has replaced auto as our largest single category was up a few percentage points. And while the auto category lagged last year, the year-over-year comparison in the quarter improved significantly relative to previous quarters and is pacing up nicely in the first quarter. Higher retransmission revenues totaling $14 million and a 21% increase in revenue growth at Captivate partially offset the impact of political advertising. On the expense side, total expenses in broadcasting declined 9.4%, again excluding special items, reflecting efficiency and cost control efforts. As Craig noted, broadcast operating income, excluding those special items was down just $19 million despite a decline in revenue of about 14%, driven primarily by $47 million lower political revenue. Looking to the first quarter, we will have the benefit of the Winter Olympics Games in Vancouver on our NBC affiliates and overall firming of ad demand. So at this point, we expect the percentage increase in first quarter television revenues to be up in the very, very high single digits, if not touch the double digits and that's early in the quarter, obviously. One note about first quarter television revenue growth, six of our CBS affiliates will have ad demand associated with the Super Bowl. However, because we are going up against last year's Super Bowl on our 12 NBC affiliates, we won't generate as much revenue on that event.Turning to the Digital segment, total revenues were $158 million in the quarter, down about 7%. Strong double-digit growth by both PointRoll and ShopLocal over 40% and 30%, respectively, partially offset the impact of lower employment ad demand on CareerBuilder's results. Operating expenses were about 3% lower and excluding special items, they were down over 8%. In addition, expenses were impacted by accrued costs for an employee incentive comp plan that is tied to the performance of certain digital businesses over a several year period. Excluding both the special items and the incentive comp plan charge, operating expenses would have been down more than 10%, again outpacing the revenue decline. So operating income would have been up in the high teens as a percentage and operating cash flow would have increased in the high single digits on a percentage basis. In addition, CareerBuilder is cycling substantial cost reductions done in the fourth quarter of '08. The adjusted cash flow margin for the Digital segment for the fourth quarter was in the mid-20s as a percentage, up several percentage points from a year ago. Focusing for a second on CareerBuilder, North American network revenue was about 20% lower in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter a year ago and totaled about $131 million. CareerBuilder's own sales efforts represent about 85% of that number and the balance is the revenue from the network of owner-affiliated newspapers. As we noted earlier, lagging demand from employment advertising had an impact on CareerBuilder's revenue results as did limited upsell opportunities for the publishing affiliates. As Craig mentioned, digital revenues companywide were approximately $245 million in the quarter and $925 million in '09. The metrics we track, such as unique visitors, page views and visits were all up in the month of December compared to December of 2008 and sequentially month-over-month to November of this year. At U.S. Community Publishing, online employment was lower in the quarter as we await job stability and growth in the country. Excluding online employment, online at our domestic community publishing sites would have been up in the low single digits. The national auto and retail categories almost 60% of U.S. Community Publishing's online revenues were all up in the quarter. USATODAY.com also turned in a strong performance with revenues up in the high teens. Improved results from certain digital investments in the quarter drove a substantial increase in our equity income. Excluding special items in both years, equity income was actually $8 million this quarter compared to $3.6 million last year. And then moving quickly to the balance sheet, we reduced long-term debt during the quarter $250 million to $3.06 billion. For the year, we reduced debt by about $755 million or 20%. Our own cost of debt is about 5%, which reflects the change and the mix of debt with the issuance of our new long-term bonds in the fourth quarter. Balances under our revolving credit agreements now total approximately $1.3 billion. We have much more than ample capacity under our revolving credit facilities and a significant amount of free cash to pay our maturities in 2011 and beyond. And with a senior leverage ratio of just 2.63x, we are very well positioned relative to the sole financial covenant, which has a ceiling of 3.5x. Cash and cash equivalents at year end totaled about $99 million. Finally, capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $22 million and $68 million for the year, a bit lower than we indicated in early December. And as always, CareerBuilder's capital expenditures, now that they are consolidated, are included in this number although they are entirely self-funding. Before I turn the call back to Craig, I always need to throw in my cautions for the upcoming quarter and remind you of several factors, which will impact it typically our smallest quarter of the year. We believe the economy, while on the mend clearly is still tenuous. We previously announced the furlough for the first quarter. It will affect fewer employees than the first quarter of '08, so the impact on expenses will be less significant. I mentioned the Super Bowl and more modest expectations there given our station's affiliate weightings. And finally, we are hearing from our folks in the U.K. that the winter snowy weather there had an impact on commerce and advertising demand in January. That being said, we are very pleased with the momentum we enjoyed coming out of the fourth quarter. And with some help from the economy, look forward to a continuing in a meaningful way. And now, I'll turn the call back to Craig before we take your questions."

We're going to be down only because we have six versus 12 properties, but we are anticipating -- certainly, this could potentially be one of the highest watched names in a long, long time. So we are very positive there, but again, just because of roughly half of the number of properties that we have, that will be down. The Leno impact, I think, it's obvious what has happened. We have talked about this since the show began in the 10:00 time period. And I think with the decisions they're making, we can further improve once the Olympics are over. Again, it's a piecemeal in how they're putting that together. They don't fully have their programming lineup put together, as you know, in the way that they applied the cash instead of to development. It went to their bottom line or so they say. And when we take a look at political, I have to say this; although, as I commented earlier, probably the bulk of this is going to go into the back half. But when you take a look at it, we will have issue money going continuously through the year in 15 of the U.S. Senate races will take place in 19 of our markets. When you take a look at the gubernatorial, 18 of our 19 markets will have opportunity.

And then on the circulation side, I think we'll have just get back to you with those specific numbers. I think the trend was a little bit better than the third quarter. I know that Bob Dickey indicated in December at UBS that we were spending additional dollars in that area on stock pressure, particularly in those days that matter a great deal to advertisers such as Sunday.

I think that the big surprise, if you will, the low end of this thing being in that $499 or less range, was quite a surprise.

I don't know if that's going to be the case, but if it is I think it would then certainly become a more mainline opportunity. And certainly, as you get into that kind of situation, I think we're going to very quickly know what direction that can point us. And I think at this point, because all of the old apps, I shouldn't say old, but the previously written ones for the iPhone itself will certainly work on this, but I think a lot of format changes will help make it a far better user experience as they reformat them for the new device.

We'll just have to see how the economy is faring and business conditions are as we get closer to the second quarter.

Revenue compari",1416,"Thanks, Gracia, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to be here and to have such good news to share with you this quarter. As you saw from our earnings press release, we had a very good quarter and an even stronger finish to the year. Revenue comparisons improved as the year progressed with fourth quarter comparisons being absolutely the best of the year. The last couple of weeks of the fourth quarter are important for any year and the momentum we had in early December continued as revenue came in even stronger than we had anticipated. We generated operating cash flow of $363 million for the quarter and $1.1 billion for the year. Quite an accomplishment in this troubled economy. We used the free cash flow to reduce our debt during the quarter by approximately $250 million and by $755 million for the year. Earnings per share were better than anticipated due to improved revenue trends, combined with the progress made on our cost structure and efficiency efforts. Of greater importance was our ability to increase income despite lagging revenue. I will go into more detail on that in just a few moments.To put these results in perspective, it's important to recall how the year began. At this point, in 2009, we knew that the year would have substantial challenges. That's certainly was the case. At the same time, however, we knew an unwavering focus on both executing on our strategic plan and fundamentally changing our cost structure were the keys to a stronger and well-positioned Gannett Co. in the wake of enormous economic uncertainty. We executed on both of these fronts and ended the year even stronger than when we've began. We highlighted several of our strategic in efficiency and initiatives in our presentations over the past year. Before we move to our fourth quarter results, I think it's important to review some of them in the context of content, cost restructuring and sales. Engaging relevant content is the keystone to successfully positioning the company for the future and an integral part of this has been our ContentOne initiative. The focus here is threefold: Efficient gathering and distribution of engaging content; driving collaboration among our businesses for both content and sales; and finally, finding new ways to deliver and monetize content. The content they are helping to create aggregate and share is being used by the majority of our sites and many of them have generated several million pages. At the same time, we are coordinating sales opportunities with potential advertisers. The power of ContentOne was evident as content around the crisis in Haiti was developed and delivered in just a few hours. Over the course of 2010, we expect ContentOne, not only to be intricately involved with day-to-day content generation and sharing, but also to be the center of our coverage efforts for major sporting events such as the Olympics, NCAA playoffs and spring training. But also for back-to-school, the Hollywood awards season and later on in the year, Halloween, Black Friday and the holiday shopping season.Another driver of success has been our efforts to permanently change our cost structure. This, as you can understand was a huge undertaking and a difficult one that impacts a lot of people. And there are employees deserve the credit and the right recognition for our success here. This is particularly important in our Publishing segment. As we have noted, consolidation of printing operations as well as centralization of some production operations has had a very significant, in fact, permanent impact on our expenses. We will achieve additional efficiencies as we centralize ad production in two centers over the course of this year. While creating greater efficiencies is a key driver of this effort, of equal importance, is our focus on rising quality and service for advertisers across all of our markets.We also have made good progress on our efforts to transform our approach to advertising from transactional to solutions-based marketing. We know the value of local advertising and are working to capture more of the local ad spend through this approach to marketing. A great example of this is the regional client solutions group we are developing in the U.S. Community Publishing and will launch this year. These groups will operate like advertising agencies and create customized marketing solutions and campaigns for our local advertisers. Testing has gone well with positive results in all of the test markets.In the Broadcasting segment, we are focused here as well on local coverage and content and generating local sales. This year, we are preparing for the Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver on our NBC stations and we'll approach our coverage with cross-divisional, cross-platform execution. Political and issue spending will, of course, be a tremendous opportunity for us to some degree early in the year but primarily in the latter half. Cross-divisional efforts are also critical component of the Gannett Digital network. We have a unique set of assets across the company that offer a wide reach as well as customized solutions bringing the breadth and diversity of all these customers touch points together. To benefit advertisers provides us a potentially significant opportunity as we return to a more stable or growing economic environment. As is evidenced in our results this quarter, progress made on the cost front, both here and in the U.K. have resulted in a higher level of free cash flow and significant debt reduction. At the UBS conference, we told you that we were very comfortable with the high end of consensus estimates and we achieved these results that significantly exceeded those expectations. So let me briefly cover key results from today's quarterly announcement and then turn the call over to Gracia.Earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis were $0.56 per share. Earnings per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes special items were $0.72 per share. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2008 on a comparable non-GAAP basis were $0.85 per share. We generated total revenue in the quarter of $1.5 billion, a decline of approximately 14%. However, this is the best year-over-year comparison quarter in 2009 by a wide margin, almost nine percentage points better than the third quarter on a pro forma basis. Sequential improvement for each month in the quarter resulted in a decline in total revenue in December of just 4% on a pro forma basis, easily the best comparison month of the year.Comps got a little easier. We are not in positive territory yet, but we are absolutely seeing improving trends and firmer advertising demand across our businesses. In publishing, the strong finish was led by greatly improving trends in national, as well as classified advertising. Broadcasting revenue comparisons were hindered by the relative lack of political advertising this quarter. However, excluding political, television revenues were up solidly in the quarter as were Captivate's revenues. PointRoll and ShopLocal delivered strong double-digit revenue growth in digital. Companywide, our digital metrics were up in December and total digital revenue topped $245 million in the quarter, or about 17% of the revenues.Total operating expenses, excluding special items declined over 17%, reflecting the impact of numerous cost-efficiency efforts that were undertaken last year and continue to be a focus. We benefited from significantly lower newsprint expense in the quarter due to a sharp decline in usage prices combined with lower consumption. As I noted earlier, perhaps the most important outcome for the quarter is the operating leverage we created. Expense reductions outpaced revenue decline in the quarter. And as a result, our pretax income adjusted for special items increased about 1% despite the declines in revenues and substantially lower political related ad demand. Similarly, in our Publishing segment, operating income, excluding special items from both quarters was 5.5% higher this year than 2008's fourth quarter. And in broadcasting, operating income, excluding special items, which is $19 million lower in the quarter despite a decline in politically related ad demand of $47 million. Our goal was to permanently restructure our costs given the constrained revenue we faced. As our results indicate, we are successfully bringing more revenue to the bottom line and we are a leaner, stronger company as we move into 2010. Gracia will go into our results in some detail, but before I hand the call over to her, I once again would like to thank the outstanding efforts of all of our employees in an extremely challenging year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gracia."

I'll provide a little more detail on our operating segments and cover some non-operating and balance sheet items. As Craig noted, we are realizing operating leverage as a result of the cost restructurings we've done and ad trend improvement",1863,"Thanks, Craig. I'll provide a little more detail on our operating segments and cover some non-operating and balance sheet items. As Craig noted, we are realizing operating leverage as a result of the cost restructurings we've done and ad trend improvements. We are more profitable on a pretax basis, excluding special items this quarter than we were a year ago even though revenues were lower especially political. In each of our business segments, moderating revenue declines and lower expense levels are favorably impacting the bottom line. There were several special items in both quarters and so assessing the performance, excluding those items can be a little bit challenging. So let me provide some additional detail to make those comparisons easier. And as a reminder, all of the revenue category stats have been included in the release this morning. So I'll focus on the highlights for each of the segments and primarily the changes in year-over-year comparisons quarter-to-quarter.Let me begin with publishing. Revenue trends, they were very similar to the total trends Craig covered. Total revenues in publishing lagged last year but we're almost eight percentage points better than the third quarter comparison. Total advertising revenue was over 10 percentage points better. Ad revenue results in December were the best comparison month of the year, 10% lower. All publishing category comparisons were better in the quarter led by national and classified, both of which improved 15 percentage points against the third quarter comparison. National advertising had a particularly strong finish and was up in the high single digits in December. And I'll just stress that a little bit more later. The trend of moderating declines occurred both here and in the U.K. In the U.S., ad revenue was down 18% although again, eight percentage points better than the third quarter. Classified improved 12 percentage points relative to the third quarter comparison as auto and employment declines improved 15 and 17 percentage points, respectively. Classified advertising was down 15% in December in the U.S.At Newsquest, similar trends occurred particularly in classified advertising, which although down about 23% in pounds improved 11 percentage points from the third quarter decline. In December, due in part to an absolute increase in real estate of over 4%, classified advertising was 17% lower. Retail and national advertising, both improved well over several percentage points relative to the third quarter decline. As I noted, national advertising for the Publishing segment finished the quarter on a strong note, advancing from a mid-20s percentage decline in October to an increase of almost 9% in December. The primary drivers were a significant ad growth at USA WEEKEND, as well as positive results for national advertising at U.S. Community Publishing sites. Ad revenue at USA TODAY was down an approximately 22% in the quarter but just 2% lower in December. The slowdown in business travel and the lodging industry has continued to impact USA TODAY. We did see growth in several categories in the quarter but it was offset by softness in the travel, retail and financial areas. Turning to expenses, our efforts to permanently restructure our cost base and create efficiencies have taken hold in a meaningful way. In publishing, pro forma operating expenses, excluding special items in both quarters dropped 18%, reflecting the impact of workforce restructuring as well as facility consolidations in 2009 and the prior year. These consolidation efforts still remain a focus as the division presidents indicated at the UBS conference as we move into 2010. The decline also represents significantly lower newsprint expense, down over 50% for the quarter. Sharply lower usage prices as well as lower consumption drove the decline. And let me just give you a quick update on newsprint given recent pricing trends. For a variety of reasons, including exchange rates and pricing below cash flow break-even levels for producers, producers have made lots of price increase announcements. But their price recovery efforts have struggled as these increases have been delayed and altered. Current industry price indexes confirm this trend, which is further challenged by regional price fragmentation. We have budgeted conservatively for 2010 in the event that newsprint production is adjusted to keep pace with demand. In the U.K., where fixed prices are negotiated on an annual basis, 2009 represented a bit of an anomaly as prices were adjusted downward at mid-year due to lower usage. Newsquest prices will decline in the low double digits in 2010. Publishing operating income was higher in the quarter, excluding special items, reflecting the faster pace of expense reductions and moderating revenue declines. Publishing segment operating cash flow was also higher, adjusted for workforce restructuring charges of about $43 million last year and over $3 million in the fourth quarter this year. So despite a revenue decline of over $208 million, adjusted operating income was $11 million higher in the quarter.In our Broadcasting segment, the challenge again this quarter was overcoming the politically related advertising we so successfully achieved last year over $58 million. However, the underlying ad demand for television is encouraging as core revenues in the quarter, which exclude political were up about 11%. Double-digit growth in the medical and media categories drove much of the improvement. Retail, which has replaced auto as our largest single category was up a few percentage points. And while the auto category lagged last year, the year-over-year comparison in the quarter improved significantly relative to previous quarters and is pacing up nicely in the first quarter. Higher retransmission revenues totaling $14 million and a 21% increase in revenue growth at Captivate partially offset the impact of political advertising. On the expense side, total expenses in broadcasting declined 9.4%, again excluding special items, reflecting efficiency and cost control efforts. As Craig noted, broadcast operating income, excluding those special items was down just $19 million despite a decline in revenue of about 14%, driven primarily by $47 million lower political revenue. Looking to the first quarter, we will have the benefit of the Winter Olympics Games in Vancouver on our NBC affiliates and overall firming of ad demand. So at this point, we expect the percentage increase in first quarter television revenues to be up in the very, very high single digits, if not touch the double digits and that's early in the quarter, obviously. One note about first quarter television revenue growth, six of our CBS affiliates will have ad demand associated with the Super Bowl. However, because we are going up against last year's Super Bowl on our 12 NBC affiliates, we won't generate as much revenue on that event.Turning to the Digital segment, total revenues were $158 million in the quarter, down about 7%. Strong double-digit growth by both PointRoll and ShopLocal over 40% and 30%, respectively, partially offset the impact of lower employment ad demand on CareerBuilder's results. Operating expenses were about 3% lower and excluding special items, they were down over 8%. In addition, expenses were impacted by accrued costs for an employee incentive comp plan that is tied to the performance of certain digital businesses over a several year period. Excluding both the special items and the incentive comp plan charge, operating expenses would have been down more than 10%, again outpacing the revenue decline. So operating income would have been up in the high teens as a percentage and operating cash flow would have increased in the high single digits on a percentage basis. In addition, CareerBuilder is cycling substantial cost reductions done in the fourth quarter of '08. The adjusted cash flow margin for the Digital segment for the fourth quarter was in the mid-20s as a percentage, up several percentage points from a year ago. Focusing for a second on CareerBuilder, North American network revenue was about 20% lower in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter a year ago and totaled about $131 million. CareerBuilder's own sales efforts represent about 85% of that number and the balance is the revenue from the network of owner-affiliated newspapers. As we noted earlier, lagging demand from employment advertising had an impact on CareerBuilder's revenue results as did limited upsell opportunities for the publishing affiliates. As Craig mentioned, digital revenues companywide were approximately $245 million in the quarter and $925 million in '09. The metrics we track, such as unique visitors, page views and visits were all up in the month of December compared to December of 2008 and sequentially month-over-month to November of this year. At U.S. Community Publishing, online employment was lower in the quarter as we await job stability and growth in the country. Excluding online employment, online at our domestic community publishing sites would have been up in the low single digits. The national auto and retail categories almost 60% of U.S. Community Publishing's online revenues were all up in the quarter. USATODAY.com also turned in a strong performance with revenues up in the high teens. Improved results from certain digital investments in the quarter drove a substantial increase in our equity income. Excluding special items in both years, equity income was actually $8 million this quarter compared to $3.6 million last year. And then moving quickly to the balance sheet, we reduced long-term debt during the quarter $250 million to $3.06 billion. For the year, we reduced debt by about $755 million or 20%. Our own cost of debt is about 5%, which reflects the change and the mix of debt with the issuance of our new long-term bonds in the fourth quarter. Balances under our revolving credit agreements now total approximately $1.3 billion. We have much more than ample capacity under our revolving credit facilities and a significant amount of free cash to pay our maturities in 2011 and beyond. And with a senior leverage ratio of just 2.63x, we are very well positioned relative to the sole financial covenant, which has a ceiling of 3.5x. Cash and cash equivalents at year end totaled about $99 million. Finally, capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $22 million and $68 million for the year, a bit lower than we indicated in early December. And as always, CareerBuilder's capital expenditures, now that they are consolidated, are included in this number although they are entirely self-funding. Before I turn the call back to Craig, I always need to throw in my cautions for the upcoming quarter and remind you of several factors, which will impact it typically our smallest quarter of the year. We believe the economy, while on the mend clearly is still tenuous. We previously announced the furlough for the first quarter. It will affect fewer employees than the first quarter of '08, so the impact on expenses will be less significant. I mentioned the Super Bowl and more modest expectations there given our station's affiliate weightings. And finally, we are hearing from our folks in the U.K. that the winter snowy weather there had an impact on commerce and advertising demand in January. That being said, we are very pleased with the momentum we enjoyed coming out of the fourth quarter. And with some help from the economy, look forward to a continuing in a meaningful way. And now, I'll turn the call back to Craig before we take your questions."

And what we had projected for the first quarter early in December, we're anticipating that we will exceed those projections on the ad revenue side in our U.S. Community Publishing side by a couple of percentage points. And it's still obviously very early in the quarter. Similarly with our television side, I'm feeling good about, again, the momentum we saw and looking at even a little bit better results than we were even anticipating in early December. As I mentioned at Newsquest, a little bit of bad weather there. I guess it snowed for about three weeks standing. And so that's had a little bit of an impact, but I know that our management team there feels good about the way we're going to end the quarter.

So we are very positive there, but again, just because of roughly half of the number of properties that we have, that will be down. The Leno impact, I think, it's obvious what has happened. We have talked about this since the show began in the 10:00 time period. And I think with the decisions they're making, we can further improve once the Olympics are over. Again, it's a piecemeal in how they're putting that together. They don't fully have their programming lineup put together, as you know, in the way that they applied the cash instead of to development. It went to their bottom line or so they say. And when we take a look at political, I have to say this; although, as I commented earlier, probably the bulk of this is going to go into the back half. But when you take a look at it, we will have issue money going continuously through the year in 15 of the U.S. Senate races will take place in 19 of our markets. When you take a look at the gubernatorial, 18 of our 19 markets will have opportunity.

I'd say on the digital side, we're seeing some firming plus maybe better actual rates on the digital side.

And then on the circulation side, I think we'll have just get back to you with those specific numbers. I think the trend was a little bit better than the third quarter. I know that Bob Dickey indicated in December at UBS that we were spending additional dollars in that area on stock pressure, particularly in those days that matter a great deal to advertisers such as Sunday. And I think he reported that there were several newspapers where our Sunday circulation actually was above 2008 circulation.

I think that the big surprise, if you will, the low end of this thing being in that $499 or less range, was quite a surprise.

I don't know if that's going to be the case, but if it is I think it would then certainly become a more mainline opportunity. And certainly, as you get into that kind of situation, I think we're going to very quickly know what direction that can point us. And I think at this point, because all of the old apps, I shouldn't say old, but the previously written ones for the iPhone itself will certainly work on this, but I think a lot of format changes will help make it a far better user experience as they reformat them for the new device.

We'll just have to see how the economy is faring and business conditions are as we get closer to the second quarter. On the newsprint side, we would have gotten more benefit from newsprint in the third and fourth quarters than we got in the first and second quarters. We expect to continue to have favorable newsprint comparisons in both the first and the second quarters, at least of 2010. So there's a variety of pieces at work here that go in a variety of different directions. And then, of course, at CareerBuilder, as we mentioned earlier, they took a number of actions in the fourth quarter of 2008 that we would have cycled in part in 2009. But I think, as a general philosophical statement, we are committed here at Gannett, as we have said for the last few years, of making sure that we continue to size our business appropriately, both from an expense and looking at where the revenue opportunity is. So we'll continue to do that. We're pleased, though, that the momentum that we got out of the fourth quarter was very much on the revenue side. And that's really the most important thing that we're going to be focused on in the 2010, while never losing sight of what we need to do on the expense side."

Revenue compari",1416,"Thanks, Gracia, and good morning to everyone. I'm pleased to be here and to have such good news to share with you this quarter. As you saw from our earnings press release, we had a very good quarter and an even stronger finish to the year. Revenue comparisons improved as the year progressed with fourth quarter comparisons being absolutely the best of the year. The last couple of weeks of the fourth quarter are important for any year and the momentum we had in early December continued as revenue came in even stronger than we had anticipated. We generated operating cash flow of $363 million for the quarter and $1.1 billion for the year. Quite an accomplishment in this troubled economy. We used the free cash flow to reduce our debt during the quarter by approximately $250 million and by $755 million for the year. Earnings per share were better than anticipated due to improved revenue trends, combined with the progress made on our cost structure and efficiency efforts. Of greater importance was our ability to increase income despite lagging revenue. I will go into more detail on that in just a few moments.To put these results in perspective, it's important to recall how the year began. At this point, in 2009, we knew that the year would have substantial challenges. That's certainly was the case. At the same time, however, we knew an unwavering focus on both executing on our strategic plan and fundamentally changing our cost structure were the keys to a stronger and well-positioned Gannett Co. in the wake of enormous economic uncertainty. We executed on both of these fronts and ended the year even stronger than when we've began. We highlighted several of our strategic in efficiency and initiatives in our presentations over the past year. Before we move to our fourth quarter results, I think it's important to review some of them in the context of content, cost restructuring and sales. Engaging relevant content is the keystone to successfully positioning the company for the future and an integral part of this has been our ContentOne initiative. The focus here is threefold: Efficient gathering and distribution of engaging content; driving collaboration among our businesses for both content and sales; and finally, finding new ways to deliver and monetize content. The content they are helping to create aggregate and share is being used by the majority of our sites and many of them have generated several million pages. At the same time, we are coordinating sales opportunities with potential advertisers. The power of ContentOne was evident as content around the crisis in Haiti was developed and delivered in just a few hours. Over the course of 2010, we expect ContentOne, not only to be intricately involved with day-to-day content generation and sharing, but also to be the center of our coverage efforts for major sporting events such as the Olympics, NCAA playoffs and spring training. But also for back-to-school, the Hollywood awards season and later on in the year, Halloween, Black Friday and the holiday shopping season.Another driver of success has been our efforts to permanently change our cost structure. This, as you can understand was a huge undertaking and a difficult one that impacts a lot of people. And there are employees deserve the credit and the right recognition for our success here. This is particularly important in our Publishing segment. As we have noted, consolidation of printing operations as well as centralization of some production operations has had a very significant, in fact, permanent impact on our expenses. We will achieve additional efficiencies as we centralize ad production in two centers over the course of this year. While creating greater efficiencies is a key driver of this effort, of equal importance, is our focus on rising quality and service for advertisers across all of our markets.We also have made good progress on our efforts to transform our approach to advertising from transactional to solutions-based marketing. We know the value of local advertising and are working to capture more of the local ad spend through this approach to marketing. A great example of this is the regional client solutions group we are developing in the U.S. Community Publishing and will launch this year. These groups will operate like advertising agencies and create customized marketing solutions and campaigns for our local advertisers. Testing has gone well with positive results in all of the test markets.In the Broadcasting segment, we are focused here as well on local coverage and content and generating local sales. This year, we are preparing for the Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver on our NBC stations and we'll approach our coverage with cross-divisional, cross-platform execution. Political and issue spending will, of course, be a tremendous opportunity for us to some degree early in the year but primarily in the latter half. Cross-divisional efforts are also critical component of the Gannett Digital network. We have a unique set of assets across the company that offer a wide reach as well as customized solutions bringing the breadth and diversity of all these customers touch points together. To benefit advertisers provides us a potentially significant opportunity as we return to a more stable or growing economic environment. As is evidenced in our results this quarter, progress made on the cost front, both here and in the U.K. have resulted in a higher level of free cash flow and significant debt reduction. At the UBS conference, we told you that we were very comfortable with the high end of consensus estimates and we achieved these results that significantly exceeded those expectations. So let me briefly cover key results from today's quarterly announcement and then turn the call over to Gracia.Earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis were $0.56 per share. Earnings per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes special items were $0.72 per share. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2008 on a comparable non-GAAP basis were $0.85 per share. We generated total revenue in the quarter of $1.5 billion, a decline of approximately 14%. However, this is the best year-over-year comparison quarter in 2009 by a wide margin, almost nine percentage points better than the third quarter on a pro forma basis. Sequential improvement for each month in the quarter resulted in a decline in total revenue in December of just 4% on a pro forma basis, easily the best comparison month of the year.Comps got a little easier. We are not in positive territory yet, but we are absolutely seeing improving trends and firmer advertising demand across our businesses. In publishing, the strong finish was led by greatly improving trends in national, as well as classified advertising. Broadcasting revenue comparisons were hindered by the relative lack of political advertising this quarter. However, excluding political, television revenues were up solidly in the quarter as were Captivate's revenues. PointRoll and ShopLocal delivered strong double-digit revenue growth in digital. Companywide, our digital metrics were up in December and total digital revenue topped $245 million in the quarter, or about 17% of the revenues.Total operating expenses, excluding special items declined over 17%, reflecting the impact of numerous cost-efficiency efforts that were undertaken last year and continue to be a focus. We benefited from significantly lower newsprint expense in the quarter due to a sharp decline in usage prices combined with lower consumption. As I noted earlier, perhaps the most important outcome for the quarter is the operating leverage we created. Expense reductions outpaced revenue decline in the quarter. And as a result, our pretax income adjusted for special items increased about 1% despite the declines in revenues and substantially lower political related ad demand. Similarly, in our Publishing segment, operating income, excluding special items from both quarters was 5.5% higher this year than 2008's fourth quarter. And in broadcasting, operating income, excluding special items, which is $19 million lower in the quarter despite a decline in politically related ad demand of $47 million. Our goal was to permanently restructure our costs given the constrained revenue we faced. As our results indicate, we are successfully bringing more revenue to the bottom line and we are a leaner, stronger company as we move into 2010. Gracia will go into our results in some detail, but before I hand the call over to her, I once again would like to thank the outstanding efforts of all of our employees in an extremely challenging year. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gracia."

I'll provide a little more detail on our operating segments and cover some non-operating and balance sheet items. As Craig noted, we are realizing operating leverage as a result of the cost restructurings we've done and ad trend improvement",1863,"Thanks, Craig. I'll provide a little more detail on our operating segments and cover some non-operating and balance sheet items. As Craig noted, we are realizing operating leverage as a result of the cost restructurings we've done and ad trend improvements. We are more profitable on a pretax basis, excluding special items this quarter than we were a year ago even though revenues were lower especially political. In each of our business segments, moderating revenue declines and lower expense levels are favorably impacting the bottom line. There were several special items in both quarters and so assessing the performance, excluding those items can be a little bit challenging. So let me provide some additional detail to make those comparisons easier. And as a reminder, all of the revenue category stats have been included in the release this morning. So I'll focus on the highlights for each of the segments and primarily the changes in year-over-year comparisons quarter-to-quarter.Let me begin with publishing. Revenue trends, they were very similar to the total trends Craig covered. Total revenues in publishing lagged last year but we're almost eight percentage points better than the third quarter comparison. Total advertising revenue was over 10 percentage points better. Ad revenue results in December were the best comparison month of the year, 10% lower. All publishing category comparisons were better in the quarter led by national and classified, both of which improved 15 percentage points against the third quarter comparison. National advertising had a particularly strong finish and was up in the high single digits in December. And I'll just stress that a little bit more later. The trend of moderating declines occurred both here and in the U.K. In the U.S., ad revenue was down 18% although again, eight percentage points better than the third quarter. Classified improved 12 percentage points relative to the third quarter comparison as auto and employment declines improved 15 and 17 percentage points, respectively. Classified advertising was down 15% in December in the U.S.At Newsquest, similar trends occurred particularly in classified advertising, which although down about 23% in pounds improved 11 percentage points from the third quarter decline. In December, due in part to an absolute increase in real estate of over 4%, classified advertising was 17% lower. Retail and national advertising, both improved well over several percentage points relative to the third quarter decline. As I noted, national advertising for the Publishing segment finished the quarter on a strong note, advancing from a mid-20s percentage decline in October to an increase of almost 9% in December. The primary drivers were a significant ad growth at USA WEEKEND, as well as positive results for national advertising at U.S. Community Publishing sites. Ad revenue at USA TODAY was down an approximately 22% in the quarter but just 2% lower in December. The slowdown in business travel and the lodging industry has continued to impact USA TODAY. We did see growth in several categories in the quarter but it was offset by softness in the travel, retail and financial areas. Turning to expenses, our efforts to permanently restructure our cost base and create efficiencies have taken hold in a meaningful way. In publishing, pro forma operating expenses, excluding special items in both quarters dropped 18%, reflecting the impact of workforce restructuring as well as facility consolidations in 2009 and the prior year. These consolidation efforts still remain a focus as the division presidents indicated at the UBS conference as we move into 2010. The decline also represents significantly lower newsprint expense, down over 50% for the quarter. Sharply lower usage prices as well as lower consumption drove the decline. And let me just give you a quick update on newsprint given recent pricing trends. For a variety of reasons, including exchange rates and pricing below cash flow break-even levels for producers, producers have made lots of price increase announcements. But their price recovery efforts have struggled as these increases have been delayed and altered. Current industry price indexes confirm this trend, which is further challenged by regional price fragmentation. We have budgeted conservatively for 2010 in the event that newsprint production is adjusted to keep pace with demand. In the U.K., where fixed prices are negotiated on an annual basis, 2009 represented a bit of an anomaly as prices were adjusted downward at mid-year due to lower usage. Newsquest prices will decline in the low double digits in 2010. Publishing operating income was higher in the quarter, excluding special items, reflecting the faster pace of expense reductions and moderating revenue declines. Publishing segment operating cash flow was also higher, adjusted for workforce restructuring charges of about $43 million last year and over $3 million in the fourth quarter this year. So despite a revenue decline of over $208 million, adjusted operating income was $11 million higher in the quarter.In our Broadcasting segment, the challenge again this quarter was overcoming the politically related advertising we so successfully achieved last year over $58 million. However, the underlying ad demand for television is encouraging as core revenues in the quarter, which exclude political were up about 11%. Double-digit growth in the medical and media categories drove much of the improvement. Retail, which has replaced auto as our largest single category was up a few percentage points. And while the auto category lagged last year, the year-over-year comparison in the quarter improved significantly relative to previous quarters and is pacing up nicely in the first quarter. Higher retransmission revenues totaling $14 million and a 21% increase in revenue growth at Captivate partially offset the impact of political advertising. On the expense side, total expenses in broadcasting declined 9.4%, again excluding special items, reflecting efficiency and cost control efforts. As Craig noted, broadcast operating income, excluding those special items was down just $19 million despite a decline in revenue of about 14%, driven primarily by $47 million lower political revenue. Looking to the first quarter, we will have the benefit of the Winter Olympics Games in Vancouver on our NBC affiliates and overall firming of ad demand. So at this point, we expect the percentage increase in first quarter television revenues to be up in the very, very high single digits, if not touch the double digits and that's early in the quarter, obviously. One note about first quarter television revenue growth, six of our CBS affiliates will have ad demand associated with the Super Bowl. However, because we are going up against last year's Super Bowl on our 12 NBC affiliates, we won't generate as much revenue on that event.Turning to the Digital segment, total revenues were $158 million in the quarter, down about 7%. Strong double-digit growth by both PointRoll and ShopLocal over 40% and 30%, respectively, partially offset the impact of lower employment ad demand on CareerBuilder's results. Operating expenses were about 3% lower and excluding special items, they were down over 8%. In addition, expenses were impacted by accrued costs for an employee incentive comp plan that is tied to the performance of certain digital businesses over a several year period. Excluding both the special items and the incentive comp plan charge, operating expenses would have been down more than 10%, again outpacing the revenue decline. So operating income would have been up in the high teens as a percentage and operating cash flow would have increased in the high single digits on a percentage basis. In addition, CareerBuilder is cycling substantial cost reductions done in the fourth quarter of '08. The adjusted cash flow margin for the Digital segment for the fourth quarter was in the mid-20s as a percentage, up several percentage points from a year ago. Focusing for a second on CareerBuilder, North American network revenue was about 20% lower in the quarter compared to the fourth quarter a year ago and totaled about $131 million. CareerBuilder's own sales efforts represent about 85% of that number and the balance is the revenue from the network of owner-affiliated newspapers. As we noted earlier, lagging demand from employment advertising had an impact on CareerBuilder's revenue results as did limited upsell opportunities for the publishing affiliates. As Craig mentioned, digital revenues companywide were approximately $245 million in the quarter and $925 million in '09. The metrics we track, such as unique visitors, page views and visits were all up in the month of December compared to December of 2008 and sequentially month-over-month to November of this year. At U.S. Community Publishing, online employment was lower in the quarter as we await job stability and growth in the country. Excluding online employment, online at our domestic community publishing sites would have been up in the low single digits. The national auto and retail categories almost 60% of U.S. Community Publishing's online revenues were all up in the quarter. USATODAY.com also turned in a strong performance with revenues up in the high teens. Improved results from certain digital investments in the quarter drove a substantial increase in our equity income. Excluding special items in both years, equity income was actually $8 million this quarter compared to $3.6 million last year. And then moving quickly to the balance sheet, we reduced long-term debt during the quarter $250 million to $3.06 billion. For the year, we reduced debt by about $755 million or 20%. Our own cost of debt is about 5%, which reflects the change and the mix of debt with the issuance of our new long-term bonds in the fourth quarter. Balances under our revolving credit agreements now total approximately $1.3 billion. We have much more than ample capacity under our revolving credit facilities and a significant amount of free cash to pay our maturities in 2011 and beyond. And with a senior leverage ratio of just 2.63x, we are very well positioned relative to the sole financial covenant, which has a ceiling of 3.5x. Cash and cash equivalents at year end totaled about $99 million. Finally, capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $22 million and $68 million for the year, a bit lower than we indicated in early December. And as always, CareerBuilder's capital expenditures, now that they are consolidated, are included in this number although they are entirely self-funding. Before I turn the call back to Craig, I always need to throw in my cautions for the upcoming quarter and remind you of several factors, which will impact it typically our smallest quarter of the year. We believe the economy, while on the mend clearly is still tenuous. We previously announced the furlough for the first quarter. It will affect fewer employees than the first quarter of '08, so the impact on expenses will be less significant. I mentioned the Super Bowl and more modest expectations there given our station's affiliate weightings. And finally, we are hearing from our folks in the U.K. that the winter snowy weather there had an impact on commerce and advertising demand in January. That being said, we are very pleased with the momentum we enjoyed coming out of the fourth quarter. And with some help from the economy, look forward to a continuing in a meaningful way. And now, I'll turn the call back to Craig before we take your questions."

As all of you know from your experience with her, Gracia is a phenomenal leader, who brings not only her tremendous financial skills to this job but her extensive knowledge of our business operations and a very, very passionate support for our company. Gracia has earned this opportunity and I couldn't be more pleased than to recognize her talent and commitment in this way. As President and COO, Gracia will continue to report to me and will leave the day-to-day operations of Gannett. We have started the search for a new CFO and that person will report to Gracia. Gracia will continue to serve as CFO until we bring on our new CFO. The role of President and COO is a new position for Gannett, which will allow me to spend the majority of my time focusing on driving the strategic direction and future of our company. I will continue to work on M&A activity, and Gracia and I will work together and continue to meet with the financial community, which I look forward to with my continued work with you.

Similarly with our television side, I'm feeling good about, again, the momentum we saw and looking at even a little bit better results than we were even anticipating in early December. As I mentioned at Newsquest, a little bit of bad weather there. I guess it snowed for about three weeks standing.

So we are very positive there, but again, just because of roughly half of the number of properties that we have, that will be down. The Leno impact, I think, it's obvious what has happened. We have talked about this since the show began in the 10:00 time period. And I think with the decisions they're making, we can further improve once the Olympics are over. Again, it's a piecemeal in how they're putting that together. They don't fully have their programming lineup put together, as you know, in the way that they applied the cash instead of to development. It went to their bottom line or so they say. And when we take a look at political, I have to say this; although, as I commented earlier, probably the bulk of this is going to go into the back half. But when you take a look at it, we will have issue money going continuously through the year in 15 of the U.S. Senate races will take place in 19 of our markets. When you take a look at the gubernatorial, 18 of our 19 markets will have opportunity. So I am very enthusiastic and positive and certainly with the Supreme Court ruling a couple of weeks ago now, there could also be some other directions that political or issue does come to the table.

And then on the circulation side, I think we'll have just get back to you with those specific numbers. I think the trend was a little bit better than the third quarter. I know that Bob Dickey indicated in December at UBS that we were spending additional dollars in that area on stock pressure, particularly in those days that matter a great deal to advertisers such as Sunday.

And I think that's what  this weekend has really caused the big consternation, if you will, with what's going on with Amazon. I think it's too early to tell yet. The device itself, I have not seen it, but from what I have read and understand, is again another beautiful device. It's just -- it's somewhere between that smartphone and a full computer. And when you have that, again, it's going to be at the marketplace that decides. I think that the big surprise, if you will, the low end of this thing being in that $499 or less range, was quite a surprise. Now typically, what we can look at from history is after the first six months, there'll be another price decline. I don't know if that's going to be the case, but if it is I think it would then certainly become a more mainline opportunity. And certainly, as you get into that kind of situation, I think we're going to very quickly know what direction that can point us. And I think at this point, because all of the old apps, I shouldn't say old, but the previously written ones for the iPhone itself will certainly work on this, but I think a lot of format changes will help make it a far better user experience as they reformat them for the new device. So we're taking a very, very close look at this and you never want to suggest or rule out anything that Apple would put out. And again, it's going to be the marketplace that decides and, as I said, we will be agnostic to the platform. But when it comes, we'll be ready."

So by the fourth quarter, we would obviously have cycled some of those activities. We also had, as you may recall, furloughs in both the first and  second quarters of last year. We announced furloughs for the first quarter this year in some areas so the impact will be a smaller impact in the first quarter of 2010 than it was in the first quarter of 2009. And with regard to future furloughs, again, those are not things that you want to do. We'll just have to see how the economy is faring and business conditions are as we get closer to the second quarter. On the newsprint side, we would have gotten more benefit from newsprint in the third and fourth quarters than we got in the first and second quarters. We expect to continue to have favorable newsprint comparisons in both the first and the second quarters, at least of 2010. So there's a variety of pieces at work here that go in a variety of different directions. And then, of course, at CareerBuilder, as we mentioned earlier, they took a number of actions in the fourth quarter of 2008 that we would have cycled in part in 2009. But I think, as a general philosophical statement, we are committed here at Gannett, as we have said for the last few years, of making sure that we continue to size our business appropriately, both from an expense and looking at where the revenue opportunity is. So we'll continue to do that. We're pleased, though, that the momentum that we got out of the fourth quarter was very much on the revenue side. And that's really the most important thing that we're going to be focused on in the 2010, while never losing sight of what we need to do on the expense side."

I am very happy to report that we are off to a great start this year as the momentum that we had at the end of the year continued through the first quarter.

I am very happy to report that we are off to a great start this year as the momentum that we had at the end of the year continued through the first quarter. We had a very good quarter on several fronts. Financially, we closed the revenue gap considerably as revenue comparisons this quarter improved significantly versus the fourth quarter. We benefited from lower expenses, reflecting our focus on greater efficiencies company-wide. As a result, we doubled adjusted earnings per share from the first quarter last year and paid down a significant amount of debt. We are most encouraged by the revenue trends and our ability to create operating leverage.The strength of our quarter, however, was not limited to our financial results. During the quarter, we benefited from our dominant local market positions and the value of our content. We also demonstrated our ability to publish on any platform and deliver solutions for advertisers. In U.S. Community Publishing, we are experiencing significantly better revenue trends across all advertising categories as the economy firms and businesses are more committed to marketing their own brands and products. We initiated an effort to improve Sunday circulation and focused on our top 32 publishing properties in U.S. Community Publishing. 13 of 32 properties have higher Sunday home delivery than they did a year ago. Our strong local market presence and compelling content contributed to our successful efforts. Our overall Sunday circulation volume has reversed trend as efforts in our markets began to take hold. Sunday circulation volume in March is down in just below single digits, the smallest decline in the last 12 months.At Newsquest in the UK, the economy there seems to be stabilizing, with home prices rising and the level of new car sales improving. As a result, revenue trends there are improving across the board. On the Digital side, online revenue growth at U.S. Community Publishing was up in the mid-single digits as we delivered more online solutions for Retail, National and Automotive advertisers. At Newsquest, Digital revenues increased as well in the low single digits. Company-wide, Digital revenues were about 17% of total revenues and were up in the high single digits, excluding CareerBuilder, which I'll discuss in just a moment. The results we achieved with the Winter Olympic Games showcased the importance and the power of the local television franchise. We achieved our revenue expectation, and just as importantly, we had some very impressive viewer rankings. KUSA-TV in Denver was the number one station in the United States for the adult 25 to 54 demographic, an outstanding achievement alone. But we also had three of the top five and four of the top 10 in that demo in our television line up.We did quite well with the Super Bowl as well. WUSA, our Washington, D.C. CBS affiliate, was the second highest-rating station for the same demo. And as you may recall, this is without their home team represented in the game or the playoffs leading up to the game. The value of our Local brands, the strength of our Local news programming and the great footprint for this year's elections all point to a robust political issue-related spending this year. We anticipate some heated House, Senate and gubernatorial races in almost all of our markets. The strong appeal of our content and brand led to two opportunities for USA TODAY that we announced in the first quarter. The first is their new partnership with Starbucks. USA TODAY is now being distributed in 6,500 corporate-owned Starbucks here in the U.S. We will benefit not only from the extension of the brand but also from increased circulation. Most notably, this new partnership is in response to customer demand for our product.USA TODAY's ability and commitment to publish content on any platform were the drivers of our second announcement, which was with Apple. They also recognized that the strong appeal of our content based on their first-hand experience with the iPhone. The USA TODAY app was up and running on the iPad the day it launched. There are two unique things to us about our app. One, the launch is being underwritten by Courtyard by Marriott through July 4. And secondly, after the promotional period ends, it will become a subscription model. It is one of the most popular apps on the iPad. At this point, there has been over 175,000 downloads, and it is the 10th most popular free app currently and was as high as number four last week. It is the number one news application in both download statistics and user reviews since the launch. So we are off to a very good start with the iPad.Besides the ability to publish on any platform, another key priority is to manage and maximize the strength of our content. That means we want to be more effective gathering and managing our content and ultimately, how we package it for advertisers. Our industry-leading initiative, ContentOne, coordinates all the content we generate across all of our properties and is delivering content that is more solutions-focused and appeals to Local, Regional and National advertisers. A good example is the portal that we'll be launching soon that focuses on jobs and the economy. It will feature job advice columns gathered by ContentOne, graphics from USA TODAY, a job advice video from Gannett Broadcasting and CareerBuilder job search module. We are very excited about our announcement earlier this week that we and 11 other major media companies plan to form a stand-alone joint venture to develop a new national mobile content and distribution service to make mobile digital television universally available to consumers. So as you can see, it has been a very busy quarter for us, with progress on several key fronts. So moving on to our results for the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes special items, earnings per diluted share were $0.50, double the comparable figure for the first quarter of 2009. Revenue totaled $1.3 billion and the year-over-year revenue decline was just 3% on a pro forma basis, 10 percentage points better than the fourth quarter year-over-year comparisons. Revenue trends continued to improve throughout the quarter. Total pro forma operating revenues were down 8% in January, and by March, they were down just under 1%.Pro forma Publishing advertising revenues were down about 8% while pro forma Publishing revenues declined about 6%. Digital segment revenues were down just under 2%. The employment picture continues to pressure results at CareerBuilder, although revenue there declined just 5% and was offset partially by double-digit revenue growth at PointRoll. Broadcasting revenues, due in part to Olympic advertising but also core revenue growth, were up 17%. Total company-wide expenses, excluding special items, were 11% lower, far outpacing the revenue decline. As a result, adjusted net income more than doubled. In fact, all of our business segments delivered substantially higher operating income and operating cash flow in the quarter compared to the first quarter of last year.We generated total operating cash flow of over $274 million and reduced debt substantially about $260 million. We are better positioned now than we were a year ago, with a stronger balance sheet and more flexible and leaner business operations. The strength of our business results reflects continued progress on both our strategic plan and our cost restructuring. Additionally, they highlight our ability to generate operating leverage as revenue trends improve with the economy. There is an important shift occurring. The discussion now is focused on market position as the economy continues to improve rather than on cost savings. It is more about the strength of our local market presence, our Regional and National brands, engaging content and the ability to deliver marketing solutions to a wide array of advertisers. Our goal is to provide relevant content on any platform the consumer chooses based on their preferences. We are accomplishing this and we expect to benefit from the many opportunities we see as media consumption and new technology continue to evolve. Our employees worked extremely hard to deliver the best content possible, and it is a great accomplishment when their peers recognize their efforts. I'd like to congratulate The Des Moines Register and photographer, Mary Chind, for winning the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography. In addition, nine of our broadcasting stations won 44 regional 2010 Edward R. Murrow awards, and I'd like to congratulate them all as well. Before I hand the call over to Gracia, I want to thank all of our employees for all of their efforts in delivering the strong financial results, as well as the wins we achieved company-wide. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gracia."

Some of the good news this quarter is that each of our business segments improved their profitability compared to a year ago due to improving revenue trends and significantly lower expenses. As Craig noted, we continue to benefit from our revenue initiatives and from consolidations and other efficiency efforts. That was very much the case for our Publishing segment. Pro forma revenue trends improved again this quarter. They progressed steadily through the quarter and were eight percentage points better than last quarter. Total advertising revenue comparisons improved 10 percentage points relative to the fourth quarter as Retail, National and Classified all had smaller declines.Classified led the better comparisons, improving by about 14 percentage points. The comparisons for Retail and National improved over nine and almost eight percentage points, respectively. Stabilizing economies in the U.K. and the U.S. led to better revenue trends for both Newsquest and our domestic Publishing operations. Ad revenues in the U.S. declined about 9% in the quarter compared to last year's first quarter and were almost 10 percentage points better than the fourth quarter comparison. Similar to comparison trends overall, Classified was about 13 percentage points better domestically followed by Retail and National. Within Classified, employment and automotive comparisons showed the biggest improvement, 27 and 14 percentage points, respectively. Domestic Classified advertising was just 7% lower in March compared to a year ago.Turning to Newsquest, their advertising results in pounds trended in much the same way. Classified advertising comparisons improved sequentially about 11 percentage points and were 13% lower than last year's first quarter. Automotive and employment were the most improved relative to fourth quarter comparisons, both were better in the mid- to high-teens. Real estate, although it did not improve as much from the fourth quarter, was down just over 1% compared to the first quarter last year. Retail was just 3% lower year-over-year, and Retail  comparisons for the fourth quarter were about eight percentage points better. National was 2% higher year-over-year and almost five percentage points better than the fourth quarter. Although National advertising for the entire Publishing segment was 2% lower for the quarter and fairly volatile, it increased in the high single digits for our U.S. Community Publishing properties and was also, as I mentioned, a bright spot for Newsquest.Advertising at USA TODAY continues to be hampered by the slow travel market and was down about 15% in the quarter. Several categories such as Automotive, Technology, Retail and others, had double-digit growth although the gains were offset by the entertainment, travel, financial and pharmaceutical categories, which lagged last year. Turning to our expense picture, we again had lower expenses company-wide in the quarter. Our Publishing segment year-over-year comparisons were impacted by two special items in last year's first quarter. The first was a pension settlement gain of almost $40 million, which was partially offset by workforce restructuring costs of $6.6 million. So if you exclude those special items in the first quarter last year, on an apples-to-apples basis, expenses in the Publishing segment were actually 14% lower. Again, our consolidation and efficiency efforts were the primary drivers of the decline, although significantly lower newsprint expense contributed as well. Newsprint expense on a pro forma basis was almost 41% lower due to substantially lower prices and lower consumption.Let me just make a brief comment on newsprint. As we all know last year, there was a global downturn in demand and that resulted in sharply lower newsprint prices. Since then, prices have started to recover, although excess capacity continues to cause a fair amount of market fragmentation. Gannett's newsprint costs are benefiting from a variety of strategic agreements in place for 201,0 and we expect favorable newsprint prices at least through the second quarter.One other reminder regarding expenses, savings associated with the furloughs in this year's first quarter were not as high as the furlough savings in the first quarter of last year, about $13 million versus $20 million in the first quarter of last year, so about a $7 million swing. As Craig noted, our increased profitability particularly in the Publishing segment, reflects the permanent restructuring of our costs in a more stable ad environment. Operating income and operating cash flow, excluding special items, were substantially higher this quarter compared to the first quarter last year. The Publishing segment operating income increased almost 60%, about $62 million despite a revenue decline of about $78 million. Operating cash flow on a comparable basis was 38% higher.In our Broadcasting segment, revenue was up significantly in the quarter, almost 17%. In March, which was not impacted by the Olympics or any other special events, advertising, excluding political, was up in the high single digits. Several categories had double-digit increases, including the top two, Automotive and Retail, which were up over 30% and 23%, respectively. Broadcasting operating expenses were down slightly in the quarter as an increase in advertising sales costs related to the higher revenues was offset by cost controls and efficiency efforts. Operating income, therefore, was up over 55% and operating cash flow totaled almost $77 million, an increase of over 45%.At this point, given current trends, we expect the percentage increase in television ad revenues for the second quarter this year to be in the very high teens to the low 20s compared to last year. But as always, remember, pacings are a point in time and can change substantially just as we saw in the first quarter. And let me also remind you that the first quarter is generally the smallest quarter of the year for our Digital segment, and this year, it was no different. Revenues in the Digital segment declined just 2% to $141 million in the quarter. Strong revenue growth at PointRoll did not quite offset the impact the current employment environment had on CareerBuilder's revenue. Although CareerBuilder's revenues declined 5% year-over-year, they improved significantly relative to fourth quarter comparisons.Digital operating expenses were also 5% lower. In addition, similar to last quarter, costs accrued for an employee incentive compensation plan that is tied to the performance of certain digital businesses impacted operating expenses. If you exclude that incentive comp plan charge, operating expenses would have been over 6% lower compared to last year's first quarter. As a result, operating income would have been about 70% higher than the reported number of $3.4 million. As is typical, Digital segment profitability in the first quarter is disproportionately smaller, as marketing and promotional expenses are higher relative to the remaining quarters in the year.Almost all of the businesses in the Digital segment, including CareerBuilder, had substantially higher operating income and cash flow this quarter compared to last year, reflecting their revenue performance and the focus on cost control in the businesses. CareerBuilder's North American network revenues were approximately $132 million in the first quarter, down about 6% from last year. In comparison to the fourth quarter of last year, however, North American network revenue was actually up 1% as Classified employment at the affiliate newspapers increased well over 10%.Now turning to our Digital revenues company-wide, which include our Digital segment, as well as in our legacy businesses, our company-wide Digital revenues were over $225 million, up slightly compared to last year. Digital revenues at U.S. Community Publishing were up in the mid-single digits. Once again, employment was a factor, although the auto, National and Retail categories were much stronger in the quarter. If you exclude employment, online revenues in our U.S. Community Publishing group were up over 10%. In March this year, our monthly Digital metrics improved compared to both February and March of last year. Stronger results for our certain Digital investments, particularly Classified Ventures, drove a $3 million increase in our equity income line. So overall, operating cash flow, absent special items, totaled $274 million in the quarter, a 39% increase from the first quarter last year. Let me turn to the balance sheet quickly. As we've noted, significantly more revenue dropped to the bottom line, and as a result, we are generating a very substantial level of free cash flow. We used that free cash flow to reduce long-term debt by $260 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, long-term debt stood at $2.8 billion, and we had just over $100 million in cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet. Our all-in cost of debt is 5.3% at this point. And our debt to EBITDA covenant ratio was just 2.3x, substantially below the 3.5x covenant. One final item, CapEx in the quarter totaled just under $9 million.So in summary, we are delivering on our commitment to permanently reconfigure our cost structure, strengthen our balance sheet and create leaner, more flexible business operations as our results this quarter clearly demonstrate. And with a little more help from the economy, we are poised to grow our revenue base as we leverage our market strength, the value of our brands and the appeal of our content. With that, I'll stop, and Craig and I will be happy to take your questions."

I'm not sure there's much more that we would add to what Bob Dickey said at the MEANY meeting, which is the fact that, obviously, rates have been impacted over the last year and a half by economic conditions.

And I think our focus is really to get a larger buy out of each of those Local customers than we've done in the past. So I think that's where our focus lies. I would say also on the Digital side, from a rate perspective, what we are seeing is that rates are clearly firming there, and in certain areas, we are actually seeing some improvement in rates. And then if you turn to the Television side, it's clear that rates there have firmed, and we expect in a year like 2010 that we're going to see very good follow through on the rate side. So it's a little bit of a mixed bag, but I think that we are heading in a positive direction on the rate side."

On the newsprint font, as I said before, we would anticipate that we'll continue to see the benefit of lower prices in the second quarter, perhaps, not quite as good a comparison as we saw before as well on the usage side. Obviously, as our revenue declines abate, usage is not down as much as it was previously. But that's very good news because we're delighted to have 100% of that revenue with only about a 15% drop on the expense slide on the newsprint side. You're very correct that we did have about $25 million of furlough savings in the second quarter of last year. And as we announced a couple of weeks ago, other than some small areas, we will not have company-wide furloughs in the second quarter. So that's about $25 million. But I will tell you that I think there are other areas where we will continue to be focused on cost controls and continue to deliver a very strong expense story in the second quarter."

With respect to is it incremental or otherwise, at this point, it's really hard to say. I think we're going to have to get a good read on it if this is replacing or not. But I have to say, I don't know if you've seen the app yet on the iPad, it is absolutely gorgeous. I think the team has done an absolutely remarkable job with it in a very short period of time. And I think the more people see this and just how beautiful it is, it's a very easy application to work with. I would expect that we're going to see a continued growth in this with similar numbers for some time to come. I hope with the supply issue that Apple seems to have at this point, it does not slow anything down. But my guess is, since domestically we'll be covered, it should be positive. With the other areas that we're on, I would not really comment as positively toward the Kindle. It just -- that's a whole different environment. And as I say, it's just different.

And frankly, it's so new. There's so many pieces to this that are coming together. But I really think this is one that will take hold because the opportunity is very real. I think in the past, the opportunities that we looked at just didn't have the kind of traction that I believe is associated with this. And you're going to see in time some very real results from the -- as I mentioned earlier, to Jim's question, the prototypes that we have looked at produce just a gorgeous picture. And as Gracia and I have both seen even at 70 miles an hour, it holds together beautifully.

If you exclude the stock option expense from corporate expense, our corporate expenses were actually down 5%. That's a phenomenon that we'll see in the first quarter.

I am very happy to report that we are off to a great start this year as the momentum that we had at the end of the year continued through the first quarter. We had a very good quarter on several fronts. Financially, we closed the revenue gap considerably as revenue comparisons this quarter improved significantly versus the fourth quarter. We benefited from lower expenses, reflecting our focus on greater efficiencies company-wide. As a result, we doubled adjusted earnings per share from the first quarter last year and paid down a significant amount of debt. We are most encouraged by the revenue trends and our ability to create operating leverage.
The strength of our quarter, however, was not limited to our financial results. During the quarter, we benefited from our dominant local market positions and the value of our content. We also demonstrated our ability to publish on any platform and deliver solutions for advertisers. In U.S. Community Publishing, we are experiencing significantly better revenue trends across all advertising categories as the economy firms and businesses are more committed to marketing their own brands and products. We initiated an effort to improve Sunday circulation and focused on our top 32 publishing properties in U.S. Community Publishing. 13 of 32 properties have higher Sunday home delivery than they did a year ago. Our strong local market presence and compelling content contributed to our successful efforts. Our overall Sunday circulation volume has reversed trend as efforts in our markets began to take hold. Sunday circulation volume in March is down in just below single digits, the smallest decline in the last 12 months.
At Newsquest in the U.K., the economy there seems to be stabilizing, with home prices rising and the level of new car sales improving. As a result, revenue trends there are improving across the board. On the Digital side, online revenue growth at U.S. Community Publishing was up in the mid-single digits as we delivered more online solutions for Retail, National and Automotive advertisers. At Newsquest, Digital revenues increased as well in the low single digits. Company-wide, Digital revenues were about 17% of total revenues and were up in the high single digits, excluding CareerBuilder, which I'll discuss in just a moment. 
The results we achieved with the Winter Olympic Games showcased the importance and the power of the local television franchise. We achieved our revenue expectation, and just as importantly, we had some very impressive viewer rankings. KUSA-TV in Denver was the number one station in the United States for the adult 25 to 54 demographic, an outstanding achievement alone. But we also had three of the top five and four of the top 10 in that demo in our television line up.
We did quite well with the Super Bowl as well. WUSA, our Washington, D.C. CBS affiliate, was the second highest-rating station for the same demo. And as you may recall, this is without their home team represented in the game or the playoffs leading up to the game. The value of our Local brands, the strength of our Local news programming and the great footprint for this year's elections all point to a robust political issue-related spending this year. We anticipate some heated House, Senate and gubernatorial races in almost all of our markets. The strong appeal of our content and brand led to two opportunities for USA TODAY that we announced in the first quarter. The first is their new partnership with Starbucks. USA TODAY is now being distributed in 6,500 corporate-owned Starbucks here in the U.S. We will benefit not only from the extension of the brand but also from increased circulation. Most notably, this new partnership is in response to customer demand for our product.
USA TODAY's ability and commitment to publish content on any platform were the drivers of our second announcement, which was with Apple. They also recognized that the strong appeal of our content based on their first-hand experience with the iPhone. The USA TODAY app was up and running on the iPad the day it launched. There are two unique things to us about our app. One, the launch is being underwritten by Courtyard by Marriott through July 4. And secondly, after the promotional period ends, it will become a subscription model. It is one of the most popular apps on the iPad. At this point, there has been over 175,000 downloads, and it is the 10th most popular free app currently and was as high as number four last week. It is the number one news application in both download statistics and user reviews since the launch. So we are off to a very good start with the iPad.
Besides the ability to publish on any platform, another key priority is to manage and maximize the strength of our content. That means we want to be more effective gathering and managing our content and ultimately, how we package it for advertisers. Our industry-leading initiative, ContentOne, coordinates all the content we generate across all of our properties and is delivering content that is more solutions-focused and appeals to Local, Regional and National advertisers. A good example is the portal that we'll be launching soon that focuses on jobs and the economy. It will feature job advice columns gathered by ContentOne, graphics from USA TODAY, a job advice video from Gannett Broadcasting and CareerBuilder job search module. We are very excited about our announcement earlier this week that we and 11 other major media companies plan to form a stand-alone joint venture to develop a new national mobile content and distribution service to make mobile digital television universally available to consumers. So as you can see, it has been a very busy quarter for us, with progress on several key fronts. So moving on to our results for the quarter. 
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes special items, earnings per diluted share were $0.50, double the comparable figure for the first quarter of 2009. Revenue totaled $1.3 billion and the year-over-year revenue decline was just 3% on a pro forma basis, 10 percentage points better than the fourth quarter year-over-year comparisons. Revenue trends continued to improve throughout the quarter. Total pro forma operating revenues were down 8% in January, and by March, they were down just under 1%.
Pro forma Publishing advertising revenues were down about 8%, while pro forma Publishing revenues declined about 6%. Digital segment revenues were down just under 2%. The employment picture continues to pressure results at CareerBuilder, although revenue there declined just 5% and was offset partially by double-digit revenue growth at PointRoll. Broadcasting revenues, due in part to Olympic advertising but also core revenue growth, were up 17%. Total company-wide expenses, excluding special items, were 11% lower, far outpacing the revenue decline. As a result, adjusted net income more than doubled. In fact, all of our business segments delivered substantially higher operating income and operating cash flow in the quarter compared to the first quarter of last year.
We generated total operating cash flow of over $274 million and reduced debt substantially about $260 million. We are better positioned now than we were a year ago, with a stronger balance sheet and more flexible and leaner business operations. The strength of our business results reflects continued progress on both our strategic plan and our cost restructuring. Additionally, they highlight our ability to generate operating leverage as revenue trends improve with the economy. 
There is an important shift occurring. The discussion now is focused on market position as the economy continues to improve rather than on cost savings. It is more about the strength of our local market presence, our Regional and National brands, engaging content and the ability to deliver marketing solutions to a wide array of advertisers. Our goal is to provide relevant content on any platform the consumer chooses based on their preferences. We are accomplishing this and we expect to benefit from the many opportunities we see as media consumption and new technology continue to evolve. 
Our employees worked extremely hard to deliver the best content possible, and it is a great accomplishment when their peers recognize their efforts. I'd like to congratulate The Des Moines Register and photographer, Mary Chind, for winning the Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Photography. In addition, nine of our broadcasting stations won 44 regional 2010 Edward R. Murrow awards, and I'd like to congratulate them all as well. 
Before I hand the call over to Gracia, I want to thank all of our employees for all of their efforts in delivering the strong financial results, as well as the wins we achieved company-wide. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gracia."

As Craig noted, we continue to benefit from our r",1514,"Thanks, Craig. Some of the good news this quarter is that each of our business segments improved their profitability compared to a year ago due to improving revenue trends and significantly lower expenses. As Craig noted, we continue to benefit from our revenue initiatives and from consolidations and other efficiency efforts. That was very much the case for our Publishing segment. Pro forma revenue trends improved again this quarter. They progressed steadily through the quarter and were eight percentage points better than last quarter. Total advertising revenue comparisons improved 10 percentage points relative to the fourth quarter as Retail, National and Classified all had smaller declines.
Classified led the better comparisons, improving by about 14 percentage points. The comparisons for Retail and National improved over nine and almost eight percentage points, respectively. Stabilizing economies in the U.K. and the U.S. led to better revenue trends for both Newsquest and our domestic Publishing operations. Ad revenues in the U.S. declined about 9% in the quarter compared to last year's first quarter and were almost 10 percentage points better than the fourth quarter comparison. Similar to comparison trends overall, Classified was about 13 percentage points better domestically, followed by Retail and National. Within Classified, employment and automotive comparisons showed the biggest improvement, 27 and 14 percentage points, respectively. Domestic Classified advertising was just 7% lower in March compared to a year ago.
Turning to Newsquest, their advertising results in pounds trended in much the same way. Classified advertising comparisons improved sequentially about 11 percentage points and were 13% lower than last year's first quarter. Automotive and employment were the most improved relative to fourth quarter comparisons, both were better in the mid- to high-teens. Real estate, although it did not improve as much from the fourth quarter, was down just over 1% compared to the first quarter last year. Retail was just 3% lower year-over-year, and Retail  comparisons for the fourth quarter were about eight percentage points better. National was 2% higher year-over-year and almost five percentage points better than the fourth quarter. Although National advertising for the entire Publishing segment was 2% lower for the quarter and fairly volatile, it increased in the high single digits for our U.S. Community Publishing properties and was also, as I mentioned, a bright spot for Newsquest.
Advertising at USA TODAY continues to be hampered by the slow travel market and was down about 15% in the quarter. Several categories such as Automotive, Technology, Retail and others, had double-digit growth, although the gains were offset by the entertainment, travel, financial and pharmaceutical categories, which lagged last year. 
Turning to our expense picture, we again had lower expenses company-wide in the quarter. Our Publishing segment year-over-year comparisons were impacted by two special items in last year's first quarter. The first was a pension settlement gain of almost $40 million, which was partially offset by workforce restructuring costs of $6.6 million. So if you exclude those special items in the first quarter last year, on an apples-to-apples basis, expenses in the Publishing segment were actually 14% lower. 
Again, our consolidation and efficiency efforts were the primary drivers of the decline, although significantly lower newsprint expense contributed as well. Newsprint expense on a pro forma basis was almost 41% lower, due to substantially lower prices and lower consumption.
Let me just make a brief comment on newsprint. As we all know, last year, there was a global downturn in demand and that resulted in sharply lower newsprint prices. Since then, prices have started to recover, although excess capacity continues to cause a fair amount of market fragmentation. Gannett's newsprint costs are benefiting from a variety of strategic agreements in place for 2010, and we expect favorable newsprint prices at least through the second quarter.
One other reminder regarding expenses. Savings associated with the furloughs in this year's first quarter were not as high as the furlough savings in the first quarter of last year, about $13 million this year versus $20 million in the first quarter of last year, so about a $7 million swing. 
As Craig noted, our increased profitability, particularly in the Publishing segment, reflects the permanent restructuring of our costs in a more stable ad environment. Operating income and operating cash flow, excluding special items, were substantially higher this quarter compared to the first quarter last year. The Publishing segment operating income increased almost 60%, about $62 million, despite a revenue decline of about $78 million. Operating cash flow on a comparable basis was 38% higher.
In our Broadcasting segment, revenue was up significantly in the quarter, almost 17%. In March, which was not impacted by the Olympics or any other special events, advertising, excluding political, was up in the high single digits. Several categories had double-digit increases, including the top two, Automotive and Retail, which were up over 30% and 23%, respectively. 
Broadcasting operating expenses were down slightly in the quarter as an increase in advertising sales costs related to the higher revenues was offset by cost controls and efficiency efforts. Operating income, therefore, was up over 55% and operating cash flow totaled almost $77 million, an increase of over 45%.
At this point, given current trends, we expect the percentage increase in television ad revenues for the second quarter this year to be in the very high teens to the low 20s compared to last year. But as always, remember, pacings are a point in time and can change substantially, just as we saw in the first quarter. 
And let me also remind you that the first quarter is generally the smallest quarter of the year for our Digital segment, and this year was no different. Revenues in the Digital segment declined just 2% to $141 million in the quarter. Strong revenue growth at PointRoll did not quite offset the impact the current employment environment had on CareerBuilder's revenue. Although CareerBuilder's revenues declined 5% year-over-year, they improved significantly relative to fourth quarter comparisons.
Digital operating expenses were also 5% lower. In addition, similar to last quarter, costs accrued for an employee incentive compensation plan that is tied to the performance of certain digital businesses impacted operating expenses. If you exclude that incentive comp plan charge, operating expenses would have been over 6% lower compared to last year's first quarter. As a result, operating income would have been about 70% higher than the reported number of $3.4 million. As is typical, Digital segment profitability in the first quarter is disproportionately smaller, as marketing and promotional expenses are higher relative to the remaining quarters in the year.
Almost all of the businesses in the Digital segment, including CareerBuilder, had substantially higher operating income and cash flow this quarter compared to last year, reflecting their revenue performance and the focus on cost control in the businesses. CareerBuilder's North American network revenues were approximately $132 million in the first quarter, down about 6% from last year. In comparison to the fourth quarter of last year, however, North American network revenue was actually up 1% as Classified employment at the affiliate newspapers increased well over 10%.
Now turning to our Digital revenues company-wide, which include our Digital segment, as well as in our legacy businesses, our company-wide Digital revenues were over $225 million, up slightly compared to last year. Digital revenues at U.S. Community Publishing were up in the mid-single digits. Once again, employment was a factor, although the auto, National and Retail categories were much stronger in the quarter. If you exclude employment, online revenues in our U.S. Community Publishing group were up over 10%. In March this year, our monthly Digital metrics improved compared to both February and March of last year. Stronger results for our certain Digital investments, particularly Classified Ventures, drove a $3 million increase in our equity income line. So overall, operating cash flow, absent special items, totaled $274 million in the quarter, a 39% increase from the first quarter last year. 
Let me turn to the balance sheet quickly. As we've noted, significantly more revenue dropped to the bottom line, and as a result, we are generating a very substantial level of free cash flow. We used that free cash flow to reduce long-term debt by $260 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, long-term debt stood at $2.8 billion, and we had just over $100 million in cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet. Our all-in cost of debt is 5.3% at this point. And our debt-to-EBITDA covenant ratio was just 2.3x, substantially below the 3.5x covenant. One final item, CapEx in the quarter totaled just under $9 million.
So in summary, we are delivering on our commitment to permanently reconfigure our cost structure, strengthen our balance sheet and create leaner, more flexible business operations as our results this quarter clearly demonstrate. And with a little more help from the economy, we are poised to grow our revenue base as we leverage our market strength, the value of our brands and the appeal of our content. 
With that, I'll stop, and Craig and I will be happy to take your questions."

And I think our focus is really to get a larger buy out of each of those Local customers than we've done in the past. So I think that's where our focus lies. I would say also on the Digital side, from a rate perspective, what we are seeing is that rates are clearly firming there, and in certain areas, we are actually seeing some improvement in rates. And then if you turn to the Television side, it's clear that rates there have firmed, and we expect in a year like 2010 that we're going to see very good follow through on the rate side.

But that's very good news because we're delighted to have 100% of that revenue with only about a 15% drop on the expense slide on the newsprint side. You're very correct that we did have about $25 million of furlough savings in the second quarter of last year. And as we announced a couple of weeks ago, other than some small areas, we will not have company-wide furloughs in the second quarter. So that's about $25 million.

I don't think Easter is as big a deal as it once was. But certainly, there is a little bit of clearly a preprint impact early, and then the Easter Sunday, usually you see a little bit of a fall off on the classified side."

As we had mentioned, the Courtyard by Marriott is booked straight through on an exclusive basis through July 3 or 4, I believe is the date, John. And our anticipation based on the early numbers that we're seeing, keep in mind, we're only into this two weeks. So it is, when we look at the kind of numbers we have though, they are very, very encouraging. Our expectation is that we will see this continue as we move forward there. With respect to is it incremental or otherwise, at this point, it's really hard to say. I think we're going to have to get a good read on it, if this is replacing or not. But I have to say, I don't know if you've seen the app yet on the iPad, it is absolutely gorgeous. I think the team has done an absolutely remarkable job with it in a very short period of time. And I think the more people see this and just how beautiful it is, it's a very easy application to work with. I would expect that we're going to see a continued growth in this with similar numbers for some time to come. I hope with the supply issue that Apple seems to have at this point, it does not slow anything down. But my guess is, since domestically we'll be covered, it should be positive. With the other areas that we're on, I would not really comment as positively toward the Kindle. It just -- that's a whole different environment. And as I say, it's just different. And without really the real beauty of the impact from the application, it, I don't think it has the traction by any means that we do on the other side. Again, when you look at it even on the iPhone, you get a pretty good sense of what you're seeing. But we're very pleased at this point, John, where all this is headed."

I understand that it is very, very good selling item, but over here, it's still in the development stage. I have also seen some development in the pre-releases of some of the smartphones. And what we are looking at is good quality video. It fits very nicely with the other applications of camera and everything you would expect from a smartphone. And those things are coming together. But it is still early. There's an awful lot to be done once we get these understandings together among the group.

But also, we want to be able to show a true utilization of that spectrum and how it is going to serve our consumers and certainly the public and how it is being utilized. So we were there, we heard lots of anticipation from, certainly, the Chairman's perspective. But I think what you will see out of this is a true need that is developed. Some of the key things, and I think I mentioned a little of this earlier. But certainly, from an emergency perspective, what that can offer on a scale coverage to the U.S. is still probably the single most coverage that any one thing can achieve. And I think that is a huge benefit. So there are a lot of things that would counter certainly from our perspective where the Chairman was. But the side of monetization, our belief is, is that with this model and how it can come together, yes, that can be certainly monetized. Again, it's awfully early at this point. We talked earlier as to the development of that model. And as I said, that is being worked on as we speak. But just to finish here, we did here. We take it very serious, and we're responding I think in the best way we all know how, improving and showing real need for that spectrum and utilization."

I’m extremely pleased to announce another quarter of improving results. Advertising demand firmed during the quarter as we benefited from the strength of our local market franchises, both here and in the UK. In second quarter, our revenue comparisons were better relative to the first quarter with total revenue down only slightly.
Broadcast and digital revenues were particularly strong while publishing revenues were down in the mid-single digits. Expense declines again, outpaced the revenue decline for the quarter. As a result, we increased our bottom line significantly with a 33% increase in both adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share.
As the economy improves and ad demand strengthens, the efficiency efforts we put in place are continuing to contribute results in the quarter. We have also made great strides in transforming Gannett to a multimedia, multiplatform company. We are positioned for growth in both our core assets and our unique digital businesses. We are committed to leveraging the strength of our local brands and extending our reach particularly our digital reach in all of our markets.
In the second quarter, we announced several initiatives that will help achieve that goal and today’s announcement is also significant. Our local advertising partnership with Yahoo! will further extend the digital reach for both our local publishing and several of our broadcast properties. The partnership combines our strong local brands and deep local connections with Yahoo!’s broad digital audience and audience targeting capabilities.
As a result of the partnership, we will increase our digital reach to as much as 80% of the total local digital audience. That will promote greater results for our advertising clients as they will be able to reach larger audiences as well as deliver more relevant ads based on demography, geography, user interest and more.
Yahoo! as a reminder does not have a local sales or marketing presence to work with local advertisers and businesses. From our operational perspective, our corporate US community publishing and broadcast teams in conjunction with Yahoo’s dedicated partnership team will work closely with each site’s management and sales teams on a detailed training and deployment plan.
All messaging, scheduling and delivery on Yahoo! sites for programs sold by Gannett’s local media organizations, sales teams to advertisers will be developed and fulfilled by Gannett. We expect, that all of our local, domestic publishing operations and several of our broadcasting properties will be participating.
In addition to the partnership with Yahoo!, we are enhancing the value of our local television brands through the development of community focused websites and our television markets. Through these hyperlocal websites, we will be able to extend the services we offer to our viewers as well as our advertisers. The sites will be integrated with an existing broadcasting websites and feature news content as well as user-generated content concerning local events.
With this more local focus, advertisers will be better equipped to target local audiences. Not only is their reach an important component of our business model, but the demand for our content is critical to the strength of our local market franchises. We think our content has tremendous value and we want to better understand consumer response to paying for that content. We began testing on July 1, paid content models in three of our publishing markets. Those are Greenville, South Carolina, Tallahassee, Florida and St. George, Utah.
We hope to glean some insights from these tests that will help us formulate and develop our long-term strategy for paid content. As you are well aware, the number and diversity of our markets allow us to experiment without disrupting our business model for the company as a whole. We view that as a tremendous advantage and we intend to leverage it as we gauge consumer and advertiser response. In the mean time, we are providing our content to consumers wherever, whenever and however they choose to receive it. Whether it is on mobile, web, print, broadcast or through wireless devices such as the iPad. Consumer and advertiser response has been strong for our mobile applications on the iPhone, iPad, iTouch and Android platforms.
Since we published the first USA TODAY iPhone application, just about a year and a half ago, total consumer downloads of the USA TODAY, iPhone, iTouch, iPad and Android, news applications plus travel applications is just over 5 million. The USA Today app on the iPad remains the number one free news and information app and is an extremely popular free app.
And advertiser interest is high with brands like Coca Cola, Barnes & Noble, Capital One and Chrysler all signing on as sponsors. As a result the USA Today app on the iPad will remain an add supported through at least the third quarter. In our publishing segment, while the advertising backdrop improved, we continue to focus on the transformation of our publishing sides on several fronts.
Client-focused marketing solutions, centralization of production functions and content management among others. To better serve our advertisers and deliver multi-platform solutions to them, we began to rollout regional client solutions groups during the quarter. These client solutions groups will help us address a much more complex selling environment.
Consumer behavior is changing in the media landscape and our publishing operations are now multimedia organizations to better reflect our full portfolio of products and consumer touch points, including digital and mobile capabilities. That presents new revenue opportunities for us as we help businesses understand, harness and benefit from our loyal and engaged audiences.
The solutions group will act much like agencies for local advertisers and will develop sophisticated marketing solutions, managing and adjusting campaigns according to desired results. Also during the quarter, we ramped up our centralized US community publishing ad production centers and now have 23 sites directing ad production to the centers.
Recently, in a single week the centers delivered a record 12,000 ads to pagination and received almost 14,000 ad orders. With the centralization of this process, we are improving ad production and creating efficiency within the division. That will allow us to focus on core strengths such as locally-driven customer based advertising solutions. We are managing our content in much the same way leveraging content where possible to free up those in the newsroom to focus on deep local content coverage.
For example, many of our publishing sites now include content developed by USA Today. More than half include a nation world page in their papers and over 60% a baseball page. And the consumer feedback has been positive. A reader in Fort Myers told us and I quote, “Imagine my surprise and pleasure to open today’s News Press and see a page in the sports section from USA Today and another in the main section on National and International News. What a great way to enhance your paper.” Once again, we are creating efficiency as well as enhancing the product and extending the brand of USA Today.
We are not stopping there. We are looking at additional ways to extend the partnership with USA Today. So, moving onto our results for the quarter. As we previously announced, we divested the Honolulu advertiser and a small publishing operation during the quarter. So our results reflect, both discontinued operations as well as gains on the sales.
Additionally, we had significant tax, net tax benefits in the quarter. Earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding special items, were $0.61, a 33% increase from the comparable amount in the second quarter of 2009. Operating revenue totaled $1.4 billion and on a pro forma basis was down only about 1%. The exchange rate for the British pound created a headwind for the quarter.
So on our pro forma, constant currency basis, the operating revenue would have been about one half of 1% lower or 0.4%. The revenue comparison improved versus the year’s first quarter. The strength of our local franchisees in our broadcasting segment drove the 20% increase in total television revenues, in the quarter. Top tier ratings for our local news programming were the key to attracting substantially higher core advertising revenues in the quarter. That combined with an extremely good footprint, lead to about $12 million in political advertising, which we fully expect to ramp significantly in the third and fourth quarter this year. 
Digital segment revenues increased 8% in the quarter, driven by revenue growth at CareerBuilder of approximately 4%. The first time we’ve seen revenue growth from CareerBuilder since the fourth quarter of 2008. PointRoll and ShopLocal, both had double-digit revenue growth which contributed to the increases as well. We continue to close the revenue gap in publishing, as publishing advertising revenues and pro forma total revenues were both down about 5%. Once again, the exchange rate had an impact on the revenue comparison. So, on pro forma basis, constant currency basis total publishing revenues declined about 4%, while publishing advertising revenues were down almost 5%. 
In June, total advertising revenues were 3.6% lower on a constant currency basis. On that basis, it was not only the best comparison month of this year, it was the best comparison month since early 2007. Results on the digital side improved, significantly. With online revenue growth at US Community Publishing increasing almost 14%, while at Newsquest digital revenues increased just over 9% in pounds. Broadcasting, digital revenues were over 23% higher, due in part to a significant increase Captivate’s online results. Company-wide digital revenues were almost 19% of total revenues and were up almost 10%.
Total company-wide expenses, excluding special items were almost 8% lower; reflecting the operating leverage that we have created in our business segments. They all achieved significantly higher profitability and operating cash flow in the quarter, compared to the second quarter of last year. Operating cash flow was $327 million in the quarter, up over 30%. As a result, we reduced debt by $170 million.
In summary, our focus remains on providing relevant, trusted content on any platform that the customer wants. At the same time, we are committed to expanding our reach in offering better solutions for advertisers as our partnership what Yahoo! demonstrates. We are improving our position in markets, while at the same time strengthening our balance sheet and increasing our flexibility to invest in our businesses. We believe there are significant opportunities as the media landscape shifts and we are positioned for growth, as it does.
But, before I hand the call over to Gracia, I just want to thank all of our employees for all of their efforts during this quarter. It’s very much appreciated. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Gracia.

Let me go into results for our business segments in more detail and cover a few balance sheet items. Then we will open up the call for questions. As a reminder, all of our category comparisons have been included in the release this morning.",1551,"Thanks, Craig. Let me go into results for our business segments in more detail and cover a few balance sheet items. Then we will open up the call for questions. As a reminder, all of our category comparisons have been included in the release this morning.
Our results this quarter reflect the significant operating leverage that has been created in all of our business segments. The Broadcasting and Digital segments, both had substantially higher revenues, and we further closed the revenue gap in publishing. Expenses as Craig said, were lower company-wide as we benefited from our ongoing cost control and efficiency efforts and. were achieved even after comparing against $25 million of furlough savings in the second quarter of last year. The result, improving profitability in each of our business segments. 
In publishing, total revenue comparisons this quarter on a pro forma constant currency basis, were about 4% lower. But we are almost three percentage points better than the first quarter. On that same basis, total advertising revenue comparison, again we are about four percentage points better than the first quarter and we are down about 5%. Classified and Retail drove the better comparisons, and we’re six percentage points and four percentage points better than the first quarter. 
I should also remind you that we sold Honolulu and a small directories business `this quarter. And their results are in discontinued operations. As well, we sold a small commercial printing business in the UK last year. Those businesses had about $35 million to $40 million of revenue in the second quarter last year whereas. we are reporting no revenue in the quarter this year from those businesses.
Ad revenue trends in both the US and UK improved in the second quarter compared to the first. In the US, advertising revenues were 5% lower versus last year as Retail, National, and Classified were all better relative to the first quarter. Reflecting advertising trends overall, Classified improved the most, down just 3% and six percentage points better than the first quarter, then followed by Retail and National.
Within Classified, employment and automotive comparison showed the largest favorable change, an. improvement of 17 percentage points for employment, and eight points for auto, relative to the first quarter. Domestic Classified advertising was just 2% lower in June, versus last year. Newsquest advertising results trended the right way overall, although trends within categories were much different than in the US.
It is worth noting, that the sequential improvement within the quarter was significant, as June advertising revenues in pounds were just 2% lower compared to a double-digit decline in April. Classified advertising comparisons at Newsquest improved sequentially, as well during the second quarter, down 7% in pounds, but six percentage points better than the first quarter.
Within Classified, all of the categories improved sequentially, and the year-over-year comparison in the second quarter were better relative to the first. In fact, real estate in the quarter increased 5%. Automotive and employment declined, but we are almost four and nine percentage points better than the first quarter respectively. Retail and National also improve sequentially. The general elections and the Easter switch, did have an adverse impact on the second quarter ad demand in the UK. 
National advertising for the total publishing segment was about 3% lower in the quarter, adjusted for currency exchange rates. National advertising at US Community Publishing increased about 23% , while softness in the travel and lodging industries continued to impact results at USA TODAY. In fact declines in travel as well as the entertainment and telecom categories offset double-digit revenue gains in the Automotive, Retail and Packaged goods areas.
As Craig noted, the expense decline company-wide in the quarter outpaced the operating revenue decline. Expense comparisons this quarter were impacted by special items in the second quarter last year, as noted in the press release. The bulk of these items impacted the publishing segments. So publishing segment expenses, including the special items from last year were down about 10%.
The biggest driver of the expense decline was our continued efforts to create efficiencies and consolidate operations. Substantially, lower newsprint also contributed to the decline. Significantly lower prices and lower consumption resulted in a 31% reduction in pro forma newsprint expense. The expense reductions in publishings were partially offset by the relative absence of approximately $20 million in furlough savings in last year's second quarter.
Drilling down a little bit on newsprint and turning to current newsprint market conditions, producers are benefiting from supply rationalizations and considerably stronger exports to Latin America, and non-Japan Asia. Despite prices that have been rising since late 2009, second quarter pricing for Gannett remained favorable with pro forma unit costs down about 24% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect newsprint expense savings for the third quarter. However, they will be at a lower level compared to what we realized in the first half of the year. Operating expense reductions and moderating declines in publishing revenue resulted in significantly better profitability in the publishing segment.
Operating income excluding special items was about $31 million higher or 21%, a significant increase given a decline of approximately $65 million in operating revenues and operating cash flow was up considerably as well, about 23%. Profitability improved dramatically in our broadcasting segment, due primarily to substantial growth in revenues and small increases and expenses.
Operating revenues were up over 20%, driven both by strength in core advertising and an increase in politically related ad spending of almost $10 million in the quarter, that’s the increase. Several categories had double-digit growth, although the auto category was extremely strong in the quarter, about 70% up. Expenses excluding special items in the broadcasting segment were up about 5% reflecting primarily higher ad sales costs as anticipated given the revenue growth as well as the absence of about $3 million in furlough savings last year. The increases were offset in part by the impact of continuing efforts to create efficiencies in the segment. Operating income and operating cash flow were both up significantly in the quarter, 56% and 44% respectively.
In light of current trends, we expect the percentage increase in television, ad revenues for the third quarter at this point to be in the mid 20s and if pushed today more likely at the higher end of the mid 20s range. It is very early in the quarter however and projecting how the quarter will end is made more difficult by political. That’s particularly difficult to predict given that if we expect the majority of political to be placed toward the end of the quarter.
However, given our terrific footprint and the enormous strength of our stations, we expect to fully benefit from whatever level of political spending occurs in our markets. 
Turning to Digital, our segment generated very good revenue growth as well as improving profitability. As Craig noted the return to revenue growth for CarreerBuilder after several quarters of lagging revenue drove the increase in Digital segment revenues. Significant revenue increases at PointRoll and ShopLocal in the mid 30s and the mid teens respectively also contributed to the increase.
Operating expenses in Digital increased just 2% in the quarter and CarreerBuilder’s expenses were flat compared to the second quarter last year. As a result, digital segment operating income was up over 49% and operating cash flow was 30% higher.
CarreerBuilder, PointRoll and ShopLocal, each had substantial double-digit gains in operating income and operating cash flow.
Looking at our company-wide Digital revenues which include our Digital segment as well as our other operations, revenues totaled over $252 million in the second quarter and over $483 million year-to-date. Digital revenues in both the publishing and broadcast segment as Craig noted were significantly higher. In US community publishing, several major categories such as automotive employment, national and retail were all up in the quarter and our other divisions saw strong increases as well.
Now let me turn to the balance sheet quickly. We reduced our debt by over a $170 million in the quarter driven by that significant operating cash flow, we both just talked about. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $2.6 billion and cash and marketable securities totaled a $157 million. At this point, our all-in cost-to-debt is 5.5%. Finally, capital expenditures were about $11 million in the quarter bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $20 million.
So in summary, we are seeing encouraging revenue trends in all of our segments particularly in the broadcast and digital components. The operating leverage we created continues to take hold in our businesses and we will benefit greatly from the initiatives we have put in place this quarter and in prior quarters and from firming advertising demand with some help from the economy.
We are certainly, as we all know seeing mixed signals on the economy and as we have been saying over the last several months, the economy remains somewhat fragile. We will keep our eyes on that, but we will always maintain our financial discipline as we move to the later half of the year. But we are absolutely heartened by the strong results of our divisions and we are very well positioned to continue to make significant progress.
Now I will stop there and Craig and I will be happy to take your questions.

I have one clarifying question and then one actual question. So to kind of talk about the elephant in the room I guess, your stock price is getting clobbered at the moment, I think because everyone was a bit confused when you suggested that the quarter would end with publishing revenues down in the low to mid-single digits and on a reported basis, is minus six which looks like a miss, however I think you alluded to the fact that you sold about $35 million to $40 million of revenue. So Craig when you spoke of that, will that before pro forming on an apples-to-apples basis because if I do that, it looks like instead of minus six, you are at minus two, so that’s the clarification and then I have got a question.

The reason why stock comp spiked up in the first quarter, is in part as you say because our stock price was significantly higher, and in the first quarter is when we issue stock option grants to a number of folks. And so, that’s typically the biggest quarter until the fourth quarter on stock comp. As I mentioned on our first quarter earnings call, we expected stock comp to be more in line with last year’s number in the second and third quarter when we’re really not issuing new shares and therefore, there’s a bit of a run-rate that’s in effect.
With regard to newsprint, I would say that we continue to be pleased with the work that we’re doing, that our folks and again our supplier doing in managing our newsprint pricing and expenses. And I don't think it’s any more or less optimistic I think, it’s consistent with where we felt we were going to be.

So, and then obviously on the broadcasting side, prices there are doing very well given the significant demand for television space, right at the moment. And as I mentioned in the first quarter, pricing is certainly firming and increasing in some categories on the digital side. So we’re feeling good about the ad rate side.

I am extremely pleased to announce another quarter of improving results. Advertising demand firmed during the quarter, as we benefited from the strength of our local market franchises, both here and in the U.K.",1768,"Thanks, Gracia, and good morning, everyone. I am extremely pleased to announce another quarter of improving results. Advertising demand firmed during the quarter, as we benefited from the strength of our local market franchises, both here and in the U.K. In the second quarter, our revenue comparisons were better relative to the first quarter, with total revenue down only slightly. 
Broadcast and Digital revenues were particularly strong, while Publishing revenues were down in the mid-single digits. Expense declines, again, outpaced the revenue decline for the quarter. As a result, we increased our bottom line significantly with a 33% increase in both adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share.
As the economy improves and as demand strengthens, the efficiency efforts we put in place are continuing to contribute results in the quarter. We have also made great strides in transforming Gannett to a multimedia, multi-platform company. We are positioned for growth in both our core assets and our unique Digital businesses. We are committed to leveraging the strength of our local brands and extending our reach, particularly our digital reach in all of our markets.
In the second quarter, we announced several initiatives that will help achieve that goal, and today's announcement is also significant. Our local advertising partnership with Yahoo will further extend the digital reach for both our local publishing and several of our broadcast properties. The partnership combines our strong local brands and deep local connections with Yahoo's broad digital audience and audience-targeting capabilities. 
As a result of the partnership, we will increase our digital reach to as much as 80% of the total local digital audience. That will promote greater results for our advertising clients, as they will be able to reach larger audiences as well as deliver more relevant ads based on demography, geography, user interest and more.
Yahoo, as a reminder, does not have a local sales or marketing presence to work with local advertisers and businesses. From our operational perspective, our Corporate U.S., Community Publishing and Broadcast teams, in conjunction with Yahoo's dedicated partnership team, will work closely with each site's management and sales teams on a detailed training and deployment plan. All messaging, scheduling and delivery on Yahoo sites for programs sold by Gannett's local media organizations, sales teams to advertisers will be developed and fulfilled by Gannett. We expect that all of our local, domestic Publishing operations and several of our Broadcasting properties will be participating.
In addition to the partnership with Yahoo, we are enhancing the value of our local television brands through the development of community-focused websites in our television markets. Through these hyperlocal websites, we will be able to extend the services we offer to our viewers as well as our advertisers. The sites will be integrated within existing broadcasting websites and feature news content as well as user-generated content concerning local events. 
With this more local focus, advertisers will be better equipped to target local audiences. Not only is our reach an important component of our business model, but the demand for our content is critical to the strength of our local market franchises. We think our content has tremendous value, and we want to better understand consumer response to paying for that content.
We began testing on July 1, paid content models in three of our publishing markets. Those are: Greenville, South Carolina; Tallahassee, Florida and St. George, Utah. We hope to glean some insights from these tests that will help us formulate and develop our long-term strategy for paid content. As you are well aware, the number and diversity of our markets allow us to experiment without disrupting our business model for the company as a whole. We view that as a tremendous advantage, and we intend to leverage it as we gauge consumer and advertiser response. 
In the meantime, we are providing our content to consumers wherever, whenever and however they choose to receive it, whether it is on mobile, web, print, broadcast or through wireless devices such as the iPad. Consumer and advertiser response has been strong for our mobile applications on the iPhone, iPad, iTouch and Android platforms. Since we published the first USA TODAY iPhone application just about a year and a half ago, total consumer downloads of the USA TODAY iPhone, iTouch, iPad and Android news applications, plus travel applications, is just over 5 million. 
The USA TODAY app on the iPad remains the number one free news and information app and is an extremely popular free app, and advertiser interest is high with brands like Coca-Cola, Barnes & Noble, Capital One and Chrysler, all signing on as sponsors. As a result, the USA TODAY app on the iPad will remain an ad supported through at least the third quarter.
In our Publishing segment, while the advertising backdrop improved, we continued to focus on the transformation of our publishing sites on several fronts. Client-focused marketing solutions, centralization of production functions and content management among others.
To better serve our advertisers and deliver multi-platform solutions to them, we began to roll out regional client solutions groups during the quarter. These client solutions groups will help us address a much more complex selling environment. Consumer behavior is changing in the media landscape, and our publishing operations are now multimedia organizations to better reflect our full portfolio of products and consumer touch points, including digital and mobile capabilities. That presents new revenue opportunities for us as we help businesses understand, harness and benefit from our loyal and engaged audiences. The solutions group will act much like agencies for local advertisers and will develop sophisticated marketing solutions, managing and adjusting campaigns according to desired results.
Also during the quarter, we ramped up our centralized U.S. Community Publishing ad production centers and now have 23 sites directing ad production to the centers. Recently, in a single week, the centers delivered a record 12,000 ads to pagination and received almost 14,000 ad orders. With the centralization of this process, we are improving ad production and creating efficiency within the division. That will allow us to focus on core strengths such as locally driven, customer-based advertising solutions.
We are managing our content in much the same way, leveraging content where possible to free up those in the newsroom to focus on deep, local content coverage. For example, many of our publishing sites now include content developed by USA TODAY. More than half include a nation world page in their papers and over 60%, a baseball page, and the consumer feedback has been positive. A reader in Fort Myers told us, and I quote, ""Imagine my surprise and pleasure to open today's news press and see a page in the sports section from USA TODAY and another in the main section on national and international news. What a great way to enhance your paper."" Once again, we are creating efficiency as well as enhancing the product and extending the brand of USA TODAY. We are not stopping there. We are looking at additional ways to extend the partnership with USA TODAY.
So moving on to our results for the quarter. As we previously announced, we divested The Honolulu Advertiser and a small publishing operation during the quarter. So our results reflect both discontinued operations as well as gains on the sales. Additionally, we had significant net tax benefit in the quarter. Earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding special items, were $0.61, a 33% increase from the comparable amount in the second quarter of 2009. 
Operating revenue totaled $1.4 billion, and on a pro forma basis, was down only about 1%. The exchange rate for the British pound created a headwind for the quarter. So on a pro forma, constant currency basis, the operating revenue would have been about 1/2 of 1% lower or 0.4%. The revenue comparison improved versus the year's first quarter. The strength of our local franchises in our Broadcasting segment drove the 20% increase in total television revenues in the quarter. 
Top-tier ratings for our local news programming were the key to attracting substantially higher core advertising revenues in the quarter. That, combined with an extremely good footprint, led to about $12 million in political advertising, which we fully expect to ramp significantly in the third and fourth quarter this year.
Digital segment revenues increased 8% in the quarter, driven by revenue growth at CareerBuilder of approximately 4%, the first time we have seen revenue growth from CareerBuilder since the fourth quarter of 2008. 
PointRoll and ShopLocal both had double-digit revenue growth, which contributed to the increases as well. We continue to close the revenue gap in Publishing, as Publishing advertising revenues and pro forma total revenues were both down about 5%. Once again, the exchange rate had an impact on the revenue comparison. 
So on a pro forma basis, constant currency basis, total Publishing revenues declined about 4%, while Publishing advertising revenues were down almost 5%. In June, total advertising revenues were 3.6% lower on a constant currency basis. On that basis, it was not only the best comparison month of this year, it was the best comparison month since early 2007. 
Results on the Digital side improved significantly. With online revenue growth at U.S. Community Publishing increasing almost 14%, while at Newsquest, Digital revenues increased just over 9% in pounds.
Broadcasting digital revenues were over 23% higher due in part to a significant increase in Captivate's online results. Company-wide Digital revenues were almost 19% of total revenues and were up almost 10%. 
Total company-wide expenses, excluding special items, were almost 8% lower, reflecting the operating leverage that we have created in our business segments. They all achieved significantly higher profitability and operating cash flow in the quarter compared to the second quarter last year.  Operating cash flow was $327 million in the quarter, up over 30%. As a result, we reduced debt by $170 million. 
In summary, our focus remains on providing relevant, trusted content on any platform that the customer wants. At the same time, we are committed to expanding our reach and offering better solutions for advertisers as our partnership with Yahoo demonstrates. We are improving our position in markets, while at the same time strengthening our balance sheet and increasing our flexibility to invest in our businesses. We believe there are significant opportunities as the media landscape shifts, and we are positioned for growth as it does. 
But before I hand the call over to Gracia, I just want to thank all of our employees for all of their efforts during this quarter. It's very much appreciated. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gracia."

Let me go into results for our business segments in more detail and cover a few balance sheet items, then we'll open up the call for questions. As a reminder, all of our category comparisons have been included in the release this morning.",1540,"Thanks, Craig. Let me go into results for our business segments in more detail and cover a few balance sheet items, then we'll open up the call for questions. As a reminder, all of our category comparisons have been included in the release this morning.
Our results this quarter reflect a significant operating leverage that has been created in all of our business segments. The Broadcasting and Digital segments both had substantially higher revenues, and we further closed the revenue gap in Publishing. Expenses, as Craig said, were lower company wide, as we benefited from our ongoing cost control and efficiency efforts and were achieved even after comparing against $25 million of furlough savings in the second quarter of last year. The result, improving profitability in each of our business segments.
In Publishing, total revenue comparisons this quarter on a pro forma, constant currency basis were about 4% lower but were almost three percentage points better than the first quarter. On that same basis, total advertising revenue comparison, again, were about four percentage points better than the first quarter and were down about 5%. Classified and retail drove the better comparisons and were six percentage points and four percentage points better than the first quarter.
I should also remind you that we sold Honolulu and a small Directories business this quarter, and their results are in discontinued operations. As well, we sold a small Commercial Printing business in the U.K. last year. Those businesses had about $35 million to $40 million of revenue in the second quarter last year, whereas we are reporting no revenue in the quarter this year from those businesses, and revenue trends in both the U.S. and the U.K. improved in the second quarter compared to the first. 
In the U.S, advertising revenues were 5% lower versus last year, as retail, national and classified were all better relative to the first quarter. Reflecting advertising trends overall, classified improved the most, down just 3% and six percentage points better than the first quarter, then followed by retail and national. Within classified, employment and automotive comparisons showed the largest favorable change, an improvement of 17 percentage points for employment and eight points for auto relative to the first quarter.
Domestic classified advertising was just 2% lower in June versus last year. Newsquest advertising results trended the right way overall, although trends within categories were much different than in the U.S. It is worth noting that the sequential improvement within the quarter was significant, as June advertising revenues in pounds were just 2% lower compared to a double-digit decline in April. Classified advertising comparisons at Newsquest improved sequentially as well during the second quarter, down 7% in pounds but six percentage points better than the first quarter. 
Within classified, all of the categories improved sequentially, and the year-over-year comparisons in the second quarter were better relative to the first. In fact, real estate in the quarter increased 5%. Automotive and employment declined but were almost four and nine percentage points better than the first quarter, respectively. Retail and National also improved sequentially. The general elections and the Easter switch did have an adverse impact on the second quarter ad demand in the U.K.
National advertising for the total Publishing segment was about 3% lower in the quarter adjusted for currency exchange rates. National advertising at U.S. Community Publishing increased about 23%, while softness in the travel and lodging industries continue to impact results at USA TODAY. In fact, declines in travel as well as the entertainment and telecom categories offset double-digit revenue gains in the automotive, retail and packaged goods areas.
As Craig noted, the expense decline company wide in the quarter outpaced the operating revenue decline. Expense comparisons this quarter were impacted by special items in the second quarter last year as noted in the press release. The bulk of these items impacted the Publishing segment. So Publishing segment expenses, including the special items from last year, were down about 10%. The biggest driver of the expense decline was our continued efforts to create efficiencies and consolidate operations. Substantially lower newsprint also contributed to the decline. Significantly lower prices and lower consumption resulted in a 31% reduction in pro forma newsprint expense. The expense reductions in Publishing were partially offset by the relative absence of approximately $20 million in furlough savings in last year's second quarter.
Drilling down a little bit on newsprint and turning to current newsprint market conditions, producers are benefiting from supply rationalizations and considerably stronger exports to Latin America and non-Japan Asia. Despite prices that have been rising since late 2009, second quarter pricing for Gannett remains favorable, with pro forma unit cost down about 24% year-over-year. 
Looking ahead, we expect newsprint expense savings for the third quarter. However, they will be at a lower level compared to what we realized in the first half of the year.
Operating expense reductions and moderating declines in Publishing revenue resulted in significantly better profitability in the Publishing segment. Operating income, excluding special items, was about $31 million higher or 21%, a significant increase given a decline of approximately $65 million in operating revenues, and operating cash flow was up considerably as well, about 23%. 
Profitability improved dramatically in our Broadcasting segment due primarily to substantial growth in revenues and small increases in expenses. Operating revenues were up over 20%, driven both by strength in core advertising and an increase in politically related ad spending of almost $10 million in the quarter. That's the increase.
Several categories had double-digit growth although the auto category was extremely strong in the quarter, about 70% up. Expenses, excluding special items in the Broadcasting segment, were up about 5%, reflecting primarily higher ad sales cost as anticipated given the revenue growth as well as the absence of about $3 million in furlough savings last year. The increases were offset in part by the impact of continuing efforts to create efficiencies in the segment. Operating income and operating cash flow were both up significantly in the quarter, 56% and 44%, respectively.
In light of current trends, we expect the percentage increase in television ad revenues for the third quarter at this point to be in the mid-20s, and if pushed today, more likely at the higher end of the mid-20s range. It is very early in the quarter, however, and projecting how the quarter will end is made more difficult by political. That's particularly difficult to predict given that we expect the majority of political to be placed toward the end of the quarter. However, given our terrific footprint and the enormous strength of our stations, we expect to fully benefit from whatever level of political spending occurs in our markets.
Turning to Digital. Our segment generated very good revenue growth as well as improving profitability. As Craig noted, the return to revenue growth for CareerBuilder after several quarters of lagging revenue drove the increase in Digital segment revenues. Significant revenue increases at PointRoll and ShopLocal in the mid-30s and the mid-teens, respectively, also contributed to the increase. 
Operating expenses in Digital increased just 2% in the quarter, and CareerBuilder's expenses were flat compared to the second quarter last year. As a result, Digital segment operating income was up over 49%, and operating cash flow was 30% higher. CareerBuilder, PointRoll and ShopLocal each had substantial double-digit gains in operating income and operating cash flow. 
Looking at our company-wide Digital revenues, which include our Digital segment as well as our other operations, revenues totaled over $252 million in the second quarter and over $483 million year-to-date. Digital revenues in both the Publishing and Broadcasting segments, as Craig noted, were significantly higher. In U.S. Community Publishing, several major categories such as automotive, employment, national and retail were all up in the quarter, and our other divisions saw strong increases as well.
Now let me turn to the balance sheet quickly. We reduced our debt by over $170 million in the quarter, driven by that significant operating cash flow we both just talked about. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $2.6 billion, and cash and marketable securities totaled $157 million. At this point, our all-in cost of debt is 5.5%. Finally, capital expenditures were about $11 million in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $20 million.
So in summary, we are seeing encouraging revenue trends in all of our segments, particularly in the Broadcast and Digital components. The operating leverage we created continues to take hold in our businesses, and we will benefit greatly from the initiatives we have put in place this quarter and in prior quarters and from firming advertising demand with some help from the economy. 
We are certainly, as we all know, seeing mixed signals on the economy, and as we have been saying over the last several months, the economy remains somewhat fragile. We'll keep our eyes on that, but we'll always maintain our financial discipline as we move to the later half of the year. But we are absolutely heartened by the strong results of our divisions, and we are very well positioned to continue to make significant progress.
Now I'll stop there, and Craig and I will be happy to take your questions."

I think because everyone was a bit confused when you suggested that the quarter would end with the Publishing revenues down in the low to mid-single digits and on a reported basis, it's minus six, which looks like a myth.

I am extremely pleased to announce another quarter of improving results. Advertising demand firmed during the quarter, as we benefited from the strength of our local market franchises, both here and in the U.K.",1768,"Thanks, Gracia, and good morning, everyone. I am extremely pleased to announce another quarter of improving results. Advertising demand firmed during the quarter, as we benefited from the strength of our local market franchises, both here and in the U.K. In the second quarter, our revenue comparisons were better relative to the first quarter, with total revenue down only slightly. 
Broadcast and Digital revenues were particularly strong, while Publishing revenues were down in the mid-single digits. Expense declines, again, outpaced the revenue decline for the quarter. As a result, we increased our bottom line significantly with a 33% increase in both adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share.
As the economy improves and as demand strengthens, the efficiency efforts we put in place are continuing to contribute results in the quarter. We have also made great strides in transforming Gannett to a multimedia, multi-platform company. We are positioned for growth in both our core assets and our unique Digital businesses. We are committed to leveraging the strength of our local brands and extending our reach, particularly our digital reach in all of our markets.
In the second quarter, we announced several initiatives that will help achieve that goal, and today's announcement is also significant. Our local advertising partnership with Yahoo will further extend the digital reach for both our local publishing and several of our broadcast properties. The partnership combines our strong local brands and deep local connections with Yahoo's broad digital audience and audience-targeting capabilities. 
As a result of the partnership, we will increase our digital reach to as much as 80% of the total local digital audience. That will promote greater results for our advertising clients, as they will be able to reach larger audiences as well as deliver more relevant ads based on demography, geography, user interest and more.
Yahoo, as a reminder, does not have a local sales or marketing presence to work with local advertisers and businesses. From our operational perspective, our Corporate U.S., Community Publishing and Broadcast teams, in conjunction with Yahoo's dedicated partnership team, will work closely with each site's management and sales teams on a detailed training and deployment plan. All messaging, scheduling and delivery on Yahoo sites for programs sold by Gannett's local media organizations, sales teams to advertisers will be developed and fulfilled by Gannett. We expect that all of our local, domestic Publishing operations and several of our Broadcasting properties will be participating.
In addition to the partnership with Yahoo, we are enhancing the value of our local television brands through the development of community-focused websites in our television markets. Through these hyperlocal websites, we will be able to extend the services we offer to our viewers as well as our advertisers. The sites will be integrated within existing broadcasting websites and feature news content as well as user-generated content concerning local events. 
With this more local focus, advertisers will be better equipped to target local audiences. Not only is our reach an important component of our business model, but the demand for our content is critical to the strength of our local market franchises. We think our content has tremendous value, and we want to better understand consumer response to paying for that content.
We began testing on July 1, paid content models in three of our publishing markets. Those are: Greenville, South Carolina; Tallahassee, Florida and St. George, Utah. We hope to glean some insights from these tests that will help us formulate and develop our long-term strategy for paid content. As you are well aware, the number and diversity of our markets allow us to experiment without disrupting our business model for the company as a whole. We view that as a tremendous advantage, and we intend to leverage it as we gauge consumer and advertiser response. 
In the meantime, we are providing our content to consumers wherever, whenever and however they choose to receive it, whether it is on mobile, web, print, broadcast or through wireless devices such as the iPad. Consumer and advertiser response has been strong for our mobile applications on the iPhone, iPad, iTouch and Android platforms. Since we published the first USA TODAY iPhone application just about a year and a half ago, total consumer downloads of the USA TODAY iPhone, iTouch, iPad and Android news applications, plus travel applications, is just over 5 million. 
The USA TODAY app on the iPad remains the number one free news and information app and is an extremely popular free app, and advertiser interest is high with brands like Coca-Cola, Barnes & Noble, Capital One and Chrysler, all signing on as sponsors. As a result, the USA TODAY app on the iPad will remain an ad supported through at least the third quarter.
In our Publishing segment, while the advertising backdrop improved, we continued to focus on the transformation of our publishing sites on several fronts. Client-focused marketing solutions, centralization of production functions and content management among others.
To better serve our advertisers and deliver multi-platform solutions to them, we began to roll out regional client solutions groups during the quarter. These client solutions groups will help us address a much more complex selling environment. Consumer behavior is changing in the media landscape, and our publishing operations are now multimedia organizations to better reflect our full portfolio of products and consumer touch points, including digital and mobile capabilities. That presents new revenue opportunities for us as we help businesses understand, harness and benefit from our loyal and engaged audiences. The solutions group will act much like agencies for local advertisers and will develop sophisticated marketing solutions, managing and adjusting campaigns according to desired results.
Also during the quarter, we ramped up our centralized U.S. Community Publishing ad production centers and now have 23 sites directing ad production to the centers. Recently, in a single week, the centers delivered a record 12,000 ads to pagination and received almost 14,000 ad orders. With the centralization of this process, we are improving ad production and creating efficiency within the division. That will allow us to focus on core strengths such as locally driven, customer-based advertising solutions.
We are managing our content in much the same way, leveraging content where possible to free up those in the newsroom to focus on deep, local content coverage. For example, many of our publishing sites now include content developed by USA TODAY. More than half include a nation world page in their papers and over 60%, a baseball page, and the consumer feedback has been positive. A reader in Fort Myers told us, and I quote, ""Imagine my surprise and pleasure to open today's news press and see a page in the sports section from USA TODAY and another in the main section on national and international news. What a great way to enhance your paper."" Once again, we are creating efficiency as well as enhancing the product and extending the brand of USA TODAY. We are not stopping there. We are looking at additional ways to extend the partnership with USA TODAY.
So moving on to our results for the quarter. As we previously announced, we divested The Honolulu Advertiser and a small publishing operation during the quarter. So our results reflect both discontinued operations as well as gains on the sales. Additionally, we had significant net tax benefit in the quarter. Earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding special items, were $0.61, a 33% increase from the comparable amount in the second quarter of 2009. 
Operating revenue totaled $1.4 billion, and on a pro forma basis, was down only about 1%. The exchange rate for the British pound created a headwind for the quarter. So on a pro forma, constant currency basis, the operating revenue would have been about 1/2 of 1% lower or 0.4%. The revenue comparison improved versus the year's first quarter. The strength of our local franchises in our Broadcasting segment drove the 20% increase in total television revenues in the quarter. 
Top-tier ratings for our local news programming were the key to attracting substantially higher core advertising revenues in the quarter. That, combined with an extremely good footprint, led to about $12 million in political advertising, which we fully expect to ramp significantly in the third and fourth quarter this year.
Digital segment revenues increased 8% in the quarter, driven by revenue growth at CareerBuilder of approximately 4%, the first time we have seen revenue growth from CareerBuilder since the fourth quarter of 2008. 
PointRoll and ShopLocal both had double-digit revenue growth, which contributed to the increases as well. We continue to close the revenue gap in Publishing, as Publishing advertising revenues and pro forma total revenues were both down about 5%. Once again, the exchange rate had an impact on the revenue comparison. 
So on a pro forma basis, constant currency basis, total Publishing revenues declined about 4%, while Publishing advertising revenues were down almost 5%. In June, total advertising revenues were 3.6% lower on a constant currency basis. On that basis, it was not only the best comparison month of this year, it was the best comparison month since early 2007. 
Results on the Digital side improved significantly. With online revenue growth at U.S. Community Publishing increasing almost 14%, while at Newsquest, Digital revenues increased just over 9% in pounds.
Broadcasting digital revenues were over 23% higher due in part to a significant increase in Captivate's online results. Company-wide Digital revenues were almost 19% of total revenues and were up almost 10%. 
Total company-wide expenses, excluding special items, were almost 8% lower, reflecting the operating leverage that we have created in our business segments. They all achieved significantly higher profitability and operating cash flow in the quarter compared to the second quarter last year.  Operating cash flow was $327 million in the quarter, up over 30%. As a result, we reduced debt by $170 million. 
In summary, our focus remains on providing relevant, trusted content on any platform that the customer wants. At the same time, we are committed to expanding our reach and offering better solutions for advertisers as our partnership with Yahoo demonstrates. We are improving our position in markets, while at the same time strengthening our balance sheet and increasing our flexibility to invest in our businesses. We believe there are significant opportunities as the media landscape shifts, and we are positioned for growth as it does. 
But before I hand the call over to Gracia, I just want to thank all of our employees for all of their efforts during this quarter. It's very much appreciated. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gracia."

Let me go into results for our business segments in more detail and cover a few balance sheet items, then we'll open up the call for questions. As a reminder, all of our category comparisons have been included in the release this morning.",1539,"Thanks, Craig. Let me go into results for our business segments in more detail and cover a few balance sheet items, then we'll open up the call for questions. As a reminder, all of our category comparisons have been included in the release this morning.
Our results this quarter reflect a significant operating leverage that has been created in all of our business segments. The Broadcasting and Digital segments both had substantially higher revenues, and we further closed the revenue gap in Publishing. Expenses, as Craig said, were lower company wide, as we benefited from our ongoing cost control and efficiency efforts and were achieved even after comparing against $25 million of furlough savings in the second quarter of last year. The result, improving profitability in each of our business segments.
In Publishing, total revenue comparisons this quarter on a pro forma, constant currency basis were about 4% lower but were almost 3 percentage points better than the first quarter. On that same basis, total advertising revenue comparison, again, were about 4 percentage points better than the first quarter and were down about 5%. Classified and retail drove the better comparisons and were 6 percentage points and 4 percentage points better than the first quarter.
I should also remind you that we sold Honolulu and a small Directories business this quarter, and their results are in discontinued operations. As well, we sold a small Commercial Printing business in the U.K. last year. Those businesses had about $35 million to $40 million of revenue in the second quarter last year, whereas we are reporting no revenue in the quarter this year from those businesses, and revenue trends in both the U.S. and the U.K. improved in the second quarter compared to the first. 
In the U.S, advertising revenues were 5% lower versus last year, as retail, national and classified were all better relative to the first quarter. Reflecting advertising trends overall, classified improved the most, down just 3% and 6 percentage points better than the first quarter, then followed by retail and national. Within classified, employment and automotive comparisons showed the largest favorable change, an improvement of 17 percentage points for employment and 8 points for auto relative to the first quarter. Domestic classified advertising was just 2% lower in June versus last year. 
Newsquest advertising results trended the right way overall, although trends within categories were much different than in the U.S. It is worth noting that the sequential improvement within the quarter was significant, as June advertising revenues in pounds were just 2% lower compared to a double-digit decline in April. Classified advertising comparisons at Newsquest improved sequentially as well during the second quarter, down 7% in pounds but 6 percentage points better than the first quarter. 
Within classified, all of the categories improved sequentially, and the year-over-year comparisons in the second quarter were better relative to the first. In fact, real estate in the quarter increased 5%. Automotive and employment declined but were almost 4 and 9 percentage points better than the first quarter, respectively. Retail and National also improved sequentially. The general elections and the Easter switch did have an adverse impact on the second quarter ad demand in the U.K.
National advertising for the total Publishing segment was about 3% lower in the quarter adjusted for currency exchange rates. National advertising at U.S. Community Publishing increased about 23%, while softness in the travel and lodging industries continue to impact results at USA TODAY. In fact, declines in travel as well as the entertainment and telecom categories offset double-digit revenue gains in the automotive, retail and packaged goods areas.
As Craig noted, the expense decline companywide in the quarter outpaced the operating revenue decline. Expense comparisons this quarter were impacted by special items in the second quarter last year as noted in the press release. The bulk of these items impacted the Publishing segment. So Publishing segment expenses, including the special items from last year, were down about 10%. The biggest driver of the expense decline was our continued efforts to create efficiencies and consolidate operations. Substantially lower newsprint also contributed to the decline. Significantly lower prices and lower consumption resulted in a 31% reduction in pro forma newsprint expense. The expense reductions in Publishing were partially offset by the relative absence of approximately $20 million in furlough savings in last year's second quarter.
Drilling down a little bit on newsprint and turning to current newsprint market conditions, producers are benefiting from supply rationalizations and considerably stronger exports to Latin America and non-Japan Asia. Despite prices that have been rising since late 2009, second quarter pricing for Gannett remains favorable, with pro forma unit cost down about 24% year-over-year. Looking ahead, we expect newsprint expense savings for the third quarter. However, they will be at a lower level compared to what we realized in the first half of the year.
Operating expense reductions and moderating declines in Publishing revenue resulted in significantly better profitability in the Publishing segment. Operating income, excluding special items, was about $31 million higher or 21%, a significant increase given a decline of approximately $65 million in operating revenues, and operating cash flow was up considerably as well, about 23%. 
Profitability improved dramatically in our Broadcasting segment due primarily to substantial growth in revenues and small increases in expenses. Operating revenues were up over 20%, driven both by strength in core advertising and an increase in politically related ad spending of almost $10 million in the quarter. That's the increase.
Several categories had double-digit growth although the auto category was extremely strong in the quarter, about 70% up. Expenses, excluding special items in the Broadcasting segment, were up about 5%, reflecting primarily higher ad sales cost as anticipated given the revenue growth as well as the absence of about $3 million in furlough savings last year. The increases were offset in part by the impact of continuing efforts to create efficiencies in the segment. Operating income and operating cash flow were both up significantly in the quarter, 56% and 44%, respectively.
In light of current trends, we expect the percentage increase in television ad revenues for the third quarter at this point to be in the mid-20s, and if pushed today, more likely at the higher end of the mid-20s range. It is very early in the quarter, however, and projecting how the quarter will end is made more difficult by political. That's particularly difficult to predict given that we expect the majority of political to be placed toward the end of the quarter. However, given our terrific footprint and the enormous strength of our stations, we expect to fully benefit from whatever level of political spending occurs in our markets.
Turning to Digital. Our segment generated very good revenue growth as well as improving profitability. As Craig noted, the return to revenue growth for CareerBuilder after several quarters of lagging revenue drove the increase in Digital segment revenues. Significant revenue increases at PointRoll and ShopLocal in the mid-30s and the mid-teens, respectively, also contributed to the increase. 
Operating expenses in Digital increased just 2% in the quarter, and CareerBuilder's expenses were flat compared to the second quarter last year. As a result, Digital segment operating income was up over 49%, and operating cash flow was 30% higher. CareerBuilder, PointRoll and ShopLocal each had substantial double-digit gains in operating income and operating cash flow. 
Looking at our company-wide Digital revenues, which include our Digital segment as well as our other operations, revenues totaled over $252 million in the second quarter and over $483 million year-to-date. Digital revenues in both the Publishing and Broadcasting segments, as Craig noted, were significantly higher. In U.S. Community Publishing, several major categories such as automotive, employment, national and retail were all up in the quarter, and our other divisions saw strong increases as well.
Now let me turn to the balance sheet quickly. We reduced our debt by over $170 million in the quarter, driven by that significant operating cash flow we both just talked about. Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $2.6 billion, and cash and marketable securities totaled $157 million. At this point, our all-in cost of debt is 5.5%. Finally, capital expenditures were about $11 million in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $20 million.
So in summary, we are seeing encouraging revenue trends in all of our segments, particularly in the Broadcast and Digital components. The operating leverage we created continues to take hold in our businesses, and we will benefit greatly from the initiatives we have put in place this quarter and in prior quarters and from firming advertising demand with some help from the economy. 
We are certainly, as we all know, seeing mixed signals on the economy, and as we have been saying over the last several months, the economy remains somewhat fragile. We'll keep our eyes on that, but we'll always maintain our financial discipline as we move to the later half of the year.

I think because everyone was a bit confused when you suggested that the quarter would end with the Publishing revenues down in the low to mid-single digits and on a reported basis, it's minus six, which looks like a myth.

But obviously, that's something we're going to keep a close watch on as economic news unfolds."

We closed the revenue gap in the third quarter despite in mixed in rather unsteady economic environment. Broadcast and Digital revenues were particularly strong and Publishing revenues continue this sequential improvement.
The impact of our cost control and efficiency efforts was reflected in expense declines. As a result, operating income and earnings per share were both significantly higher compared to the third quarter last year. In fact, we again improved the profitability of each of our business segments, excluding special items when compared to third quarter last year.
Another significant news subsequent to the close of the quarter, we completed $500 million bond financing and two, $250 million tranches, due in 2015 and 2018. The net result is an even better structure of our debt maturities. We now have a modest amount of maturities due every year through 2018, excluding 2013, in which we have no maturities.
All of our maturing debt commitments can be easily managed with our free cash flow and credit availability. We also amended and extended our revolving credit facilities.
Total commitments under the amended revolving credit agreements are now $1.63 billion through March 15, 2012, and a total extended commitments from March 15, 2012, to September 2014, totaling $1.14 billion.
Gracia will cover the transactions in a little more detail later. The completion of these two transactions is a significant achievement for the company. We have further strengthened our financial condition and ensured our financial flexibility well into the future, as we positioned Gannett for potential growth opportunities.
We continue to progress on a number of strategic initiatives focusing on our ability to deliver our content on any platform, connect that content with consumers and hone our ability to sell across those platforms. We firmly believe that providing engaging content and the ability to deliver it in any way the consumer wishes are keys to our success.
Our content has great value and for the past three months, we have been testing paid content models at three of our domestic publishing sites, Greenville, South Carolina, St. George, Utah and Tallahassee, Florida. We have taken different approaches in each of the test to help access different aspects of the paid content business model and consumer dynamics.
In Tallahassee and St. George, we are testing content pricing model changes and Greenville, the home of Clemson University we’re testing a premium site that is available through a separate subscription only, TigersNow.com, which focuses on exclusive coverage of Clemson sports. We now have a couple of months of data as a result of these tests and while it is still early, we are seeing some very interesting results and important takeaways.
Here’s what we’re learning. Our subscribers are much more heavily engaged with our content than non-subscribers. Web users who are subscribers are consuming four and five times as many pages per visit as non-subscribers, and in the case of TigersNow.com, users are consuming a remarkable level of content, more than 40 pages per visit and as high as 70 compared to six to eight pages per visit, our sites typically experienced, and our full content subscription model is driving increased usage of our e-Editions.
In Tallahassee and Greenville, the e-Editions in both markets now have more than 1300 unique users daily. A comprehensive content promotion strategy that spans social media, email and other platforms is driving consumer awareness, and we are seeing month-over-month gains in page views at two of the three sites.
We also continue to enhance promotion of the changes to the subscription model to drive added online activation by full content subscribers. The result has been significantly higher online engagement around news events.
For example, publisher e-mails to our customers regarding item specific, the Clemson football drove significant spikes in page views. Similarly, content targeting high interest topics like public safety, education and outdoors in St. George market has generated strong positive response from our readers.
We are finding that Gannett’s well known local public personalities further help us connect with our customers and drive consumer engagement. For example, pages personalized from a popular columnist in Tallahassee have the greatest success in terms of driving online activations on tallahassee.com.
A slightly different approach, direct interaction with Editor, Bob Gabordi through a variety of media, print columns, Facebook, Twitter, a blog on tallahassee.com show customers are willing to come down a new path with us, if they feel a connection.
In fact, Bob summarized the current effort very well in his blog, and I quote, ‘It is too early to declare victory, and no doubt, there will be much tweaking before we settle on the right approach. But this much is clear.
Through it all, over the last three months, tallahassee.com has remained the region’s leading news Web site according to independent reports on total reach and traffic.
What more? Our customers tend to be more local, better serving the needs of our loyal advertisers. This is a powerful and gratifying message. Our readers have told us they are willing to pay for the quality of our local reporting rather than just accept what the others offer for free, and their advertisers get the benefit of an engaged local audience.’
Honing our abilities to sell across platforms to engage the audiences, Bob notes developing solutions for local advertisers is crucial to our success and growth. As we announced in July, we now have the ability to offer Yahoo! as another alternative for our local advertisers.
The rollout of Yahoo! has moved quite quickly. We have rolled out sales alliances in five publishing sites and three broadcasting sites and the results are very promising.
At the end of the third quarter, the pilot markets collectively were ahead of their sales goals to-date. 20 additional publishing sites were launched by mid-November and two additional broadcasting sites were launched by the end of November.
In addition, our broadcasting sites are further strengthening their commitment to hyper-local content through the launch of community level Web sites. These sites deliver content that is very relevant to local consumers and provide local advertisers the ability to connect with consumers in that community.
To-date, we have launched in four markets with a total of 140 neighborhood sites. Sales results have been ahead of expectations, and we expect to launch four more markets this month.
Our U.S. Community Publishing Group continues to make progress under development of our Client Solutions Groups. These groups are developing comprehensive advertising solutions for our customers. Our team in the West market is fully staffed and their early results have been positive.
One recent success included the development of a highly creative and successful campaign for a major grocer in the Midwest, featuring a social media driven contest promotion targeted toward young moms and a multimedia campaign including television, newspaper and digital media across the state and to select zip codes in adjacent states.
USA TODAY undertook a major realignment with the creation of new teams that will focus on design and product development, digital asset management and integrated business development, and they will be fundamentally reshaping the news, content and editing groups as they continue their evolution as a multi-platform media company.
The popularity of its iPad app continues to grow with a total of more than 1 million downloads. That app was recently recognized with the MOBI Award for best mobile app for editorial content.
We are learning more about our customers every day, particularly those accessing contents through newer platforms like the iPhone and the iPad and Android, as well as our dot-com and other mobile audiences.
This restructuring at USA TODAY creates the infrastructure to design products, procure new business opportunities, and develop the systems to support the new platforms. At USA TODAY and across the company, we continue to align our content with different audiences that access various platforms, print, digital, broadcast and mobile, and of course, we connect those audiences with our advertisers.
I want to emphasis that we are moving away from our legacy media platforms or our commitment to First Amendment and Watchdog Journalism. This is important, because as the level of content on the internet continues to grow the value of providing reliable trustworthy and relevant content becomes ever more critical.
Moving on to our results, Gracia will discuss in more detail. Third quarter earnings per share, excluding special items increased by about 21% to $0.52, compared to $0.43 in third quarter of last year. As I mentioned, total operating revenues were unchanged, although they would have been up almost 1%, when adjusted for currency.
Broadcasting revenues were significantly higher this quarter, compared to last year increasing about 22%. Ad revenues in television were up about 26% in the quarter. The increase was driven both by stronger core revenues with double-digit growth in several key categories as well as the expected step-up in political spending.
In fact, year-to-date political spending has kept pace with ad spending in 2008 presidential election year and is ahead of spending in the last non-presidential election year of 2006.
Digital segment revenues also increased in the quarter, about 10%, as CareerBuilder revenue was stronger and PointRoll had double-digit revenue growth.
Publishing segment revenues were down in the mid single-digits, but better relative to second quarter. There were some bright spots in publishing revenues as national advertising was up about 2%. Classified, auto, and employment advertising in the U.S. were also up substantially year-over-year.
Our focus on online advertising is reflected in higher digital advertising at both U.S. Community Publishing and USA TODAY. In fact, online revenue company-wide totaled about $256 million and increased almost 10%.
It now represents over 19% of total revenues. Expenses were kept in check in the quarter and were down about 3%, excluding special items, as a result of the revenue gains and lower expenses, we improved the profitability of all our business segments on the same basis. We again reduced our debt in the quarter by approximately $210 million.
In summary, we are moving forward on several initiatives that enhance our position as a leading multimedia enterprise. We are cementing our values as local media franchises through efforts like Yahoo! and Client Solutions Group and at the same time we continue to assess ways to enhance the value of our content and how it is delivered.
We are building on the successes we have achieved to-date, and with a strong balance sheet, we are in a great position to propel growth into the future.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Gracia.

I’ll cover in a little more detail our business segments for the quarter, as well as, some balance sheet items, and then we’ll open it for questions. As a reminder, all of our category comparisons have been included in the release this morning. This quarter’s results reflect substantial revenue growth in our Broadcasting and Digital segments.
Publishing revenues, although down in the mid single digits improved sequentially from second quarter comparison, as a result, we closed the revenue gap for the quarter on an as reported basis as operating revenues overall were unchanged, but on a constant currency basis, revenues were actually up 1%.
Expenses were lower company-wide, which helped to improve the profitability for each of our segments, once we adjust for special items. We have summarized the special items in our release this morning, but in short, they were associated primary with facility consolidations, asset impairments, as well as workforce restructuring.
We reported EPS on a GAAP basis of $0.42 for the quarter compared to $0.31 last year. Adjusting for those special items in both years EPS was actually $0.52 this quarter versus $0.43 last year, an increase of over 20% as detailed on our non-GAAP schedules.
Also in our release this morning, we’ve provided reconciliations for our non-GAAP schedules to our GAAP schedules. As a reminder, we completed the sale of the Honolulu Advertiser and its related assets and a small directory publishing business, in the second quarter of this year. Results for these properties have been reclassified to discontinued operations.
Revenues associated with those properties totaled over $24 million in the third quarter last year. To help you with your thinking about the fourth quarter, revenue from these properties totaled approximately $30 million in last year’s fourth quarter.
Turning to our business segments. In Publishing, total revenues were about 5% lower. They were down about 4% on a constant currency basis and the comparison was better than the comparison in the second quarter this year.
On the same constant currency basis, total advertising revenue comparisons were better relative to the second quarter as all categories, retail, national and classified contributed to the improvement in the comparisons. National was particularly strong swinging to a positive and about five percentage points better than the second quarter comparison.
On a three-year comparison basis, which I know some of you focused on, we saw about four percentage point sequential improvement in total advertising. All category comparisons were better, particularly classified which improved almost eight percentage points from the quarter-to-quarter two-year comparison.
Domestic advertising revenue trends were better relative to the second quarter and were down just over 3%. National advertising was up over 3% and was well over five percentage points better relative to the second quarter. Retail and classified comparisons in U.S. both improved relative to the second quarter, although to a lesser extent than national.
Classified in the U.S. was just 2% lower in the quarter. The declines were lower in the quarter led by sequential comparison improvement on both our year-over-year and two year basis.
In the U.K. at Newsquest, a more challenging economic environment and uncertainty around the spending cuts agenda of the new government had an impact on results there, particularly in the retail and classified categories.
Looking again at the total Publishing segment, classified advertising adjusted for currency was about 4% lower in the quarter and better relative to the second quarter, driven primarily by an increase of almost 7% in classified auto.
In the U.S. auto and employment, were both stronger in the quarter compared to the third quarter last year, up 10% and 9% respectively. Both categories increased more than 10% in September compared to September last year.
Results in the employment category improved sequentially, building on the positive growth we achieved in the second quarter. At Newsquest real estate advertising continued to be positive as it has been since the end of the first quarter. Automotive and employment, however, at Newsquest lagged last year.
National advertising in our Publishing segment was a bright spot overall and particularly in the U.S. Domestically national advertising increased about 3% driven by solid growth at U.S. Community Publishing.
Advertising at USATODAY.com also contributed to the increase with online national advertising for them, up over 60% in the quarter. Print advertising at USA Today posted its most favorable year-over-year comparison this year in the third quarter, but continues to be impacted by relative weakness in the travel and lodging markets.
Several important categories, particularly automotive were stronger, in fact much stronger, compared to the third quarter last year, but some other categories including restaurants, pharmaceutical, and packaged goods lagged last year.
We are encouraged by the level of online advertising in the quarter in our Publishing segment. U.S. Community Publishing, online advertising was up over 10% as all categories virtually were up significantly in the quarter and online advertising at Newsquest increased more than 8% in pounds.
Turning to reported operating expenses, company-wide they were down a bit under 4% for the quarter. Special items impacted third quarter results both this year and last year with them totaling $31.1 million pre-tax this quarter and $41.5 million last year in the same quarter. Special items impacted all of our business segments this year and just Publishing and Broadcasting last year.
Operating expenses in total excluding special items were about 3% lower in the quarter. Publishing segment expenses excluding special items were approximately 6% lower and reflect the impact of our cost controls and efficiency efforts, as well as lower newsprint. Newsprint consumption and usage prices both declined in the mid-single digits, which resulted in newsprint expense that was about 12% lower.
Drawing down a little on the current newsprint situation, increased shipments overseas have acted to balance domestic supply and demand. The strength of these export markets has been a key factor in producer price recovery, but those markets are beginning to show some signs of retreat as offshore customer inventories grow.
Here in North America, a pattern of regional fragmentation persists, with a continuing east-west price divide, in fact, an announced increase for October failed to garner support, confirming that market conditions remained inconsistent across the U.S.
The outlook for the fourth quarter includes two key producers emerging from bankruptcy a moderate approach to recovery efforts by these producers would support a stable environment for both industries.
Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter newsprint usage prices will be higher than a year ago, but consumption is expected to be lower once again. Expense reductions again outpaced the revenue declines in Publishing. As a result, operating income excluding special items was about 4% better in the third quarter this year versus the third quarter last year.
Operating cash flow on the same basis totaled about $173 million for the quarter. So, despite a decline in revenue of about $48 million, the profit margin and cash flow margin both improved. Profitability by just about all measures was stronger in our broadcasting segment as substantial revenue gains were achieved.
Operating revenue growth was very strong, up over 22% as our television stations benefited from our best-in-class ratings and an extremely good political footprint. Strengths in our core television business continued as several key categories including auto, a significant contributor to revenue growth, as well as telecom, media and banking and finance, all had solid double digit growth in the quarter.
As expected, politically related ad demand also ramped in the quarter and totaled $21.3 million. Growth in core advertising of about $16.7 million was almost matched by a $16.3 million increase in political spending. We’re particularly pleased to see that strength in core as well as in political.
The profitability of our Broadcasting segment improved with a significant revenue growth. Excluding special items, operating income and operating cash flow increased 49% and 42% respectively.
Similarly, the profit margin for the third quarter was approximately 41%, an increase of over 700 basis points. The cash flow margin was over 600 basis points higher from the third quarter last year, equaling almost 45%.
At this point, we expect the percentage increase in television advertising revenues to be in the mid-to-high 20s for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter last year. Again, that’s TV ad revenues, not total revenues.
As has been the case in the past, the buildup to the elections will be fanatic and the political spending as a result can be quite volatile. We fully expect to gain from our footprints and the value of our local TV franchises as we close in on Election Day.
Turning to Digital, excluding special items, revenue and profitability were higher again in this segment this quarter. CareerBuilder’s revenue growth was up in the very high single-digits, improving on the revenue growth in the second quarter. PointRoll also generated double-digit revenue growth in the quarter.
Operating cash flow excluding special items totaled over $36 million, up about 8%. Operating income on the same basis was over 16% higher, reaching almost $29 million.
Before I turn to the balance sheet, with respect to our tax rate, our effective tax rate was 33.5% for the quarter versus 34% last year. The better tax rate added about $900,000 or so to net earnings.
On the equity income line, results were about $2 million better than last year. However on the non-operating income line, those results were about $1 million less. So, if you put all of those factors together, they had a favorable impact on our EPS of less than one penny for the quarter.
Turning to the balance sheet, in addition to another meaningful reduction in our overall debt level, after the quarter close, we successfully completed a bond financing and a bank facility extension, as Craig mentioned and as we foreshadowed last quarter.
Let me highlight some of the more important points of each transaction. The bond financing was a $500 million private placement into $250 million tranches, maturing in 2015 and 2018. The coupons were 6.375% for the notes due in 2015 and 7.125% for the notes due in 2018.
These are among the very lowest yields for any issuer with comparable ratings this year, and clearly illustrate that the fixed income investing community recognized the significant progress that Gannett has made, and how well positioned we are for the future.
We also extended our revolving credit facilities. That extension was accomplished with very minimal impact on the cost of the facilities, and we are pleased with the confidence again shown in us by our strong bank group.
Together, the transactions further strengthen our balance sheet, improve the structure of our debt maturities, and provide us with significant financial capacity to invest in opportunities that will drive our future growth.
Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $2.4 billion as we reduced debt $2.10 million in the quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter totaled $172 million. At this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 6.5%, including the impact of our new long-term financings. Our debt-to-EBITDA covenant was 1.93 times.
Finally, capital expenditures were about $17 million in the quarter bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $37 million. We now expect CapEx to be between $65 million and $75 million for the full year.
So, in summary, we closed the revenue gap. We improved our profitability overall and we achieved continued sequential improvement, despite a mixed economy and increased uncertainty around the economy beginning in the summer months.
There were several bright spots in terms of revenue in the quarter, not the least of which was continued growth in our digital revenues and our strong performance, particularly in the core and our television business. We progressed on several strategic fronts, as Craig noted and look forward to putting what we are learning about the consumer to work in many arenas.
The strength of our balance sheet as well as a greater understanding of the consumer, the advertiser and their interaction in the emerging media landscape, have positioned Gannett as well as possible as we look to the future.
Now, I’ll stop there, and Craig and I will be delighted to take your questions.

With regard to the fourth quarter, frankly we’re only a couple of weeks into the quarter.

So, it’s a little difficult to be sitting here on October 15, looking out particularly with the strength that we closed the year last year and that continued into the first quarter. But I’d say overall that on a the Newsquest side, I think they are seeing a little bit better advertising numbers, again very early couple of weeks of the quarter.
As you can see on the Broadcasting side, we’re anticipating that ad revenues on television are going to be up in the mid to high 20s, which is certainly even stronger than what we achieved in the third quarter. And then on the Digital side, what we are hearing from PointRoll and our other businesses, is that after a little bit of low-end activity in the summer months, that they are seeing a good pickup in the backlog, and so they are anticipating good strength continuing into the fourth quarter.
On the U.S. Community Publishing side, it’s really too early to say. I think it depends on category by category, and we’re just going to have to see how that plays out as we get closer to the holiday season.

As we all know based on I guess Mr. Bernanke’s testimony this morning as well as various mixed indicators we’re seeing on the economy, certainly through the summer months and leading into now the economy has not performed as well as I think many prognosticators were hoping that it would.
So we’ll have to see how the numbers play out, but obviously to the extent that we can get additional help from the economy, we would be well on the way to recording positive numbers. But I would say that as you can see, in total for the company on a constant currency basis, revenues were up 1%.

In addition to, as you know the very, very strong numbers that we are coming in politically, I made the comment that our core is extraordinarily strong in several of the key categories. Let me be very specific there. Auto has been really, really doing well for us. We have done well in the telecommunications area as well we have done well in media and banking and finance.
I can only say that it is very, very early here for Q4, but to have that kind of core strength at this time really bodes well for what Dave Lougee and his team are doing. The reason to say this is because we all know that when that election ends, those dollars are gone and it is very, very reassuring to have strong core strength behind that. So, I just wanted really to emphasize this because this will be a big key factor for us in Q4.

I think the good news that we’ve been talking about is the fact that in U.S. Community Publishing we have placed considerable focus on Sunday home delivery circulation, because that is obviously a very important part of our circulation days for advertisers, and as we all know, Sunday is an extremely important advertising day.
We are very pleased to see that the investment that we made in the last half of last year and continuing through this year has borne fruit for us. I think when the numbers come out for the six months ended September 30, that you will see that 21 of our top 31 markets had growth in home delivery Sunday volume above last year. You will also see that 11 of our smaller sites will show year-over-year home delivery Sunday gains. When I look at one Sunday, if you just extract out our U.S. Community Publishing, not including Detroit, in fact Sunday circulation is down just a little over 2%. So, we’re extremely pleased with the progress that we are making in that very, very key area.

Newsquest makes a lot of money. In fact, their margin as I have said a couple of times is consistent with the margin that our local U.S. Community Publishing operations generate. So, their margins are in the high-teens to low 20s. They have consistently made money throughout the years, even in a year like last year, when revenues were under as much pressure as they were.
As I said earlier, clearly the progress that Newsquest stalled the bid in the third quarter, if you follow any of the economic and political backdrop in the U.K., you would know or you’d note that it’s more difficult in the U.K. I believe than here in the States, as they have had a lot of conversations and the current government leadership there has indicated that on October 20, they are going to be announcing final significant spending cuts across the country. As a result of that, public spending has virtually come to a halt in that country and consumer confidence has weekend as a result of that.
So I think there is some macro political and economic issues that Newsquest is contending with. But I would say that U.K. seems to be addressing its problems early and dramatically. So, I hope that that will bode well for them coming out of the economic malaise that all of us are seeing, more quickly than perhaps other countries in Europe or even the U.S.

Let me, Doug, comment with your question with regard to core, as you know right now, with Q4 it’s awfully early. Dave Lougee is very, very confident at this point on a couple of the key categories that we have and we are feeling good about that. To say at this point that that’s going to continue, I don’t know to that degree at this time, but I don’t see anything at this time that’s going to change what we’re seeing. We can only hope that as Gracia commented earlier, we must have the improvement from the economy. We’ve had questions on it, but that’s really as far as I can comment there, Doug.

We closed the revenue GAAP in the third quarter, despite a mix in rather unsteady economic environment. 
  
  Broadcast and Digital revenues were particularly strong, and Publishing revenues continued the sequential improvement. The impact of our cost control and efficiency efforts was reflected in expense declines. As a result, operating income and earnings per share were both significantly higher compared to the third quarter last year. In fact, we again improved the profitability of each of our business segments, excluding special items when compared to third quarter last year.
  
  Another significant note, subsequent to the close of the quarter, we completed $500 million bond financing and two $250 million tranches due in 2015 and 2018. The net result is an even better structure for our debt maturities. We now have a modest amount of maturities due every year through 2018, excluding 2013, in which we have no maturities. All of our maturing debt commitments can be easily managed with our free cash flow and credit availability. We also amended and extended our revolving credit facilities. Total commitments under the amended revolving credit agreements are now $1.63 billion through March 15, 2012 and a total extended commitment from March 15, 2012, to September 30, 2014, totaling $1.14 billion. Gracia will cover the transactions in a little more detail later.
  
  The completion of these two transactions is a significant achievement for the company. We have further strengthened our financial condition and ensured our financial flexibility well into the future as we positioned Gannett for potential growth opportunities. We continue to progress on a number of strategic initiatives, focusing on our ability to deliver our content on any platform, Gannett, that content with consumers and hone our ability to sell across those platforms. We firmly believe that providing engaging content and the ability to deliver it in any way the consumer wishes are key to our success.
  
  Our content has great value and for the past three months, we have been testing paid content models at three of our domestic publishing sites, Greenville, South Carolina, St. George, Utah and Tallahassee, Florida. We have taken slightly different approaches in each of the tests to help assess different aspects of the paid content business model and consumer dynamics. In Tallahassee and St. George, we are testing content pricing model changes. In Greenville, the home of Clemson University, we are testing a premium site that is available through a separate subscription only. TigersNow.com is focused on exclusive coverage of Clemson sports.
  
  We now have a couple of months of data as a result of these tests and while it is still early, we are seeing some very interesting results and important takeaways. Here's what we're learning: Our subscribers are much more heavily engaged with our content than nonsubscribers; web users, who are subscribers, are consuming four and five times as many pages per visit as nonsubscribers; and in the case of TigersNow.com, users are consuming a remarkable level of content, more than 40 pages per visit and as high as 70, compared to six to eight pages per visit our sites typically experience; and our full content subscription model is driving increased usage of our e-Editions. In Tallahassee and Greenville, the e-Editions in both markets now have more than 13,000 unique users daily; a comprehensive content promotion strategy that span social media, email and other platforms, is driving consumer awareness, and we are seeing month-over-month gains in page views at two of the three sites. 
  
  We also continue to enhance promotion of the changes to the subscription model to drive added online activations by full content subscribers. The result has been significantly higher online engagement around news events.
  
  For example, publisher e-mails to our customers regarding item-\ specific to Clemson football drove significant spikes in page views. Similarly, content targeting high-interest topics like public safety, education and outdoors in St. George market has generated strong positive response from our readers. We are finding that Gannett's well-known local public personalities further help us connect with our customers and drive consumer engagement. 
  
  For example, pieces personalized from a popular columnist in Tallahassee had the greatest success in terms of driving online activations on tallahassee.com. And a slightly different approach, direct interaction with editor Bob Gabordi through a variety of media, print columns, Facebook, Twitter, a blog on tallahassee.com, show customers are willing to come down a new path with us if they feel a connection. 
  
  In fact, Bob summarized the current efforts very well in his blog. And I quote, ""It is too early to declare victory and no doubt, there will be much tweaking before we settle on the right approach. But this much is clear. Through it all, over the last three months, tallahassee.com has remained the region's leading news website, according to independent reports on total reach and traffic. What's more, our customers tend to be more local, better serving the needs of our loyal advertisers. This is a powerful and gratifying message. Our readers have told us, they are willing to pay for the quality of our local reporting rather than just accept what the others offer for free, and their advertisers get the benefit of an engaged local audience.""
  
  Honing our abilities to sell across platforms to engage audiences, Bob notes, developing solutions for local advertisers is crucial to our success and growth. As we announced in July, we now have the ability to offer Yahoo! as another alternative for our local advertisers. The rollout of Yahoo! has moved quite quickly. We have rolled out sales alliances in five publishing sites and three broadcasting sites. And the results are very promising.
  
  At the end of the third quarter, the pilot markets collectively were ahead of their sales goals to date. 20 additional publishing sites will launch by mid-November, and two additional broadcasting sites will launch by the end of November. In addition, our broadcasting sites are further strengthening their commitment to hyper-local content through the launch of community level websites. These sites deliver content that is very relevant to local consumers and provide local advertisers the ability to connect with consumers in that community. To date, we have launched in four markets with a total of 140 neighborhood sites. Sales results have been ahead of expectations and we expect to launch four more markets this month. 
  
  Our U.S. Community Publishing group continues to make progress on the development of our client solutions groups. These groups are developing comprehensive advertising solutions for our customers. Our team in the West market is fully staffed, and their early results have been positive. One recent success included the development of a highly creative and successful campaign for a major grocer in the Midwest featuring a social media-driven contest promotion targeted toward young moms and a multimedia campaign, including television, newspaper and digital media across the state and into select ZIP codes in adjacent states.
  
  USA TODAY, undertook a major realignment with the creation of new teams that will focus on design and product development, digital asset management and integrated business development, and they will be fundamentally reshaping the news, content and editing groups as they continue their evolution as a multi-platform media company. 
  
  The popularity of its iPad app continues to grow, with a total of more than 1 million downloads. That app was recently recognized with the MOBI award for Best Mobile App for Editorial Content. We are learning more about our customers every day, particularly, those accessing contents through newer platforms like the iPhone and the iPad and Android, as well as our dot-com and other mobile audiences. These restructuring at USA TODAY creates the infrastructure, the design products, to cure new business opportunities and develop the systems to support the new platforms.
  
  At USA TODAY, and across the company, we continue to align our content with the different audiences that access various platforms: print, digital, broadcast and mobile. And of course, we connect those audiences with our advertisers. I want to emphasize that we are not moving away from our legacy media platforms or our commitment to First Amendment and watchdog journalism. This is important because as the level of content on the Internet continues to grow, the value of providing reliable, trustworthy and relevant content becomes ever more critical.
  
  Moving on to our results. Gracia will discuss in more detail. Third quarter earnings per share, excluding special items increased by about 21% to $0.52 compared to $0.43 in third quarter of last year. As I mentioned, total operating revenues were unchanged, although they would have been up almost 1% when adjusted for currency. Broadcasting revenues were significantly higher this quarter compared to last year increasing about 22%. Ad revenues in television were up about 26% in the quarter. The increase was driven both by stronger core revenues, with double-digit growth in several key categories, as well as the expected step-up in political spending. In fact, year-to-date, political spending has kept pace with ad spending in 2008's presidential election year and is ahead of spending in the last non-presidential election year of 2006.
  
  Digital segment revenues also increased in the quarter, about 10%, as CareerBuilder revenue was stronger and PointRoll had double-digit revenue growth. Publishing segment revenues were down in the mid-single digits, but better relative to second quarter. There were some bright spots in Publishing revenues as National Advertising was up about 2%. Classified Auto and Employment Advertising in the U.S. were also substantially year-over-year.
  
  Our focus on online advertising is reflected in higher digital advertising at both U.S. Community Publishing and USA TODAY. In fact, Online revenue, company-wide totaled about $256 million and increased almost 10%. It now represents over 19% of total revenues. Expenses were kept in check in the quarter and were down about 3%, excluding special items. As a result of the revenue gains and lower expenses, we improved the profitability of all our business segments on the same basis. And we again reduced our debt in the quarter by approximately $210 million.
  
  In summary, we are moving forward on several initiatives that enhance our position as a leading multimedia enterprise. We are cementing our values as local media franchises through efforts like Yahoo! and client solutions groups and at the same time, we continue to assess ways to enhance the value of our content and how it is delivered. We are building on the successes we have achieved to date and with a strong balance sheet, we are in a great position to propel growth into the future. 
  
  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gracia."

I'll cover in a little more detail our business segments for the quarter, as well as some balance sheet items, and then we'll open it up for questions. As a reminder, all of our category comparisons have been included in the release this mo",2039,"Thanks, Craig. I'll cover in a little more detail our business segments for the quarter, as well as some balance sheet items, and then we'll open it up for questions. As a reminder, all of our category comparisons have been included in the release this morning. 
  
  This quarter's results reflect substantial revenue growth in our Broadcasting and Digital segments. Publishing revenues, although down in the mid-single digits, improved sequentially from second quarter comparisons. As a result, we closed the revenue GAAP for the quarter on an as-reported basis as operating revenues overall were unchanged. But on a constant currency basis, revenues were actually up 1%.
  
  Expenses were lower company-wide, which helped to improve the profitability for each of our segments once we adjust for special items. We have summarized special items in our release this morning, but in short, they are associated primarily with facility consolidations, asset impairments as well as workforce restructuring. We reported EPS on a GAAP basis of $0.42 for the quarter, compared to $0.31 last year. Adjusting for those special items in both years, EPS was actually $0.52 this quarter versus $0.43 last year, an increase of over 20% as detailed on our non-GAAP schedules.
  
  Also in our release this morning, we provided reconciliations for our non-GAAP schedules to our GAAP schedules. As a reminder, we completed the sale of The Honolulu Advertiser and its related assets, and a small Directory Publishing business in the second quarter of this year. Results for these properties have been reclassified to discontinued operations. Revenues associated with those properties totaled over $24 million in the third quarter last year. To help you with your thinking about the fourth quarter, revenue from these properties totaled approximately $30 million in last year's fourth quarter.
  
  Turning to our business segments, in Publishing, total revenues were about 5% lower. They were down about 4% on a constant-currency basis and the comparison was better than the comparison in the second quarter this year. On the same constant-currency basis, total Advertising revenue comparisons were better relative to the second quarter as all categories, Retail, National and Classified, contributed to the improvement in the comparisons. National was particularly strong, swinging to a positive and out about five percentage points better than the second quarter comparison.
  
  On a two-year comparison basis, which I know some of you focus on, we saw about a four percentage point sequential improvement in total Advertising. All category comparisons were better, particularly Classified, which improved almost eight percentage points from the quarter-to-quarter two-year comparison. Domestic Advertising revenue trends were better relative to the second quarter and were down just over 3%. National Advertising was up over 3% and was well over five percentage points better relative to the second quarter. Retail and Classified comparisons in the U.S. both improved relative to the second quarter, although to a lesser extent than National. Classified in the U.S. was just 2% lower in the quarter. The declines were lower in the quarter led by sequential comparison improvement on both a year-over-year and two-year basis.
  
  In the U.K., at Newsquest, a more challenging economic environment and uncertainty around the spending cuts agenda of the new government had an impact on results there, particularly in the Retail and Classified categories. Looking again at the total Publishing segment, Classified Advertising adjusted for currency, was about 4% lower in the quarter and they're better relative to the second quarter, driven primarily by an increase of almost 7% in Classified Auto. In the U.S. Auto and Employment were both stronger in the quarter compared to the third quarter last year, up 10% and 9%, respectively. Both categories increased more than 10% in September compared to September last year.
  
  Results in the Employment category improved sequentially, building on the positive growth we achieved in the second quarter. At Newsquest, Real Estate Advertising continue to be positive as it has been since the end of the first quarter. Automotive and Employment, however, at Newsquest lagged last year. National Advertising and our Publishing segment was a bright spot, overall, and particularly in the U.S. Domestically, National Advertising increased about 3%, driven by solid growth at U.S. Community Publishing. Advertising at USA TODAY.com also contributed to the increased with online National Advertising for them, up over 60% in the quarter.
  
  Print Advertising at USA TODAY posted its most favorable year-over-year comparison this year in the third quarter, but continues to be impacted by relative weakness in the travel and lodging markets. Several important categories, particularly Automotive, was stronger, in fact much stronger, compared to the third quarter last year but some other categories, including Restaurants, Pharmaceutical and Packaged Goods lagged last year.
  
  We are encouraged by the level of Online Advertising in the quarter and our Publishing segment. U.S. Community Publishing, Online Advertising was up over 10%, as all categories virtually were up significantly in the quarter. And Online Advertising at Newsquest increased more than 8% in pounds.
  
  Turning to reported operating expenses. Company-wide, they were down a bit under 4% for the quarter. Special items impacted third quarter results both this year and last year, with them totaling $31.1 million pretax this quarter and $41.5 million last year in the same quarter. Special items impacted all of our business segments this year and just Publishing and Broadcasting last year. Operating expenses in total, excluding special items, were about 3% lower in the quarter.
  
  Publishing segment expenses, excluding special items were approximately 6% lower and reflect the impact of our cost controls and efficiency efforts, as well as lower newsprint. Newsprint consumption and usage prices both declined in the mid-single digits, which resulted in Newsprint expense that was about 12% lower. 
  
  Drilling down a little on the current newsprint situation. Increased shipments overseas have acted to balance domestic supply and demand. The strength of these export markets has been a key factor in producer price recovery. But those markets are beginning to show some signs of retreat as offshore customer inventories grow. Here in North America, a pattern of regional fragmentation persists for the continuing East-West price divide. In fact, an announced increase for October failed to garner support confirming that market conditions remain inconsistent across the U.S.
  
  The outlook for the fourth quarter includes two key producers emerging from bankruptcy. A moderate approach to recovery efforts by these producers would support a stable environment for both industries. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter usage prices will be higher than a year ago, but consumption is expected to be lower once again.
  
  Expense reductions again outpaced the revenue decline in Publishing. As a result, operating income, excluding special items, was about 4% better in the third quarter this year versus the third quarter last year. Operating cash flow on the same basis totaled about $173 million for the quarter. So despite a decline in revenue of about $48 million, the profit margin and cash flow margin both improved.
  
  Profitability by just about all measures was stronger in our Broadcasting segment, as substantial revenue gains were achieved. Operating revenue growth was very strong, up over 22% as our television stations benefited from our best-in-class ratings and an extremely good political footprint. Strength in our core Television business continued, as several key categories, including Auto, a significant contributor to revenue growth as well as Telecom, Media and Banking and Finance all had solid double-digit growth in the quarter. 
  
  As expected, politically-related ad demand also ramped in the quarter and totaled $21.3 million. Growth in core Advertising of about $16.7 million was almost matched by a $16.3 million increase in political spending. We're particularly pleased to see that strength in core as well as in political.
  
  The profitability of our Broadcasting segment improved with the significant revenue growth. Excluding special items, operating income and operating cash flow increased 49% and 42%, respectively. Similarly, the profit margin for the third quarter was approximately 41%, an increase of over 700 basis points. And the cash flow margin was over 600 basis points higher from the third quarter last year, equaling almost 45%. At this point, we expect the percentage increase in Television Advertising revenues to be in the mid- to high-20s for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter last year. 
  
  Again, that's TV ad revenues, not total revenues. As has been the case in the past, the buildup to the elections will be phonetic and the political spending as a result can be quite volatile. We fully expect to gain from our footprint in the value of our local TV franchises as we close in on election day.
  
  Turning to Digital, excluding special items, revenue and profitability were higher again in this segment this quarter. CareerBuilder's revenue growth was up in the very high single digits, improving on the revenue growth in the second quarter. PointRoll also generated double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding special items totaled over $36 million, up about 8%. Operating income on the same basis was over 16% higher, reaching almost $29 million. And before I turn to the balance sheet, with respect to our tax rate, our effective tax rate was 33.5% for the quarter versus 34% last year. The better tax rate added about $900,000 or so to net earnings.
  
  On the equity income line, results were about $2 million better than last year. However, on the nonoperating income line, those results were about $1 million less. So if you put all of those factors together, they had a favorable impact on our EPS of less than $0.01 for the quarter.
  
  Turning to the balance sheet. In addition to another meaningful reduction in our overall debt level, after the quarter closed, we successfully completed a bond financing and a bank facility extension as Craig mentioned and as we foreshadowed last quarter. Let me highlight some of the more important points of each transaction. 
  
  The bond financing was a $500 million private placement in two $250 million tranches maturing in 2015 and 2018. The coupons were 6 3/8 for the notes due in '15 and seven and an eight for the notes due in 2018. These are among the very lowest yields for any issuer with comparable ratings this year, and clearly illustrate that the fixed-income investing community recognized the significant progress that Gannett has made. And how well positioned we are for the future.
  
  We also extended our revolving credit facility. That extension was accomplished with a very minimal impact on the cost of the facilities and we are pleased with the confidence again shown in us by our strong bank group. Together, the transactions further strengthen our balance sheet, improve the structure of our debt maturities and provide us with significant financial capacity to invest in opportunities that will drive our future growth.
  
  Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $2.4 billion as we reduced debt by $210 million in the quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter totaled $172 million. At this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 6.5%, including the impact of our new long-term financings. Our debt-to-EBITDA covenant was 1.93x. Finally, capital expenditures were about $17 million in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $37 million. We now expect CapEx to be between $65 million and $75 million for the full year.
  
  So in summary, we closed the revenue GAAP. We improved our profitability overall and we achieved continued sequential improvement despite a mixed economy and increased uncertainty around the economy beginning in the summer months. There were several bright spots in terms of revenue in the quarter, not the least of which was continued growth in our digital revenues and our strong performance, particularly in the core in our Television business. We progressed on several strategic fronts as Craig noted, and look forward to putting what we are learning about the consumer to work in many arenas. The strength of our balance sheet, as well as a greater understanding of the consumer, the advertiser and their interaction in the emerging media landscape have positioned Gannett as well as possible as we look to the future.
  
  Now I'll stop there, and Craig and I will be delighted to take your questions."

So it's a little difficult to be sitting here on October 15, looking out, particularly with the strength that we closed the year last year, and that continued into the first quarter. But I'd say, overall, that on the Newsquest side, I think they are seeing a little bit better advertising numbers just in these, again, very early couple of weeks of the quarter. As you can see on the broadcasting side, we're anticipating that ad revenues on television are going to be up in the mid- to high-20s, which is certainly even stronger than what we achieved in the third quarter. And then on the Digital side, what we are hearing from PointRoll and our other businesses is that after a little bit of a lull in activity in the summer months that they are seeing a good pickup in the backlog. And so they're anticipating good strength continuing into the fourth quarter. And on the U.S. Community Publishing side, it's really too early to say. I think it depends on category by category. And we're just going to have to see how that plays out as we get closer to the holiday season."

So we'll have to see how the numbers play out. But obviously, to the extent that we can get additional help from the economy, we would be well on the way to reporting positive numbers. But I would say that as you can see, in total, for the company, on a constant currency basis, revenues were up 1%."

And I can only say that it is very, very early here for Q4. But to have that kind of core strength at this time, really bodes well for what Dave Lougee and his team are doing.

And we're very pleased to see that the investment that we made in the last half of last year and continuing through this year, has borne fruit for us. I think when the numbers come out for the six months ended September 30, that you will see that 21 of our top 31 markets had growth in home delivery Sunday volume above last year. You'll also see that 11 of our smaller sites will show year-over-year home delivery Sunday gains.

On the USA TODAY side, I think they're seeing some very good progress with regard to the Hotel side of the equation. A number of the hotels that we're experimenting with a variety of different things related to print products. They're seeing some follow-through with those companies and are seeing improved results as a result of consumer request and consumer demand. On the USA TODAY circulation front, I think what we're seeing is that in the third quarter, USA TODAY circulation down in the 1.7% range. So a significant improvement over what we had been experiencing. And hopefully as travel continues to come back and hotels continue to come back, we will see even better results."

So their margins are in the high-teens to low-20s. And they have consistently made money throughout the years, even in a year like last year when revenues were under as much pressure as they were. As I said earlier, clearly, the progress that Newsquest stalled a bit in the third quarter, if you follow any of the economic and political backdrop in the U.K., you'd note that it's more difficult in the U.K., I believe, than here in the States as they have had a lot of conversations and the current leadership there, government leadership there, has indicated that on October 20, they're going to be announcing final significant spending cuts across the country. As a result of that, public spending has virtually come to a halt in that country and consumer confidence has weakened as a result of that. So I think there's some macro-political and economic issues that Newsquest is contending with. But I would say that U.K. seems to be addressing its problems early and dramatically. And so I hope that, that will bode well for them coming out of the economic malaise that all of us are seeing more quickly than perhaps other countries in Europe or even the U.S."

We closed the revenue gap in the third quarter, despite a mixed and in rather unsteady economic environment. 
  
Broadcast and Digital revenues were particularly strong, and Publishing revenues continued their sequential improvement. The impact of our cost control and efficiency efforts was reflected in expense declines. As a result, operating income and earnings per share were both significantly higher compared to the third quarter last year. In fact, we again improved the profitability of each of our business segments, excluding special items when compared to third quarter last year.
  
In other significant news, subsequent to the close of the quarter, we completed $500 million bond financing and two $250 million tranches due in 2015 and 2018. The net result is an even better structure for our debt maturities. We now have a modest amount of maturities due every year through 2018, excluding 2013, in which we have no maturities. All of our maturing debt commitments can be easily managed with our free cash flow and credit availability. We also amended and extended our revolving credit facilities. Total commitments under the amended revolving credit agreements are now $1.63 billion through March 15, 2012, and a total extended commitment from March 15, 2012, to September 30, 2014, totaling $1.14 billion. Gracia will cover the transactions in a little more detail later.
  
The completion of these two transactions is a significant achievement for the company. We have further strengthened our financial condition and ensured our financial flexibility well into the future as we position Gannett for potential growth opportunities. We continue to progress on a number of strategic initiatives, focusing on our ability to deliver our content on any platform, connect that content with consumers and hone our ability to sell across those platforms. We firmly believe that providing engaging content and the ability to deliver it in any way the consumer wishes are key to our success.
  
Our content has great value and for the past three months, we have been testing paid content models at three of our domestic publishing sites, Greenville, South Carolina, St. George, Utah and Tallahassee, Florida. We have taken slightly different approaches in each of the tests to help assess different aspects of the paid content business model and consumer dynamics. In Tallahassee and St. George, we are testing content pricing model changes. In Greenville, the home of Clemson University, we are testing a premium site that is available through a separate subscription only, TigersNow.com, that focuses on exclusive coverage of Clemson sports.
  
We now have a couple of months of data as a result of these tests and while it is still early, we are seeing some very interesting results and important takeaways. Here's what we're learning: Our subscribers are much more heavily engaged with our content than nonsubscribers; web users who are subscribers, are consuming four and five times as many pages per visit as nonsubscribers; and in the case of TigersNow.com, users are consuming a remarkable level of content, more than 40 pages per visit and as high as 70, compared to six to eight pages per visit our sites typically experience; and our full content subscription model is driving increased usage of our e-Editions. In Tallahassee and Greenville, the e-Editions in both markets now have more than 1,300 unique users daily; a comprehensive content promotion strategy that spans social media, e-mail and other platforms, is driving consumer awareness; and we are seeing month-over-month gains in page views at two of the three sites. 
  
We also continue to enhance promotion of the changes to the subscription model to drive added online activations by full-content subscribers. The result has been significantly higher online engagement around news events.
  
For example, publisher e-mails to our customers regarding items specific to Clemson football drove significant spikes in page views. Similarly, content targeting high-interest topics like public safety, education and outdoors in St. George market has generated strong positive response from our readers. We are finding that Gannett's well-known local public personalities further help us connect with our customers and drive consumer engagement. 
  
For example, pieces personalized from a popular columnist in Tallahassee had the greatest success in terms of driving online activations on tallahassee.com. And a slightly different approach, direct interaction with editor Bob Gabordi through a variety of media, print columns, Facebook, Twitter, a blog on tallahassee.com, show customers are willing to come down a new path with us if they feel a connection. 
  
In fact, Bob summarized the current effort very well in his blog. And I quote, ""It is too early to declare victory and no doubt, there will be much tweaking before we settle on the right approach. But this much is clear. Through it all, over the last three months, tallahassee.com has remained the region's leading news website, according to independent reports on total reach and traffic. What's more, our customers tend to be more local, better serving the needs of our loyal advertisers. This is a powerful and gratifying message. Our readers have told us, they are willing to pay for the quality of our local reporting rather than just accept what the others offer for free, and their advertisers get the benefit of an engaged local audience.""
  
Honing our abilities to sell across platforms to engage audiences, Bob notes, developing solutions for local advertisers is crucial to our success and growth. As we announced in July, we now have the ability to offer Yahoo! as another alternative for our local advertisers. The rollout of Yahoo! has moved quite quickly. We have rolled out sales alliances in five publishing sites and three broadcasting sites. And the results are very promising.
  
At the end of the third quarter, the pilot markets collectively were ahead of their sales goals to date. 20 additional publishing sites will launch by mid-November, and two additional broadcasting sites will launch by the end of November. In addition, our broadcasting sites are further strengthening their commitment to hyper-local content through the launch of community level websites. These sites deliver content that is very relevant to local consumers and provide local advertisers the ability to connect with consumers in their community. To date, we have launched in four markets with a total of 140 neighborhood sites. Sales results have been ahead of expectations and we expect to launch four more markets this month. 
  
Our U.S. Community Publishing group continues to make progress on the development of our client solutions groups. These groups are developing comprehensive advertising solutions for our customers. Our team in the West market is fully staffed, and their early results have been positive. One recent success included the development of a highly creative and successful campaign for a major grocer in the Midwest featuring a social media-driven contest promotion targeted toward young moms and a multimedia campaign, including television, newspaper and digital media across the state and into select ZIP codes in adjacent states.
  
USA TODAY undertook a major realignment with the creation of new teams that will focus on design and product development, digital asset management and integrated business development, and they will be fundamentally reshaping the news, content and editing groups as they continue their evolution as a multi-platform media company. 
  
The popularity of its iPad app continues to grow, with a total of more than 1 million downloads. That app was recently recognized with the MOBI award for Best Mobile App for Editorial Content. We are learning more about our customers every day, particularly, those accessing content through newer platforms like the iPhone and the iPad and Android, as well as our dot-com and other mobile audiences. This restructuring at USA TODAY creates the infrastructure to design products, to cure new business opportunities and develop the systems to support the new platforms.
  
At USA TODAY, and across the company, we continue to align our content with the different audiences that access various platforms: print, digital, broadcast and mobile. And of course, we connect those audiences with our advertisers. I want to emphasize that we are not moving away from our legacy media platforms or our commitment to First Amendment and watchdog journalism. This is important because as the level of content on the Internet continues to grow, the value of providing reliable, trustworthy and relevant content becomes ever more critical.
  
Moving on to our results. Gracia will discuss in more detail. Third quarter earnings per share, excluding special items, increased by about 21% to $0.52 compared to $0.43 in third quarter of last year. As I mentioned, total operating revenues were unchanged, although they would have been up almost 1% when adjusted for currency. Broadcasting revenues were significantly higher this quarter compared to last year increasing about 22%. Ad revenues in television were up about 26% in the quarter. The increase was driven both by stronger core revenues, with double-digit growth in several key categories, as well as the expected step-up in political spending. In fact, year-to-date, political spending has kept pace with ad spending in 2008's presidential election year and is ahead of spending in the last non-presidential election year of 2006.
  
Digital segment revenues also increased in the quarter, about 10%, as CareerBuilder revenue was stronger and PointRoll had double-digit revenue growth. Publishing segment revenues were down in the mid-single digits, but better relative to second quarter. There were some bright spots in Publishing revenues as National Advertising was up about 2%. Classified Auto and Employment Advertising in the U.S. were also substantially year-over-year.
  
Our focus on online advertising is reflected in higher digital advertising at both U.S. Community Publishing and USA TODAY. In fact, Online revenue company-wide totaled about $256 million and increased almost 10%. It now represents over 19% of total revenues. Expenses were kept in check in the quarter and were down about 3%, excluding special items. As a result of the revenue gains and lower expenses, we improved the profitability of all our business segments on the same basis. And we again reduced our debt in the quarter by approximately $210 million.
  
In summary, we are moving forward on several initiatives that enhance our position as a leading multimedia enterprise. We are cementing our values as local media franchises through efforts like Yahoo! and client solutions groups, and at the same time, we continue to assess ways to enhance the value of our content and how it is delivered. We are building on the successes we have achieved to date and with a strong balance sheet, we are in a great position to propel growth into the future. 
  
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gracia."

I'll cover in a little more detail our business segments for the quarter, as well as some balance sheet items, and then we'll open it up for questions.

I'll cover in a little more detail our business segments for the quarter, as well as some balance sheet items, and then we'll open it up for questions. As a reminder, all of our category comparisons have been included in the release this morning. 
  
This quarter's results reflect substantial revenue growth in our Broadcasting and Digital segments. Publishing revenues, although down in the mid-single digits, improved sequentially from second quarter comparisons. As a result, we closed the revenue gap for the quarter on an as-reported basis as operating revenues overall were unchanged. But on a constant currency basis, revenues were actually up 1%.
  
Expenses were lower company-wide, which helped to improve the profitability for each of our segments once we adjust for special items. We have summarized the special items in our release this morning, but in short, they are associated primarily with facility consolidations, asset impairments as well as workforce restructuring. We reported EPS on a GAAP basis of $0.42 for the quarter, compared to $0.31 last year. Adjusting for those special items in both years, EPS was actually $0.52 this quarter versus $0.43 last year, an increase of over 20% as detailed on our non-GAAP schedules.
  
Also in our release this morning, we provided reconciliations for our non-GAAP schedules to our GAAP schedules. As a reminder, we completed the sale of The Honolulu Advertiser and its related assets, and a small Directory Publishing business in the second quarter of this year. Results for these properties have been reclassified to discontinued operations. Revenues associated with those properties totaled over $24 million in the third quarter last year. To help you with your thinking about the fourth quarter, revenue from these properties totaled approximately $30 million in last year's fourth quarter.
  
Turning to our business segments, in Publishing total revenues were about 5% lower. They were down about 4% on a constant-currency basis and the comparison was better than the comparison in the second quarter this year. On the same constant-currency basis, total Advertising revenue comparisons were better relative to the second quarter as all categories, Retail, National and Classified, contributed to the improvement in the comparisons. National was particularly strong, swinging to a positive and about five percentage points better than the second quarter comparison.
  
On a two-year comparison basis, which I know some of you focus on, we saw about a four percentage point sequential improvement in total Advertising. All category comparisons were better, particularly Classified, which improved almost eight percentage points from the quarter-to-quarter two-year comparison. Domestic Advertising revenue trends were better relative to the second quarter and were down just over 3%. National Advertising was up over 3% and was well over five percentage points better relative to the second quarter. Retail and Classified comparisons in the U.S. both improved relative to the second quarter, although to a lesser extent than National. Classified in the U.S. was just 2% lower in the quarter. The declines were lower in the quarter led by sequential comparison improvement on both a year-over-year and two-year basis.
  
In the U.K., at Newsquest, a more challenging economic environment and uncertainty around the spending cuts agenda of the new government had an impact on results there, particularly in the Retail and Classified categories. Looking again at the total Publishing segment, Classified Advertising adjusted for currency was about 4% lower in the quarter and better relative to the second quarter, driven primarily by an increase of almost 7% in Classified Auto. In the U.S. Auto and Employment were both stronger in the quarter compared to the third quarter last year, up 10% and 9%, respectively. Both categories increased more than 10% in September compared to September last year.
  
Results in the Employment category improved sequentially, building on the positive growth we achieved in the second quarter. At Newsquest, Real Estate Advertising continued to be positive as it has been since the end of the first quarter. Automotive and Employment, however, at Newsquest lagged last year. National Advertising in our Publishing segment was a bright spot, overall, and particularly in the U.S. Domestically, National Advertising increased about 3%, driven by solid growth at U.S. Community Publishing. Advertising at USA TODAY.com also contributed to the increase with online National Advertising for them, up over 60% in the quarter.
  
Print Advertising at USA TODAY posted its most favorable year-over-year comparison this year in the third quarter, but continues to be impacted by relative weakness in the travel and lodging markets. Several important categories, particularly Automotive, were stronger, in fact much stronger compared to the third quarter last year but some other categories, including Restaurants, Pharmaceutical and Packaged Goods lagged last year.
  
We are encouraged by the level of Online Advertising in the quarter in our Publishing segment. U.S. Community Publishing, Online Advertising was up over 10%, as all categories virtually were up significantly in the quarter. And Online Advertising at Newsquest increased more than 8% in pounds.
  
Turning to reported operating expenses. Company-wide, they were down a bit under 4% for the quarter. Special items impacted third quarter results both this year and last year, with them totaling $31.1 million pretax this quarter and $41.5 million last year in the same quarter. Special items impacted all of our business segments this year and just Publishing and Broadcasting last year. Operating expenses in total, excluding special items, were about 3% lower in the quarter.
  
Publishing segment expenses, excluding special items were approximately 6% lower and reflect the impact of our cost controls and efficiency efforts, as well as lower newsprint. Newsprint consumption and usage prices both declined in the mid-single digits, which resulted in Newsprint expense that was about 12% lower. 
  
Drilling down a little on the current newsprint situation. Increased shipments overseas have acted to balance domestic supply and demand. The strength of these export markets has been a key factor in producer price recovery. But those markets are beginning to show some signs of retreat as offshore customer inventories grow. Here in North America, a pattern of regional fragmentation persists with a continuing East-West price divide. In fact, an announced increase for October failed to garner support confirming that market conditions remain inconsistent across the U.S.
  
The outlook for the fourth quarter includes two key producers emerging from bankruptcy. A moderate approach to recovery efforts by these producers would support a stable environment for both industries. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter usage prices will be higher than a year ago, but consumption is expected to be lower once again.
  
Expense reductions again outpaced the revenue decline in Publishing. As a result, operating income, excluding special items, was about 4% better in the third quarter this year versus the third quarter last year. Operating cash flow on the same basis totaled about $173 million for the quarter. So despite a decline in revenue of about $48 million, the profit margin and cash flow margin both improved.
  
Profitability by just about all measures was stronger in our Broadcasting segment, as substantial revenue gains were achieved. Operating revenue growth was very strong, up over 22% as our television stations benefited from our best-in-class ratings and an extremely good political footprint. Strength in our core Television business continued, as several key categories, including Auto, a significant contributor to revenue growth, as well as Telecom, Media and Banking and Finance all had solid double-digit growth in the quarter. 
  
As expected, politically-related ad demand also ramped in the quarter and totaled $21.3 million. Growth in core Advertising of about $16.7 million was almost matched by a $16.3 million increase in political spending. We're particularly pleased to see that strength in core as well as in political.
  
The profitability of our Broadcasting segment improved with the significant revenue growth. Excluding special items, operating income and operating cash flow increased 49% and 42%, respectively. Similarly, the profit margin for the third quarter was approximately 41%, an increase of over 700 basis points. And the cash flow margin was over 600 basis points higher from the third quarter last year, equaling almost 45%. At this point, we expect the percentage increase in Television Advertising revenues to be in the mid- to high-20s for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter last year. 
  
Again, that's TV ad revenues, not total revenues. As has been the case in the past, the buildup to the elections will be frenetic and the political spending as a result can be quite volatile. We fully expect to gain from our footprint and the value of our local TV franchises as we close in on election day.
  
Turning to Digital, excluding special items, revenue and profitability were higher again in this segment this quarter. CareerBuilder's revenue growth was up in the very high-single digits, improving on the revenue growth in the second quarter. PointRoll also generated double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding special items totaled over $36 million, up about 8%. Operating income on the same basis was over 16% higher, reaching almost $29 million. And before I turn to the balance sheet, with respect to our tax rate, our effective tax rate was 33 ½% for the quarter versus 34% last year. The better tax rate added about $900,000 or so to net earnings.
  
On the equity income line, results were about $2 million better than last year. However, on the non-operating income line, those results were about $1 million less. So if you put all of those factors together, they had a favorable impact on our EPS of less than one penny for the quarter.
  
Turning to the balance sheet. In addition to another meaningful reduction in our overall debt level, after the quarter closed we successfully completed a bond financing and a bank facility extension as Craig mentioned and as we foreshadowed last quarter. Let me highlight some of the more important points of each transaction. 
  
The bond financing was a $500 million private placement in two $250 million tranches maturing in 2015 and 2018. The coupons were 6 3/8% for the notes due in '15 and 7 1/8% for the notes due in 2018. These are among the very lowest yields for any issuer with comparable ratings this year, and clearly illustrate that the fixed-income investing community recognized the significant progress that Gannett has made. And how well-positioned we are for the future.
  
We also extended our revolving credit facilities. That extension was accomplished with very minimal impact on the cost of the facilities and we are pleased with the confidence again shown in us by our strong bank group. Together, the transactions further strengthen our balance sheet, improve the structure of our debt maturities and provide us with significant financial capacity to invest in opportunities that will drive our future growth.
  
Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $2.4 billion as we reduced debt by $210 million in the quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter totaled $172 million. At this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 6 ½%, including the impact of our new long-term financings. Our debt-to-EBITDA covenant was 1.93x. Finally, capital expenditures were about $17 million in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $37 million. We now expect CapEx to be between $65 million and $75 million for the full year.
  
So in summary, we closed the revenue gap. We improved our profitability overall and we achieved continued sequential improvement despite a mixed economy and increased uncertainty around the economy beginning in the summer months. There were several bright spots in terms of revenue in the quarter, not the least of which was continued growth in our digital revenues and our strong performance, particularly in the core in our Television business. We progressed on several strategic fronts as Craig noted, and look forward to putting what we are learning about the consumer to work in many arenas. The strength of our balance sheet, as well as a greater understanding of the consumer, the advertiser and their interaction in the emerging media landscape have positioned Gannett as well as possible as we look to the future.
  
Now I'll stop there, and Craig and I will be delighted to take your questions."

So it's a little difficult to be sitting here on October 15, looking out, particularly with the strength that we closed the year last year, and that continued into the first quarter. But I'd say, overall, that on the Newsquest side, I think they are seeing a little bit better advertising numbers just in these, again, very early couple of weeks of the quarter. As you can see on the broadcasting side, we're anticipating that ad revenues on television are going to be up in the mid- to high-20s, which is certainly even stronger than what we achieved in the third quarter. And then on the Digital side, what we are hearing from PointRoll and our other businesses is that after a little bit of a lull in activity in the summer months that they are seeing a good pickup in the backlog. And so they're anticipating good strength continuing into the fourth quarter. And on the U.S. Community Publishing side, it's really too early to say. I think it depends on category by category.

So we'll have to see how the numbers play out. But obviously, to the extent that we can get additional help from the economy, we would be well on the way to reporting positive numbers. But I would say that as you can see, in total, for the company, on a constant-currency basis, revenues were up 1%."

In addition to, as you know, the very, very strong numbers that we have coming in politically -- I made the comment that our core is extraordinarily strong in several of the key categories. And let me be very specific there. Auto has been really, really doing well for us. We have done well in the Telecommunications area, as well we have done well in Media and Banking and Finance. And I can only say that it is very, very early here for Q4. But to have that kind of core strength at this time, really bodes well for what Dave Lougee and his team are doing. And the reason to say this is because we all know that when that election ends, those dollars are gone and it is very, very reassuring to have strong core strength behind that.

Because that is obviously a very important part of our circulation base for advertisers. And as we all know, Sunday is an extremely important advertising day. And we're very pleased to see that the investment that we made in the last half of last year and continuing through this year, has borne fruit for us. I think when the numbers come out for the six months ended September 30, that you will see that 21 of our top 31 markets had growth in home delivery Sunday volume above last year. You'll also see that 11 of our smaller sites will show year-over-year home delivery Sunday gains. And when I look at on a Sunday, if I just extract out our U.S. Community Publishing, not including Detroit, in fact, Sunday circulation is down just a little over 2%.

As I said earlier, clearly, the progress that Newsquest stalled a bit in the third quarter, if you follow any of the economic and political backdrop in the U.K., you'd note that it's more difficult in the U.K., I believe, than here in the States as they have had a lot of conversations and the current leadership there, government leadership there, has indicated that on October 20, they're going to be announcing final significant spending cuts across the country. As a result of that, public spending has virtually come to a halt in that country and consumer confidence has weakened as a result of that.

We closed the revenue gap in the third quarter, despite a mixed and in rather unsteady economic environment. 
 
Broadcast and Digital revenues were particularly strong, and Publishing revenues continued their sequential improvement. The impact of our cost control and efficiency efforts was reflected in expense declines. As a result, operating income and earnings per share were both significantly higher compared to the third quarter last year. In fact, we again improved the profitability of each of our business segments, excluding special items when compared to third quarter last year.
 
In other significant news, subsequent to the close of the quarter, we completed $500 million bond financing and two $250 million tranches due in 2015 and 2018. The net result is an even better structure for our debt maturities. We now have a modest amount of maturities due every year through 2018, excluding 2013, in which we have no maturities. All of our maturing debt commitments can be easily managed with our free cash flow and credit availability. We also amended and extended our revolving credit facilities. Total commitments under the amended revolving credit agreements are now $1.63 billion through March 15, 2012, and a total extended commitment from March 15, 2012, to September 30, 2014, totaling $1.14 billion. Gracia will cover the transactions in a little more detail later.
 
The completion of these two transactions is a significant achievement for the company. We have further strengthened our financial condition and ensured our financial flexibility well into the future as we position Gannett for potential growth opportunities. We continue to progress on a number of strategic initiatives, focusing on our ability to deliver our content on any platform, connect that content with consumers and hone our ability to sell across those platforms. We firmly believe that providing engaging content and the ability to deliver it in any way the consumer wishes are key to our success.
 
Our content has great value and for the past three months, we have been testing paid content models at three of our domestic publishing sites: Greenville, South Carolina; St. George, Utah; and Tallahassee, Florida. We have taken slightly different approaches in each of the tests to help assess different aspects of the paid content business model and consumer dynamics. In Tallahassee and St. George, we are testing content pricing model changes. In Greenville, the home of Clemson University, we are testing a premium site that is available through a separate subscription only, TigersNow.com, that focuses on exclusive coverage of Clemson sports.
 
We now have a couple of months of data as a result of these tests and while it is still early, we are seeing some very interesting results and important takeaways. Here's what we're learning: Our subscribers are much more heavily engaged with our content than nonsubscribers; web users who are subscribers are consuming 4x and 5x as many pages per visit as nonsubscribers; and in the case of TigersNow.com, users are consuming a remarkable level of content, more than 40 pages per visit and as high as 70, compared to six to eight pages per visit our sites typically experience; and our full content subscription model is driving increased usage of our e-Editions. In Tallahassee and Greenville, the e-Editions in both markets now have more than 1,300 unique users daily; a comprehensive content promotion strategy that spans social media, e-mail and other platforms, is driving consumer awareness; and we are seeing month-over-month gains in page views at two of the three sites. 
 
We also continue to enhance promotion of the changes to the subscription model to drive added online activations by full-content subscribers. The result has been significantly higher online engagement around news events.
 
For example, publisher e-mails to our customers regarding items specific to Clemson football drove significant spikes in page views. Similarly, content targeting high-interest topics like public safety, education and outdoors in St. George market has generated strong positive response from our readers. We are finding that Gannett's well-known local public personalities further help us connect with our customers and drive consumer engagement. 
 
For example, pieces personalized from a popular columnist in Tallahassee had the greatest success in terms of driving online activations on tallahassee.com. And a slightly different approach, direct interaction with editor Bob Gabordi through a variety of media, print columns, Facebook, Twitter, a blog on tallahassee.com, show customers are willing to come down a new path with us if they feel a connection. 
 
In fact, Bob summarized the current effort very well in his blog. And I quote, ""It is too early to declare victory and no doubt, there will be much tweaking before we settle on the right approach. But this much is clear. Through it all, over the last three months, tallahassee.com has remained the region's leading news website, according to independent reports on total reach and traffic. What's more, our customers tend to be more local, better serving the needs of our loyal advertisers. This is a powerful and gratifying message. Our readers have told us, they are willing to pay for the quality of our local reporting rather than just accept what the others offer for free, and their advertisers get the benefit of an engaged local audience.""
 
Honing our abilities to sell across platforms to engage audiences, Bob notes, developing solutions for local advertisers is crucial to our success and growth. As we announced in July, we now have the ability to offer Yahoo! as another alternative for our local advertisers. The rollout of Yahoo! has moved quite quickly. We have rolled out sales alliances in five publishing sites and three broadcasting sites. And the results are very promising.
 
At the end of the third quarter, the pilot markets collectively were ahead of their sales goals to date. 20 additional publishing sites will launch by mid-November, and two additional broadcasting sites will launch by the end of November. In addition, our broadcasting sites are further strengthening their commitment to hyper-local content through the launch of community level websites. These sites deliver content that is very relevant to local consumers and provide local advertisers the ability to connect with consumers in their community. To date, we have launched in four markets with a total of 140 neighborhood sites. Sales results have been ahead of expectations and we expect to launch four more markets this month. 
 
Our U.S. Community Publishing group continues to make progress on the development of our client solutions groups. These groups are developing comprehensive advertising solutions for our customers. Our team in the West market is fully staffed, and their early results have been positive. One recent success included the development of a highly creative and successful campaign for a major grocer in the Midwest featuring a social media-driven contest promotion targeted toward young moms and a multimedia campaign, including television, newspaper and digital media across the state and into select ZIP codes in adjacent states.
 
USA TODAY undertook a major realignment with the creation of new teams that will focus on design and product development, digital asset management and integrated business development, and they will be fundamentally reshaping the news, content and editing groups as they continue their evolution as a multi-platform media company. 
 
The popularity of its iPad app continues to grow, with a total of more than 1 million downloads. That app was recently recognized with the MOBI award for Best Mobile App for Editorial Content. We are learning more about our customers every day, particularly, those accessing content through newer platforms like the iPhone and the iPad and Android, as well as our dot-com and other mobile audiences. This restructuring at USA TODAY creates the infrastructure to design products, to cure new business opportunities and develop the systems to support the new platforms.
 
At USA TODAY, and across the company, we continue to align our content with the different audiences that access various platforms: print, digital, broadcast and mobile. And of course, we connect those audiences with our advertisers. I want to emphasize that we are not moving away from our legacy media platforms or our commitment to First Amendment and watchdog journalism. This is important because as the level of content on the Internet continues to grow, the value of providing reliable, trustworthy and relevant content becomes ever more critical.
 
Moving on to our results. Gracia will discuss in more detail. Third quarter earnings per share, excluding special items, increased by about 21% to $0.52 compared to $0.43 in third quarter of last year. As I mentioned, total operating revenues were unchanged, although they would have been up almost 1% when adjusted for currency. Broadcasting revenues were significantly higher this quarter compared to last year increasing about 22%. Ad revenues in television were up about 26% in the quarter. The increase was driven both by stronger core revenues, with double-digit growth in several key categories, as well as the expected step-up in political spending. In fact, year-to-date, political spending has kept pace with ad spending in 2008's presidential election year and is ahead of spending in the last non-presidential election year of 2006.
 
Digital segment revenues also increased in the quarter, about 10%, as CareerBuilder revenue was stronger and PointRoll had double-digit revenue growth. Publishing segment revenues were down in the mid-single digits, but better relative to second quarter. There were some bright spots in Publishing revenues as National Advertising was up about 2%. Classified Auto and Employment Advertising in the U.S. were also substantially year-over-year.
 
Our focus on online advertising is reflected in higher digital advertising at both U.S. Community Publishing and USA TODAY. In fact, Online revenue company-wide totaled about $256 million and increased almost 10%. It now represents over 19% of total revenues. Expenses were kept in check in the quarter and were down about 3%, excluding special items. As a result of the revenue gains and lower expenses, we improved the profitability of all our business segments on the same basis. And we again reduced our debt in the quarter by approximately $210 million.
 
In summary, we are moving forward on several initiatives that enhance our position as a leading multimedia enterprise. We are cementing our values as local media franchises through efforts like Yahoo! and client solutions groups, and at the same time, we continue to assess ways to enhance the value of our content and how it is delivered. We are building on the successes we have achieved to date and with a strong balance sheet, we are in a great position to propel growth into the future. 
 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gracia."

I'll cover in a little more detail our business segments for the quarter, as well as some balance sheet items, and then we'll open it up for questions. As a reminder, all of our category comparisons have been included in the release this morning. 
 
This quarter's results reflect substantial revenue growth in our Broadcasting and Digital segments. Publishing revenues, although down in the mid-single digits, improved sequentially from second quarter comparisons. As a result, we closed the revenue gap for the quarter on an as-reported basis as operating revenues overall were unchanged. But on a constant currency basis, revenues were actually up 1%.
 
Expenses were lower company-wide, which helped to improve the profitability for each of our segments once we adjust for special items. We have summarized the special items in our release this morning, but in short, they are associated primarily with facility consolidations, asset impairments as well as workforce restructuring. We reported EPS on a GAAP basis of $0.42 for the quarter, compared to $0.31 last year. Adjusting for those special items in both years, EPS was actually $0.52 this quarter versus $0.43 last year, an increase of over 20% as detailed on our non-GAAP schedules.
 
Also in our release this morning, we've provided reconciliations for our non-GAAP schedules to our GAAP schedules. As a reminder, we completed the sale of The Honolulu Advertiser and its related assets and a small Directory Publishing business in the second quarter of this year. Results for these properties have been reclassified to discontinued operations. Revenues associated with those properties totaled over $24 million in the third quarter last year. To help you with your thinking about the fourth quarter, revenue from these properties totaled approximately $30 million in last year's fourth quarter.
 
Turning to our business segments, in Publishing total revenues were about 5% lower. They were down about 4% on a constant-currency basis and the comparison was better than the comparison in the second quarter this year. On the same constant-currency basis, total Advertising revenue comparisons were better relative to the second quarter as all categories, Retail, National and Classified, contributed to the improvement in the comparisons. National was particularly strong, swinging to a positive and about five percentage points better than the second quarter comparison.
 
On a two-year comparison basis, which I know some of you focus on, we saw about a four percentage point sequential improvement in total Advertising. All category comparisons were better, particularly Classified, which improved almost eight percentage points from the quarter-to-quarter two-year comparison. Domestic Advertising revenue trends were better relative to the second quarter and were down just over 3%. National Advertising was up over 3% and was well over five percentage points better relative to the second quarter. Retail and Classified comparisons in the U.S. both improved relative to the second quarter, although to a lesser extent than National. Classified in the U.S. was just 2% lower in the quarter. The declines were lower in the quarter led by sequential comparison improvement on both a year-over-year and two-year basis.
 
In the U.K., at Newsquest, a more challenging economic environment and uncertainty around the spending cuts agenda of the new government had an impact on results there, particularly in the Retail and Classified categories. Looking again at the total Publishing segment, Classified Advertising adjusted for currency was about 4% lower in the quarter and better relative to the second quarter, driven primarily by an increase of almost 7% in Classified Auto. In the U.S. Auto and Employment were both stronger in the quarter compared to the third quarter last year, up 10% and 9%, respectively. Both categories increased more than 10% in September compared to September last year.
 
Results in the Employment category improved sequentially, building on the positive growth we achieved in the second quarter. At Newsquest, Real Estate Advertising continued to be positive as it has been since the end of the first quarter. Automotive and Employment, however, at Newsquest lagged last year. National Advertising in our Publishing segment was a bright spot, overall, and particularly in the U.S. Domestically, National Advertising increased about 3%, driven by solid growth at U.S. Community Publishing. Advertising at USA TODAY.com also contributed to the increase with online National Advertising for them, up over 60% in the quarter.
 
Print Advertising at USA TODAY posted its most favorable year-over-year comparison this year in the third quarter, but continues to be impacted by relative weakness in the travel and lodging markets. Several important categories, particularly Automotive, were stronger, in fact much stronger compared to the third quarter last year but some other categories, including Restaurants, Pharmaceutical and Packaged Goods lagged last year.
 
We are encouraged by the level of Online Advertising in the quarter in our Publishing segment. U.S. Community Publishing, Online Advertising was up over 10%, as all categories virtually were up significantly in the quarter. And Online Advertising at Newsquest increased more than 8% in pounds.
 
Turning to reported operating expenses. Company-wide, they were down a bit under 4% for the quarter. Special items impacted third quarter results both this year and last year, with them totaling $31.1 million pretax this quarter and $41.5 million last year in the same quarter. Special items impacted all of our business segments this year and just Publishing and Broadcasting last year. Operating expenses in total, excluding special items, were about 3% lower in the quarter.
 
Publishing segment expenses, excluding special items were approximately 6% lower and reflect the impact of our cost controls and efficiency efforts, as well as lower newsprint. Newsprint consumption and usage prices both declined in the mid-single digits, which resulted in Newsprint expense that was about 12% lower. 
 
Drilling down a little on the current newsprint situation. Increased shipments overseas have acted to balance domestic supply and demand. The strength of these export markets has been a key factor in producer price recovery. But those markets are beginning to show some signs of retreat as offshore customer inventories grow. Here in North America, a pattern of regional fragmentation persists with a continuing East-West price divide. In fact, an announced increase for October failed to garner support confirming that market conditions remain inconsistent across the U.S.
 
The outlook for the fourth quarter includes two key producers emerging from bankruptcy. A moderate approach to recovery efforts by these producers would support a stable environment for both industries. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect fourth quarter newsprint usage prices will be higher than a year ago, but consumption is expected to be lower once again.
 
Expense reductions again outpaced the revenue declines in Publishing. As a result, operating income, excluding special items, was about 4% better in the third quarter this year versus the third quarter last year. Operating cash flow on the same basis totaled about $173 million for the quarter. So despite a decline in revenue of about $48 million, the profit margin and cash flow margin both improved.
 
Profitability by just about all measures was stronger in our Broadcasting segment, as substantial revenue gains were achieved. Operating revenue growth was very strong, up over 22% as our television stations benefited from our best-in-class ratings and an extremely good political footprint. Strength in our core Television business continued, as several key categories, including Auto, a significant contributor to revenue growth, as well as Telecom, Media and Banking and Finance all had solid double-digit growth in the quarter. 
 
As expected, politically-related ad demand also ramped in the quarter and totaled $21.3 million. Growth in core Advertising of about $16.7 million was almost matched by a $16.3 million increase in political spending. We're particularly pleased to see that strength in core as well as in political.
 
The profitability of our Broadcasting segment improved with the significant revenue growth. Excluding special items, operating income and operating cash flow increased 49% and 42%, respectively. Similarly, the profit margin for the third quarter was approximately 41%, an increase of over 700 basis points. And the cash flow margin was over 600 basis points higher from the third quarter last year, equaling almost 45%. At this point, we expect the percentage increase in Television Advertising revenues to be in the mid- to high-20s for the fourth quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter last year. 
 
Again, that's TV ad revenues, not total revenues. As has been the case in the past, the buildup to the elections will be frenetic and the political spending as a result can be quite volatile. We fully expect to gain from our footprint and the value of our local TV franchises as we close in on election day.
 
Turning to Digital, excluding special items, revenue and profitability were higher again in this segment this quarter. CareerBuilder's revenue growth was up in the very high-single digits, improving on the revenue growth in the second quarter. PointRoll also generated double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Operating cash flow, excluding special items totaled over $36 million, up about 8%. Operating income on the same basis was over 16% higher, reaching almost $29 million. And before I turn to the balance sheet, with respect to our tax rate, our effective tax rate was 33 ½% for the quarter versus 34% last year. The better tax rate added about $900,000 or so to net earnings.
 
On the equity income line, results were about $2 million better than last year. However, on the non-operating income line, those results were about $1 million less. So if you put all of those factors together, they had a favorable impact on our EPS of less than one penny for the quarter.
 
Turning to the balance sheet. In addition to another meaningful reduction in our overall debt level, after the quarter closed we successfully completed a bond financing and a bank facility extension as Craig mentioned and as we foreshadowed last quarter. Let me highlight some of the more important points of each transaction. 
 
The bond financing was a $500 million private placement in two $250 million tranches maturing in 2015 and 2018. The coupons were 6 3/8% for the notes due in '15 and 7 1/8% for the notes due in 2018. These are among the very lowest yields for any issuer with comparable ratings this year, and clearly illustrate that the fixed-income investing community recognized the significant progress that Gannett has made. And how well-positioned we are for the future.
 
We also extended our revolving credit facilities. That extension was accomplished with very minimal impact on the cost of the facilities and we are pleased with the confidence again shown in us by our strong bank group. Together, the transactions further strengthen our balance sheet, improve the structure of our debt maturities and provide us with significant financial capacity to invest in opportunities that will drive our future growth.
 
Long-term debt at the end of the quarter was $2.4 billion as we reduced debt by $210 million in the quarter. Cash at the end of the quarter totaled $172 million. At this point, our all-in cost of debt is approximately 6 ½%, including the impact of our new long-term financings. Our debt-to-EBITDA covenant was 1.93x. Finally, capital expenditures were about $17 million in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $37 million. We now expect CapEx to be between $65 million and $75 million for the full year.
 
So in summary, we closed the revenue gap. We improved our profitability overall and we achieved continued sequential improvement despite a mixed economy and increased uncertainty around the economy beginning in the summer months. There were several bright spots in terms of revenue in the quarter, not the least of which was continued growth in our digital revenues and our strong performance, particularly in the core in our Television business. We progressed on several strategic fronts as Craig noted, and look forward to putting what we are learning about the consumer to work in many arenas. The strength of our balance sheet, as well as a greater understanding of the consumer, the advertiser and their interaction in the emerging media landscape have positioned Gannett as well as possible as we look to the future.
 
Now I'll stop there, and Craig and I will be delighted to take your questions."

With regard to the fourth quarter, frankly, we're only a couple of weeks into the quarter. And as you may recall in last year's fourth quarter, there was a good buildup and December closed out the quarter on a particularly strong note. So it's a little difficult to be sitting here on October 15, looking out, particularly with the strength that we closed the year last year, and that continued into the first quarter. But I'd say, overall, that on the Newsquest side, I think they are seeing a little bit better advertising numbers just in these, again, very early couple of weeks of the quarter. As you can see on the broadcasting side, we're anticipating that ad revenues on television are going to be up in the mid- to high-20s, which is certainly even stronger than what we achieved in the third quarter. And then on the Digital side, what we are hearing from PointRoll and our other businesses is that after a little bit of a lull in activity in the summer months that they are seeing a good pickup in the backlog. And so they're anticipating good strength continuing into the fourth quarter. And on the U.S. Community Publishing side, it's really too early to say. I think it depends on category by category. And we're just going to have to see how that plays out as we get closer to the holiday season."

So we'll have to see how the numbers play out. But obviously, to the extent that we can get additional help from the economy, we would be well on the way to reporting positive numbers.

And we're very pleased to see that the investment that we made in the last half of last year and continuing through this year, has borne fruit for us. I think when the numbers come out for the six months ended September 30, that you will see that 21 of our top 31 markets had growth in home delivery Sunday volume above last year. You'll also see that 11 of our smaller sites will show year-over-year home delivery Sunday gains.

As I said earlier, clearly, the progress that Newsquest stalled a bit in the third quarter, if you follow any of the economic and political backdrop in the U.K., you'd note that it's more difficult in the U.K., I believe, than here in the States as they have had a lot of conversations and the current leadership there, government leadership there, has indicated that on October 20, they're going to be announcing final significant spending cuts across the country. As a result of that, public spending has virtually come to a halt in that country and consumer confidence has weakened as a result of that. So I think there's some macro-political and economic issues that Newsquest is contending with. But I would say that U.K. seems to be addressing its problems early and dramatically.
