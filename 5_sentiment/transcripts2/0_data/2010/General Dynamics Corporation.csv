General Dynamics finished 2009 with a very good fourth quarter marked by strong operational performance, excellent cash flow and the achievement of several key milestones. Sales in the quarter were $7.9 billion,",1890,"Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics finished 2009 with a very good fourth quarter marked by strong operational performance, excellent cash flow and the achievement of several key milestones. Sales in the quarter were $7.9 billion, up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2008 but somewhat lighter than I had anticipated, primarily because of timing on several international vehicle contracts and the delayed passage of the 2010 Defense Bill.Net earnings from continuing operations were $618 million or $1.58 per fully diluted share. In the quarter, we achieved the 12% company-wide operating margin, our best performance in 2009. For the full year, sales were nearly $32 billion, a 9% increase over 2008 driven entirely by our Defense businesses. Demand for our Defense products and services generated 12.7% top line growth, more than offsetting the 6% decline at Aerospace. Nearly 10% of the growth in our Defense businesses was organic.2009 earnings from continuing operations were $2.4 billion or $6.20 per fully diluted shares. Operating earnings totaled $3.7 billion in 2009, with Combat Systems and IS&T both topping $1 billion of EBIT. I should also highlight that Marine Systems delivered their best ever earnings performance, and Aerospace exceeded $700 million in earnings, an impressive performance in a very challenging market environment.Free cash flow after capital expenditures totaled $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Each of the business groups contributed to this excellent fourth quarter results, which brought total cash for the year to $2.5 billion or 103% of earnings from continuing operations. This included a pension contribution of nearly $250 million.Fourth quarter orders reached $7.4 billion, the strongest quarter this year. General Dynamics finished 2009 with a total backlog of $65.5 billion, more than two times annual sales. Total potential contract value, which includes backlog, unexercised options and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity IDIQ contracts totaled $83 billion. Now I'd like to focus on the performance and outlook for each of our business segments, starting with our three defense groups.First, Combat. Combat Systems had a very successful fourth quarter. Sales were $2.5 billion, 6.6% higher than the fourth quarter of 2008 due primarily to increased Stryker, Abrams, Armor and Weapon Systems volume. Double-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter was the result of 14.8% margins, 160 basis points of improvement over last year's fourth quarter. Margin performance resulted from increased booking rates on several of our U.S. and European vehicle programs and a more favorable mix' in our Guns and Weapons Systems business. For the full year, sales were up 17.7% compared with 2008, including 12.5% organic sales growth. The group's organic growth was driven by Stryker, Abrams and European vehicle volumes. The remainder of the growth came from AxleTech.While I am pleased with this double-digit growth, I had anticipated over 20% sales growth. The difference is the result of timing on several contract awards in year end vehicle deliveries. For the year, the group generated operating earnings in excess of $1.2 billion, margins were 13.1%, 50 basis points lower than 2008 due to mix shift. Year-end backlog for Combat Systems totaled $13.4 billion, of which $11.4 billion is fully funded.Fourth quarter orders, which totaled over $3 billion were greater than sales, causing backlog to grow $500 million from the third to the fourth quarter. Foreign Military Sales contract were particularly strong in the fourth quarter, including $160 million for Iraqi tank upgrades, $18 million for Saudi Arabian tank work and $2.2 billion for Light Armored Vehicles. These international programs will begin to take hold in 2010, with growing volumes over the next several years.The group also made significant progress towards several future opportunities in the fourth quarter. In early November, our JLTV [Joint Light Tactical Vehicle] became the first vehicle to successfully complete critical design review with our first prototypes due to be delivered to our customers this spring. Additionally, our European Land Systems group, led by General Dynamics U.K., submitted its first bid to provide the British army's next-generation reconnaissance armored fighting vehicles. European Land System is also bidding on the Spanish program for several hundred 8x8 armored vehicles. For this year, based on the strength of our backlog and continued support for our core programs, I expect Combat Systems to deliver 4% to 5% sales growth with operating margins in the high 12% range. Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group finished their best year with another very good quarter. Quarterly sales totaled $1.6 billion, a 12.4% increase over 2008, and operating earnings increased 18.2% to $156 million. This quarter's double-digit sales and earnings growth is particularly impressive since the same quarter a year ago saw sales and earnings growth 13.3% and 30.7%, respectively when compared with 2007. Virginia Class Submarine and repair volume drove revenue growth, and increased booking rates on several programs drove earnings improvement. The group's 10.1% margins in the fourth quarter were up 50 basis points over fourth quarter 2008. For the full year, sales and operating earnings increased 14.5% and 23.2%, respectively. Margins for the full year were 10.1%, a noteworthy accomplishment resulting from hard work and sustained disciplined execution in all three shipyards.Marine's U.N. backlog totaled $22.5 billion, down from year end 2008 but robust by any measure. We anticipate adding orders for several ships in the first half of 2010 including, T-AKE's 13 and 14, DDG's-1001 and 1002 [ph]  And advance procurement for another DDG-51 destroyer. For this year, I expect Marine Systems sales growth to be between 7% and 8%. Margins will degrade somewhat maybe in the mid-9% range as the group experiences some mix shift in the surface combatant workload.IS&T. Fourth quarter sales in the IS&T group were $2.7 billion, a 2.8% increase over the same quarter last year. Margin rates increased 80 basis points, causing earnings to grow 11.5% compared to fourth quarter 2008. Margin improvement was particularly strong at our Tactical Communications and ISR businesses. Sales for the full year grew 7.6%, while operating earnings grew 7.1%. Organic sales growth was 4.4%. The group's 2009 margin rate was constant at 10.7%, a very good result.Demand for products across the group's portfolio continued in the fourth quarter, resulting in over $2.3 billion in new orders. IS&T's year-end backlog totaled $10.3 billion, up slightly from fourth quarter 2008. Total potential contract value, backlog and estimated potential contract value under IDIQ contracts grew 12.9% through 2009 to $23.1 billion at year-end, positioning IS&T for another successful year in 2010. Sales growth in 2010 should be between 8% and 9%, while margins will be in the mid-10% range.Now before moving to the Aerospace group, let me comment briefly on our overall Defense outlook. 2009 was clearly a successful year for our Defense businesses. Operating performance was very good, and we will continue to build on those successes moving forward. Execution remains paramount. The 2010 Defense Bill passed in late December fully supported our core programs, positioning our Defense business for success in the year ahead. Most of our procurement programs were funded in the 2010 base budgets, as supplemental funding targeted the operations and maintenance requirements. In the coming weeks, we will get more detailed insight in the defense funding priorities and requirements for the next several years. I am confident that GD will fare well. Our products are at the center of today's fight, and we will continue to evolve our offerings to address changing war fighting requirements in a way that is affordable to our customer.Now let's move to Aerospace. The Aerospace group finished an exceedingly difficult year with a solid fourth quarter. Several of the quarter highlights include: Continued strength in order activity, substantially fewer customer defaults, improved service volume and the first flights of our new G250 and G650 aircraft. The group's fourth quarter sales were $1.2 billion, and operating earnings were $167 million. While sales and earnings were down significantly when compared to fourth quarter 2008, sales were up 5.4%, and operating earnings were up 33.6% compared with third quarter 2009.The group's 14.1% operating margin was up 290 basis points from third quarter 2009 due to a better delivery mix and improved pricing in the Services business. For the full year, sales were $5.2 billion, down 6.2% from 2008. The sales decline resulted from fewer green-aircraft deliveries and a 15% reduction in our Services business, somewhat offset by the addition of a full year of Jet Aviation. Operating earnings for the year were $707 million, and margins were 13.7%. While earnings and margins were also down from 2008, they were outstanding given the environment. These are the earnings of the market leader.Gulfstream's proactive approach to managing production and internally driven cost-cutting initiatives protected profitability in an unpredictable and decidedly difficult market. All indications point to continued market improvement in 2010. The improved trend in flying hours in the third quarter of 2009 held through year end, and our service centers continue to work full weeks. Pre-owned inventory levels are continuing to decline, particularly for large cabin models. We have four remaining pre-owned aircraft in inventory, after selling one in the fourth quarter and taking one in trade. In 2010, our aircraft deliveries include potential trade-in options for nine pre-owned aircraft.Orders outpaced deliveries again in the quarter, and customer defaults slowed significantly. New aircraft book to bill was 1.47x on a dollar-denominated basis, leading to a slight increase in backlog. Backlog now stands at $19.3 billion. Our 2009 orders were 60% international, with great diversity in the customer mix. Given the continued pace of order activity in the fourth quarter and new customer interests, the backlog remains durable. Our large cabin backlog is essentially sold in 2010, three quarters sold in 2011, and we're already making significant progress in 2012. We plan to produce 77 large green aircraft in 2010, several more than we produced last year.Mid-sized production, on the other hand, will decrease to 14 aircraft. Mid-cabin activity represented around 5% of Aerospace's 2009 sales and less than 5% of their earnings. Our product development efforts remain on track in the fourth quarter with successful first flights of the G250 and G650 aircraft. Both aircraft continue to undergo rigorous flight testing in preparation for 2011 FAA certification. Given the success of the testing to date, we believe that the Aerospace group is well-positioned to begin delivering the G250 in 2011 and the G650 in 2012. Revenues and earnings on these programs will begin driving growth in 2011.For 2010, I think it's reasonable to expect low to mid single-digit sales growth in Aerospace, with margins around 14%. This admittedly conservative guidance reflects the market as we see it today. If market conditions continue to improve, particularly in the mid-sized market, we have the flexibility to adjust, and I will factor any upside into subsequent guidance updates.In summary, 2009 was a good year for General Dynamics, and we anticipate continued success in 2010. The guidance I provided this morning implies mid-single digit growth in sales. Margins will be in the low to mid-11% range, causing earnings from continuing operations to grow at the mid-single digit rate. I expect earnings per share from continuing operations in a range of $6.40 to $6.50. I should note that this guidance does not include or anticipate the results of capital deployment. It is purely an operating forecast. And with that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on several key financial highlights. Hugh?"

First, I'll mention our corporate operating ex",505,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to cover a few items, the impact and comparison of the 2009 results to 2008 and to communicate to you our expectations for 2010 with respect to same items. First, I'll mention our corporate operating expense, you can see on Exhibit B and D for the quarter and for the full year, respectively.Of the increase, year-over-year is attributable to increased stock option expense, which we report for the entire company in the corporate expense line. We expect corporate operating expense for 2010 in the range of $95 million. Next, our interest expense is up for the quarter and the year. Focusing now on the full year, net interest expense is up due to a reduction in interest income of about $55 million. That was driven by lower market interest rates and lower average invested cash balances during the year.In addition, we issued fixed rate notes in December of 2008 and June of 2009, that increased our interest expense during the year. Strong cash performance in the fourth quarter reduced our net debt by $1.2 billion, preserving our strong balance sheet and the financial flexibility that comes with it. With the reduction in net debt and the scheduled repayment of $700 million of fixed rate notes in August, we're expecting our 2010 interest expense to be down from 2009, a little around $150 million.Regarding taxes, you may recall that our 2008 tax provision included the favorable settlement of long-standing tax litigation. That reduced our provision by $35 million or $0.09 per share and resulted in an effective tax rate of 31.2%. Of the effective tax rate for 2009 was 31.5%, which was in line with our expectations. The expected 2010 rate to be in the same range, perhaps up by 20 to 30 basis points.With respect to our shares outstanding, you can see that diluted count effectively unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2008 to 2009. We did repurchase 1.5 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2009, but that activity was late enough in year that had minimal effects on our weighted average share count.This was in addition to 2.1 million shares repurchased in the first quarter of the year. As Jay pointed out, the 2010 guidance does not assume the impact of the future capital deployment activities, including potential share repurchases. Finally, a couple of thoughts with respect to pensions, you'll notice that the impact of changes in our funded status in several places in our financial results. First, as Jay pointed out, our strong cash generation in 2009 includes contributions of about $250 million to our pension plans. This, combined with asset returns of approximately 20% in 2009, improved our plans funded status by $500 million. This, of course, had a positive impact on shareholders equity, it reflects changes in the funded status of our retirement plans. For 2010, we're planning approximately $270 million in contributions to our pension plan.That completes my remarks and Amy, I'll turn this back over to you for Q&A."

I know you understand that, I'm stating the obvious. But that's number one. We've got pension that you mentioned that will be a little this year, in the $260 million to $270 million range. We've got dividends, which we're very committed to, that the Board will deal with again in a couple of months. And we've got tactical share repurchases. So in the M&A side, we remain very opportunistic and very acquisitive in our search patterns, but very selective in what we do. So I would anticipate remaining within the balance of deals in the max of $1 billion to $1.5 billion, and where they will add value in our portfolio or fill a gap that exist in that portfolio. And to be honest with you, that covers a lot of territory, both on the commercial side and within defense space. And that's about as specific as I'll get right now, as you might expect."

274561,78966667,58207,"General Dynamics Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-28-2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","Thank you Amy and good morning everyone. General Dynamics delivered a good first quarter marked by strong operating performance across our businesses. Revenues in the quarter were $7.8 billion down from the first quarter of 2009. You may recall that in la",1985,"Thank you Amy and good morning everyone. General Dynamics delivered a good first quarter marked by strong operating performance across our businesses. Revenues in the quarter were $7.8 billion down from the first quarter of 2009. You may recall that in last year’s first quarter revenues were unusually high. In fact it was the company’s single largest revenue quarter ever. 
Unlike last year’s experience we expect sales to continue to increase as the year progresses more consistent with our historical pattern. Operating earnings were $918 million in the quarter, up slightly from last year’s first quarter resulting in an 11.8% operating margin. A favorable program mix and disciplined execution contributed to the 80 basis point year-over-year margin improvement with particularly strong performance at aerospace and combat systems. 
Earnings from continuing operations were $599 million, up slightly from last year’s first quarter. This drove 7.7% return on sales 50 basis points better than last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.54 on a fully diluted basis flat when compared with first quarter 2009. Free cash flow after capital expenditures totaled $150 million somewhat light but better than last year’s first quarter. In the quarter, we experienced some growth in operating working capital at our IS&T in general and at C4 Systems in particular. 
This is largely a timing issue that will reverse itself as the year progresses. We should be around 100% net earnings to free cash conversion again this year. First quarter orders totaled $7.2 billion, significantly higher than last year with robust award activity across our business portfolio. Backlog totaled $63.9 billion at the end of the quarter, down modestly from year end. Funded backlog however was up 3% at $47 billion. Total potential contract value which includes backlog, unexercised option in indefinite delivery and definite quantity contracts reached nearly $81 billion. 
Now I’d like to focus on the performance of each of our business segments starting with our three defense groups and I’ll begin with the Combat Systems. Sales were $2 billion, down $400 million or approximately 17% from last year’s first quarter. The volume decline resulted from several factors. A significant decrease in MRAP volume when compared with the first quarter of 2009, the absence of deliveries of weapon systems that protects soldiers from roadside explosive threats, lower small-caliber ammunition volume, and last year’s cancellation of the Future Combat Systems program.
Higher volume on Abrams, Stryker and several European vehicle programs somewhat offset these decline. Our Combat Systems businesses delivered $269 million of operating earnings in the first quarter. Down just $10 million from last year on significantly less volume. Consequently, the groups operating margin was 13.4%, 180 basis points higher than last year. This performance was the result of a favorable program mix and strong execution on several vehicle and ammunition programs. 
Combat Systems backlog declined modestly from year-end to $12.9 billion, despite the decline in backlog award activity was healthy in the quarter. We received new orders on our core programs and also on several new opportunities. These new opportunities include an additional 250 RG-31 MRAP vehicles and MRAP (inaudible) awards beyond the retrofit work we had expected this year. 
The MRAP deliveries are scheduled largely in the second half of the year. In March we were selected as the preferred vehicle provider for the United Kingdom FRESH program. This opportunity includes both the Scout variant and the Common Base Platform for up to 580 specialist vehicles. The FRESH program also anticipates several other blocks of vehicles for which we will provide the common base platform. We are working with the United Kingdom on the initial FRESH contract and we expect to add it to backlog later this year. 
The FRESH program provides good upside to Combat’s outlook over the next five years. There are several other opportunities that could generate additional awards this year, including the Canadian lab upgrade program for which we expect to receive a contract in the second quarter and the Spanish eight by eight vehicle competition which we expect to be awarded in the second half. Other potential 2010 awards include the ground combat vehicle competition, the next phase of the Saudi Tank program, additional Iraqi tank options and the opportunity to enhance Stryker Combat vehicle protection. 
For the year, I expect Combat Systems sales and earnings to grow each quarter. This trend is typical for Combat Systems as the group’s European vehicle business generally realizes a significant portion of annual sales and earnings in the third and fourth quarters. Much of the topline growth I’ve guided to for the year comes from international programs including the live FMS program and several European vehicle programs. Our plan anticipates these programs building in the second half. 
That said it is worth noting that we have experienced the ways on international programs in the past. While our current international programs are still on track, it is too early in the year to predict uncertainty how they will unfold. I remain comfortable with the earnings implied in my guidance for the group, although they could come from slightly higher margins and lower revenue than originally forecast. 
Marine Systems, the Marine Systems group had a solid first quarter. Revenues were $1.6 billion in the quarter, down very slightly compared to year ago. Operating earnings were $161 million and operating margins were 9.8% essentially flat when compared to first quarter 2009. This margin reflects improved performance on our auxiliary ship programs and negative mix shift in our surface combating programs as DDG-51 work declines and DDG-1000 volume increases. 
Marine’s backlog totaled $22.1 billion at the end of the quarter, down slightly from year end 2009. We added orders for two T-AKE’s in the quarter as well as long leave funding for another DDG-51 destroyer. I anticipate orders for two additional DDG-1000 later this year which will again increase the size of the backlog. Marine Systems will see growth in volume as the year progresses, although mix shift in the Destroyer program will continue to pressure the group’s margins. Given their excellent execution to-date however I think there is a chance that they will outperform by mid 9% margin guidance for the year. 
IS&T, the Information Systems and Technology Group began 2010 with their largest sales quarter ever at $2.8 billion. Earnings were $290 million and operating margins were 10.5%. Margins were particularly strong at our IT services business which enjoyed a favorable program mix in the quarter. IS&T’s backlog was $10.3 billion at the end of the quarter and once again the group achieved a book-to-bill of one times. 
This reflects continued demand for the group’s products and services particularly in light of their robust first quarter sales. this quarter’s order activity was very strong at our tactical communications and IT services businesses reflecting our success in capturing business in faster growing market segments such as tactical networks and communication, healthcare services, simulation and training and IT infrastructure. We had a number of notable IS&T awards in the quarter, some of which you’ll find at exhibit G of our press release. Work on these contracts will help drive the group’s revenues this year especially in the second half. 
IS&T’s estimated potential contract value under IDIQ contracts grew 3% in the first quarter to $13.2 billion. When combined backlog and estimated potential contract value totaled $23.5 billion providing IS&T ample opportunity for continued growth. IS&T remains well positioned to achieve my guidance of approximately 8 to 9% sales growth in mid 10 margins this year. 
Now let's move to Aerospace. The Aerospace Group is off to a very good start in 2010. when compared to last year’s first quarter the group’s revenues were down 6.7%. However first quarter 2009’s results reflected a higher annual production rate including three additional green deliveries and 17 additional completions. Of those 17 additional completions 15 were mid-cabin aircraft. You may remember that we reduced Gulfstream’s annual production in March of 2009 as a result of the change in market conditions. 
The most significant production cut was in the mid-cabin aircraft. On the other hand, first quarter revenues were $1.4 billion, up nearly 15% over the fourth quarter of last year, due to additional Gulfstream new aircraft volume. Gulfstream green deliveries in the first quarter included seven additional midsize jets when compared to the last quarter and one additional large cabin aircraft. 
The groups operating earnings were $218 million and margins were 16.1%, improved when compared with both last quarter and the prior year period. Last year’s cost cutting efforts helped to drive some of the margin improvement in the quarter. We continued to see gradual improvement in the business aviation market in 2010, including healthy customer interest particularly for our largest jets. We also see declining pre-owned inventory levels and healthy aftermarket demand. 
Gulfstream enjoyed their largest order intake since mid 2008 in the first quarter with international orders dominating the order book. Orders were representative of every major international region and demand was particularly strong for our large cabin aircraft. Gross new aircraft book-to-bill was 1.2 times on a dollar denominated basis. Despite green take, new aircraft deliveries in default activity led backlog to decline modestly from year end to $18.5 billion. 
Orders outpace defaults for the fourth consecutive quarter and with continued economic recovery, I expect orders to increasingly outpace defaults as the year progresses. Pre-owned inventory levels continued to decline. We sold three pre-owned aircraft this quarter, took none in trade and have one aircraft remaining in inventory. For the remainder of 2010, we have no more than four trading commitments. Aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul demand was solid in the quarter although the first quarter does tend to be somewhat lighter than other periods of the year. 
Jet Aviation’s global FBO aircraft management and charter businesses were particularly strong. As we expected it appears the groups services business will be up for the year in the low to mid-single digit range. We continue to make great strides in our product development programs in the first quarter. Both the G250 and G650 have two aircraft in flight test at this time and we are extremely pleased with the results we’ve seen. 
Certification plans for both models remain on-track. For the year, we remain on pace to achieve our delivery plan which includes approximately 77 large cabin aircraft and 14 midsized. Large cabin deliveries will be slower in the third quarter as we are planning a two week furlough at Savannah. Slight improvement in the mid-cabin market could provide upside to plan deliveries. I remain optimistic on the outlook for the business aviation market and am encouraged by the generally positive trends we’ve seen thus far in 2010. 
Aerospace is well positioned to achieve low to mid-single digit sales growth with some upside to the 14% margin guidance I’ve provided. With regard to capital deployment, our solid balance sheet affords us ample flexibility to enhance shareholder returns. In the quarter we continued our balance strategy repurchasing 2.9 million shares at attractive prices. We also expanded our tactical communications portfolio with the acquisition of a software company that facilitates battle field information collection and dissemination for soldiers, a capability at the forefront of defense spending priorities. 
The Board also increased the quarterly dividend by 10.5%. The 13th increase in as many years. In summary, we’ve hit the deck running in the first quarter and we’re on our way to another successful year. The year is still young, so I am going to reiterate my full year guidance to 640 to 650. I think I’ve provided some indication of where I believe there maybe upside to that guidance, but it would imprudent to make any adjustments at this point. 
The improving business jet market and 2011 defense budget request provide a good foundation for the company moving forward. And with that, I’ll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on several key financial highlights, Hugh.

This estimate of course does not assume any extraordinary capital deployment activities throughout the remainder of the year. 
Over the past 12 months we’ve cut our net debt, by net debt I mean debtless cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We’ve cut our net debt in half, from $2.6 billion to $1.3 billion. This improvement can be attributed to our strong cash performance that comes after deploying Fox shipment, $700 million in acquisitions of new businesses, $600 million in payment of debt dividends - excuse me, in payment of dividends, $500 million in company sponsored resource and development, $400 million in capital expenditures and $300 million in share repurchases. 
Over this period our debt-to-equity ratio has dropped to 30.2% from 37.8% and our debt-to-capital ratio is 23.2% down from 27.4%. our next scheduled debt repayment is $700 million of fixed rate notes due in August of this year.

We’ve got grand combat vehicle competition that will lay itself out later this year, JLTV is still playing, Stryker is in play right now, reset modernization all of those elements is not just new production. So it’s multifaceted and very robust as we forward. So I don’t see a big tail off if that’s perhaps the implication here, because our core programs are being very well supported.  
We also have on the international side things that perhaps more realities the last time we talk like as I mentioned in my remarks the FRESH contract which will be significant add to the portfolio for Combat Systems.

To your point on margins, I started off by saying I am very pleased with the performance that aerospace both in Gulfstream and in Jet Aviation. So let's just get that on the table at the start and it’s reflected in the margin performance that you saw. There are several thing, have been several things that play in realizing those margins relative to both year-over-year first quarter ’09 and the sequential from last quarter, example year-over-year our margins this quarter were positively impacted certainly by mix as I mentioned I think in my remarks. So we have 15 fewer midsized completions this year than we did last year.  
Also we had a - we didn’t have pre-owned charges this year which we had last year. And as is usually the case when we’re talking about aerospace here, they lowered their SG&A this quarter through great discipline, continuous improvement in cost savings. So those are three I’d say elements that differentiate this quarter from year ago quarter on the margin side.  
Let's talk about sequential now from fourth quarter ’09 to first quarter ‘010 and the positive influencers if you will are somewhat different this quarter. I’ll leave the lower SG&A in there because indeed that made a big different again this quarter as it did in the year-over-year comparison but we also had improvement in Jet Aviation which is consistent with we’ve been telling you was happening and would continue to happen. We saw that quarter-over-quarter here and we’re very pleased with that and I would also say as I mentioned in my remarks I think that we did have some liquidated damages.  
So that’s kind of the summation if you will of elements that I think impacted the differentiation quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Now that said I would caution not to get too far ahead I mean on margins this year because we have something’s to thing about going forward. One is that we are planning a furlough at Gulfstream in the third quarter, not as long as we had last year but nonetheless we’ve got a furlough in the plan which will impact us and also the midsize mix is still a little bit uncertain in all of this, it depends on how the market recovers, depends on how many completions etcetera, etcetera. So that will definitely have an impact, it could definitely have an impact on the margins going forward.  
And then I would also say that we expect the liquidated damages to be less of a factor going forward and we can talk about the backlog later but in point of fact what we see didn’t surprise us and we see less of it in the next and subsequent quarters going forward. So that’s probably more than you asked for but that’s kind of my rundown on the margins side and I hope it’s responsive to your question.

First of all, in terms, I’ll just go in terms of orders and defaults, just sort of lumping together here, the way I got it stacked in my head. It was on the order side, the best quarter we’ve had since the third quarter of 2008, across the product line and as I mentioned orders did outpace default for the fourth consecutive quarter. So we feel very good about that. $18.5 billion is a very robust backlog by any measure so I feel very good about that even though it moves around a little bit. Now the default activity in this quarter, we’ll talk about it little. A couple of things, for example it was greater than, it was the quarter before when we surprised by that honestly, not really, OK? And here are couple of reasons why.  
Let's talk about 650. we had actually by number five 650 defaults in the quarter, OK? They were all tied to the -- you recall the first flight payment milestone, anyway that’s the fourth quarter event that manifested itself in activity in the first quarter. So we lost five of those, not surprisingly they were instantly back filled and we’re still taking orders in the 650 backlog is still just south of 200 aircraft. So but it did in fact impact us on the liquidated damages side.  
In addition to that Cai, we had a number of defaults frankly that we've been working with the customer for a while and you could have brought some of them to default in the fourth quarter and end the year, we got payment milestones moved to the first quarter. And so some of that just triggered as a result of timing and folks we've been working with for a while. So, again, not a big surprise. 
Having said all of that, as we told you before Joe Lombardo, Larry Flynn, the Gulfstream team and I spent a lot of time together going through the backlog, customer by customer and we still do that almost weekly. And what we see ahead of us is an order book that is still very robust and a default activity that would decrease as the year progresses and I would expect spread between orders and defaults to continue to increase as the year goes forward. I hope that answers your question.

So, we can talk about backlog a little bit just as it applies across the corporation. It's not a one size fits all package; what do I mean by that? Let's just talk about the defense businesses. The aerospace backlog we talked about but in the defense businesses you've heard us say before I think in the marine systems group, the backlog is very lumpy and we usually talking big lumps when they come, okay.

Now that over simplifies how difficult it is to sustain a 1X book to bill as they're very good at doing but they're very disciplined and very accomplished with that. So that's pretty steady. On the combat side, it's almost in between those two that I just described but it tends to come particularly when you see some of this international business in pretty lumpy orders. So all that said, we can see a lot out ahead of us but how it comes and in what size lumps I think is something we're just going to have to work our way through. But clearly for combat systems, the bill will be throughout the year and the programs that we see on the international side, for instance I mentioned the labs in Canada, there's another vehicle competition that we anticipate in Canada called the Tactical Armored Patrol Vehicle that we're partnered with Oshkosh that will realize itself we believe based on what they're saying now. 
Next year and stream out for several years, we’ve got the FMS Labs at great scale, $2.2 billion that are just coming into design work right now that will play out for the next several years. We have got more labs from that customers country that we believe will come in the second half of this year. We've got Iraqi tanks, we've got Saudi Arabian tanks. So there's lots of business that we can see building over the next five years probably longer than you wanted.

The 250 order book honestly is a manifestation of the mid cabin market.

And when people see, touch and fly in this airplane, they won't be able to get enough of it. So that is my profound belief and it also will give us the pacing right now, puts us I think in good shape to match the market as it recovers, the mid cabin market recovers because we are seeing activity in that market and I think you're hearing that from the other OEMs as well.

I think if memory serves, it was like 16% better than the ‘08 Q1. So we didn't help ourselves with the comp in that sense but it's really more to me - I feel very good about IS&T right now. They had a great performance quarter as we described. I anticipate more of that for the rest of the year. And the timing of the contracts okay, maybe not as dramatic as I described in combat systems but the sensing will be that that will build again throughout the year as we go forward.
So we've got as you know a very diverse portfolio, all elements of that portfolio are very active. We got tactical communications, battle space management, C-Square whatever you want to call it with WIN-T increment two, increment one, increment three is in play. We've got jitters, we've got common hardware/software working there. IT services was very strong as I detailed in my remarks. ISR is still very active. Access is busy within that space for us as we expected and throughout it all we've got cyber at scale. So we're very busy in IS&T, I don't expect that to change. Their year is a challenge but they're up to the challenge.

What do I mean by that? These ships are being built in their shipyard. They are clearly ready to prime and quite frankly to be as competitive as we could be with the Ostile boats, we felt that having them solo if you will rather than having them and Bath Iron Works in there would make them cost competitive, because you don’t have two yards, you are only working with one.
Embedded in all of that for us is the fact that the core mission system of that great ship is ours, okay? It comes from our IS&T team, AIS in particularly and it’s working beautiful and it’s open architecture and we are very excited about that. So that’s a long way around saying we felt that that for this round it was most appropriate for Ostile to prime this. They felt that way and we are in complete alignment with them on that.
By the way, it also for round two that the way they are appears set up by the Navy for round two, it also then would give us the opportunity to put - to bid for the second source in 2012 should we choose to do so. But that’s a long way down range. But I hope that answers your question.

And so we expect at least three of those Mobile Landing Platform -- Mobile Landing Ships. And then we also got a significant book of business out there with repair. There is no navy shipyard, okay, in San Diego and there are over 50 navy combatants that need to be maintained out there. So that's - that I think last year was like I don't know 20 some percent, 24% I think of NASSCO’s revenues. 
So there is plenty of work in that book of business. The commercial side just needs to have the market come back and we will be very competitive when it does.

General Dynamics delivered a good first quarter, marked by strong operating performance across our businesses. Revenues in the quarter were $7.8 billion, down from the first quarter of 2009. You may recall tha",1981,"Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics delivered a good first quarter, marked by strong operating performance across our businesses. 
Revenues in the quarter were $7.8 billion, down from the first quarter of 2009. You may recall that in last year's first quarter, revenues were unusually high. In fact, it was the company's single largest revenue quarter ever. Unlike last year's experience, we expect sales to continue to increase as the year progresses, more consistent with our historical pattern. 
Operating earnings were $918 million in the quarter, up slightly from last year's first quarter, resulting in an 11.8% operating margin. A favorable program mix and disciplined execution contributed to the 80 basis point year-over-year margin improvement, with particularly strong performance at Aerospace and Combat Systems.
Earnings from continuing operations were $599 million, up slightly from last year's first quarter. This drove a 7.7% return on sales, 50 basis points better than last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.54 on a fully diluted basis, flat when compared with first quarter 2009. 
Free cash flow after capital expenditures totaled $150 million, somewhat light but better than last year's first quarter. In the quarter, we experienced some growth in operating working capital at our IS&T group in general and at C4 Systems in particular. This is largely a timing issue that will reverse itself as the year progresses. We should be around 100% net earnings to free cash conversion again this year.
First quarter orders totaled $7.2 billion, significantly higher than last year, with robust award activity across our business portfolio. Backlog totaled $63.9 billion at the end of the quarter, down modestly from year end. Funded backlog however, was up 3% at $47 billion. Total potential contract value, which includes backlog, unexercised options and indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts reached nearly $81 billion. 
Now I'd like to focus on the performance of each of our business segments starting with our three Defense groups. And I'll begin with Combat Systems.  Sales were $2 billion, down $400 million or approximately 17% from last year's first quarter. The volume decline resulted from several factors: A significant decrease in MRAP volume when compared with the first quarter of 2009; the absence of deliveries of weapons systems that protect soldiers from roadside explosive threats; lower small caliber ammunition volume; and last year's cancellation of the future Combat Systems program. Higher volume on Abrams, Stryker and several European vehicle programs somewhat offset these declines.
Our Combat Systems businesses delivered $269 million of operating earnings in the first quarter, down just $10 million from last year on significantly less volume. Consequently, the group's operating margin was 13.4%, 180 basis points higher than last year. This performance was the result of a favorable program mix and strong execution on several vehicle and ammunition programs.
Combat Systems backlog declined modestly from year end to $12.9 billion. Despite the decline in backlog, award activity was healthy in the quarter. We received new orders on our core programs and also won several new opportunities. These new opportunities include an additional 250 RG-31 MRAP vehicles and MRAP Axle awards beyond the retrofit work we had expected this year. The MRAP deliveries are scheduled largely in the second half of the year.
In March, we were selected as the preferred vehicle provider for the United Kingdom FRES program. This opportunity includes both the Scout variant and the common-base platform for up to 580 specialist vehicles. The FRES program also anticipates several other blocks of vehicles for which we will provide the common-base platform. We are working with the United Kingdom on the initial FRES contract, and we expect to add it to backlog later this year. The FRES program provides good upside to Combat's outlook over the next five years. 
There are several other opportunities that could generate additional awards this year, including the Canadian lab upgrade program for which, we expect to receive a contract in the second quarter, and the Spanish 8x8 Vehicle Competition, which we expect to be awarded in the second half. Other potential 2010 awards include the ground combat vehicle competition, the next phase of the Saudi tank program, additional Iraqi tank options and the opportunity to enhance Stryker combat vehicle protection. For the year, I expect Combat Systems sales and earnings to grow each quarter. This trend is typical for Combat Systems, as the group's European Vehicle business generally realizes a significant portion of annual sales and earnings in the third and fourth quarters.
Much of the top line growth I have guided to for the year comes from international programs, including the lab FMS program and several European vehicle programs. Our plan anticipates these programs building in the second half. That said, it is worth noting that we have experienced delays on international programs in the past. While our current international programs are still on track, it is too early in the year to predict with certainty how they will unfold. I remain comfortable with the earnings implied in my guidance for the group, although they could come from slightly higher margins and lower revenue than originally forecast.
Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group had a solid first quarter. Revenues were $1.6 billion in the quarter, down very slightly compared to a year ago. Operating earnings were $161 million, and operating margins were 9.8%, essentially flat when compared to first quarter 2009. This margin reflects improved performance on our auxiliary ship programs and negative mix shift in our surface combatant programs as DDG-51 work declines and DDG 1000 volume increases. 
Marines backlog totaled $22.1 billion at the end of the quarter, down slightly from year end 2009. We added orders for two T-AKEs in the quarter, as well as long-lead funding for another DDG-51 destroyer. I anticipate orders for two additional DDG 1000s later this year, which will again increase the size of the backlog. 
Marine Systems will see growth in volume as the year progresses, although mix shift in the destroyer program will continue to pressure the group's margins. Given their excellent execution to date, however, I think there is a chance that they will outperform my mid-9% margin guidance for the year.
IS&T. The Information Systems and Technology group began 2010 with their largest sales quarter ever at $2.8 billion. Earnings were $290 million and operating margins were 10.5%. Margins were particularly strong at our IT Services business, which enjoyed a favorable program mix in the quarter. IS&T's backlog was $10.3 billion at the end of the quarter, and once again, the group achieved a book-to-bill of 1x. This reflects continued demand for the group's products and services, particularly in light of their robust first quarter sales. 
This quarter's order activity was very strong at our Tactical Communications and IT Services businesses, reflecting our success in capturing business in faster growing market segments, such as tactical networks and communication, healthcare services, simulation and training and IT infrastructure. 
We had a number of notable IS&T awards in the quarter, some of which, you'll find at Exhibit G of our press release. Work on these contracts will help drive the group's revenues this year, especially in the second half.
IS&T's the estimated potential contract value under ID/IQ contracts grew 3% in the first quarter to $13.2 billion. When combined, backlog and estimated potential contract value totaled $23.5 billion, providing IS&T ample opportunity for continued growth. IS&T remains well-positioned to achieve my guidance of approximately 8% to 9% sales growth and mid-10% margins this year.
Now let's move to Aerospace. The Aerospace group is off to a very good start in 2010. When compared to last year's first quarter, the group's revenues were down 6.7%. However, first quarter 2009's results reflected a higher annual production rate, including three additional green deliveries and 17 additional completions. Of those 17 additional completions, 15 were mid-cabin aircraft. You may remember that we reduced Gulfstream's annual production in March of 2009, as a result of the change in market conditions. The most significant production cut was in the mid-cabin aircraft. 
On the other hand, first quarter revenues were $1.4 billion, up nearly 15% over the fourth quarter of last year, due to additional Gulfstream new aircraft volume. Gulfstream green deliveries in the first quarter included seven additional mid-size jets when compared to last quarter and one additional large cabin aircraft. The group's operating earnings were $218 million and margins were 16.1%, improved when compared with both last quarter and the prior-year period. Last year's cost-cutting efforts helped to drive some of the margin improvement in the quarter. 
We continue to see gradual improvement in the business aviation market in 2010, including healthy customer interest, particularly for our largest jets. We also see declining pre-owned inventory levels and healthy aftermarket demand. Gulfstream enjoyed their largest order intake since mid-2008 in the first quarter, with international orders dominating the order book. Orders were representative of every major international region, and demand was particularly strong for our large cabin aircraft. 
Gross new aircraft book-to-bill was 1.2x on a dollar-denominated basis. Despite good order intake, new aircraft deliveries and default activity led backlog to decline modestly from year end to $18.5 billion. Orders outpaced defaults for the fourth consecutive quarter, and with continued economic recovery, I expect orders to increasingly outpace defaults as the year progresses.
Pre-owned inventory levels continue to decline. We sold three pre-owned aircraft this quarter, took none in trade and have one aircraft remaining in inventory. For the remainder of 2010, we have no more than four trade-in commitments. 
Aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul demand was solid in the quarter, although the first quarter does tend to be somewhat lighter than other periods of the year. Jet Aviation's global FBO, Aircraft Management and Charter businesses were particularly strong. As we expected, it appears the Group Services business will be up for the year in the low- to mid- single digit range. 
We continue to make great strides in our product development programs in the first quarter. Both the G350 and the G650 had two aircraft in flight test at this time, and we are extremely pleased with the results we've seen. Certification plans for both models remain on track. 
For the year, we remain on pace to achieve our delivery plan, which includes approximately 77 large cabin aircraft and 14 mid-sized. Large cabin deliveries will be slower in the third quarter as we are planning a two-week furlough at Savannah. Slight improvement in the mid-cabin market could provide upside to planned deliveries. I remain optimistic on the outlook for the business aviation market, and I'm encouraged by the generally positive trends we've seen thus far in 2010. Aerospace is well positioned to achieve low- to mid-single digit sales growth, with some upside to the 14% margin guidance I've provided.
With regard to capital deployment, our solid balance sheet affords us ample flexibility to enhance shareholder returns. In the quarter, we continued our balanced strategy, repurchasing 2.9 million shares at attractive prices. We also expanded our tactical communications portfolio with the acquisition of a software company that facilitates battlefield information collection and dissemination for soldiers, a capability at the forefront of Defense spending priorities. The board also increased the quarterly dividend by 10.5%, the 13th increase in as many years. 
In summary, we've hit the deck running in the first quarter, and we're on our way to another successful year. The year is still young, so I'm going to reiterate my full year guidance of 640 to 650. I think I've provided some indication of where I believe there may be upside to that guidance, but it would be imprudent to make any adjustments at this point. The improving business jet market and 2011 Defense budget request provide a good foundation for the company moving forward. 
And with that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd, to touch on several key financial highlights."

Although interest expense was up for the first quarter compared to year ago, we expect full year interest expense to be down slightly from 2009, somewhere between $150 million and $160 million. This estimate, of course, does not assume any extraordinary capital deployment activities throughout the remainder of the year.
Over the past 12 months, we've cut our net debt. By net debt, I meant debt less cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We've cut our net debt in half from $2.6 billion to $1.3 billion. This improvement can be attributed to our strong cash performance and comes after deploying approximately $700 million in acquisitions of new businesses, $600 million in payment of dividends, $500 million in company-sponsored research and development, $400 million in capital expenditures and $300 million in share repurchases. Over this period, our debt-to-equity ratio has dropped to 30.2% from 37.8%, and our debt-to-capital ratio is 23.2%, down from 27.4%. 
Our next scheduled debt repayment is $700 million of fixed rate notes due in August of this year. Finally, I would also like to remind everyone we plan to make a voluntary contribution to our pension plan of about $270 million in the third quarter of this year.

We've got ground combat vehicle competition that will lay itself out later this year. JLTV is still playing, Stryker is in play right now. Reset, modernization, all of those elements, it's not just new production. So it's multifaceted and very robust as we go forward. So I don't see a big tail off, if that's perhaps the implication here, because our core programs are being very well-supported. We also have on the international side, things that perhaps, more reality as the last time we talked, like as I mentioned in my remarks, the FRES contract, which will be a significant add to the portfolio for Combat Systems."

To your point on margins, I'd start it off by saying I'm very pleased with the performance that Aerospace, both in Gulfstream and in Jet Aviation. So let's just get that on the table at the start. And it's reflected in the margin performance that you saw. There have been several things that play in realizing those margins, relative to both year-over-year, first quarter '09 and the sequential from last quarter. Example, year-over-year, on margins, this quarter were positively impacted, certainly by mix, as I mentioned, I think, in my remarks. So we had 15 fewer mid-sized completions this year than we did last year. Also, we didn't have pre-owned charges this year, which we had last year. And as is usually the case, when we're talking about Aerospace here, they lowered their SG&A this quarter through great discipline, continuous improvement and cost savings. So those are three, I'd say, elements that differentiate this quarter from year-ago quarter on the margin side. Let's talk about sequential now, from fourth quarter '09 to first quarter '10 and the positive influencers, if you will, are somewhat different this quarter. I'll leave that lower SG&A in there because indeed, that made a big difference again this quarter, as it did in the year-over-year comparison, but we also had improvement at Jet Aviation, which is consistent with what we've been telling you was happening and will continue to happen. We saw that quarter-over-quarter here. And we're very pleased with that. And I would also say, as I mentioned in my remarks, that we did have some liquidated damages. So that's kind of the summation, if you will, of elements that I think impacted the differentiation, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Now that said, I would caution not to get too far ahead of me on margins this year because we have some things to think about going forward. One is that we are planning a furlough at Gulfstream in the third quarter, not as long as we had last year, but nonetheless, we've got a furlough in the plan, which will impact us. And also, the mid-size mix is still a little bit uncertain in all of this, depends on how the market recovers, depends on how many completions, et cetera, et cetera. So that will definitely have an impact, could definitely have an impact on margins going forward. And then I would also say that we expect the liquidated damages to be less of a factor going forward, and we can talk about the backlog later. But point of fact, what we see didn't surprise us, and we see less of it in the next and subsequent quarters going forward. So that's probably more than you asked for, but that's kind of my rundown on the margin side. And I hope it's responsive to your question."

It was, on the orders side, the best quarter we've had since the third quarter of 2008 across the product line. And as I mentioned, orders did outpace default for the fourth consecutive quarter. So we feel very good about that. $18.5 billion is a very robust backlog by any measure. So I feel very good about that, even though it moves around a little bit. Now the default activity in this quarter. We'll talk about it a little. A couple things, for example, it was greater than it was the quarter before. Were we surprised by that? Honestly, not really. And here are a couple of reasons why. Let's talk about 650. We had, actually by number, five 650 defaults in the quarter. They were all tied to, if you recall the first flight payment milestone? Anyway, that's a fourth quarter event that manifested itself in activity in the first quarter. So we lost five of those. Not surprisingly, they were instantly backfilled and were still taking orders, and the 650 backlog is still just south of 200 aircrafts. But it did in fact impact us on the liquidated damages side. In addition to that, Cai, we had a number of defaults, frankly, that we've been working with the customer for a while, and you could have brought some of them to default in the fourth quarter. And in the year, we've got payment milestones moved to the first quarter. And so some of that just triggered, as a result of timing and things our folks have been working with for a while. So again, not a big surprise. Having said all of that, as we've told you before, Joe Lombardo and Larry Flynn, the Gulfstream team and I spent a lot of time together going through the backlog, customer by customer, and we still do that almost weekly.

We see, again, in the U.S. franchise programs, there is opportunity for growth. They're as stable as they can be right now. But there is growth opportunity, particularly with the other elements that we talked about like reset, modernization, vehicle improvements, et cetera. But on the international side indeed, that is a portfolio that will build as we go. We can see it. I just can't time it out to the day. That's the reality and it's not a surprise. We can talk about backlog a little bit just as it applies across the corporation. It's not a one-size-fits-all package. What do I mean by that? Let's just talk about the Defense businesses. The Aerospace backlog, we've talked about. But in the Defense businesses, you've heard us say before, I think, in the Marine Systems group, the backlog is very lumpy. And we're usually talking big lumps when they come. We're at 22 or so million dollars right now, and we don't have the next to DDG 1000s in the backlog yet, et cetera. You understand that. On the IS&T side, relatively speaking, it's pretty Steady Eddy. That oversimplifies how difficult it is to sustain a 1x book to bill, as they're very good at doing, but they're very, very disciplined and very accomplished at that. So that's pretty steady. On the Combat side, it's almost in between those two that I just described. But it tends to come, particularly when you see some of this international business in pretty lumpy orders. So all that said, we can see a lot out ahead of us, but how it comes and in what size lumps, I think it's something we're just going to have to work our way through. But clearly, for Combat Systems, the bill will be throughout the year, and the programs that we see on the international side, FRES, as I mentioned, the labs in Canada, there's another vehicle competition that we anticipate in Canada called the Tactical Armored Patrol Vehicle that were partnered with Oshkosh on that will realize itself, we believe, based on what they're saying now, and next year and stream up for several years. We've got the FMS labs at great scale, $2.2 billion that are just coming into design work right now that will play out for the next several years. We've got more labs from that customers, countries that we believe will come in the second half of this year. We've got Iraqi tanks, we've got Saudi Arabian tanks. So there's lots of business that we can see building over the next five years, probably longer than you wanted."

The 250 order book, honestly, is a manifestation of the mid-cabin market. So it is not robust at this point, I would tell you. But I'm okay with that because as you mentioned, we've got 15 months until it because an entry into service reality. And when people see, touch and fly in this airplane, they won't be able to get enough of it. So that is my profound belief. And it also will give us the pacing right now, puts us, I think, in good shape to match the market as it recovers, the mid-cabin market recovers because we are seeing activity in that market. And I think you're hearing that from the other OEMs as well. And I might add one other thing to that Peter. We don't build flight sales on the 250s because we match demand with supply. But we're very excited about the 250 as we are about our 650. And I believe the sales will become very robust. It's just not time yet."

That said, the challenge there is the market space. And so, you know we're building one through five in the product carriers, six through nine are not in the build. And right now, today's answer is we don't expect them to come to us anytime soon. They are not in our plan anymore. But that market too, shall return. And we are getting some interest in commercial activity that could be resonant at NASSCO. And I don't want to get much more specific than that except to say, and I think we've talked about this before. You've got Jones Act ships that are out there in some number that are getting very old and very tired and very inefficient. And frankly, you've got environmental disciplines that are going to be kicking in here in terms of single-hulled versus double-hulled oilers et cetera, et cetera. So there's a lot going on that will come. It's just a question of when it comes. NASSCO's Navy side is coming out with 14 T-AKEs which are being done very well as you might expect. And that will bring us out through 2012 there, the mobile landing platform is being put into the '11 budget. We're already doing some of the front end work on that and so we expect at least three of those mobile landing platform, mobile landing ships. And then you also got a significant book of business out there with repair. There's no Navy shipyard in San Diego, and there are over 50 Navy combatants that need to be maintained out there. So that, I think last year was like 24%, I think, of NASSCO's revenues. So there's plenty of work in that book of business. The commercial side just needs to have the market come back. It will be very competitive when it does."

General Dynamics delivered a good first quarter, marked by strong operating performance across our businesses. Revenues in the quarter were $7.8 billion, down from the first quarter of 2009. You may recall tha",1980,"Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics delivered a good first quarter, marked by strong operating performance across our businesses. 
Revenues in the quarter were $7.8 billion, down from the first quarter of 2009. You may recall that in last year's first quarter, revenues were unusually high. In fact, it was the company's single largest revenue quarter ever. Unlike last year's experience, we expect sales to continue to increase as the year progresses, more consistent with our historical pattern. 
Operating earnings were $918 million in the quarter, up slightly from last year's first quarter, resulting in an 11.8% operating margin. A favorable program mix and disciplined execution contributed to the 80 basis point year-over-year margin improvement, with particularly strong performance at Aerospace and Combat Systems.
Earnings from continuing operations were $599 million, up slightly from last year's first quarter. This drove a 7.7% return on sales, 50 basis points better than last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.54 on a fully diluted basis, flat when compared with first quarter 2009. 
Free cash flow after capital expenditures totaled $150 million, somewhat light but better than last year's first quarter. In the quarter, we experienced some growth in operating working capital at our IS&T group in general and at C4 Systems in particular. This is largely a timing issue that will reverse itself as the year progresses. We should be around 100% net earnings to free cash conversion again this year.
First quarter orders totaled $7.2 billion, significantly higher than last year, with robust award activity across our business portfolio. Backlog totaled $63.9 billion at the end of the quarter, down modestly from year end. Funded backlog however, was up 3% at $47 billion. Total potential contract value, which includes backlog, unexercised options and indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts reached nearly $81 billion. 
Now I'd like to focus on the performance of each of our business segments starting with our three Defense groups. And I'll begin with Combat Systems.  Sales were $2 billion, down $400 million or approximately 17% from last year's first quarter. The volume decline resulted from several factors: A significant decrease in MRAP volume when compared with the first quarter of 2009; the absence of deliveries of weapons systems that protect soldiers from roadside explosive threats; lower small caliber ammunition volume; and last year's cancellation of the future Combat Systems program. Higher volume on Abrams, Stryker and several European vehicle programs somewhat offset these declines.
Our Combat Systems businesses delivered $269 million of operating earnings in the first quarter, down just $10 million from last year on significantly less volume. Consequently, the group's operating margin was 13.4%, 180 basis points higher than last year. This performance was the result of a favorable program mix and strong execution on several vehicle and ammunition programs.
Combat Systems backlog declined modestly from year end to $12.9 billion. Despite the decline in backlog, award activity was healthy in the quarter. We received new orders on our core programs and also won several new opportunities. These new opportunities include an additional 250 RG-31 MRAP vehicles and MRAP Axle awards beyond the retrofit work we had expected this year. The MRAP deliveries are scheduled largely in the second half of the year.
In March, we were selected as the preferred vehicle provider for the United Kingdom FRES program. This opportunity includes both the Scout variant and the common-base platform for up to 580 specialist vehicles. The FRES program also anticipates several other blocks of vehicles for which we will provide the common-base platform. We are working with the United Kingdom on the initial FRES contract, and we expect to add it to backlog later this year. The FRES program provides good upside to Combat's outlook over the next five years. 
There are several other opportunities that could generate additional awards this year, including the Canadian lab upgrade program for which, we expect to receive a contract in the second quarter, and the Spanish 8x8 Vehicle Competition, which we expect to be awarded in the second half. Other potential 2010 awards include the ground combat vehicle competition, the next phase of the Saudi tank program, additional Iraqi tank options and the opportunity to enhance Stryker combat vehicle protection. For the year, I expect Combat Systems sales and earnings to grow each quarter. This trend is typical for Combat Systems, as the group's European Vehicle business generally realizes a significant portion of annual sales and earnings in the third and fourth quarters.
Much of the top line growth I have guided to for the year comes from international programs, including the lab FMS program and several European vehicle programs. Our plan anticipates these programs building in the second half. That said, it is worth noting that we have experienced delays on international programs in the past. While our current international programs are still on track, it is too early in the year to predict with certainty how they will unfold. I remain comfortable with the earnings implied in my guidance for the group, although they could come from slightly higher margins and lower revenue than originally forecast.
Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group had a solid first quarter. Revenues were $1.6 billion in the quarter, down very slightly compared to a year ago. Operating earnings were $161 million, and operating margins were 9.8%, essentially flat when compared to first quarter 2009. This margin reflects improved performance on our auxiliary ship programs and negative mix shift in our surface combatant programs as DDG-51 work declines and DDG 1000 volume increases. 
Marines backlog totaled $22.1 billion at the end of the quarter, down slightly from year end 2009. We added orders for two T-AKEs in the quarter, as well as long-lead funding for another DDG-51 destroyer. I anticipate orders for two additional DDG 1000s later this year, which will again increase the size of the backlog. 
Marine Systems will see growth in volume as the year progresses, although mix shift in the destroyer program will continue to pressure the group's margins. Given their excellent execution to date, however, I think there is a chance that they will outperform my mid-9% margin guidance for the year.
IS&T. The Information Systems and Technology group began 2010 with their largest sales quarter ever at $2.8 billion. Earnings were $290 million and operating margins were 10.5%. Margins were particularly strong at our IT Services business, which enjoyed a favorable program mix in the quarter. IS&T's backlog was $10.3 billion at the end of the quarter, and once again, the group achieved a book-to-bill of 1x. This reflects continued demand for the group's products and services, particularly in light of their robust first quarter sales. 
This quarter's order activity was very strong at our Tactical Communications and IT Services businesses, reflecting our success in capturing business in faster growing market segments, such as tactical networks and communication, healthcare services, simulation and training and IT infrastructure. 
We had a number of notable IS&T awards in the quarter, some of which, you'll find at Exhibit G of our press release. Work on these contracts will help drive the group's revenues this year, especially in the second half.
IS&T's the estimated potential contract value under ID/IQ contracts grew 3% in the first quarter to $13.2 billion. When combined, backlog and estimated potential contract value totaled $23.5 billion, providing IS&T ample opportunity for continued growth. IS&T remains well-positioned to achieve my guidance of approximately 8% to 9% sales growth and mid-10% margins this year.
Now let's move to Aerospace. The Aerospace group is off to a very good start in 2010. When compared to last year's first quarter, the group's revenues were down 6.7%. However, first quarter 2009's results reflected a higher annual production rate, including three additional green deliveries and 17 additional completions. Of those 17 additional completions, 15 were mid-cabin aircraft. You may remember that we reduced Gulfstream's annual production in March of 2009, as a result of the change in market conditions. The most significant production cut was in the mid-cabin aircraft. 
On the other hand, first quarter revenues were $1.4 billion, up nearly 15% over the fourth quarter of last year, due to additional Gulfstream new aircraft volume. Gulfstream green deliveries in the first quarter included seven additional mid-size jets when compared to last quarter and one additional large cabin aircraft. The group's operating earnings were $218 million and margins were 16.1%, improved when compared with both last quarter and the prior-year period. Last year's cost-cutting efforts helped to drive some of the margin improvement in the quarter. 
We continue to see gradual improvement in the business aviation market in 2010, including healthy customer interest, particularly for our largest jets. We also see declining pre-owned inventory levels and healthy aftermarket demand. Gulfstream enjoyed their largest order intake since mid-2008 in the first quarter, with international orders dominating the order book. Orders were representative of every major international region, and demand was particularly strong for our large cabin aircraft. 
Gross new aircraft book-to-bill was 1.2x on a dollar-denominated basis. Despite good order intake, new aircraft deliveries and default activity led backlog to decline modestly from year end to $18.5 billion. Orders outpaced defaults for the fourth consecutive quarter, and with continued economic recovery, I expect orders to increasingly outpace defaults as the year progresses.
Pre-owned inventory levels continue to decline. We sold three pre-owned aircraft this quarter, took none in trade and have one aircraft remaining in inventory. For the remainder of 2010, we have no more than four trade-in commitments. 
Aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul demand was solid in the quarter, although the first quarter does tend to be somewhat lighter than other periods of the year. Jet Aviation's global FBO, Aircraft Management and Charter businesses were particularly strong. As we expected, it appears the Group Services business will be up for the year in the low to mid single-digit range. 
We continue to make great strides in our product development programs in the first quarter. Both the G250 and G650 have two aircraft in flight test at this time, and we are extremely pleased with the results we've seen. Certification plans for both models remain on track. 
For the year, we remain on pace to achieve our delivery plan, which includes approximately 77 large cabin aircraft and 14 mid-sized. Large cabin deliveries will be slower in the third quarter as we are planning a two-week furlough at Savannah. Slight improvement in the mid-cabin market could provide upside to planned deliveries. I remain optimistic on the outlook for the business aviation market, and I'm encouraged by the generally positive trends we've seen thus far in 2010. Aerospace is well positioned to achieve low to mid single-digit sales growth, with some upside to the 14% margin guidance I've provided.
With regard to capital deployment, our solid balance sheet affords us ample flexibility to enhance shareholder returns. In the quarter, we continued our balanced strategy, repurchasing 2.9 million shares at attractive prices. We also expanded our tactical communications portfolio with the acquisition of a software company that facilitates battlefield information collection and dissemination for soldiers, a capability at the forefront of defense spending priorities. The board also increased the quarterly dividend by 10.5%, the 13th increase in as many years. 
In summary, we've hit the deck running in the first quarter, and we're on our way to another successful year. The year is still young, so I'm going to reiterate my full year guidance of 640 to 650. I think I've provided some indication of where I believe there may be upside to that guidance, but it would be imprudent to make any adjustments at this point. The improving business jet market and 2011 Defense budget request provide a good foundation for the company moving forward. 
And with that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on several key financial highlights. Hugh?"

This estimate, of course, does not assume any extraordinary capital deployment activities throughout the remainder of the year.
Over the past 12 months, we've cut our net debt. By net debt, I meant debt less cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We've cut our net debt in half from $2.6 billion to $1.3 billion. This improvement can be attributed to our strong cash performance and comes after deploying approximately $700 million in acquisitions of new businesses, $600 million in payment of dividends, $500 million in company-sponsored research and development, $400 million in capital expenditures and $300 million in share repurchases. Over this period, our debt-to-equity ratio has dropped to 30.2% from 37.8%, and our debt-to-capital ratio is 23.2%, down from 27.4%. 
Our next scheduled debt repayment is $700 million of fixed-rate notes due in August of this year. Finally, I would also like to remind everyone that we plan to make a voluntary contribution to our pension plan of about $270 million in the third quarter of this year.

Heavily weighted, if you will, to the third and fourth quarters, which is not at all unusual for Combat Systems, but fairly substantive in its elements across both U.S. franchise and international. That's the general description I would offer."

We've got ground combat vehicle competition that will lay itself out later this year. JLTV is still playing, Stryker is in play right now. Reset, modernization, all of those elements, it's not just new production. So it's multifaceted and very robust as we go forward. So I don't see a big tail off, if that's perhaps the implication here, because our core programs are being very well-supported. We also have on the international side, things that perhaps, more reality as the last time we talked, like as I mentioned in my remarks, the FRES contract, which will be a significant add to the portfolio for Combat Systems."

To your point on margins, I'd start it off by saying I'm very pleased with the performance that Aerospace, both in Gulfstream and in Jet Aviation. So let's just get that on the table at the start. And it's reflected in the margin performance that you saw. There have been several things that play in realizing those margins, relative to both year-over-year, first quarter '09 and the sequential from last quarter. Example, year-over-year, on margins, this quarter were positively impacted, certainly by mix, as I mentioned, I think, in my remarks. So we had 15 fewer mid-sized completions this year than we did last year. Also, we didn't have pre-owned charges this year, which we had last year. And as is usually the case, when we're talking about Aerospace here, they lowered their SG&A this quarter through great discipline, continuous improvement and cost savings. So those are three, I'd say, elements that differentiate this quarter from year-ago quarter on the margin side. Let's talk about sequential now, from fourth quarter '09 to first quarter '10 and the positive influencers, if you will, are somewhat different this quarter. I'll leave that lower SG&A in there because indeed, that made a big difference again this quarter, as it did in the year-over-year comparison, but we also had improvement at Jet Aviation, which is consistent with what we've been telling you was happening and will continue to happen. We saw that quarter-over-quarter here. And we're very pleased with that. And I would also say, as I mentioned in my remarks, that we did have some liquidated damages. So that's kind of the summation, if you will, of elements that I think impacted the differentiation, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Now that said, I would caution not to get too far ahead of me on margins this year because we have some things to think about going forward. One is that we are planning a furlough at Gulfstream in the third quarter, not as long as we had last year, but nonetheless, we've got a furlough in the plan, which will impact us. And also, the mid-size mix is still a little bit uncertain in all of this, depends on how the market recovers, depends on how many completions, et cetera, et cetera. So that will definitely have an impact, could definitely have an impact on margins going forward. And then I would also say that we expect the liquidated damages to be less of a factor going forward, and we can talk about the backlog later. But point of fact, what we see didn't surprise us, and we see less of it in the next and subsequent quarters going forward. So that's probably more than you asked for, but that's kind of my rundown on the margin side. And I hope it's responsive to your question."

It was, on the orders side, the best quarter we've had since the third quarter of 2008 across the product line. And as I mentioned, orders did outpace default for the fourth consecutive quarter. So we feel very good about that. $18.5 billion is a very robust backlog by any measure. So I feel very good about that, even though it moves around a little bit. Now the default activity in this quarter, we'll talk about it a little. A couple of things. For example, it was greater than it was the quarter before. Were we surprised by that? Honestly, not really. And here are a couple of reasons why. Let's talk about 650. We had, actually by number, five 650 defaults in the quarter. They were all tied to, if you recall, the first flight payment milestone. Anyway, that's a fourth quarter event that manifested itself in activity in the first quarter. So we lost five of those. Not surprisingly, they were instantly backfilled and we're still taking orders, and the 650 backlog is still just south of 200 aircrafts. But it did, in fact, impact us on the liquidated damages side. In addition to that, Cai, we had a number of defaults, frankly, that we've been working with the customer for a while, and you could have brought some of them to default in the fourth quarter. And in the year, we've got payment milestones moved to the first quarter. And so some of that just triggered, as a result of timing and things our folks have been working with for a while. So again, not a big surprise. Having said all of that, as we've told you before, Joe Lombardo, Larry Flynn, the Gulfstream team and I spent a lot of time together going through the backlog, customer by customer, and we still do that almost weekly. And what we see ahead of us is an order book that is still very robust and a default activity that would decrease as the year progresses. And I would expect the spread between orders and defaults to continue to increase as the year goes forward. I hope that answers your question."

But on the international side indeed, that is a portfolio that will build as we go. We can see it. I just can't time it out to the day. That's the reality and it's not a surprise. We can talk about backlog a little bit just as it applies across the corporation. It's not a one-size-fits-all package. What do I mean by that? Let's just talk about the Defense businesses. The Aerospace backlog, we've talked about. But in the Defense businesses, you've heard us say before, I think, in the Marine Systems group, the backlog is very lumpy. And we're usually talking big lumps when they come. We're at 22 or so million dollars right now, and we don't have the next two DDG 1000s in the backlog yet, et cetera. You understand that. On the IS&T side, relatively speaking, it's pretty Steady Eddy. Now that oversimplifies how difficult it is to sustain a 1x book-to-bill, as they're very good at doing, but they're very, very disciplined and very accomplished at that. So that's pretty steady. On the Combat side, it's almost in between those two that I just described. But it tends to come, particularly when you see some of this international business in pretty lumpy orders. So all that said, we can see a lot out ahead of us. But how it comes and in what size lumps, I think it's something we're just going to have to work our way through. But clearly, for Combat Systems, the bill will be throughout the year, and the programs that we see on the international side, FRES, as I mentioned, the labs in Canada, there's another vehicle competition that we anticipate in Canada called the Tactical Armored Patrol Vehicle that were partnered with Oshkosh on that will realize itself, we believe, based on what they're saying now, and next year and stream up for several years. We've got the FMS labs at great scale, $2.2 billion that are just coming into design work right now that'll play out for the next several years. We've got more labs from that customers, countries that we believe will come in the second half of this year. We've got Iraqi tanks, we've got Saudi Arabian tanks. So there's lots of business that we can see building over the next five years, probably longer than you wanted."

And when people see, touch and fly in this airplane, they won't be able to get enough of it. So that is my profound belief.

And it's working beautifully and it's open architecture, and we are very excited about that. So that's a long way around saying we felt that for this round, it was most appropriate for Austal to prime this. They felt that way, and we are in complete alignment with them on that.

In fact, it's doing superbly in execution. Every product carrier we've put out has been ahead of schedule and below budget. So we know how to build those ships better than anybody. That said, the challenge there is the market space. And so, you know we're building one through five in the product carriers, six through nine are not in the build. And right now, today's answer is we don't expect them to come to us anytime soon. They are not in our plan anymore. But that market too, shall return. And we are getting some interest in commercial activity that could be resonant at NASSCO. And I don't want to get much more specific than that except to say, and I think we've talked about this before. You've got Jones Act ships that are out there in some number that are getting very old and very tired and very inefficient. And frankly, you've got environmental disciplines that are going to be kicking in here in terms of single-hulled versus double-hulled oilers et cetera, et cetera. So there's a lot going on that will come. It's just a question of when it comes. NASSCO's Navy side is coming out with 14 T-AKEs which are being done very well as you might expect. And that will bring us out through 2012 there, the mobile landing platform is being put into the '11 budget. We're already doing some of the front end work on that and so we expect at least three of those mobile landing platform, mobile landing ships. And then you also got a significant book of business out there with repair. There's no Navy shipyard in San Diego, and there are over 50 Navy combatants that need to be maintained out there. So that, I think last year was like 24%, I think, of NASSCO's revenues. So there's plenty of work in that book of business. The commercial side just needs to have the market come back. It will be very competitive when it does."

General Dynamics' second quarter performance was solid, delivering $8.1 billion in sales and record operating earnings of $985 million. This led to earnings per share of $1.68 on a fully diluted basis, $0.07 ahe",3105,"Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics' second quarter performance was solid, delivering $8.1 billion in sales and record operating earnings of $985 million. This led to earnings per share of $1.68 on a fully diluted basis, $0.07 ahead of last year's second quarter and $0.14 ahead of last quarter. Operating margins in all four groups were very strong in the quarter, driving 12.2% company margins, 50 basis points better than last year's second quarter and 40 basis points better than last quarter.
Second quarter free cash flow after capital expenditures was $414 million, approximately 64% of earnings from continuing operations. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $564 million, relatively consistent with last year's performance. I expect strong cash generation in the second half. 
We deployed $190 million of cash in the quarter to make two acquisitions that complement our core Combat Systems and IS&T businesses. We also took advantage of market conditions to buy 5.5 million shares of GD common stock in the open market. 
Orders this quarter exceeded $7 billion, over $1 billion more in last year's second quarter with robust activity in the Combat Systems and Information Systems and Technology groups. At the end of the quarter, total backlog stood at $62.5 billion.
Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups. And first, let's talk about Combat Systems. Combat Systems second quarter was marked by excellent operational performance across the business. Sales volume totaled $2.1 billion, up from the first quarter, but down from the same period a year ago, due to less MRAP volume, the cancellation of FCS and Stryker timing. In the second half, we anticipate stronger MRAP and Stryker volume. 
Earnings were essentially flat when compared with last year's second quarter, despite the decline in sales, as margins expanded across the portfolio. The 150-basis-point margin improvement is the result of better program mix, with volume concentrated in more mature procurement programs and improved operating performance. Compared to last quarter, earnings grew nearly 10% to $295 million. 
Total backlog for Combat Systems decreased modestly to $12.8 billion in the quarter. Order activity outpaced sales at three of the four businesses, including European Land Systems, which had its strongest order activity since the second quarter of last year. 
Notable orders in the quarter included approximately $500 million for Stryker vehicles and Abrams tanks, $200 million for United Kingdom's Scout vehicle development work, $35 million for the development phase of the Canadian LAV upgrade program and nearly $300 million for Hydra rockets. We expect to book several additional large international orders this year. 
Looking forward for the group, sales in the remainder of the year will be higher than both year-to-date and last year's second half, with particular strength in the fourth quarter. That said, my overall assessment now shows sales in 2010 to be essentially flat to slightly below 2009. 
As I mentioned on the first quarter call, the growth originally projected in 2010 was influenced heavily by international work in the second half of the year. A confluence of factors, including the European sovereign debt crisis, prolonged contract negotiations and the decline in the euro has changed our international sales outlook for this year. 
The sovereign debt crisis had delayed the award of the  Spanish 8x8 program until 2011. However, the Spanish government remains committed to this program, having stated publicly that it remains a top defense priority. 
Prolonged contract negotiations slows the award of our  Canadian LAV  program, which will now transition to production in 2011 rather than this year. A several hundred million dollar FMS LAV Award will also push out until late this year or early next year. Additionally at current exchange rates, the decline in the euro would reduce sales by nearly $150 million by year and. This is translation rather than meaningful economic impact, and obviously could vary, depending on whether the euro settles relative to the dollar at year end.
Our U.S. Core business received some unanticipated awards in the first half to include 250 RG-31s, stronger than expected EXCEL awards and Stryker development work. These positives have been somewhat offset by delays in awards at our Weapons Systems business and some reduction in contract scope in other programs. Not withstanding the adjusted sales outlook for 2010, full year earnings will be consistent with my original expectations. Margins will be in the mid 13% range, up approximately 50 to 60 basis points from my prior guidance, due to the favorable mix mentioned earlier.
As we look to the future, Combat's portfolio is well positioned. Let me briefly review four key components of this group's business. First, U.S. vehicles, comprised just over 50% of 2009 Combat sales, obviously driven by the Stryker and Abrams programs, which are core to today's army and will remain so for years to come. Current backlog, continued vehicle enhancements and reset opportunities will sustain these two mature programs. 
We are also competing on an array of next-generation vehicle programs, including the Ground Combat Vehicle and the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, which could offer upside in the longer term. In the event that any of these developmental programs are delayed, we see continued opportunity for our current vehicles.
Secondly, U.S. weapons systems and ammunition. At approximately 1/3 of 2009 combat sales, they provide an array of critical systems and ammunition products to a wide range of U.S. and international customers. The core programs in these businesses remain well supported in the midterm, while new opportunities in precision munitions, armor, commercial axles, Denel and international ammunition bode well for the longer term. 
Thirdly, international FMS and export vehicles. We expect to grow substantially over the next four years as we begin delivering light-armored vehicles and tanks to a variety of Middle Eastern customers. We are currently working four contracts, totaling close to $4 billion, with deliveries between 2011 and 2014. Two of those contracts, worth nearly $2.5 billion for FMS labs and Iraqi tanks are now in backlog. The other two contracts for additional FMS labs in tanks could add $1.4 billion to backlog before year end. These FMS sales present a meaningful opportunity, around $800 million to $1 billion of volume per year between 2011 and 2014.
And finally, international indigenous vehicles. One of our key market discriminators here is that we are residents in many of the countries where we manufacture and sell vehicles, thus making our employees an important component of local GDP. There have been several recent positive developments in this business, including: solidifying the first complement of the Canadian LAV upgrade program, which when added to backlog next year, will contribute another $850 million to sales between 2011 and 2013; selection as the preferred supplier for a five-year $100 million deal to sustain Australia's armored fighting vehicle fleet; and finalizing a contract worth several hundred million dollars over the next three years to develop and deliver Scout Specialist Vehicles to the British Army. 
Clearly the sovereign debt crisis has added some uncertainty to our European business over the past quarter. In June, I visited our European businesses. And while their situation remains dynamic, it was clear that in spite of timelines moving to the right, our programs remain in high demand. No programs have been eliminated or taken off the table. 
National security remains an important spending priority, even when times are austere and our indigenous workforce provides an important economic engine in many of these economies. We are setting the international standard for the next generation of armored vehicles, and I feel confident in our opportunities to provide best-in-class vehicles at affordable prices for years to come.
In summary, the Combat Systems portfolio of products is well placed in today's fighting force and is complemented by a healthy set of near and long-term opportunities. These opportunities, combined with the current backlog, provide relative stability in our core Domestic businesses and growth in our international workload. This will result in attractive margins and cash flow for the next several years.
Marine Systems. Marine Systems group delivered another solid quarter. Revenues were up slightly, though earnings were consistent with last year's second quarter at $1.6 billion and $167 million, respectively. This is a particularly good performance as last year's results reflected 17% sales and 32% earnings growth. 
Sales in the quarter were up at Electric Boat and Bath Iron Works reflecting increased Virginia and DDG 1000 volume and expand an SSBN replacement design efforts. This growth was somewhat offset by a decline in NASSCO sales due to repair volume timing and the ramp down of the commercial product carrier program. 
Marines margins in the quarter were 10.2%, up 40 basis points from the first quarter. The Marine group's backlog totaled $21.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, down 3.6% from the first quarter. We anticipate adding the second and third DDG 1000 ships to this backlog, either later this year or early next year, pending final contract negotiations with our customer.  In the second quarter, the group received funding for long-lead materials for these ships. 
Group sales will grow progressively through the second half, driven by the continued ramp to two-per-year Virginia class submarine production. Overall, sales should be up approximately 5% compared with last year, somewhat below my prior guidance. This change reflects continued weakness in the Commercial Shipbuilding business. 
We are, however, seeing renewed interest across the range of commercial shippers, including the dry cargo market, container ships and some tankers. Our excellent performance on the current five-ship product carrier program positions us to capitalize on a number of these contracts, most likely starting next year. 
Group margins for the year should be around the mid 9% range, consistent with my earlier guidance. Margins will decline as the year progresses, due to the surface combatant workload mix shift, which will escalate in the second half. Given the group's consistently excellent operating performance in managing for profitability, there may be some upside to my 9.5% margin guidance. 
Looking longer term, our shipyards are poised for slow, steady top line growth predicated on a healthy backlog and opportunities set. While the group faces a margin headwind in the near term, I see opportunity to expand margins, as surface combatant fixed price work builds, commercial shipbuilding opportunities materialize and two-per-year Virginia is realized.
IS&T. Our IS&T group had its highest ever revenue and earnings quarter. Sales were nearly $3 billion, up 12% over second quarter 2009 and 6.3% year-to-date. Sales growth was driven by continued demand for our ruggedized mobile computing and tactical communications products, an increased intelligence, IT and infrastructure support work. The group's second quarter operating earnings were $312 million, up 10% year-over-year and 7.6%, sequentially. Operating margins were 10.5%, in line with the first quarter and my expectation for this year.
Backlog for the group increased by over $300 million this quarter, as book to bill exceeded 1x again. Awards were particularly strong in our Tactical Communications and IT Services businesses. The businesses were also selected to compete on several large multiyear IDIQ contracts, which contributed to a 28% increase in our potential contract value. Many of these awards are detailed in our press release. 
IS&T's volume in the second half will exceed both last year's second half and this year's first half. Overall, I expect group sales to be up 8% to 9%, perhaps closer to the midpoint of that range. And margins will remain around 10.5%, both consistent with previous guidance.
Looking beyond 2010, IS&T's highly diverse portfolio positions the group to leverage its current capabilities to capture new business in fast-growing market segments. Tactical communications and battlefield management remain high customer spending priorities. 
Two weeks ago, many of our tactical communications products, including WIN-T and JTRS were part of a U.S. Army, Brigade Combat Team integration exercise that showcased their technical maturity and critical networking capabilities. As these programs transition to production over the next several years, they will enhance sales growth and margins. 
IT intelligence, infrastructure and healthcare support represents some of the other faster currents in the groups' marketplace. Sales growth will also be driven by the rapidly expanding cyber market, where IS&T has a very strong position with an array of government and commercial customers.
Aerospace. The Aerospace group's results were marked by excellent operational performance and new product development progress. Order intake was somewhat slower than anticipated, but year-to-date orders are in line with expectations. The group's second quarter sales were $1.38 billion, down modestly from last year's second quarter, due to fewer pre-owned aircraft sales at Gulfstream and less completions volume at Jet Aviation. The group's earnings were up 8.4%. Margins were 16.8%, a 160-basis-point improvement resulting from expanded Gulfstream volumes and margins, improved jet aviation completions margin and lower SG&A and R&D costs.
We continue to see signs of gradual improvement in the business jet market. Gulfstream flying hours are up. And we enjoyed a 16% improvement in the group's services sales versus last year's second quarter and a 7% improvement year-to-date. Additionally, market pre-owned aircraft levels continue to decline. At the end of the second quarter, Gulfstream had one pre-owned aircraft and inventory, and it is under contract. We anticipate receiving no more than three additional pre-owned aircraft before year end.
Customer interest in Gulfstream aircraft remains healthy, despite a slowdown in order intake in the second half of the quarter. Orders outpaced defaults by 3:1, while defaults were at their lowest level of this downturn. On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated book to bill was 0.6x. At $17.8 billion, our backlog includes nearly 200 G650 orders and approximately $6 billion in orders for our in-service aircraft. This is a very solid and sustaining backlog.
Orders in the quarter spanned the entirety of our product portfolio, with roughly 2/3 for the large-cabin aircraft and 1/3 for the mid cabins. Second quarter orders also reflected renewed interest in our North American markets, which were essentially dormant following last year's financial crisis and ensuing anti-business jet rhetoric. We also continue to see relative orders strength across several emerging markets including the Asia Pacific region, one of the strongest markets for business aviation and from for in particular. 
In addition to current backlog, we have a healthy pipeline of new opportunities, which we believe will translate to orders as the financial markets recover from a turbulent second quarter. Large cabin deliveries remain on track and will total 76 this year. As you may recall, Gulfstream completed a two-week furlough in July, which will result in fewer large cabin deliveries in the third quarter. The mid cabin business continue to show improvement in the second quarter and now exceeds my original expectations for 14 deliveries this year. I expect to deliver a total of 21 midsized jets this year, with some further upside if second half demands, nears what we've seen in the first half.
For the full year, I expect the group's sales to be up low to mid-single digits consistent with my prior guidance. Operating margins will be better than previously anticipated, probably in the mid-15% range with some upside. 
On the product development front, there are now three G250 aircraft and four G650 aircraft in flight test and 2011 FAA and EASA certification for both aircraft remain on track. As we look toward the next several years, the group will enjoy steady top line growth as we begin G650 deliveries in the second half of 2011, and the Services business continues to expand commensurate with the growing installed base. 
Our current order book and a healthy pipeline of potential new customer orders bode well for sustaining production of our G450 and G550 aircraft at or near current levels. The group's margins should continue to expand, driven in part by continued improvement of Jet Aviation and the transition to full rate production on our new aircraft models. We will continue to aggressively manage this business for profitability on the up as we did through the down.
In summary, General Dynamics executed well in the first half of 2010 and is well positioned for similar success in the second half. For the year, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $6.60 to $6.65, an increase from my prior guidance. 
Before concluding my remarks, I'd like to comment on today's dynamic business environment, particularly as it relates to our Defense businesses. Within this environment, the Pentagon's commitment to maintaining current force structure levels, which are sized to address the evolving threat environment, remains unchanged. While the post-9/11 world allows for little near-term defense budget reduction, pressures to manage discretionary spending will undoubtedly increase in the out years. 
I certainly appreciate the challenge the deficit-reduction emphasis represents for future defense spending. Over the past quarter, Secretary of Defense, Gates, and his senior leadership team have aggressively embarked upon a series of initiatives focused on making the Pentagon, a more cost-effective, efficient organization. Improving efficiency is particularly important to achieving the Pentagon's goal of preserving for structure, to appropriately organize, train and equip today's force to fight, weapons spending will have to show some growth in the years ahead. 
In a flat-budget environment, the Defense Department must extract savings from within its own budget to achieve this required growth. Having focused on achieving savings in the weapons accounts last year, the Pentagon now appears focused primarily on extracting overhead savings from operations and maintenance budget, the tail, to support investment account requirements, the tooth. 
The specifics of the Pentagon's efficiency initiatives are not yet evident, but what is clear, is that the environment is changing and that all stakeholders will have a role to play. I am personally involved with other CEOs in a cooperative dialogue to develop procedures that will achieve needed results while protecting the viability of the Defense industrial base. I'm encouraged that the Pentagon has engaged the industry as it embarks on shaping these measures. 
General Dynamics is already a very lean and efficient operator. We will continue to support our customer in pursuing even greater value for the defense dollar. Our Defense businesses have all experienced strong support in the ongoing 2011 budget deliberations. While there are several steps remaining before the 2011 budget, Defense bill becomes law, I remain confident that GD's core programs will receive solid Congressional support. 
General Dynamics is particularly well positioned to excel in this fast-changing environment. Low costs and quality production continue to enhance our competitiveness. Our streamlined business model limits overhead expense and empowers our business unit presidents to remain entrepreneurial and agile. 
And with that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?"

I'd like to start with a couple of notes on capital deployment in the second half of the year. We have $700 million of fixed rate notes that are still due to mature in August. we plan to satisfy that obligations with cash on hand. As a result, we'll see lower interest expense in the second half of the year, and we expect full year interest expense to be somewhere between $155 million and $160 million. We are also scheduled to make a voluntary contribution to our pension plans of approximately $270 million in September. 
I would like to also point out that we recently renewed our 364-day bank line, increasing it by about $200 million and extending the term to three years. This increases our commercial paper capacity to approximately $2 billion. The increased commercial paper capacity, along with the debt repayment in the third quarter, further bolsters our strong balance sheet and gives us capacity to execute on future opportunities.
Finally, an update on our expectations for our effective tax rate. I had previously guided you to a rate of 31.5% with some 20 to 30 basis points of exposure, meaning risk that the rate could be as high as 31.8%. Given our experience in the first half and what we see ahead of us for the remainder of the year, the rate is still looking like 31.5%, but with the opportunity to come in 20 to 30 basis points lower rather than higher. 
So that completes my remarks, and I'll turn it back to Amy to begin the Q&A. Amy?"

And you've captured it and I said it in my remarks, I mean, I'm very pleased with the performance at all three of our shipyards. The margins are representative of the excellence of those yards in doing what they do best. And really, the margin guidance that I'm giving is purely reflective of the mix shift, predominantly at Bath Iron Works. But also, somewhat, as we move block to block with Virginia Class, we're now into Block III, I think, as you know, and then also coming to the end of the product carrier line, if you will, at NASSCO. So what is all that mean? In the Bath instance, you know we're in the build on the first cost-plus DDG 1000. It's about, I think, like 17% complete, okay? No big surprises. We're pleased with what we've got. We like it a lot. We're in contract negotiations for the next two fixed-price 1001 and 1002 by hull number. And so that will work itself through. And so you'll see the DDG 1000 that's in the build becoming more of Bath's portfolio here as the year advances, and the DDG 51s, the mature fixed price, we know how to build these babies better than anybody. And you'll see all of that tailing down a little bit as the last two boats are in the build right now and the next one comes in, on the '11 budget, DDG 115 by hull number. Beyond that, the DDG 51s will arrive in some number. But it's just not parsed out in the budget beyond the '11 budget, as you well know. So the point of all that is you're going to see the margins come down as that cost-plus boat dominates, if you will, relatively speaking, Bath Iron Works. And then as we get into the fixed price, DDG 1000 and back into the fixed-price, DDG 51, you're going to see those margins go back up again. I would also then comment in terms Electric Boat, I mentioned the transition that we're still doing with Block IIs, and we're now starting Block IIIs. So the margins, I would expect, as we mature into Block III, I would expect, given that we continue to perform as a team, the way we perform right now, and going forward, we can enhance the margins in Virginia Class. And that's going to be, as you know, the major muscle mover for the Marine group. I would also add in terms of margin opportunity, the SSBN at Electric Boat, and I think you know, we're doing early engineering and development work on the SSBN Replacement, which is timelined into about a 2019 start to replace the Ohio Class SSBNs some years later. But that will also provide opportunity there. At the NASSCO side, you know that the T-AKE 14 in number will complete at the end of 2012. The product carrier's completed at the end of 2010. And that's why I changed the guidance, because the product carriers are going away. And that's a great margin opportunity that will tail out here very shortly. On the Navy side, we've got the MLP coming in on the '11 budget to enhance that side of it as the T-AKEs run out, if you will. And then on the Commercial side, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're very encouraged by the discussions we're having right now. The commercial market is coming back. And I believe that the time's up, the way we're thinking, we'll, you're going to see contracts here for 2011 in that market, okay? And I'd also comment at NASSCO as it applies to all shipyards, but the most relevant current example is at NASSCO. We manage those businesses for profitability, and we're very disciplined in so doing. We just let go close to 600 people at NASSCO, because the volume was not appropriate to keep them, and we'll continue to do that as necessary down and up, to make sure that we  maintain profitability.

I'm going to give you more of the tutorial than you asked for, okay, because this is the way I've got it stacked in my head. The forfeiture profits, liquidated damages, were not a margin driver for us, because it was as low as it's been since the downturn. So let's just take that off the table at the top. If you look at the margins year-over-year, okay, this time was better, positively impacted, because of the Aircraft Services volume improvement, which I talked to in my remarks, less pre-owned aircraft sales and frankly, those that did sell, sold at a modest profit versus the loss they sold at a year ago. And then the things you'd expect me to say, lower SG&A and then less, and this is R&D expenditure, because we have larger supplier payments in the quarter, okay? That's kind of the year-over-year up to the 16.8%. If you look at it sequentially against the first quarter of 2010, really the difference there is the R&D expenditure, okay? So that's the lift that they got there. Looking forward for the rest of the year, why am I not sticking my nose up in the 16s, like I think, you're implying in the question? And the answer is we had the two-week furlough at Gulfstream, the overhead absorption attached to that. I do expect the forfeiture profits, the liquidated damages or whatever, to continue to decline, okay, with fewer anticipated defaults in the second half. And I expect the R&D expenditures to increase. Normally, historically, I guess, you'd say, the R&D expenditure net is more weighted in our favor on the second half of the year, and this year, it was favored to the first half of the year. So anyway, I think those are probably the major margin factors I would have for you today."

If you add the IDIQs to that, it goes in excess of 1:1. So those two, okay, better than okay. On the Aerospace side -- well, on the Marine side, I think you used the word, but I'll use it again, that's the lumpiest of all in terms of how you add to the backlog. It comes in big slugs, and then it doesn't for a while, and then it comes in big slugs again. And what you're seeing right now, quite honestly is the impending, but not yet arrival of the number two or number three DDG 1000. That's really what you're seeing there. On Aerospace, look, it's $17.8 billion worth of backlog. Yes, it came down. But here's the way I look at it, and we look at it. If you take the 650 and give that, let's say, $12 billion of that $18 billion, put that aside, you got almost $6 billion of backlog on your in-production aircraft, largely in the large cabin. That's a very robust backlog. But here's the way I look at it. I look at it in terms of who's in there and how long will it take for you to get in entering the service with an airplane you want to buy today. And the answer to that, in terms of the 450 and the 550 is 18 to 24 months. And in our thinking, in my thinking, that's kind of the sweet spot. If that backlog, given the production rates we have, the fat backlog carries an 18-to-24-month delivery time with it, that backlog is sized appropriately. If it gets less than that, okay, then we got some sales work to do. If it's more than that, then the customer base waits too long for their airplane. So that's kind of where I am with that."

General Dynamics' second quarter performance was solid, delivering $8.1 billion in sales and record operating earnings of $985 million. This led to earnings per share of $1.68 on a fully diluted basis, $0.07 ahead of last year's second quarter and $0.14 ahead of last quarter. Operating margins in all four groups were very strong in the quarter, driving 12.2% company margins, 50 basis points better than last year's second quarter and 40 basis points better than last quarter.
Second quarter free cash flow after capital expenditures was $414 million, approximately 64% of earnings from continuing operations. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $564 million, relatively consistent with last year's performance. I expect strong cash generation in the second half. 
We deployed $190 million of cash in the quarter to make two acquisitions that complement our core Combat Systems and IS&T businesses. We also took advantage of market conditions to buy 5.5 million shares of GD common stock in the open market. 
Orders this quarter exceeded $7 billion, over $1 billion more than last year's second quarter with robust activity in the Combat Systems and Information Systems and Technology groups. At the end of the quarter, total backlog stood at $62.5 billion.
Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups. And first, let's talk about Combat Systems. Combat Systems second quarter was marked by excellent operational performance across the business. Sales volume totaled $2.1 billion, up from the first quarter, but down from the same period a year ago, due to less MRAP volume, the cancellation of FCS and Stryker timing. In the second half, we anticipate stronger MRAP and Stryker volume. 
Earnings were essentially flat when compared with last year's second quarter, despite the decline in sales, as margins expanded across the portfolio. The 150-basis-point margin improvement is the result of better program mix, with volume concentrated in more mature procurement programs and improved operating performance. Compared to last quarter, earnings grew nearly 10% to $295 million. 
Total backlog for Combat Systems decreased modestly to $12.8 billion in the quarter. Order activity outpaced sales at three of the four businesses, including European Land Systems, which had its strongest order activity since the second quarter of last year. 
Notable orders in the quarter included approximately $500 million for Stryker vehicles and Abrams tanks, $200 million for United Kingdom's Scout vehicle development work, $35 million for the development phase of the Canadian LAV upgrade program and nearly $300 million for Hydra rockets. We expect to book several additional large international orders this year. 
Looking forward for the group, sales in the remainder of the year will be higher than both year-to-date and last year's second half, with particular strength in the fourth quarter. That said, my overall assessment now shows sales in 2010 to be essentially flat to slightly below 2009. 
As I mentioned on the first quarter call, the growth originally projected in 2010 was influenced heavily by international work in the second half of the year. A confluence of factors, including the European sovereign debt crisis, prolonged contract negotiations and the decline in the euro has changed our international sales outlook for this year. 
The sovereign debt crisis has delayed the award of the Spanish 8x8 program until 2011. However, the Spanish government remains committed to this program, having stated publicly that it remains a top defense priority. 
Prolonged contract negotiations slowed the award of our Canadian LAV program, which will now transition to production in 2011 rather than this year. A several hundred million dollar FMS LAV Award will also push out until late this year or early next year. Additionally at current exchange rates, the decline in the euro would reduce sales by nearly $150 million by year and. This is translation rather than meaningful economic impact, and obviously could vary depending on where the euro settles relative to the dollar at year end.
Our U.S. Core business received some unanticipated awards in the first half to include 250 RG-31s, stronger than expected EXCEL awards and Stryker development work. These positives have been somewhat offset by delays in awards at our Weapons Systems business and some reduction in contract scope in other programs. Not withstanding the adjusted sales outlook for 2010, full year earnings will be consistent with my original expectations. Margins will be in the mid-13% range, up approximately 50 to 60 basis points from my prior guidance, due to the favorable mix mentioned earlier.
As we look to the future, Combat's portfolio is well positioned. Let me briefly review four key components of this group's business. First, U.S. vehicles, comprised just over 50% of 2009 Combat sales, obviously driven by the Stryker and Abrams programs, which are core to today's army and will remain so for years to come. Current backlog, continued vehicle enhancements and reset opportunities will sustain these two mature programs. 
We are also competing on an array of next-generation vehicle programs, including the Ground Combat Vehicle and the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, which could offer upside in the longer term. In the event that any of these developmental programs are delayed, we see continued opportunity for our current vehicles.
Secondly, U.S. weapons systems and ammunition. At approximately 1/3 of 2009 combat sales, they provide an array of critical systems and ammunition products to a wide range of U.S. and international customers. The core programs in these businesses remain well supported in the midterm, while new opportunities in precision munitions, armor, commercial axles, Denel and international ammunition bode well for the longer term. 
Thirdly, international FMS and export vehicles. We expect to grow substantially over the next four years as we begin delivering light-armored vehicles and tanks to a variety of Middle Eastern customers. We are currently working four contracts, totaling close to $4 billion, with deliveries between 2011 and 2014. Two of those contracts, worth nearly $2.5 billion for FMS LAVs and Iraqi tanks are now in backlog. The other two contracts for additional FMS LAVs and tanks could add $1.4 billion to backlog before year end. These FMS sales present a meaningful opportunity, around $800 million to $1 billion of volume per year between 2011 and 2014.
And finally, international indigenous vehicles. One of our key market discriminators here is that we are residents in many of the countries where we manufacture and sell vehicles, thus making our employees an important component of local GDP. There have been several recent positive developments in this business, including: solidifying the first complement of the Canadian LAV upgrade program, which when added to backlog next year, will contribute another $850 million to sales between 2011 and 2013; selection as the preferred supplier for a five-year $100 million deal to sustain Australia's armored fighting vehicle fleet; and finalizing a contract worth several hundred million dollars over the next three years to develop and deliver Scout Specialist Vehicles to the British Army. 
Clearly the sovereign debt crisis has added some uncertainty to our European business over the past quarter. In June, I visited our European businesses. And while their situation remains dynamic, it was clear that in spite of timelines moving to the right, our programs remain in high demand. No programs have been eliminated or taken off the table. 
National security remains an important spending priority, even when times are austere and our indigenous workforce provides an important economic engine in many of these economies. We are setting the international standard for the next generation of armored vehicles, and I feel confident in our opportunities to provide best-in-class vehicles at affordable prices for years to come.
In summary, the Combat Systems portfolio of products is well placed in today's fighting force and is complemented by a healthy set of near and long-term opportunities. These opportunities, combined with the current backlog, provide relative stability in our core Domestic businesses and growth in our international workload. This will result in attractive margins and cash flow for the next several years.
Marine Systems. Marine Systems group delivered another solid quarter. Revenues were up slightly, though earnings were consistent with last year's second quarter at $1.6 billion and $167 million, respectively. This is a particularly good performance as last year's results reflected 17% sales and 32% earnings growth. 
Sales in the quarter were up at Electric Boat and Bath Iron Works reflecting increased Virginia and DDG 1000 volume and expand an SSBN replacement design efforts. This growth was somewhat offset by a decline in NASSCO sales due to repair volume timing and the ramp down of the commercial product carrier program. 
Marines margins in the quarter were 10.2%, up 40 basis points from the first quarter. The Marine group's backlog totaled $21.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, down 3.6% from the first quarter. We anticipate adding the second and third DDG 1000 ships to this backlog, either later this year or early next year, pending final contract negotiations with our customer.  In the second quarter, the group received funding for long-lead materials for these ships. 
Group sales will grow progressively through the second half, driven by the continued ramp to two-per-year Virginia class submarine production. Overall, sales should be up approximately 5% compared with last year, somewhat below my prior guidance. This change reflects continued weakness in the Commercial Shipbuilding business. 
We are, however, seeing renewed interest across the range of commercial shippers, including the dry cargo market, container ships and some tankers. Our excellent performance on the current five-ship product carrier program positions us to capitalize on a number of these contracts, most likely starting next year. 
Group margins for the year should be around the mid 9% range, consistent with my earlier guidance. Margins will decline as the year progresses, due to the surface combatant workload mix shift, which will escalate in the second half. Given the group's consistently excellent operating performance in managing for profitability, there may be some upside to my 9.5% margin guidance. 
Looking longer term, our shipyards are poised for slow, steady top line growth predicated on a healthy backlog and opportunities set. While the group faces a margin headwind in the near term, I see opportunity to expand margins, as surface combatant fixed price work builds, commercial shipbuilding opportunities materialize and two-per-year Virginia is realized.
IS&T. Our IS&T group had its highest ever revenue and earnings quarter. Sales were nearly $3 billion, up 12% over second quarter 2009 and 6.3% year-to-date. Sales growth was driven by continued demand for our ruggedized mobile computing and tactical communications products, an increased intelligence, IT and infrastructure support work. The group's second quarter operating earnings were $312 million, up 10% year-over-year and 7.6%, sequentially. Operating margins were 10.5%, in line with the first quarter and my expectation for this year.
Backlog for the group increased by over $300 million this quarter, as book to bill exceeded 1x again. Awards were particularly strong in our Tactical Communications and IT Services businesses. The businesses were also selected to compete on several large multiyear IDIQ contracts, which contributed to a 28% increase in our potential contract value. Many of these awards are detailed in our press release. 
IS&T's volume in the second half will exceed both last year's second half and this year's first half. Overall, I expect group sales to be up 8% to 9%, perhaps closer to the midpoint of that range. And margins will remain around 10.5%, both consistent with previous guidance.
Looking beyond 2010, IS&T's highly diverse portfolio positions the group to leverage its current capabilities to capture new business in fast-growing market segments. Tactical communications and battlefield management remain high customer spending priorities. 
Two weeks ago, many of our tactical communications products, including WIN-T and JTRS were part of a U.S. Army, Brigade Combat Team integration exercise that showcased their technical maturity and critical networking capabilities. As these programs transition to production over the next several years, they will enhance sales growth and margins. 
IT intelligence, infrastructure and healthcare support represents some of the other faster currents in the groups' marketplace. Sales growth will also be driven by the rapidly expanding cyber market, where IS&T has a very strong position with an array of government and commercial customers.
Aerospace. The Aerospace group's results were marked by excellent operational performance and new product development progress. Order intake was somewhat slower than anticipated, but year-to-date orders are in line with expectations. The group's second quarter sales were $1.38 billion, down modestly from last year's second quarter, due to fewer pre-owned aircraft sales at Gulfstream and less completions volume at Jet Aviation. The group's earnings were up 8.4%. Margins were 16.8%, a 160-basis-point improvement resulting from expanded Gulfstream volumes and margins, improved jet aviation completions margin and lower SG&A and R&D costs.
We continue to see signs of gradual improvement in the business jet market. Gulfstream flying hours are up. And we enjoyed a 16% improvement in the group's services sales versus last year's second quarter and a 7% improvement year-to-date. Additionally, market pre-owned aircraft levels continue to decline. At the end of the second quarter, Gulfstream had one pre-owned aircraft and inventory, and it is under contract. We anticipate receiving no more than three additional pre-owned aircraft before year end.
Customer interest in Gulfstream aircraft remains healthy, despite a slowdown in order intake in the second half of the quarter. Orders outpaced defaults by 3:1, while defaults were at their lowest level of this downturn. On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated book to bill was 0.6x. At $17.8 billion, our backlog includes nearly 200 G650 orders and approximately $6 billion in orders for our in-service aircraft. This is a very solid and sustaining backlog.
Orders in the quarter spanned the entirety of our product portfolio, with roughly 2/3 for the large-cabin aircraft and 1/3 for the mid cabins. Second quarter orders also reflected renewed interest in our North American markets, which were essentially dormant following last year's financial crisis and ensuing anti-business jet rhetoric. We also continue to see relative orders strength across several emerging markets including the Asia Pacific region, one of the strongest markets for business aviation and from for in particular. 
In addition to current backlog, we have a healthy pipeline of new opportunities, which we believe will translate to orders as the financial markets recover from a turbulent second quarter. Large cabin deliveries remain on track and will total 76 this year. As you may recall, Gulfstream completed a two-week furlough in July, which will result in fewer large cabin deliveries in the third quarter. The mid cabin business continue to show improvement in the second quarter and now exceeds my original expectations for 14 deliveries this year. I expect to deliver a total of 21 midsized jets this year, with some further upside if second half demands, nears what we've seen in the first half.
For the full year, I expect the group's sales to be up low to mid-single digits consistent with my prior guidance. Operating margins will be better than previously anticipated, probably in the mid-15% range with some upside. 
On the product development front, there are now three G250 aircraft and four G650 aircraft in flight test and 2011 FAA and EASA certification for both aircraft remain on track. As we look toward the next several years, the group will enjoy steady top line growth as we begin G650 deliveries in the second half of 2011, and the Services business continues to expand commensurate with the growing installed base. 
Our current order book and a healthy pipeline of potential new customer orders bode well for sustaining production of our G450 and G550 aircraft at or near current levels. The group's margins should continue to expand, driven in part by continued improvement of Jet Aviation and the transition to full rate production on our new aircraft models. We will continue to aggressively manage this business for profitability on the up as we did through the down.
In summary, General Dynamics executed well in the first half of 2010 and is well positioned for similar success in the second half. For the year, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $6.60 to $6.65, an increase from my prior guidance. 
Before concluding my remarks, I'd like to comment on today's dynamic business environment, particularly as it relates to our Defense businesses. Within this environment, the Pentagon's commitment to maintaining current force structure levels, which are sized to address the evolving threat environment, remains unchanged. While the post-9/11 world allows for little near-term defense budget reduction, pressures to manage discretionary spending will undoubtedly increase in the out years. 
I certainly appreciate the challenge the deficit-reduction emphasis represents for future defense spending. Over the past quarter, Secretary of Defense, Gates, and his senior leadership team have aggressively embarked upon a series of initiatives focused on making the Pentagon, a more cost-effective, efficient organization. Improving efficiency is particularly important to achieving the Pentagon's goal of preserving for structure, to appropriately organize, train and equip today's force to fight, weapons spending will have to show some growth in the years ahead. 
In a flat-budget environment, the Defense Department must extract savings from within its own budget to achieve this required growth. Having focused on achieving savings in the weapons accounts last year, the Pentagon now appears focused primarily on extracting overhead savings from operations and maintenance budget, the tail, to support investment account requirements, the tooth. 
The specifics of the Pentagon's efficiency initiatives are not yet evident, but what is clear, is that the environment is changing and that all stakeholders will have a role to play. I am personally involved with other CEOs in a cooperative dialogue to develop procedures that will achieve needed results while protecting the viability of the Defense industrial base. I'm encouraged that the Pentagon has engaged the industry as it embarks on shaping these measures. 
General Dynamics is already a very lean and efficient operator. We will continue to support our customer in pursuing even greater value for the defense dollar. Our Defense businesses have all experienced strong support in the ongoing 2011 budget deliberations. While there are several steps remaining before the 2011 budget, Defense bill becomes law, I remain confident that GD's core programs will receive solid Congressional support. 
General Dynamics is particularly well positioned to excel in this fast-changing environment. Low costs and quality production continue to enhance our competitiveness. Our streamlined business model limits overhead expense and empowers our business unit presidents to remain entrepreneurial and agile. 
And with that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?"

We have $700 million of fixed rate notes that are still due to mature in August. We plan to satisfy that obligations with cash on hand. As a result, we'll see lower interest expense in the second half of the year, and we expect full year interest expense to be somewhere between $155 million and $160 million. We are also scheduled to make a voluntary contribution to our pension plans of approximately $270 million in September. 
I would like to also point out that we recently renewed our 364-day bank line, increasing it by about $200 million and extending the term to three years. This increases our commercial paper capacity to approximately $2 billion. The increased commercial paper capacity, along with the debt repayment in the third quarter, further bolsters our strong balance sheet and gives us capacity to execute on future opportunities.
Finally, an update on our expectations for our effective tax rate. I had previously guided you to a rate of 31.5% with some 20 to 30 basis points of exposure, meaning risk that the rate could be as high as 31.8%. Given our experience in the first half and what we see ahead of us for the remainder of the year, the rate is still looking like 31.5%, but with the opportunity to come in 20 to 30 basis points lower rather than higher. 
So that completes my remarks, and I'll turn it back to Amy to begin the Q&A. Amy?"

And you've captured it and I said it in my remarks, I mean, I'm very pleased with the performance at all three of our shipyards. The margins are representative of the excellence of those yards in doing what they do best. And really, the margin guidance that I'm giving is purely reflective of the mix shift, predominantly at Bath Iron Works. But also, somewhat, as we move block to block with Virginia Class, we're now into Block III, I think, as you know, and then also coming to the end of the product carrier line, if you will, at NASSCO. So what is all that mean? In the Bath instance, you know we're in the build on the first cost-plus DDG 1000. It's about, I think, like 17% complete, okay? No big surprises. We're pleased with what we've got. We like it a lot. We're in contract negotiations for the next two fixed-price 1001 and 1002 by hull number. And so that will work itself through. And so you'll see the DDG 1000 that's in the build becoming more of Bath's portfolio here as the year advances, and the DDG 51s, the mature fixed price, we know how to build these babies better than anybody. And you'll see all of that tailing down a little bit as the last two boats are in the build right now and the next one comes in, on the '11 budget, DDG 115 by hull number. Beyond that, the DDG 51s will arrive in some number. But it's just not parsed out in the budget beyond the '11 budget, as you well know. So the point of all that is you're going to see the margins come down as that cost-plus boat dominates, if you will, relatively speaking, Bath Iron Works. And then as we get into the fixed price, DDG 1000 and back into the fixed-price, DDG 51, you're going to see those margins go back up again. I would also then comment in terms Electric Boat, I mentioned the transition that we're still doing with Block IIs, and we're now starting Block IIIs. So the margins, I would expect, as we mature into Block III, I would expect, given that we continue to perform as a team, the way we perform right now, and going forward, we can enhance the margins in Virginia Class. And that's going to be, as you know, the major muscle mover for the Marine group. I would also add in terms of margin opportunity, the SSBN at Electric Boat, and I think you know, we're doing early engineering and development work on the SSBN Replacement, which is timelined into about a 2019 start to replace the Ohio Class SSBNs some years later. But that will also provide opportunity there. At the NASSCO side, you know that the T-AKE 14 in number will complete at the end of 2012. The product carrier's completed at the end of 2010. And that's why I changed the guidance, because the product carriers are going away. And that's a great margin opportunity that will tail out here very shortly. On the Navy side, we've got the MLP coming in on the '11 budget to enhance that side of it as the T-AKEs run out, if you will. And then on the Commercial side, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're very encouraged by the discussions we're having right now. The commercial market is coming back. And I believe that the time's up, the way we're thinking, we'll, you're going to see contracts here for 2011 in that market, okay? And I'd also comment at NASSCO as it applies to all shipyards, but the most relevant current example is at NASSCO. We manage those businesses for profitability, and we're very disciplined in so doing. We just let go close to 600 people at NASSCO, because the volume was not appropriate to keep them, and we'll continue to do that as necessary down and up, to make sure that we  maintain profitability. So that's probably more than you asked for. But that's kind of my Marine view."

I'm going to give you more of the tutorial than you asked for, okay, because this is the way I've got it stacked in my head. The forfeiture profits, liquidated damages, were not a margin driver for us, because it was as low as it's been since the downturn. So let's just take that off the table at the top. If you look at the margins year-over-year, okay, this time was better, positively impacted, because of the Aircraft Services volume improvement, which I talked to in my remarks, less pre-owned aircraft sales and frankly, those that did sell, sold at a modest profit versus the loss they sold at a year ago. And then the things you'd expect me to say, lower SG&A and then less, and this is R&D expenditure, because we have larger supplier payments in the quarter, okay? That's kind of the year-over-year up to the 16.8%. If you look at it sequentially against the first quarter of 2010, really the difference there is the R&D expenditure, okay? So that's the lift that they got there. Looking forward for the rest of the year, why am I not sticking my nose up in the 16s, like I think, you're implying in the question? And the answer is we had the two-week furlough at Gulfstream, the overhead absorption attached to that. I do expect the forfeiture profits, the liquidated damages or whatever, to continue to decline, okay, with fewer anticipated defaults in the second half. And I expect the R&D expenditures to increase. Normally, historically, I guess, you'd say, the R&D expenditure net is more weighted in our favor on the second half of the year, and this year, it was favored to the first half of the year. So anyway, I think those are probably the major margin factors I would have for you today."

I mentioned in my remarks that I was very pleased with the Combat Systems and IS&T growth and all that is true, better than 1:1 in IS&T and close to it in Combat. If you add the IDIQs to that, it goes in excess of 1:1. So those two, okay, better than okay. On the Aerospace side -- well, on the Marine side, I think you used the word, but I'll use it again, that's the lumpiest of all in terms of how you add to the backlog. It comes in big slugs, and then it doesn't for a while, and then it comes in big slugs again. And what you're seeing right now, quite honestly is the impending, but not yet arrival of the number two or number three DDG 1000. That's really what you're seeing there. On Aerospace, look, it's $17.8 billion worth of backlog. Yes, it came down. But here's the way I look at it, and we look at it. If you take the 650 and give that, let's say, $12 billion of that $18 billion, put that aside, you got almost $6 billion of backlog on your in-production aircraft, largely in the large cabin. That's a very robust backlog. But here's the way I look at it. I look at it in terms of who's in there and how long will it take for you to get in entering the service with an airplane you want to buy today. And the answer to that, in terms of the 450 and the 550 is 18 to 24 months. And in our thinking, in my thinking, that's kind of the sweet spot. If that backlog, given the production rates we have, the fat backlog carries an 18-to-24-month delivery time with it, that backlog is sized appropriately. If it gets less than that, okay, then we got some sales work to do. If it's more than that, then the customer base waits too long for their airplane. So that's kind of where I am with that."

We look at what we're engaged in and what environment we're operating in back to the entrepreneurial agility of my business unit Presidents.

General Dynamics' second quarter performance was solid, delivering $8.1 billion in sales and record operating earnings of $985 million. This led to earnings per share of $1.68 on a fully diluted basis, $0.07 ahead of last year's second quarter and $0.14 ahead of last quarter. Operating margins in all four groups were very strong in the quarter, driving 12.2% company margins, 50 basis points better than last year's second quarter and 40 basis points better than last quarter.
Second quarter free cash flow after capital expenditures was $414 million, approximately 64% of earnings from continuing operations. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $564 million, relatively consistent with last year's performance. I expect strong cash generation in the second half. 
We deployed $190 million of cash in the quarter to make two acquisitions that complement our core Combat Systems and IS&T businesses. We also took advantage of market conditions to buy 5.5 million shares of GD common stock in the open market. 
Orders this quarter exceeded $7 billion, over $1 billion more than last year's second quarter with robust activity in the Combat Systems and Information Systems and Technology groups. At the end of the quarter, total backlog stood at $62.5 billion.
Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups. And first, let's talk about Combat Systems. Combat Systems second quarter was marked by excellent operational performance across the business. Sales volume totaled $2.1 billion, up from the first quarter, but down from the same period a year ago, due to less MRAP volume, the cancellation of FCS and Stryker timing. In the second half, we anticipate stronger MRAP and Stryker volume. 
Earnings were essentially flat when compared with last year's second quarter, despite the decline in sales, as margins expanded across the portfolio. The 150-basis-point margin improvement is the result of better program mix, with volume concentrated in more mature procurement programs and improved operating performance. Compared to last quarter, earnings grew nearly 10% to $295 million. 
Total backlog for Combat Systems decreased modestly to $12.8 billion in the quarter. Order activity outpaced sales at three of the four businesses, including European Land Systems, which had its strongest order activity since the second quarter of last year. 
Notable orders in the quarter included approximately $500 million for Stryker vehicles and Abrams tanks, $200 million for United Kingdom's Scout vehicle development work, $35 million for the development phase of the Canadian LAV upgrade program and nearly $300 million for Hydra rockets. We expect to book several additional large international orders this year. 
Looking forward for the group, sales in the remainder of the year will be higher than both year-to-date and last year's second half, with particular strength in the fourth quarter. That said, my overall assessment now shows sales in 2010 to be essentially flat to slightly below 2009. 
As I mentioned on the first quarter call, the growth originally projected in 2010 was influenced heavily by international work in the second half of the year. A confluence of factors, including the European sovereign debt crisis, prolonged contract negotiations and the decline in the euro has changed our international sales outlook for this year. 
The sovereign debt crisis has delayed the award of the Spanish 8x8 program until 2011. However, the Spanish government remains committed to this program, having stated publicly that it remains a top defense priority. 
Prolonged contract negotiations slowed the award of our Canadian LAV program, which will now transition to production in 2011 rather than this year. A several hundred million dollar FMS LAV Award will also push out until late this year or early next year. Additionally at current exchange rates, the decline in the euro would reduce sales by nearly $150 million by year and. This is translation rather than meaningful economic impact, and obviously could vary depending on where the euro settles relative to the dollar at year end.
Our U.S. Core business received some unanticipated awards in the first half to include 250 RG-31s, stronger than expected EXCEL awards and Stryker development work. These positives have been somewhat offset by delays in awards at our Weapons Systems business and some reduction in contract scope in other programs. Not withstanding the adjusted sales outlook for 2010, full year earnings will be consistent with my original expectations. Margins will be in the mid-13% range, up approximately 50 to 60 basis points from my prior guidance, due to the favorable mix mentioned earlier.
As we look to the future, Combat's portfolio is well positioned. Let me briefly review four key components of this group's business. First, U.S. vehicles, comprised just over 50% of 2009 Combat sales, obviously driven by the Stryker and Abrams programs, which are core to today's army and will remain so for years to come. Current backlog, continued vehicle enhancements and reset opportunities will sustain these two mature programs. 
We are also competing on an array of next-generation vehicle programs, including the Ground Combat Vehicle and the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, which could offer upside in the longer term. In the event that any of these developmental programs are delayed, we see continued opportunity for our current vehicles.
Secondly, U.S. weapons systems and ammunition. At approximately 1/3 of 2009 combat sales, they provide an array of critical systems and ammunition products to a wide range of U.S. and international customers. The core programs in these businesses remain well supported in the midterm, while new opportunities in precision munitions, armor, commercial axles, Denel and international ammunition bode well for the longer term. 
Thirdly, international FMS and export vehicles. We expect to grow substantially over the next four years as we begin delivering light-armored vehicles and tanks to a variety of Middle Eastern customers. We are currently working four contracts, totaling close to $4 billion, with deliveries between 2011 and 2014. Two of those contracts, worth nearly $2.5 billion for FMS LAVs and Iraqi tanks are now in backlog. The other two contracts for additional FMS LAVs and tanks could add $1.4 billion to backlog before year end. These FMS sales present a meaningful opportunity, around $800 million to $1 billion of volume per year between 2011 and 2014.
And finally, international indigenous vehicles. One of our key market discriminators here is that we are residents in many of the countries where we manufacture and sell vehicles, thus making our employees an important component of local GDP. There have been several recent positive developments in this business, including: solidifying the first complement of the Canadian LAV upgrade program, which when added to backlog next year, will contribute another $850 million to sales between 2011 and 2013; selection as the preferred supplier for a five-year $100 million deal to sustain Australia's armored fighting vehicle fleet; and finalizing a contract worth several hundred million dollars over the next three years to develop and deliver Scout Specialist Vehicles to the British Army. 
Clearly the sovereign debt crisis has added some uncertainty to our European business over the past quarter. In June, I visited our European businesses. And while their situation remains dynamic, it was clear that in spite of timelines moving to the right, our programs remain in high demand. No programs have been eliminated or taken off the table. 
National security remains an important spending priority, even when times are austere and our indigenous workforce provides an important economic engine in many of these economies. We are setting the international standard for the next generation of armored vehicles, and I feel confident in our opportunities to provide best-in-class vehicles at affordable prices for years to come.
In summary, the Combat Systems portfolio of products is well placed in today's fighting force and is complemented by a healthy set of near and long-term opportunities. These opportunities, combined with the current backlog, provide relative stability in our core Domestic businesses and growth in our international workload. This will result in attractive margins and cash flow for the next several years.
Marine Systems. Marine Systems group delivered another solid quarter. Revenues were up slightly, though earnings were consistent with last year's second quarter at $1.6 billion and $167 million, respectively. This is a particularly good performance as last year's results reflected 17% sales and 32% earnings growth. 
Sales in the quarter were up at Electric Boat and Bath Iron Works reflecting increased Virginia and DDG 1000 volume and expand an SSBN replacement design efforts. This growth was somewhat offset by a decline in NASSCO sales due to repair volume timing and the ramp down of the commercial product carrier program. 
Marines margins in the quarter were 10.2%, up 40 basis points from the first quarter. The Marine group's backlog totaled $21.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, down 3.6% from the first quarter. We anticipate adding the second and third DDG 1000 ships to this backlog, either later this year or early next year, pending final contract negotiations with our customer.  In the second quarter, the group received funding for long-lead materials for these ships. 
Group sales will grow progressively through the second half, driven by the continued ramp to two-per-year Virginia class submarine production. Overall, sales should be up approximately 5% compared with last year, somewhat below my prior guidance. This change reflects continued weakness in the Commercial Shipbuilding business. 
We are, however, seeing renewed interest across the range of commercial shippers, including the dry cargo market, container ships and some tankers. Our excellent performance on the current five-ship product carrier program positions us to capitalize on a number of these contracts, most likely starting next year. 
Group margins for the year should be around the mid 9% range, consistent with my earlier guidance. Margins will decline as the year progresses, due to the surface combatant workload mix shift, which will escalate in the second half. Given the group's consistently excellent operating performance in managing for profitability, there may be some upside to my 9.5% margin guidance. 
Looking longer term, our shipyards are poised for slow, steady top line growth predicated on a healthy backlog and opportunities set. While the group faces a margin headwind in the near term, I see opportunity to expand margins, as surface combatant fixed price work builds, commercial shipbuilding opportunities materialize and two-per-year Virginia is realized.
IS&T. Our IS&T group had its highest ever revenue and earnings quarter. Sales were nearly $3 billion, up 12% over second quarter 2009 and 6.3% year-to-date. Sales growth was driven by continued demand for our ruggedized mobile computing and tactical communications products, an increased intelligence, IT and infrastructure support work. The group's second quarter operating earnings were $312 million, up 10% year-over-year and 7.6%, sequentially. Operating margins were 10.5%, in line with the first quarter and my expectation for this year.
Backlog for the group increased by over $300 million this quarter, as book to bill exceeded 1x again. Awards were particularly strong in our Tactical Communications and IT Services businesses. The businesses were also selected to compete on several large multiyear IDIQ contracts, which contributed to a 28% increase in our potential contract value. Many of these awards are detailed in our press release. 
IS&T's volume in the second half will exceed both last year's second half and this year's first half. Overall, I expect group sales to be up 8% to 9%, perhaps closer to the midpoint of that range. And margins will remain around 10.5%, both consistent with previous guidance.
Looking beyond 2010, IS&T's highly diverse portfolio positions the group to leverage its current capabilities to capture new business in fast-growing market segments. Tactical communications and battlefield management remain high customer spending priorities. 
Two weeks ago, many of our tactical communications products, including WIN-T and JTRS were part of a U.S. Army, Brigade Combat Team integration exercise that showcased their technical maturity and critical networking capabilities. As these programs transition to production over the next several years, they will enhance sales growth and margins. 
IT intelligence, infrastructure and healthcare support represents some of the other faster currents in the groups' marketplace. Sales growth will also be driven by the rapidly expanding cyber market, where IS&T has a very strong position with an array of government and commercial customers.
Aerospace. The Aerospace group's results were marked by excellent operational performance and new product development progress. Order intake was somewhat slower than anticipated, but year-to-date orders are in line with expectations. The group's second quarter sales were $1.38 billion, down modestly from last year's second quarter, due to fewer pre-owned aircraft sales at Gulfstream and less completions volume at Jet Aviation. The group's earnings were up 8.4%. Margins were 16.8%, a 160-basis-point improvement resulting from expanded Gulfstream volumes and margins, improved jet aviation completions margin and lower SG&A and R&D costs.
We continue to see signs of gradual improvement in the business jet market. Gulfstream flying hours are up. And we enjoyed a 16% improvement in the group's services sales versus last year's second quarter and a 7% improvement year-to-date. Additionally, market pre-owned aircraft levels continue to decline. At the end of the second quarter, Gulfstream had one pre-owned aircraft and inventory, and it is under contract. We anticipate receiving no more than three additional pre-owned aircraft before year end.
Customer interest in Gulfstream aircraft remains healthy, despite a slowdown in order intake in the second half of the quarter. Orders outpaced defaults by 3:1, while defaults were at their lowest level of this downturn. On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated book to bill was 0.6x. At $17.8 billion, our backlog includes nearly 200 G650 orders and approximately $6 billion in orders for our in-service aircraft. This is a very solid and sustaining backlog.
Orders in the quarter spanned the entirety of our product portfolio, with roughly 2/3 for the large-cabin aircraft and 1/3 for the mid cabins. Second quarter orders also reflected renewed interest in our North American markets, which were essentially dormant following last year's financial crisis and ensuing anti-business jet rhetoric. We also continue to see relative orders strength across several emerging markets including the Asia Pacific region, one of the strongest markets for business aviation and from for in particular. 
In addition to current backlog, we have a healthy pipeline of new opportunities, which we believe will translate to orders as the financial markets recover from a turbulent second quarter. Large cabin deliveries remain on track and will total 76 this year. As you may recall, Gulfstream completed a two-week furlough in July, which will result in fewer large cabin deliveries in the third quarter. The mid cabin business continue to show improvement in the second quarter and now exceeds my original expectations for 14 deliveries this year. I expect to deliver a total of 21 midsized jets this year, with some further upside if second half demands, nears what we've seen in the first half.
For the full year, I expect the group's sales to be up low to mid-single digits consistent with my prior guidance. Operating margins will be better than previously anticipated, probably in the mid-15% range with some upside. 
On the product development front, there are now three G250 aircraft and four G650 aircraft in flight test and 2011 FAA and EASA certification for both aircraft remain on track. As we look toward the next several years, the group will enjoy steady top line growth as we begin G650 deliveries in the second half of 2011, and the Services business continues to expand commensurate with the growing installed base. 
Our current order book and a healthy pipeline of potential new customer orders bode well for sustaining production of our G450 and G550 aircraft at or near current levels. The group's margins should continue to expand, driven in part by continued improvement of Jet Aviation and the transition to full rate production on our new aircraft models. We will continue to aggressively manage this business for profitability on the up as we did through the down.
In summary, General Dynamics executed well in the first half of 2010 and is well positioned for similar success in the second half. For the year, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $6.60 to $6.65, an increase from my prior guidance. 
Before concluding my remarks, I'd like to comment on today's dynamic business environment, particularly as it relates to our Defense businesses. Within this environment, the Pentagon's commitment to maintaining current force structure levels, which are sized to address the evolving threat environment, remains unchanged. While the post-9/11 world allows for little near-term defense budget reduction, pressures to manage discretionary spending will undoubtedly increase in the out years. 
I certainly appreciate the challenge the deficit-reduction emphasis represents for future defense spending. Over the past quarter, Secretary of Defense, Gates, and his senior leadership team have aggressively embarked upon a series of initiatives focused on making the Pentagon, a more cost-effective, efficient organization. Improving efficiency is particularly important to achieving the Pentagon's goal of preserving for structure, to appropriately organize, train and equip today's force to fight, weapons spending will have to show some growth in the years ahead. 
In a flat-budget environment, the Defense Department must extract savings from within its own budget to achieve this required growth. Having focused on achieving savings in the weapons accounts last year, the Pentagon now appears focused primarily on extracting overhead savings from operations and maintenance budget, the tail, to support investment account requirements, the tooth. 
The specifics of the Pentagon's efficiency initiatives are not yet evident, but what is clear, is that the environment is changing and that all stakeholders will have a role to play. I am personally involved with other CEOs in a cooperative dialogue to develop procedures that will achieve needed results while protecting the viability of the Defense industrial base. I'm encouraged that the Pentagon has engaged the industry as it embarks on shaping these measures. 
General Dynamics is already a very lean and efficient operator. We will continue to support our customer in pursuing even greater value for the defense dollar. Our Defense businesses have all experienced strong support in the ongoing 2011 budget deliberations. While there are several steps remaining before the 2011 budget, Defense bill becomes law, I remain confident that GD's core programs will receive solid Congressional support. 
General Dynamics is particularly well positioned to excel in this fast-changing environment. Low costs and quality production continue to enhance our competitiveness. Our streamlined business model limits overhead expense and empowers our business unit presidents to remain entrepreneurial and agile. 
And with that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?"

We have $700 million of fixed rate notes that are still due to mature in August. We plan to satisfy that obligations with cash on hand. As a result, we'll see lower interest expense in the second half of the year, and we expect full year interest expense to be somewhere between $155 million and $160 million. We are also scheduled to make a voluntary contribution to our pension plans of approximately $270 million in September. 
I would like to also point out that we recently renewed our 364-day bank line, increasing it by about $200 million and extending the term to three years. This increases our commercial paper capacity to approximately $2 billion. The increased commercial paper capacity, along with the debt repayment in the third quarter, further bolsters our strong balance sheet and gives us capacity to execute on future opportunities.
Finally, an update on our expectations for our effective tax rate. I had previously guided you to a rate of 31.5% with some 20 to 30 basis points of exposure, meaning risk that the rate could be as high as 31.8%. Given our experience in the first half and what we see ahead of us for the remainder of the year, the rate is still looking like 31.5%, but with the opportunity to come in 20 to 30 basis points lower rather than higher. 
So that completes my remarks, and I'll turn it back to Amy to begin the Q&A. Amy?"

And you've captured it and I said it in my remarks, I mean, I'm very pleased with the performance at all three of our shipyards. The margins are representative of the excellence of those yards in doing what they do best. And really, the margin guidance that I'm giving is purely reflective of the mix shift, predominantly at Bath Iron Works. But also, somewhat, as we move block to block with Virginia Class, we're now into Block III, I think, as you know, and then also coming to the end of the product carrier line, if you will, at NASSCO. So what does all that mean? In the Bath instance, you know we're in the build on the first cost-plus DDG 1000. It's about, I think, like 17% complete, okay? No big surprises. We're pleased with what we've got. We like it a lot. We're in contract negotiations for the next two fixed-price 1001 and 1002 by hull number. And so that will work itself through. And so you'll see the DDG 1000 that's in the build becoming more of Bath's portfolio here as the year advances, and the DDG 51s, the mature fixed price, we know how to build these babies better than anybody. And you'll see all of that tailing down a little bit as the last two boats are in the build right now and the next one comes in, on the '11 budget, DDG 115 by hull number. Beyond that, the DDG 51s will arrive in some number. But it's just not parsed out in the budget beyond the '11 budget, as you well know. So the point of all that is you're going to see the margins come down as that cost-plus boat dominates, if you will, relatively speaking, Bath Iron Works. And then as we get into the fixed price, DDG 1000s and back into the fixed-price, DDG 51s, you're going to see those margins go back up again. I would also then comment in terms of Electric Boat, I mentioned the transition that we're still doing with Block IIs, and we're now starting Block IIIs. So the margins, I would expect, as we mature into Block III, I would expect, given that we continue to perform as a team, the way we perform right now, and going forward, we can enhance the margins in Virginia Class. And that's going to be, as you know, the major muscle mover for the Marine group. I would also add in terms of margin opportunity, the SSBN at Electric Boat, and I think you know, we're doing early engineering and development work on the SSBN Replacement, which is timelined into about a 2019 start to replace the Ohio Class SSBNs some years later. But that will also provide opportunity there. At the NASSCO side, you know that the T-AKE 14 in number will complete at the end of 2012. The product carrier's completed at the end of 2010. And that's why I changed the guidance, because the product carriers are going away. And that's a great margin opportunity that will tail out here very shortly. On the Navy side, we've got the MLP coming in on the '11 budget to enhance that side of it as the T-AKEs run out, if you will. And then on the Commercial side, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're very encouraged by the discussions we're having right now. The commercial market is coming back. And I believe that the time's up, the way we think it will, you're going to see contracts here for 2011 in that market, okay? And I'd also comment at NASSCO as it applies to all shipyards, but the most relevant current example is at NASSCO. We manage those businesses for profitability, and we're very disciplined in so doing. We just let go close to 600 people at NASSCO, because the volume was not appropriate to keep them, and we'll continue to do that as necessary, down and up, to make sure that we  maintain profitability. So that's probably more than you asked for. But that's kind of my Marine view."

I'm going to give you more of the tutorial than you asked for, okay? Because this is the way I've got it stacked in my head. The forfeiture profits, liquidated damages, were not a margin driver for us, because it was as low as it's been since the downturn. So let's just take that off the table at the top. If you look at the margins year-over-year, okay, this time was better, positively impacted, because of the Aircraft Services volume improvement, which I talked to in my remarks, less pre-owned aircraft sales and frankly, those that did sell, sold at a modest profit versus the loss they sold at a year ago. And then the things you'd expect me to say, lower SG&A and then less, unless this is R&D expenditure, because we have larger supplier payments in the quarter, okay? That's kind of the year-over-year up to the 16.8%. If you look at it sequentially against the first quarter of 2010, really the difference there is the R&D expenditure, okay? So that's the lift that they got there. Looking forward for the rest of the year, why am I not sticking my nose up in the 16s, like I think, you're implying in the question? And the answer is we had the two-week furlough at Gulfstream, the overhead absorption attached to that. I do expect the forfeiture profits, the liquidated damages or whatever, to continue to decline, okay, with fewer anticipated defaults in the second half. And I expect the R&D expenditures to increase. Normally, historically, I guess, you'd say, the R&D expenditure net is more weighted in our favor on the second half of the year, and this year, it was favored to the first half of the year. So anyway, I think those are probably the major margin factors I would have for you today."

I mentioned in my remarks that I was very pleased with the Combat Systems and IS&T growth and all that is true, better than 1:1 in IS&T and close to it in Combat. If you add the IDIQs to that, it goes in excess of 1:1. So those two, okay, better than okay. On the Aerospace side -- well, on the Marine side, I think you used the word, but I'll use it again, that's the lumpiest of all in terms of how you add to the backlog. It comes in big slugs, and then it doesn't for a while, and then it comes in big slugs again. And what you're seeing right now, quite honestly is the impending, but not yet arrival of the number two or number three DDG 1000. That's really what you're seeing there. On Aerospace, look, it's $17.8 billion worth of backlog. Yes, it came down. But here's the way I look at it, and we look at it. If you take the 650 and give that, let's say, $12 billion of that $18 billion, put that aside, you got almost $6 billion in backlog in your in-production aircraft, largely in the large cabin. That's a very robust backlog. But here's the way I look at it. I look at it in terms of who's in there and how long will it take for you to get in entering the service with an airplane you want to buy today. And the answer to that, in terms of the 450 and the 550 is 18 to 24 months. And in our thinking, in my thinking, that's kind of the sweet spot. If that backlog, given the production rates we have, the fat backlog carries an 18-to-24-month delivery time with it, that backlog is sized appropriately. If it gets less than that, okay, then we got some sales work to do. If it's more than that, then the customer base waits too long for their airplane. So that's kind of where I am with that."

We look at what we're engaged in and what environment we're operating in back to the entrepreneurial agility of my business unit Presidents. They're looking, all the time, to see how they can enhance the portfolio we have in ensuring its relevance, and also looking at adjacencies that may give us more opportunity, or quite frankly, also looking in new areas or harvesting things that are in our portfolio that aren't appropriate for us anymore that might do someone else, something better.

274561,78966669,70226,"General Dynamics Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-28-2010",2010-07-28,"Earnings Calls","General Dynamics Corporation","Executives","  Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics' second quarter performance was solid, delivering $8.1 billion in sales and record operating earnings of $985 million. This led to earnings per share of $1.68 on a fully diluted basis, $0.07 a",3104,"  Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics' second quarter performance was solid, delivering $8.1 billion in sales and record operating earnings of $985 million. This led to earnings per share of $1.68 on a fully diluted basis, $0.07 ahead of last year's second quarter and $0.14 ahead of last quarter. Operating margins in all four groups were very strong in the quarter, driving 12.2% company margins, 50 basis points better than last year's second quarter and 40 basis points better than last quarter.
  Second quarter free cash flow after capital expenditures was $414 million, approximately 64% of earnings from continuing operations. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $564 million, relatively consistent with last year's performance. I expect strong cash generation in the second half. 
  We deployed $190 million of cash in the quarter to make two acquisitions that complement our core Combat Systems and IS&T businesses. We also took advantage of market conditions to buy 5.5 million shares of GD common stock in the open market. 
  Orders this quarter exceeded $7 billion, over $1 billion more than last year's second quarter with robust activity in the Combat Systems and Information Systems and Technology groups. At the end of the quarter, total backlog stood at $62.5 billion.
  Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups. And first, let's talk about Combat Systems. Combat Systems second quarter was marked by excellent operational performance across the business. Sales volume totaled $2.1 billion, up from the first quarter, but down from the same period a year ago, due to less MRAP volume, the cancellation of FCS and Stryker timing. In the second half, we anticipate stronger MRAP and Stryker volume. 
  Earnings were essentially flat when compared with last year's second quarter, despite the decline in sales, as margins expanded across the portfolio. The 150-basis-point margin improvement is the result of better program mix, with volume concentrated in more mature procurement programs and improved operating performance. Compared to last quarter, earnings grew nearly 10% to $295 million. 
  Total backlog for Combat Systems decreased modestly to $12.8 billion in the quarter. Order activity outpaced sales at three of the four businesses, including European Land Systems, which had its strongest order activity since the second quarter of last year. 
  Notable orders in the quarter included approximately $500 million for Stryker vehicles and Abrams tanks, $200 million for United Kingdom's Scout vehicle development work, $35 million for the development phase of the Canadian LAV upgrade program and nearly $300 million for Hydra rockets. We expect to book several additional large international orders this year. 
  Looking forward for the group, sales in the remainder of the year will be higher than both year-to-date and last year's second half, with particular strength in the fourth quarter. That said, my overall assessment now shows sales in 2010 to be essentially flat to slightly below 2009. 
  As I mentioned on the first quarter call, the growth originally projected in 2010 was influenced heavily by international work in the second half of the year. A confluence of factors, including the European sovereign debt crisis, prolonged contract negotiations and the decline in the euro has changed our international sales outlook for this year. 
  The sovereign debt crisis has delayed the award of the Spanish 8x8 program until 2011. However, the Spanish government remains committed to this program, having stated publicly that it remains a top defense priority. 
  Prolonged contract negotiations slowed the award of our Canadian LAV program, which will now transition to production in 2011 rather than this year. A several hundred million dollar FMS LAV Award will also push out until late this year or early next year. Additionally at current exchange rates, the decline in the euro would reduce sales by nearly $150 million by year and. This is translation rather than meaningful economic impact, and obviously could vary depending on where the euro settles relative to the dollar at year end.
  Our U.S. Core business received some unanticipated awards in the first half to include 250 RG-31s, stronger than expected EXCEL awards and Stryker development work. These positives have been somewhat offset by delays in awards at our Weapons Systems business and some reduction in contract scope in other programs. Not withstanding the adjusted sales outlook for 2010, full year earnings will be consistent with my original expectations. Margins will be in the mid-13% range, up approximately 50 to 60 basis points from my prior guidance, due to the favorable mix mentioned earlier.
  As we look to the future, Combat's portfolio is well positioned. Let me briefly review four key components of this group's business. First, U.S. vehicles, comprised just over 50% of 2009 Combat sales, obviously driven by the Stryker and Abrams programs, which are core to today's army and will remain so for years to come. Current backlog, continued vehicle enhancements and reset opportunities will sustain these two mature programs. 
  We are also competing on an array of next-generation vehicle programs, including the Ground Combat Vehicle and the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, which could offer upside in the longer term. In the event that any of these developmental programs are delayed, we see continued opportunity for our current vehicles.
  Secondly, U.S. weapons systems and ammunition. At approximately 1/3 of 2009 combat sales, they provide an array of critical systems and ammunition products to a wide range of U.S. and international customers. The core programs in these businesses remain well supported in the midterm, while new opportunities in precision munitions, armor, commercial axles, Denel and international ammunition bode well for the longer term. 
  Thirdly, international FMS and export vehicles. We expect to grow substantially over the next four years as we begin delivering light-armored vehicles and tanks to a variety of Middle Eastern customers. We are currently working four contracts, totaling close to $4 billion, with deliveries between 2011 and 2014. Two of those contracts, worth nearly $2.5 billion for FMS LAVs and Iraqi tanks are now in backlog. The other two contracts for additional FMS LAVs and tanks could add $1.4 billion to backlog before year end. These FMS sales present a meaningful opportunity, around $800 million to $1 billion of volume per year between 2011 and 2014.
  And finally, international indigenous vehicles. One of our key market discriminators here is that we are residents in many of the countries where we manufacture and sell vehicles, thus making our employees an important component of local GDP. There have been several recent positive developments in this business, including: solidifying the first complement of the Canadian LAV upgrade program, which when added to backlog next year, will contribute another $850 million to sales between 2011 and 2013; selection as the preferred supplier for a five-year $100 million deal to sustain Australia's armored fighting vehicle fleet; and finalizing a contract worth several hundred million dollars over the next three years to develop and deliver Scout Specialist Vehicles to the British Army. 
  Clearly the sovereign debt crisis has added some uncertainty to our European business over the past quarter. In June, I visited our European businesses. And while their situation remains dynamic, it was clear that in spite of timelines moving to the right, our programs remain in high demand. No programs have been eliminated or taken off the table. 
  National security remains an important spending priority, even when times are austere and our indigenous workforce provides an important economic engine in many of these economies. We are setting the international standard for the next generation of armored vehicles, and I feel confident in our opportunities to provide best-in-class vehicles at affordable prices for years to come.
  In summary, the Combat Systems portfolio of products is well placed in today's fighting force and is complemented by a healthy set of near and long-term opportunities. These opportunities, combined with the current backlog, provide relative stability in our core Domestic businesses and growth in our international workload. This will result in attractive margins and cash flow for the next several years.
  Marine Systems. Marine Systems group delivered another solid quarter. Revenues were up slightly, though earnings were consistent with last year's second quarter at $1.6 billion and $167 million, respectively. This is a particularly good performance as last year's results reflected 17% sales and 32% earnings growth. 
  Sales in the quarter were up at Electric Boat and Bath Iron Works reflecting increased Virginia and DDG 1000 volume and expand an SSBN replacement design efforts. This growth was somewhat offset by a decline in NASSCO sales due to repair volume timing and the ramp down of the commercial product carrier program. 
  Marines margins in the quarter were 10.2%, up 40 basis points from the first quarter. The Marine group's backlog totaled $21.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, down 3.6% from the first quarter. We anticipate adding the second and third DDG 1000 ships to this backlog, either later this year or early next year, pending final contract negotiations with our customer. In the second quarter, the group received funding for long-lead materials for these ships. 
  Group sales will grow progressively through the second half, driven by the continued ramp to two-per-year Virginia class submarine production. Overall, sales should be up approximately 5% compared with last year, somewhat below my prior guidance. This change reflects continued weakness in the Commercial Shipbuilding business. 
  We are, however, seeing renewed interest across the range of commercial shippers, including the dry cargo market, container ships and some tankers. Our excellent performance on the current five-ship product carrier program positions us to capitalize on a number of these contracts, most likely starting next year. 
  Group margins for the year should be around the mid 9% range, consistent with my earlier guidance. Margins will decline as the year progresses, due to the surface combatant workload mix shift, which will escalate in the second half. Given the group's consistently excellent operating performance in managing for profitability, there may be some upside to my 9.5% margin guidance. 
  Looking longer term, our shipyards are poised for slow, steady top line growth predicated on a healthy backlog and opportunities set. While the group faces a margin headwind in the near term, I see opportunity to expand margins, as surface combatant fixed price work builds, commercial shipbuilding opportunities materialize and two-per-year Virginia is realized.
  IS&T. Our IS&T group had its highest ever revenue and earnings quarter. Sales were nearly $3 billion, up 12% over second quarter 2009 and 6.3% year-to-date. Sales growth was driven by continued demand for our ruggedized mobile computing and tactical communications products, an increased intelligence, IT and infrastructure support work. The group's second quarter operating earnings were $312 million, up 10% year-over-year and 7.6%, sequentially. Operating margins were 10.5%, in line with the first quarter and my expectation for this year.
  Backlog for the group increased by over $300 million this quarter, as book to bill exceeded 1x again. Awards were particularly strong in our Tactical Communications and IT Services businesses. The businesses were also selected to compete on several large multiyear IDIQ contracts, which contributed to a 28% increase in our potential contract value. Many of these awards are detailed in our press release. 
  IS&T's volume in the second half will exceed both last year's second half and this year's first half. Overall, I expect group sales to be up 8% to 9%, perhaps closer to the midpoint of that range. And margins will remain around 10.5%, both consistent with previous guidance.
  Looking beyond 2010, IS&T's highly diverse portfolio positions the group to leverage its current capabilities to capture new business in fast-growing market segments. Tactical communications and battlefield management remain high customer spending priorities. 
  Two weeks ago, many of our tactical communications products, including WIN-T and JTRS were part of a U.S. Army, Brigade Combat Team integration exercise that showcased their technical maturity and critical networking capabilities. As these programs transition to production over the next several years, they will enhance sales growth and margins. 
  IT intelligence, infrastructure and healthcare support represents some of the other faster currents in the groups' marketplace. Sales growth will also be driven by the rapidly expanding cyber market, where IS&T has a very strong position with an array of government and commercial customers.
  Aerospace. The Aerospace group's results were marked by excellent operational performance and new product development progress. Order intake was somewhat slower than anticipated, but year-to-date orders are in line with expectations. The group's second quarter sales were $1.38 billion, down modestly from last year's second quarter, due to fewer pre-owned aircraft sales at Gulfstream and less completions volume at Jet Aviation. The group's earnings were up 8.4%. Margins were 16.8%, a 160-basis-point improvement resulting from expanded Gulfstream volumes and margins, improved jet aviation completions margin and lower SG&A and R&D costs.
  We continue to see signs of gradual improvement in the business jet market. Gulfstream flying hours are up. And we enjoyed a 16% improvement in the group's services sales versus last year's second quarter and a 7% improvement year-to-date. Additionally, market pre-owned aircraft levels continue to decline. At the end of the second quarter, Gulfstream had one pre-owned aircraft and inventory, and it is under contract. We anticipate receiving no more than three additional pre-owned aircraft before year end.
  Customer interest in Gulfstream aircraft remains healthy, despite a slowdown in order intake in the second half of the quarter. Orders outpaced defaults by 3:1, while defaults were at their lowest level of this downturn. On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated book to bill was 0.6x. At $17.8 billion, our backlog includes nearly 200 G650 orders and approximately $6 billion in orders for our in-service aircraft. This is a very solid and sustaining backlog.
  Orders in the quarter spanned the entirety of our product portfolio, with roughly 2/3 for the large-cabin aircraft and 1/3 for the mid cabins. Second quarter orders also reflected renewed interest in our North American markets, which were essentially dormant following last year's financial crisis and ensuing anti-business jet rhetoric. We also continue to see relative orders strength across several emerging markets including the Asia Pacific region, one of the strongest markets for business aviation and from for in particular. 
  In addition to current backlog, we have a healthy pipeline of new opportunities, which we believe will translate to orders as the financial markets recover from a turbulent second quarter. Large cabin deliveries remain on track and will total 76 this year. As you may recall, Gulfstream completed a two-week furlough in July, which will result in fewer large cabin deliveries in the third quarter. The mid cabin business continue to show improvement in the second quarter and now exceeds my original expectations for 14 deliveries this year. I expect to deliver a total of 21 midsized jets this year, with some further upside if second half demands, nears what we've seen in the first half.
  For the full year, I expect the group's sales to be up low to mid-single digits consistent with my prior guidance. Operating margins will be better than previously anticipated, probably in the mid-15% range with some upside. 
  On the product development front, there are now three G250 aircraft and four G650 aircraft in flight test and 2011 FAA and EASA certification for both aircraft remain on track. As we look toward the next several years, the group will enjoy steady top line growth as we begin G650 deliveries in the second half of 2011, and the Services business continues to expand commensurate with the growing installed base. 
  Our current order book and a healthy pipeline of potential new customer orders bode well for sustaining production of our G450 and G550 aircraft at or near current levels. The group's margins should continue to expand, driven in part by continued improvement of Jet Aviation and the transition to full rate production on our new aircraft models. We will continue to aggressively manage this business for profitability on the up as we did through the down.
  In summary, General Dynamics executed well in the first half of 2010 and is well positioned for similar success in the second half. For the year, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $6.60 to $6.65, an increase from my prior guidance. 
  Before concluding my remarks, I'd like to comment on today's dynamic business environment, particularly as it relates to our Defense businesses. Within this environment, the Pentagon's commitment to maintaining current force structure levels, which are sized to address the evolving threat environment, remains unchanged. While the post-9/11 world allows for little near-term defense budget reduction, pressures to manage discretionary spending will undoubtedly increase in the out years. 
  I certainly appreciate the challenge the deficit-reduction emphasis represents for future defense spending. Over the past quarter, Secretary of Defense, Gates, and his senior leadership team have aggressively embarked upon a series of initiatives focused on making the Pentagon, a more cost-effective, efficient organization. Improving efficiency is particularly important to achieving the Pentagon's goal of preserving for structure, to appropriately organize, train and equip today's force to fight, weapons spending will have to show some growth in the years ahead. 
  In a flat-budget environment, the Defense Department must extract savings from within its own budget to achieve this required growth. Having focused on achieving savings in the weapons accounts last year, the Pentagon now appears focused primarily on extracting overhead savings from operations and maintenance budget, the tail, to support investment account requirements, the tooth. 
  The specifics of the Pentagon's efficiency initiatives are not yet evident, but what is clear, is that the environment is changing and that all stakeholders will have a role to play. I am personally involved with other CEOs in a cooperative dialogue to develop procedures that will achieve needed results while protecting the viability of the Defense industrial base. I'm encouraged that the Pentagon has engaged the industry as it embarks on shaping these measures. 
  General Dynamics is already a very lean and efficient operator. We will continue to support our customer in pursuing even greater value for the defense dollar. Our Defense businesses have all experienced strong support in the ongoing 2011 budget deliberations. While there are several steps remaining before the 2011 budget, Defense bill becomes law, I remain confident that GD's core programs will receive solid Congressional support. 
  General Dynamics is particularly well positioned to excel in this fast-changing environment. Low costs and quality production continue to enhance our competitiveness. Our streamlined business model limits overhead expense and empowers our business unit presidents to remain entrepreneurial and agile. 
  And with that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?

We have $700 million of fixed rate notes that are still due to mature in August. We plan to satisfy that obligations with cash on hand. As a result, we'll see lower interest expense in the second half of the year, and we expect full year interest expense to be somewhere between $155 million and $160 million. We are also scheduled to make a voluntary contribution to our pension plans of approximately $270 million in September. 
  I would like to also point out that we recently renewed our 364-day bank line, increasing it by about $200 million and extending the term to three years. This increases our commercial paper capacity to approximately $2 billion. The increased commercial paper capacity, along with the debt repayment in the third quarter, further bolsters our strong balance sheet and gives us capacity to execute on future opportunities.
  Finally, an update on our expectations for our effective tax rate. I had previously guided you to a rate of 31.5% with some 20 to 30 basis points of exposure, meaning risk that the rate could be as high as 31.8%. Given our experience in the first half and what we see ahead of us for the remainder of the year, the rate is still looking like 31.5%, but with the opportunity to come in 20 to 30 basis points lower rather than higher. 
  So that completes my remarks, and I'll turn it back to Amy to begin the Q&A. Amy?

I mentioned in my remarks about going to see our European businesses. I did that on the European Land Systems side. And I also went to Basel and Zürich, and spent some time with Jet and went through some of the completion aircraft, et cetera. So I would report that steady progress has been made. We have indeed worked very hard on the front end processes for our Completions business and it's taking the desired and necessary effect. The other remark I'd make, and you know this, Carter and Joe, but when you step into something like these wide-body, narrow-body completions, it's not a two-month deal. These projects go for a long time, years in many cases. So working through that inventory, the legacy inventory and getting them back in the air and return to their customers in good shape has been an ongoing evolution, and in fact, it still goes on. But I would tell you that they've definitely turned a corner. And the future looks very bright in the Completions business, both skyline-wise and how we execute on that skyline.

And you've captured it and I said it in my remarks, I mean, I'm very pleased with the performance at all three of our shipyards. The margins are representative of the excellence of those yards in doing what they do best. And really, the margin guidance that I'm giving is purely reflective of the mix shift, predominantly at Bath Iron Works. But also, somewhat, as we move block to block with Virginia Class, we're now into Block III, I think, as you know, and then also coming to the end of the product carrier line, if you will, at NASSCO. So what does all that mean? In the Bath instance, you know we're in the build on the first cost-plus DDG 1000. It's about, I think, like 17% complete, okay? No big surprises. We're pleased with what we've got. We like it a lot. We're in contract negotiations for the next two fixed-price 1001 and 1002 by hull number. And so that will work itself through. And so you'll see the DDG 1000 that's in the build becoming more of Bath's portfolio here as the year advances, and the DDG 51s, the mature fixed price, we know how to build these babies better than anybody. And you'll see all of that tailing down a little bit as the last two boats are in the build right now and the next one comes in, on the '11 budget, DDG 115 by hull number. Beyond that, the DDG 51s will arrive in some number. But it's just not parsed out in the budget beyond the '11 budget, as you well know. So the point of all that is you're going to see the margins come down as that cost-plus boat dominates, if you will, relatively speaking, Bath Iron Works. And then as we get into the fixed price, DDG 1000s and back into the fixed-price, DDG 51s, you're going to see those margins go back up again. I would also then comment in terms of Electric Boat, I mentioned the transition that we're still doing with Block IIs, and we're now starting Block IIIs. So the margins, I would expect, as we mature into Block III, I would expect, given that we continue to perform as a team, the way we perform right now, and going forward, we can enhance the margins in Virginia Class. And that's going to be, as you know, the major muscle mover for the Marine group. I would also add in terms of margin opportunity, the SSBN at Electric Boat, and I think you know, we're doing early engineering and development work on the SSBN Replacement, which is timelined into about a 2019 start to replace the Ohio Class SSBNs some years later. But that will also provide opportunity there. At the NASSCO side, you know that the T-AKE 14 in number will complete at the end of 2012. The product carrier's completed at the end of 2010. And that's why I changed the guidance, because the product carriers are going away. And that's a great margin opportunity that will tail out here very shortly. On the Navy side, we've got the MLP coming in on the '11 budget to enhance that side of it as the T-AKEs run out, if you will. And then on the Commercial side, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're very encouraged by the discussions we're having right now. The commercial market is coming back. And I believe that the time's up, the way we think it will, you're going to see contracts here for 2011 in that market, okay? And I'd also comment at NASSCO as it applies to all shipyards, but the most relevant current example is at NASSCO. We manage those businesses for profitability, and we're very disciplined in so doing. We just let go close to 600 people at NASSCO, because the volume was not appropriate to keep them, and we'll continue to do that as necessary, down and up, to make sure that we maintain profitability. So that's probably more than you asked for. But that's kind of my Marine view.

I'm going to give you more of the tutorial than you asked for, okay? Because this is the way I've got it stacked in my head. The forfeiture profits, liquidated damages, were not a margin driver for us, because it was as low as it's been since the downturn. So let's just take that off the table at the top. If you look at the margins year-over-year, okay, this time was better, positively impacted, because of the Aircraft Services volume improvement, which I talked to in my remarks, less pre-owned aircraft sales and frankly, those that did sell, sold at a modest profit versus the loss they sold at a year ago. And then the things you'd expect me to say, lower SG&A and then less, unless this is R&D expenditure, because we have larger supplier payments in the quarter, okay? That's kind of the year-over-year up to the 16.8%. If you look at it sequentially against the first quarter of 2010, really the difference there is the R&D expenditure, okay? So that's the lift that they got there. Looking forward for the rest of the year, why am I not sticking my nose up in the 16s, like I think, you're implying in the question? And the answer is we had the two-week furlough at Gulfstream, the overhead absorption attached to that. I do expect the forfeiture profits, the liquidated damages or whatever, to continue to decline, okay, with fewer anticipated defaults in the second half. And I expect the R&D expenditures to increase. Normally, historically, I guess, you'd say, the R&D expenditure net is more weighted in our favor on the second half of the year, and this year, it was favored to the first half of the year. So anyway, I think those are probably the major margin factors I would have for you today.

I mentioned in my remarks that I was very pleased with the Combat Systems and IS&T growth and all that is true, better than 1:1 in IS&T and close to it in Combat. If you add the IDIQs to that, it goes in excess of 1:1. So those two, okay, better than okay. On the Aerospace side -- well, on the Marine side, I think you used the word, but I'll use it again, that's the lumpiest of all in terms of how you add to the backlog. It comes in big slugs, and then it doesn't for a while, and then it comes in big slugs again. And what you're seeing right now, quite honestly is the impending, but not yet arrival of the number two or number three DDG 1000. That's really what you're seeing there. On Aerospace, look, it's $17.8 billion worth of backlog. Yes, it came down. But here's the way I look at it, and we look at it. If you take the 650 and give that, let's say, $12 billion of that $18 billion, put that aside, you got almost $6 billion in backlog in your in-production aircraft, largely in the large cabin. That's a very robust backlog. But here's the way I look at it. I look at it in terms of who's in there and how long will it take for you to get in entering the service with an airplane you want to buy today. And the answer to that, in terms of the 450 and the 550 is 18 to 24 months. And in our thinking, in my thinking, that's kind of the sweet spot. If that backlog, given the production rates we have, the fat backlog carries an 18-to-24-month delivery time with it, that backlog is sized appropriately. If it gets less than that, okay, then we got some sales work to do. If it's more than that, then the customer base waits too long for their airplane. So that's kind of where I am with that.

General Dynamics' second quarter performance was solid, delivering $8.1 billion in sales and record operating earnings of $985 million. This led to earnings per share of $1.68 on a fully diluted basis, $0.07 ahe",3104,"Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics' second quarter performance was solid, delivering $8.1 billion in sales and record operating earnings of $985 million. This led to earnings per share of $1.68 on a fully diluted basis, $0.07 ahead of last year's second quarter and $0.14 ahead of last quarter. Operating margins in all four groups were very strong in the quarter, driving 12.2% company margins, 50 basis points better than last year's second quarter and 40 basis points better than last quarter.
Second quarter free cash flow after capital expenditures was $414 million, approximately 64% of earnings from continuing operations. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $564 million, relatively consistent with last year's performance. I expect strong cash generation in the second half. 
We deployed $190 million of cash in the quarter to make two acquisitions that complement our core Combat Systems and IS&T businesses. We also took advantage of market conditions to buy 5.5 million shares of GD common stock in the open market. 
Orders this quarter exceeded $7 billion, over $1 billion more than last year's second quarter with robust activity in the Combat Systems and Information Systems and Technology groups. At the end of the quarter, total backlog stood at $62.5 billion.
Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups. And first, let's talk about Combat Systems. Combat Systems second quarter was marked by excellent operational performance across the business. Sales volume totaled $2.1 billion, up from the first quarter, but down from the same period a year ago, due to less MRAP volume, the cancellation of FCS and Stryker timing. In the second half, we anticipate stronger MRAP and Stryker volume. 
Earnings were essentially flat when compared with last year's second quarter, despite the decline in sales, as margins expanded across the portfolio. The 150-basis-point margin improvement is the result of better program mix, with volume concentrated in more mature procurement programs and improved operating performance. Compared to last quarter, earnings grew nearly 10% to $295 million. 
Total backlog for Combat Systems decreased modestly to $12.8 billion in the quarter. Order activity outpaced sales at three of the four businesses, including European Land Systems, which had its strongest order activity since the second quarter of last year. 
Notable orders in the quarter included approximately $500 million for Stryker vehicles and Abrams tanks, $200 million for United Kingdom's Scout vehicle development work, $35 million for the development phase of the Canadian LAV upgrade program and nearly $300 million for Hydra rockets. We expect to book several additional large international orders this year. 
Looking forward for the group, sales in the remainder of the year will be higher than both year-to-date and last year's second half, with particular strength in the fourth quarter. That said, my overall assessment now shows sales in 2010 to be essentially flat to slightly below 2009. 
As I mentioned on the first quarter call, the growth originally projected in 2010 was influenced heavily by international work in the second half of the year. A confluence of factors, including the European sovereign debt crisis, prolonged contract negotiations and the decline in the euro has changed our international sales outlook for this year. 
The sovereign debt crisis has delayed the award of the Spanish 8x8 program until 2011. However, the Spanish government remains committed to this program, having stated publicly that it remains a top defense priority. 
Prolonged contract negotiations slowed the award of our Canadian LAV program, which will now transition to production in 2011 rather than this year. A several hundred million dollar FMS LAV Award will also push out until late this year or early next year. Additionally at current exchange rates, the decline in the euro would reduce sales by nearly $150 million by year and. This is translation rather than meaningful economic impact, and obviously could vary depending on where the euro settles relative to the dollar at year end.
Our U.S. Core business received some unanticipated awards in the first half to include 250 RG-31s, stronger than expected EXCEL awards and Stryker development work. These positives have been somewhat offset by delays in awards at our Weapons Systems business and some reduction in contract scope in other programs. Not withstanding the adjusted sales outlook for 2010, full year earnings will be consistent with my original expectations. Margins will be in the mid-13% range, up approximately 50 to 60 basis points from my prior guidance, due to the favorable mix mentioned earlier.
As we look to the future, Combat's portfolio is well positioned. Let me briefly review four key components of this group's business. First, U.S. vehicles, comprised just over 50% of 2009 Combat sales, obviously driven by the Stryker and Abrams programs, which are core to today's army and will remain so for years to come. Current backlog, continued vehicle enhancements and reset opportunities will sustain these two mature programs. 
We are also competing on an array of next-generation vehicle programs, including the Ground Combat Vehicle and the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, which could offer upside in the longer term. In the event that any of these developmental programs are delayed, we see continued opportunity for our current vehicles.
Secondly, U.S. weapons systems and ammunition. At approximately 1/3 of 2009 combat sales, they provide an array of critical systems and ammunition products to a wide range of U.S. and international customers. The core programs in these businesses remain well supported in the midterm, while new opportunities in precision munitions, armor, commercial axles, Denel and international ammunition bode well for the longer term. 
Thirdly, international FMS and export vehicles. We expect to grow substantially over the next four years as we begin delivering light-armored vehicles and tanks to a variety of Middle Eastern customers. We are currently working four contracts, totaling close to $4 billion, with deliveries between 2011 and 2014. Two of those contracts, worth nearly $2.5 billion for FMS LAVs and Iraqi tanks are now in backlog. The other two contracts for additional FMS LAVs and tanks could add $1.4 billion to backlog before year end. These FMS sales present a meaningful opportunity, around $800 million to $1 billion of volume per year between 2011 and 2014.
And finally, international indigenous vehicles. One of our key market discriminators here is that we are residents in many of the countries where we manufacture and sell vehicles, thus making our employees an important component of local GDP. There have been several recent positive developments in this business, including: solidifying the first complement of the Canadian LAV upgrade program, which when added to backlog next year, will contribute another $850 million to sales between 2011 and 2013; selection as the preferred supplier for a five-year $100 million deal to sustain Australia's armored fighting vehicle fleet; and finalizing a contract worth several hundred million dollars over the next three years to develop and deliver Scout Specialist Vehicles to the British Army. 
Clearly the sovereign debt crisis has added some uncertainty to our European business over the past quarter. In June, I visited our European businesses. And while their situation remains dynamic, it was clear that in spite of timelines moving to the right, our programs remain in high demand. No programs have been eliminated or taken off the table. 
National security remains an important spending priority, even when times are austere and our indigenous workforce provides an important economic engine in many of these economies. We are setting the international standard for the next generation of armored vehicles, and I feel confident in our opportunities to provide best-in-class vehicles at affordable prices for years to come.
In summary, the Combat Systems portfolio of products is well placed in today's fighting force and is complemented by a healthy set of near and long-term opportunities. These opportunities, combined with the current backlog, provide relative stability in our core Domestic businesses and growth in our international workload. This will result in attractive margins and cash flow for the next several years.
Marine Systems. Marine Systems group delivered another solid quarter. Revenues were up slightly, though earnings were consistent with last year's second quarter at $1.6 billion and $167 million, respectively. This is a particularly good performance as last year's results reflected 17% sales and 32% earnings growth. 
Sales in the quarter were up at Electric Boat and Bath Iron Works reflecting increased Virginia and DDG 1000 volume and expand an SSBN replacement design efforts. This growth was somewhat offset by a decline in NASSCO sales due to repair volume timing and the ramp down of the commercial product carrier program. 
Marines margins in the quarter were 10.2%, up 40 basis points from the first quarter. The Marine group's backlog totaled $21.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, down 3.6% from the first quarter. We anticipate adding the second and third DDG 1000 ships to this backlog, either later this year or early next year, pending final contract negotiations with our customer.  In the second quarter, the group received funding for long-lead materials for these ships. 
Group sales will grow progressively through the second half, driven by the continued ramp to two-per-year Virginia class submarine production. Overall, sales should be up approximately 5% compared with last year, somewhat below my prior guidance. This change reflects continued weakness in the Commercial Shipbuilding business. 
We are, however, seeing renewed interest across the range of commercial shippers, including the dry cargo market, container ships and some tankers. Our excellent performance on the current five-ship product carrier program positions us to capitalize on a number of these contracts, most likely starting next year. 
Group margins for the year should be around the mid 9% range, consistent with my earlier guidance. Margins will decline as the year progresses, due to the surface combatant workload mix shift, which will escalate in the second half. Given the group's consistently excellent operating performance in managing for profitability, there may be some upside to my 9.5% margin guidance. 
Looking longer term, our shipyards are poised for slow, steady top line growth predicated on a healthy backlog and opportunities set. While the group faces a margin headwind in the near term, I see opportunity to expand margins, as surface combatant fixed price work builds, commercial shipbuilding opportunities materialize and two-per-year Virginia is realized.
IS&T. Our IS&T group had its highest ever revenue and earnings quarter. Sales were nearly $3 billion, up 12% over second quarter 2009 and 6.3% year-to-date. Sales growth was driven by continued demand for our ruggedized mobile computing and tactical communications products, an increased intelligence, IT and infrastructure support work. The group's second quarter operating earnings were $312 million, up 10% year-over-year and 7.6%, sequentially. Operating margins were 10.5%, in line with the first quarter and my expectation for this year.
Backlog for the group increased by over $300 million this quarter, as book to bill exceeded 1x again. Awards were particularly strong in our Tactical Communications and IT Services businesses. The businesses were also selected to compete on several large multiyear IDIQ contracts, which contributed to a 28% increase in our potential contract value. Many of these awards are detailed in our press release. 
IS&T's volume in the second half will exceed both last year's second half and this year's first half. Overall, I expect group sales to be up 8% to 9%, perhaps closer to the midpoint of that range. And margins will remain around 10.5%, both consistent with previous guidance.
Looking beyond 2010, IS&T's highly diverse portfolio positions the group to leverage its current capabilities to capture new business in fast-growing market segments. Tactical communications and battlefield management remain high customer spending priorities. 
Two weeks ago, many of our tactical communications products, including WIN-T and JTRS were part of a U.S. Army, Brigade Combat Team integration exercise that showcased their technical maturity and critical networking capabilities. As these programs transition to production over the next several years, they will enhance sales growth and margins. 
IT intelligence, infrastructure and healthcare support represents some of the other faster currents in the groups' marketplace. Sales growth will also be driven by the rapidly expanding cyber market, where IS&T has a very strong position with an array of government and commercial customers.
Aerospace. The Aerospace group's results were marked by excellent operational performance and new product development progress. Order intake was somewhat slower than anticipated, but year-to-date orders are in line with expectations. The group's second quarter sales were $1.38 billion, down modestly from last year's second quarter, due to fewer pre-owned aircraft sales at Gulfstream and less completions volume at Jet Aviation. The group's earnings were up 8.4%. Margins were 16.8%, a 160-basis-point improvement resulting from expanded Gulfstream volumes and margins, improved jet aviation completions margin and lower SG&A and R&D costs.
We continue to see signs of gradual improvement in the business jet market. Gulfstream flying hours are up. And we enjoyed a 16% improvement in the group's services sales versus last year's second quarter and a 7% improvement year-to-date. Additionally, market pre-owned aircraft levels continue to decline. At the end of the second quarter, Gulfstream had one pre-owned aircraft and inventory, and it is under contract. We anticipate receiving no more than three additional pre-owned aircraft before year end.
Customer interest in Gulfstream aircraft remains healthy, despite a slowdown in order intake in the second half of the quarter. Orders outpaced defaults by 3:1, while defaults were at their lowest level of this downturn. On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated book to bill was 0.6x. At $17.8 billion, our backlog includes nearly 200 G650 orders and approximately $6 billion in orders for our in-service aircraft. This is a very solid and sustaining backlog.
Orders in the quarter spanned the entirety of our product portfolio, with roughly 2/3 for the large-cabin aircraft and 1/3 for the mid cabins. Second quarter orders also reflected renewed interest in our North American markets, which were essentially dormant following last year's financial crisis and ensuing anti-business jet rhetoric. We also continue to see relative orders strength across several emerging markets including the Asia Pacific region, one of the strongest markets for business aviation and from for in particular. 
In addition to current backlog, we have a healthy pipeline of new opportunities, which we believe will translate to orders as the financial markets recover from a turbulent second quarter. Large cabin deliveries remain on track and will total 76 this year. As you may recall, Gulfstream completed a two-week furlough in July, which will result in fewer large cabin deliveries in the third quarter. The mid cabin business continue to show improvement in the second quarter and now exceeds my original expectations for 14 deliveries this year. I expect to deliver a total of 21 midsized jets this year, with some further upside if second half demands, nears what we've seen in the first half.
For the full year, I expect the group's sales to be up low to mid-single digits consistent with my prior guidance. Operating margins will be better than previously anticipated, probably in the mid-15% range with some upside. 
On the product development front, there are now three G250 aircraft and four G650 aircraft in flight test and 2011 FAA and EASA certification for both aircraft remain on track. As we look toward the next several years, the group will enjoy steady top line growth as we begin G650 deliveries in the second half of 2011, and the Services business continues to expand commensurate with the growing installed base. 
Our current order book and a healthy pipeline of potential new customer orders bode well for sustaining production of our G450 and G550 aircraft at or near current levels. The group's margins should continue to expand, driven in part by continued improvement of Jet Aviation and the transition to full rate production on our new aircraft models. We will continue to aggressively manage this business for profitability on the up as we did through the down.
In summary, General Dynamics executed well in the first half of 2010 and is well positioned for similar success in the second half. For the year, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $6.60 to $6.65, an increase from my prior guidance. 
Before concluding my remarks, I'd like to comment on today's dynamic business environment, particularly as it relates to our Defense businesses. Within this environment, the Pentagon's commitment to maintaining current force structure levels, which are sized to address the evolving threat environment, remains unchanged. While the post-9/11 world allows for little near-term defense budget reduction, pressures to manage discretionary spending will undoubtedly increase in the out years. 
I certainly appreciate the challenge the deficit-reduction emphasis represents for future defense spending. Over the past quarter, Secretary of Defense, Gates, and his senior leadership team have aggressively embarked upon a series of initiatives focused on making the Pentagon, a more cost-effective, efficient organization. Improving efficiency is particularly important to achieving the Pentagon's goal of preserving for structure, to appropriately organize, train and equip today's force to fight, weapons spending will have to show some growth in the years ahead. 
In a flat-budget environment, the Defense Department must extract savings from within its own budget to achieve this required growth. Having focused on achieving savings in the weapons accounts last year, the Pentagon now appears focused primarily on extracting overhead savings from operations and maintenance budget, the tail, to support investment account requirements, the tooth. 
The specifics of the Pentagon's efficiency initiatives are not yet evident, but what is clear, is that the environment is changing and that all stakeholders will have a role to play. I am personally involved with other CEOs in a cooperative dialogue to develop procedures that will achieve needed results while protecting the viability of the Defense industrial base. I'm encouraged that the Pentagon has engaged the industry as it embarks on shaping these measures. 
General Dynamics is already a very lean and efficient operator. We will continue to support our customer in pursuing even greater value for the defense dollar. Our Defense businesses have all experienced strong support in the ongoing 2011 budget deliberations. While there are several steps remaining before the 2011 budget, Defense bill becomes law, I remain confident that GD's core programs will receive solid Congressional support. 
General Dynamics is particularly well positioned to excel in this fast-changing environment. Low costs and quality production continue to enhance our competitiveness. Our streamlined business model limits overhead expense and empowers our business unit presidents to remain entrepreneurial and agile. 
And with that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?"

We have $700 million of fixed rate notes that are still due to mature in August. We plan to satisfy that obligations with cash on hand. As a result, we'll see lower interest expense in the second half of the year, and we expect full year interest expense to be somewhere between $155 million and $160 million. We are also scheduled to make a voluntary contribution to our pension plans of approximately $270 million in September. 
I would like to also point out that we recently renewed our 364-day bank line, increasing it by about $200 million and extending the term to three years. This increases our commercial paper capacity to approximately $2 billion. The increased commercial paper capacity, along with the debt repayment in the third quarter, further bolsters our strong balance sheet and gives us capacity to execute on future opportunities.
Finally, an update on our expectations for our effective tax rate. I had previously guided you to a rate of 31.5% with some 20 to 30 basis points of exposure, meaning risk that the rate could be as high as 31.8%. Given our experience in the first half and what we see ahead of us for the remainder of the year, the rate is still looking like 31.5%, but with the opportunity to come in 20 to 30 basis points lower rather than higher.

And I'm very bullish on the longer-term margins for the 650. It's going to be a game buster airplane for both the customer and for Gulfstream."

The other remark I'd make, and you know this, Carter and Joe, but when you step into something like these wide-body, narrow-body completions, it's not a two-month deal. These projects go for a long time, years in many cases. So working through that inventory, the legacy inventory and getting them back in the air and return to their customers in good shape has been an ongoing evolution, and in fact, it still goes on. But I would tell you that they've definitely turned a corner. And the future looks very bright in the Completions business, both skyline-wise and how we execute on that skyline."

And you've captured it and I said it in my remarks, I mean, I'm very pleased with the performance at all three of our shipyards. The margins are representative of the excellence of those yards in doing what they do best. And really, the margin guidance that I'm giving is purely reflective of the mix shift, predominantly at Bath Iron Works. But also, somewhat, as we move block to block with Virginia Class, we're now into Block III, I think, as you know, and then also coming to the end of the product carrier line, if you will, at NASSCO. So what does all that mean? In the Bath instance, you know we're in the build on the first cost-plus DDG 1000. It's about, I think, like 17% complete, okay? No big surprises. We're pleased with what we've got. We like it a lot. We're in contract negotiations for the next two fixed-price 1001 and 1002 by hull number. And so that will work itself through. And so you'll see the DDG 1000 that's in the build becoming more of Bath's portfolio here as the year advances, and the DDG 51s, the mature fixed price, we know how to build these babies better than anybody. And you'll see all of that tailing down a little bit as the last two boats are in the build right now and the next one comes in, on the '11 budget, DDG 115 by hull number. Beyond that, the DDG 51s will arrive in some number. But it's just not parsed out in the budget beyond the '11 budget, as you well know. So the point of all that is you're going to see the margins come down as that cost-plus boat dominates, if you will, relatively speaking, Bath Iron Works. And then as we get into the fixed price, DDG 1000s and back into the fixed-price, DDG 51s, you're going to see those margins go back up again. I would also then comment in terms of Electric Boat, I mentioned the transition that we're still doing with Block IIs, and we're now starting Block IIIs. So the margins, I would expect, as we mature into Block III, I would expect, given that we continue to perform as a team, the way we perform right now, and going forward, we can enhance the margins in Virginia Class. And that's going to be, as you know, the major muscle mover for the Marine group. I would also add in terms of margin opportunity, the SSBN at Electric Boat, and I think you know, we're doing early engineering and development work on the SSBN Replacement, which is timelined into about a 2019 start to replace the Ohio Class SSBNs some years later. But that will also provide opportunity there. At the NASSCO side, you know that the T-AKE 14 in number will complete at the end of 2012. The product carrier's completed at the end of 2010. And that's why I changed the guidance, because the product carriers are going away. And that's a great margin opportunity that will tail out here very shortly. On the Navy side, we've got the MLP coming in on the '11 budget to enhance that side of it as the T-AKEs run out, if you will. And then on the Commercial side, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're very encouraged by the discussions we're having right now. The commercial market is coming back. And I believe that the time's up, the way we think it will, you're going to see contracts here for 2011 in that market, okay? And I'd also comment at NASSCO as it applies to all shipyards, but the most relevant current example is at NASSCO. We manage those businesses for profitability, and we're very disciplined in so doing. We just let go close to 600 people at NASSCO, because the volume was not appropriate to keep them, and we'll continue to do that as necessary, down and up, to make sure that we maintain profitability. So that's probably more than you asked for. But that's kind of my Marine view."

I'm going to give you more of the tutorial than you asked for, okay? Because this is the way I've got it stacked in my head. The forfeiture profits, liquidated damages, were not a margin driver for us, because it was as low as it's been since the downturn. So let's just take that off the table at the top. If you look at the margins year-over-year, okay, this time was better, positively impacted, because of the Aircraft Services volume improvement, which I talked to in my remarks, less pre-owned aircraft sales and frankly, those that did sell, sold at a modest profit versus the loss they sold at a year ago. And then the things you'd expect me to say, lower SG&A and then less, unless this is R&D expenditure, because we have larger supplier payments in the quarter, okay? That's kind of the year-over-year up to the 16.8%. If you look at it sequentially against the first quarter of 2010, really the difference there is the R&D expenditure, okay? So that's the lift that they got there. Looking forward for the rest of the year, why am I not sticking my nose up in the 16s, like I think, you're implying in the question? And the answer is we had the two-week furlough at Gulfstream, the overhead absorption attached to that. I do expect the forfeiture profits, the liquidated damages or whatever, to continue to decline, okay, with fewer anticipated defaults in the second half. And I expect the R&D expenditures to increase. Normally, historically, I guess, you'd say, the R&D expenditure net is more weighted in our favor on the second half of the year, and this year, it was favored to the first half of the year. So anyway, I think those are probably the major margin factors I would have for you today."

I mentioned in my remarks that I was very pleased with the Combat Systems and IS&T growth and all that is true, better than 1:1 in IS&T and close to it in Combat. If you add the IDIQs to that, it goes in excess of 1:1. So those two, okay, better than okay. On the Aerospace side -- well, on the Marine side, I think you used the word, but I'll use it again, that's the lumpiest of all in terms of how you add to the backlog. It comes in big slugs, and then it doesn't for a while, and then it comes in big slugs again. And what you're seeing right now, quite honestly is the impending, but not yet arrival of the number two or number three DDG 1000. That's really what you're seeing there. On Aerospace, look, it's $17.8 billion worth of backlog. Yes, it came down. But here's the way I look at it, and we look at it. If you take the 650 and give that, let's say, $12 billion of that $18 billion, put that aside, you got almost $6 billion in backlog in your in-production aircraft, largely in the large cabin. That's a very robust backlog. But here's the way I look at it. I look at it in terms of who's in there and how long will it take for you to get in entering the service with an airplane you want to buy today. And the answer to that, in terms of the 450 and the 550 is 18 to 24 months. And in our thinking, in my thinking, that's kind of the sweet spot. If that backlog, given the production rates we have, the fat backlog carries an 18-to-24-month delivery time with it, that backlog is sized appropriately. If it gets less than that, okay, then we got some sales work to do. If it's more than that, then the customer base waits too long for their airplane. So that's kind of where I am with that."

General Dynamics delivered another solid operating performance in the third quarter with sales of $8 billion nearly 4% better than the same quarter a year ago. Operating earnings of $966 million were up 10.5% ov",3093,"Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics delivered another solid operating performance in the third quarter with sales of $8 billion nearly 4% better than the same quarter a year ago. Operating earnings of $966 million were up 10.5% over the year-ago quarter. Company margins improved 80 basis points to 12.1%. Earnings per share were $1.70 on a fully diluted basis, $0.22 better than last year's third quarter.
Third quarter free cash flow, after capital expenditures, was $784 million, 121% of earnings from continuing operations. This includes a voluntary payment of $270 million to our pension plan. In terms of capital deployment, we used $700 million in the quarter to retire our 4.5% fixed rate notes. We also purchased 2.7 million shares of General Dynamics' stock in the open market for $163 million. Year-to-date, we have spent $726 million to repurchase 11.2 million shares. Through share repurchases and dividends, we have returned almost 90% of year-to-date free cash flow to shareholders.
Third quarter orders were the strongest we've seen this year. Aerospace and IS&T's book to bill exceeded 1:1 while Combat's book to bill was nearly 1:1. At the end of the quarter, total backlog stood at a robust $61.8 billion. 
Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups, starting with the largest of our four businesses, IS&T. IS&T enjoyed strong orders, sales, earnings and margins in the third quarter. Sales were nearly $3 billion for the second consecutive quarter, an 8% increase over last year's third quarter. This is healthy growth in light of the fact that last year's third quarter was the group's highest sales quarter in 2009. Year-to-date, sales are up 7%. The group's third quarter earnings were $306 million up 3.4% year-over-year. Operating margins were 10.4% in the quarter, essentially in line with my 10.5% full year guidance.
The group's book to bill exceeded 1x for the third consecutive quarter causing backlog to increase by $230 million. If the group maintains this win rate, as I expect, 2010 will stand as the 12th year that book-to-bill has been at or above 1x, an excellent track record for a business of this size and diversity.
Award activity in the quarter was particularly strong at our tactical communications and IT services businesses. Several of these contracts are detailed in today's earnings press release. Total estimated contract value, which adds the potential value of IDIQ contracts to total backlog, stood at $24.9 billion at quarter-end. This represents well over 2x expected 2011 sales and a 5% increase above the year-ago value.
Fourth quarter sales and margins will be essentially in line with the third quarter. For the full year, I expect group sales to increase approximately 8% to 8.5% over last year driven by double-digit sales growth in our Tactical Communications and Information Technology Services businesses. Margins for the year will remain around 10.5%. 
As we look to the future, IS&T is particularly well positioned. I want to spend a few minutes this morning giving you a sense for why. First, a few facts that highlight the group's diverse business base. Group sales are derived from thousands of contracts at any given time with no single contract totaling more than 2% of company sales. Approximately 40% of sales come from civil agencies, restricted, commercial and international customers. Product and systems integration dominate the group's efforts, representing over 50% of sales. The remaining sales consist of approximately 25% high-end engineering services and 20% pure IT service work. Nearly half of sales result from fixed price contracts while approximately 38% are cost plus and the remainder, time and materials. 
Over the past decade, we have evolved the group's products and services offerings into a balanced portfolio that remains at the forefront of Defense and Federal spending priorities. Let me briefly review the three key pieces of this business.
First, Tactical Communications and Battle Space Management. This segment represents approximately only 45% of the group's sales and comprises a U.S. and a smaller U.K.-based business. The group's products and services provide critical command and control capability and enables secure, continuous communications all the way to the dismounted soldier. Programs include the Army's battlefield network, known as WIN-T and the new handheld software defined Joint Tactical Radio System unknown as JTRS HMS. We have dramatically diversified our overseas C4 business from a purely U.K.-based avionics house to a provider of vehicles, force protection, security, avionics and C4I products to a global clientele.
Earlier this year, GD U.K. was awarded the development contract for the British Army scout reconnaissance vehicle. This program remains a top funding priority and was included as a component of the Army's future land forces in the U.K.'s recent strategic defense and security review.
Next, Information Technology and Mission Services. Our IT services unit comprises a little over 1/3 of the group's sales. This business enjoys excellent market positions in the Defense Department and the intelligence community as a provider of IT infrastructure, simulation and training services and key mission support. This business also provides an array of IT Healthcare Services to military, federal and commercial customers. 
And finally, Intelligence, Surveillance And Reconnaissance, ISR systems. Comprising about 20% of IS&T sales, this business specializes in signals intelligence, tactical imagery and information collection, processing, exploitation and distribution. 
In 2009, as many of you know, we added Access to this unit. As a best in class supplier of high-performance electrical optical and infrared sensors and systems, Access provides sensor components that enhance the ability of war fighters and government agencies alike to provide timely, actionable intelligence.
Although not a designated business unit within IS&T, Cyber security encompasses core capabilities resident in each of our businesses including encryption and information assurance, network security and forensics. General Dynamics is a market leader in the cyber arena with approximately $2 billion in 2009 sales across a diversed customer base, including the Pentagon, homeland security and the commercial markets.
As prime contractor on many sophisticated national Cyber security programs, we employ more than 50% of U.S. cleared digital forensics investigators. Government agencies and private corporations alike will spend billions to protect and defend their networks in the years ahead. General Dynamics will be a major part of that fast-growing market.
The IS&T group, by leveraging its current capabilities to capture new business in faster growing market segments, has the opportunity to deliver steady growth over the next several years. Each of the group's businesses remain focused on maintaining their competitive edge by aggressively cutting costs, encouraging continues improvement initiatives and selectively pursuing those opportunities that offer the most attractive returns.
Combat Systems. Combat Systems sales were $2.1 billion in the third quarter. This result represented less volume than the year-ago quarter primarily in vehicle modifications, combat logistic support and development programs. Year-to-date, over 50% of the group's sales decline is related to last MRAP volume and less engineering work which is largely the result of the cancellation of future Combat Systems. 
Despite a reduction in sales, earnings were essentially flat with last year's third quarter as margins expanded in several of our businesses. The 150 basis point year-over-year margin improvement is the result of strong operating performance and less engineering and development content.
Total backlog for Combat Systems was essentially unchanged from second quarter at $12.8 billion. Notable orders in the quarter included approximately $475 million for Stryker vehicles and Abrams tanks, $80 million for Iraqi tank logistic support, $260 million for reactive armor, guns and biological detection systems and a $120 million award to supply ammunition to the Canadian Armed Forces.
Because of the success of Stryker double-V hull testing, we received another series of orders for the new hulls subsequent to the quarter. Double-V modifications of the current Stryker fleet remain another promising opportunity. We were also notified earlier this month that our U.S. Vehicle business was selected to negotiate a contract to produce Merkava APC main hulls and kits for the Israeli government. We expect to add this program to backlog in the first half of next year and we'll deliver these hulls over the next overall years.
We made progress on several international programs in the quarter delivering the first of 140 Iraqi tanks, finalizing preparations for FMS LAV productions and progressing through Canadian LAV upgrade engineering work. Despite these progress, international sales are coming more slowly than anticipated but should grow more significantly in 2011. Consistent with my earlier report, a number of international programs have been slowed by their country's financial status, but none have been canceled or withdrawn. 
Combat expects to book several additional international orders in the fourth quarter including an FMS LAV order totaling $250 million, the first production contract for an FMS tank upgrade program totaling $300 million and a $100 million order for German EAGLE vehicles.
In the first half of 2011, we expect to add the first tranche of production funding for the $850 million Canadian LAV upgrade program to the backlog. The pacing of U.S. awards has also lagged our expectations this year. Some of the awards expected in the first half including armor and biological detection systems came late in the third quarter and will result in lower sales than previously expected in 2010. Other program awards, most notably the ground combat vehicle competition, will push out until 2011. Looking forward for the group, sales in the fourth quarter will be this year's strongest by far. For the full year, I expect the group's sales to be around $9 billion. 
My expectation for the group's full-year earnings remain unchanged. Margins, therefore, will be around 14%, 40 to 50 basis points higher than my prior guidance. This margin performance is the result of strong operational execution in the first nine months of the year and a favorable program mix that includes less development and initial stage international work than originally anticipated.
As we look ahead, combat's international opportunities, combined with current backlog, provide relative top line stability as international workflow mitigates some slowing in our U.S. programs. The group's mature program mix will result in attractive margins and cash flow for the next several years.
Marine systems. The Marine Systems group had another good quarter with sales of $1.7 billion, up 12% over the year-ago period and 4% sequentially. Earnings totaled $169 million, up 9% over last year and consistent with last quarter's results. Sales and earnings growth were driven by growing Virginia class volume and SSBN replacement design efforts. The group's third quarter operating margin was 9.9%, down modestly from both the year-ago period and the prior quarter due to mixed shift in our surface combatant programs. With that said, this operating margin exceeded my expectations due to particularly good performance at Electric Boat and NASSCO. Electric Boat's third quarter delivery of USS Missouri is representative of the focus on execution resident at each of our three ERs. EB delivered this submarine in a record 65 months, five months faster than any of the six prior Virginia class boats. Missouri required 600,000 fewer labor hours than EB's last Virginia class sub and was 8% under target cost.
Marines backlog totaled $20.6 billion at the end of the third quarter down 3% from the end of last quarter. Despite this decline, the group booked several key orders in the quarter including funding for Bath Iron Works to continue providing management, engineering and detailed design developments for the DDG 51 program. NASSCO also received funding for advanced engineering and long lead materials for the new mobile landing platform, MLP. And in final contract negotiations with our customer, we expect to add several construction contract to vast backlog in the first half of next year, including, the DDG's 1001 and 1002, the second and third of the Zumwalt Class and the DDG 115, the restart of the DDG 51 program.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, group sales will look similar to the third quarter with operating margins in the mid-9% range as the surface combatants mix shift of Bath Iron Works becomes more apparent. For the full year, sales should be up approximately 5% compared with last year and margins will be in the high-9% range, slightly better than my prior guidance. 
Looking ahead, our shipyards enjoy a healthy backlog and an attractive opportunity set. In addition to our Navy work, we continue to see renewed interest across the range of commercial shippers and anticipate that we can leverage our excellent commercial tanker performance to win new commericial work in 2011.
Over the next two to three years, you will see the potential for margin improvements as surface combatant fixed-price work builds, commercial ship building opportunities materialize and construction on two per year Virginia is realized.
Aerospace. The Aerospace group's third quarter results were marked by improved order activity, service volume and operational performance. Group sales were nearly $1.3 billion, up 15% from last year's third quarter due to more green aircraft deliveries and higher services volume. Earnings were $199 million, a nearly 60% increase over the same period last year while margins were 15.4%, a 420 basis point improvement.
When compared with this year's second quarter, sales, earnings and margins were down due to the two-week furlough at Gulfstream, which caused fewer green deliveries and the timing of R&D cost. I expect sales, earnings and margins to show improvement in the fourth quarter.
The business jet market, particularly in the large cabin long-range segment, continue to make strides toward recovery in the third quarter, including further reduction in preowned aircraft levels.
Gulfstream took one preowned aircraft and trade this quarter and sold two aircraft for a modest profit. At the end of the quarter, Gulfstream had no preowned aircraft in inventory.
Customer interest remains healthy as Gulfstream booked more orders in the third quarter than in any quarter since the economic downturn began in mid-2008. On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated book-to-bill was a 1.2x. Orders handily outpaced defaults resulting in a modest 1% decline in the backlog from the end of the second quarter. The group's backlog remains a robust $17.6 billion.
In addition to current backlog, our pipeline of new opportunities remain strong. We continued to experience strong international order activity and interest, particularly in the emerging markets. In the quarter, Latin America and Asia-Pacific represented nearly 1/3 of order activity and now comprise over 40% of backlog. Recent orders span the entirety of our in production and new aircraft portfolio.
Flying hours improved again this quarter, a reality that helped Gulfstream service facilities enjoy their highest quarterly volume ever. Year-to-date, Gulfstream's service business is up 18.5%. Beyond improved utilization figures and a growing installed fleet, Gulfstream service volumes reflects their unwavering commitment to provide a best-in-class support.
In the quarter, Gulfstream's large cabin business jets were voted number one for the eighth consecutive year in the annual AIA Product Support survey. Jet Aviation Service business has also enjoyed healthy growth this year, up nearly 10% year-to-date. As the international install fleet grows, we are adapting by growing our Product Support organization, which is the largest in the industry today. Jet continues to enhance its service offerings across the globe with particular emphasis in Asia, a region whose installed base promises to grow rapidly over the next several years.
Although Jet's service related sales were up in the quarter, overall volume was down modestly from last quarter on lower completion revenue. Business jet completions work has been lighter this year as OEMs delivered fewer aircraft. Conversely, the narrow-body wide-body pipeline remains robust. And Jet signed agreements to complete three more of these aircraft in August. Jet continues to take steps to improve probability including consolidating its U.S. completions and MRO operations at its Skokie, Illinois facility near St. Louis. 
Planned deliveries for large cabin aircraft are on track at 75 this year. Mid-cabin orders were more plentiful than anticipated in the quarter and I now expect the total approaching 30 this year, several more than I guided you to in July. We continue to make exciting progress on the product development front. With three G250 aircraft and four soon to be five, G650 aircraft in flight test, we are on glide slope toward 2011 FAA IASA certification for both aircraft. In fact, recently, the fourth G650 test article and the first ever Gulfstream test article with a fully-outfitted interior, flew the fastest ultra range, long-range flight ever flown by a business jet. This is a compelling demonstration of the G650's exceptional high-speed cruise capabilities. That was 5,000 nautical miles at 0.9 mach in nine hours and 45 minutes.  Both aircraft flew to NBAA in Atlanta, Georgia last week, with the G250 making its maiden transatlantic voyage en route. 
For the full year, I expect the Aerospace group sales to be up mid-single-digit above last year, slightly higher than my prior guidance due to better than anticipated service volume. Operating margins will also be better than previously anticipated, close to 16%. 
As we look to the future, the group will enjoy steady top line growth, driven by new product introduction and improving service volume. We will continue to manage this business with great discipline on the up cycle as we did through the down. 
In summary, General Dynamics continues to perform well and remains positioned for a good fourth quarter. For the year, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $6.70 to $6.75, an increase from my prior guidance. As we look toward 2011, the defense and Aerospace markets remain dynamic. Amidst the uncertainty of a fast changing market place and budget adjustments, we remain focused on execution as we believe this will enable us to leverage our incumbency to win new opportunities. Our defense backlog already includes a solid order book for next year and we are encouraged by the Congressional support our programs have received in the 2011 defense budget appropriations process. 
Consequently, as we look to the future, I believe General Dynamics will offer a sustaining Defense business with excellent operating margins and strong free cash flow. In addition, our Aerospace business will be the growth engine throughout the near and intermediate timeframe. We are aggressively managing our businesses for profitability, with continued emphasis on earnings growth and efficient conversion of earnings to cash. Our strong balance sheet and excellent cash outlook afford us to tremendous flexibility to continue deploying capital in a balanced manner in order to create the greatest long-term value for our shareholders.
And with that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?"

I'll start with some observations about our cash performance and financing activities. As you know, we experienced growth in working capital through the first half of the year due to timing of contract payments,",350,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some observations about our cash performance and financing activities. As you know, we experienced growth in working capital through the first half of the year due to timing of contract payments, particularly in our IS&T business. Continued focus on this area has begun to yield positive results. In the third quarter, we reversed the trend and trimmed 2010 OWC growth by 1/3. You can see the impact of that effort and the impact that had on strong free cash flow performance in the quarter. In addition, as Jay noted, we repaid $700 million of fixed rate Notes in the third quarter. As a result of strong free cash flow and debt repayment, we've reduced our net debt by almost $400 million in the quarter. This leaves us at the end of the third quarter with a strong balance sheet and a debt to equity ratio of just under 24%. With the third quarter debt repayment, we're expecting net interest expense for the year of between $155 million to $160 million, consistent with our previous guidance but probably toward the lower end of that range. I should point out that in 2011, we're planning a $750 million debt repayment and a $300 million pension contribution, very similar to the debt repayment in the pension contribution made in 2010.
Finally, a quick note on our tax rate, I previously guided you to a range, which was as low as 31.2%. That range was predicated largely on a then in process of 2009 tax return. As we finalized the return in the third quarter, we identified some additional R&D tax credits that drove the rate to the lower end of our range. At this point, we're forecasting an effective rate of 31.2% for the year with some opportunity to improve.  That compares with the full year rate of 31.5% last year. The tax rate in the third quarter reflects the true up to the reduced full year rate. 
That completes my remarks and I'll turn it back to Amy to begin the Q&A."

So that will be an ever-growing and you know we're passing through LRIP and WIN-T and we're expecting an LRIP decision on JTRS here within the next two quarters, I think. So that business will continue to mature and develop going forward. The IT services piece for us is very, very good business, both in the infrastructure, the support, the healthcare, IT. So we've got many opportunities across what I'd call a diverse growth portfolio in IT. And with that, we've got our ISR that I talked about which is 20% of the portfolio but again, it recognized and necessary fast current in both DoD space and frankly, in agency space and commercial applications. All around that, cyber, which will take a big tent with lots of players in it for as long as the eye can see, we believe, and we're well grounded in cyber, as I mentioned in my remarks.

So we've got a great team doing superb work across a global scale here. I'm very proud of them. Now as to the sales, a tendency of that performance, we had as you know, a very, what I would call with a clarity of hindsight, a very aggressive sales plan at the start of the year, which has been softened by the reality, mostly timing realities of the world scene. So I would tell you that the first half of the year, in terms of sales growth, if you will, pretty much happened the way we thought it would and I think I've been saying all along that we were heavily loaded to the second half of the year, which is not terribly unusual for combat, but it was more so this year than I think perhaps historically. So we we're heavily loaded to the second half of the year. I would tell you, in addition to what I said in my remarks about year-over-year comparisons with MRAP volume growing away and NCSD being canceled, a lot of what we are seeing, Howard, is just the timing of these programs. The indigenous vehicle programs we are seeing the European sovereign debt realities impact us in Spain with the 8x8 competition that was going to happen this year has been moved into the mid year of 2011 but reaffirmed by the Spanish Ministry of Defense has being essential to the Spanish Army. so we believe that one will still come. There others in Portugal and other European countries that have pushed out a little bit, prolonging contract negotiations. I am sure things, if you will, the Canadian LAV is probably the best example of that, $850 million, I mentioned it in my remarks. It's happening, as we speak, we're in development, contract execution right now. We'll get the production contract in 2011 and off we go. And by the way there, Howard, I should just mentioned on the Canadian side, when  we talk about that LAV upgrade, we also talk about the technical Armored Patrol Vehicles and the CCV as a downrange programs that are coming, but just in the last few days, it's been reaffirmed by my source with the Army chief up there, basically ties this as a family of land combat vehicles that will all be, the RFPs for TAPV CTV are going to happen this year according to him and so we'll be in production, whoever gets that will be in production from 2012 to 2015. So it's coming, it's just not here this year. With the UK scout vehicle, which in contract right now on development but it will be more to follow in the coming years. The international vehicle export business we've talked about before, the FMS LAVs and some of the tanks, we've got some of them, we've got more to come. Some of them we expect here in the fourth quarter. Would I bet everything on the fourth quarter, no. But if it's not in the fourth quarter, it will be in 2011. So it's all coming. The U.S. vehicle business, we've had D-scope on some of the programs that we've talked about earlier in the year, Cougar MOD is one of them, the remote weapon system for Stryker is another one that comes to mind. We've had to lay our new programs like the GCV as I talked about and honestly, a little bit of lumpiness, I guess you could say, in kind of the reset and modification work on Stryker and Abrams as the force reconstitutes or repositions itself in some measures. And then on the weapon systems business, we've seen some delay as well. Armor is a classic example and then we had some softness in the commercial axle market and some of the aftermarket that goes with that actually is coming in now but anyway, I think that's probably more than you ask me for but to sum it all, I would say it was also a very strong order quarter for combat which also bodes well, I think, for the rest of the year and for 2011. Historically, European Land Systems has been the strongest in the fourth quarter, I expect that to happen again this year."

As to do debt market, I know it's a favorite question that we get a lot, but I would just tell you that truly keeping with the way General Dynamics does business, which I'd like to think is very disciplined, we kind of don't go to the debt market unless we have a specific reason for going to the debt market. If I got a purpose in mind that we need to go, we've got plenty of access to go there but we don't do it just to get some cash. We've got $2 billion in credit facilities, we're great cash generators, we have lots of cash on hand right now and so we'll continue to generate more. It gives us the flexibility we need to be acquisitive, which we historically as you know have been and will continue to be as opportunities present themselves. So we're not inclined to go to the debt market for good deals because actually the commercial paper market right now, which we have got great access to, would give us more attractive rates than the debt market. We also retired our $700 million notes this year at par with essentially no economic cost to us. So we think we're managing that size in a pretty balanced manner."

And I'm being realistic in terms of how I think of defense, it's not going to grow like it has been, very obviously. But we do believe that there maybe some modest growth opportunity in there and what I cited in the past calls in IS&T, are a classic example of that. On the combat side, that's a steady business as we see it right now. We see a lot of 2011 already in program or record. And if you look at the United States Army, for example, and look at the 20-some heavy brigade combat teams and the seven going to eight and probably going to nine, Stryker Brigade Combat Teams with the former at 60 Abrams per brigade and the latter at 330 plus Strykers per brigade, that kid is not going to change until you see a fundamental change in the fore structure of the United States Army. So we try to think of it in pragmatic terms, thread based and core based, if you will, and that really I think performed the core basis of my comments as much as anything, Joe. And on the Aerospace side, that is clearly a growth engine for everyone, I would say, in the industry but particularly when you're driving the premier brand, the Gulfstream with new products about to hit the street with 200 plus airplanes in the G650 queue, et cetera. So put all that together and you've got, I believe, a very steady, sustaining Defense business. Could things change? That depends on budgets and all the realities, but I still believe with everything I've got that the threat and the appetite for risk taking at a national strategic level will drive the defense budget as much as anything.

General Dynamics delivered another solid operating performance in the third quarter with sales of $8 billion, nearly 4% better than the same quarter a year ago. Operating earnings of $966 million were up 10.5% o",3082,"Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics delivered another solid operating performance in the third quarter with sales of $8 billion, nearly 4% better than the same quarter a year ago. Operating earnings of $966 million were up 10.5% over the year-ago quarter. Company margins improved 80 basis points to 12.1%. Earnings per share were $1.70 on a fully diluted basis, $0.22 better than last year's third quarter.
Third quarter free cash flow, after capital expenditures, was $784 million, 121% of earnings from continuing operations. This includes a voluntary payment of $270 million to our pension plan. In terms of capital deployment, we used $700 million in the quarter to retire our 4.5% fixed rate notes. We also purchased 2.7 million shares of General Dynamics' stock in the open market for $163 million. Year-to-date, we have spent $726 million to repurchase 11.2 million shares. Through share repurchases and dividends, we have returned almost 90% of year-to-date free cash flow to shareholders.
Third quarter orders were the strongest we've seen this year. Aerospace and IS&T's book to bill exceeded 1:1 while Combat's book to bill was nearly 1:1. At the end of the quarter, total backlog stood at a robust $61.8 billion. 
Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups, starting with the largest of our four businesses, IS&T. IS&T enjoyed strong orders, sales, earnings and margins in the third quarter. Sales were nearly $3 billion for the second consecutive quarter, an 8% increase over last year's third quarter. This is healthy growth in light of the fact that last year's third quarter was the group's highest sales quarter in 2009. Year-to-date, sales are up 7%. The group's third quarter earnings were $306 million up 3.4% year-over-year. Operating margins were 10.4% in the quarter, essentially in line with my 10.5% full year guidance.
The group's book to bill exceeded 1x for the third consecutive quarter causing backlog to increase by $230 million. If the group maintains this win rate, as I expect, 2010 will stand as the 12th year that book-to-bill has been at or above 1x, an excellent track record for a business of this size and diversity.
Award activity in the quarter was particularly strong at our Tactical Communications and IT Services businesses. Several of these contracts are detailed in today's earnings press release. Total estimated contract value, which adds the potential value of IDIQ contracts to total backlog, stood at $24.9 billion at quarter-end. This represents well over 2x expected 2011 sales and a 5% increase above the year-ago value.
Fourth quarter sales and margins will be essentially in line with the third quarter. For the full year, I expect group sales to increase approximately 8% to 8.5% over last year driven by double-digit sales growth in our Tactical Communications and Information Technology Services businesses. Margins for the year will remain around 10.5%. 
As we look to the future, IS&T is particularly well positioned. I want to spend a few minutes this morning giving you a sense for why. First, a few facts that highlight the group's diverse business base. Group sales are derived from thousands of contracts at any given time with no single contract totaling more than 2% of company sales. Approximately 40% of sales come from civil agencies, restricted, commercial and international customers. Product and systems integration dominate the group's efforts, representing over 50% of sales. The remaining sales consist of approximately 25% high-end engineering services and 20% pure IT service work. Nearly half of sales result from fixed price contracts while approximately 38% are cost plus and the remainder, time and materials. 
Over the past decade, we have evolved the group's products and services offerings into a balanced portfolio that remains at the forefront of Defense and Federal spending priorities. Let me briefly review the three key pieces of this business.
First, Tactical Communications and Battle Space Management. This segment represents approximately only 45% of the group's sales and comprises a U.S. and a smaller U.K.-based business. The group's products and services provide critical command and control capability and enables secure, continuous communications all the way to the dismounted soldier. Programs include the Army's battlefield network, known as WIN-T and the new handheld software defined Joint Tactical Radio System known as JTRS HMS. We have dramatically diversified our overseas C4 business from a purely U.K.-based avionics house to a provider of vehicles, force protection, security, avionics and C4I products to a global clientele.
Earlier this year, GD U.K. was awarded the development contract for the British Army Scout reconnaissance vehicle. This program remains a top funding priority and was included as a component of the Army's future land forces in the U.K.'s recent strategic defense and security review.
Next, Information Technology and Mission Services. Our IT services unit comprises a little over 1/3 of the group's sales. This business enjoys excellent market positions in the Defense Department and the intelligence community as a provider of IT infrastructure, simulation and training services and key mission support. This business also provides an array of IT Healthcare Services to military, federal and commercial customers. 
And finally, Intelligence, Surveillance And Reconnaissance, ISR systems. Comprising about 20% of IS&T sales, this business specializes in signals intelligence, tactical imagery and information collection, processing, exploitation and distribution. 
In 2009, as many of you know, we added Axsys to this unit. As a best in class supplier of high-performance electrical optical and infrared sensors and systems, Axsys provides sensor components that enhance the ability of war fighters and government agencies alike to provide timely, actionable intelligence.
Although not a designated business unit within IS&T, Cyber security encompasses core capabilities resident in each of our businesses including encryption and information assurance, network security and forensics. General Dynamics is a market leader in the cyber arena with approximately $2 billion in 2009 sales across a diverse customer base, including the Pentagon, Homeland Security and the commercial markets.
As prime contractor on many sophisticated national Cyber security programs, we employ more than 50% of U.S.-cleared digital forensics investigators. Government agencies and private corporations alike will spend billions to protect and defend their networks in the years ahead. General Dynamics will be a major part of that fast-growing market.
The IS&T group, by leveraging its current capabilities to capture new business in faster growing market segments, has the opportunity to deliver steady growth over the next several years. Each of the group's businesses remain focused on maintaining their competitive edge by aggressively cutting costs, encouraging continuous improvement initiatives and selectively pursuing those opportunities that offer the most attractive returns.
Combat Systems. Combat Systems sales were $2.1 billion in the third quarter. This result represented less volume than the year-ago quarter primarily in vehicle modifications, combat logistic support and development programs. Year-to-date, over 50% of the group's sales decline is related to last MRAP volume and less engineering work, which is largely the result of a cancellation of future Combat Systems. 
Despite a reduction in sales, earnings were essentially flat with last year's third quarter as margins expanded in several of our businesses. The 150 basis point year-over-year margin improvement is the result of strong operating performance and less engineering and development content.
Total backlog for Combat Systems was essentially unchanged from second quarter at $12.8 billion. Notable orders in the quarter included approximately $475 million for Stryker vehicles and Abrams tanks, $80 million for Iraqi tank logistic support, $260 million for reactive armor, guns and biological detection systems and a $120 million award to supply ammunition to the Canadian Armed Forces.
Because of the success of Stryker double-V hull testing, we received another series of orders for the new hulls subsequent to the quarter. Double-V modifications of the current Stryker fleet remain another promising opportunity. We were also notified earlier this month that our U.S. Vehicle business was selected to negotiate a contract to produce Merkava APC main hulls and kits for the Israeli government. We expect to add this program to backlog in the first half of next year and we'll deliver these hulls over the next several years.
We made progress on several international programs in the quarter, delivering the first of 140 Iraqi tanks, finalizing preparations for FMS LAV production and progressing through Canadian LAV upgrade engineering work. Despite this progress, international sales are coming more slowly than anticipated but should grow more significantly in 2011. Consistent with my earlier report, a number of international programs have been slowed by their country's financial status, but none have been canceled or withdrawn. 
Combat expects to book several additional international orders in the fourth quarter including an FMS LAV order totaling $250 million, the first production contract for an FMS tank upgrade program totaling $300 million and a $100 million order for German EAGLE vehicles.
In the first half of 2011, we expect to add the first tranche of production funding for the $850 million Canadian LAV upgrade program to the backlog. The pacing of U.S. awards has also lagged our expectations this year. Some of the awards expected in the first half including armor and biological detection systems came late in the third quarter and will result in lower sales than previously expected in 2010. Other program awards, most notably the ground combat vehicle competition, were pushed out until 2011. Looking forward for the group, sales in the fourth quarter will be this year's strongest by far. For the full year, I expect the group's sales to be around $9 billion. 
My expectation for the group's full-year earnings remain unchanged. Margins, therefore, will be around 14%, 40 to 50 basis points higher than my prior guidance. This margin performance is the result of strong operational execution in the first nine months of the year and a favorable program mix that includes less development and initial- stage international work than originally anticipated.
As we look ahead, Combat's international opportunities, combined with current backlog, provide relative top line stability as international workload mitigates some slowing in our U.S. programs. The group's mature program mix will result in attractive margins and cash flow for the next several years.
Marine systems. The Marine Systems group had another good quarter with sales of $1.7 billion, up 12% over the year-ago period and 4% sequentially. Earnings totaled $169 million, up 9% over last year and consistent with last quarter's results. Sales and earnings growth were driven by growing Virginia class volume and SSBN replacement design efforts. The group's third quarter operating margin was 9.9%, down modestly from both the year-ago period and the prior quarter due to mixed shift in our surface combatant programs. With that said, this operating margin exceeded my expectations due to particularly good performance at Electric Boat and NASSCO. Electric Boat's third quarter delivery of USS Missouri is representative of the focus on execution resident at each of our three ERs. EB delivered this submarine in a record 65 months, five months faster than any of the six prior Virginia class boats. Missouri required 600,000 fewer labor hours than EB's last Virginia-class sub and was 8% under target cost.
Marine's backlog totaled $20.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, down 3% from the end of last quarter. Despite this decline, the group booked several key orders in the quarter including funding for Bath Iron Works to continue providing management, engineering and detailed design developments for the DDG 51 program. NASSCO also received funding for advanced engineering and long lead materials for the new mobile landing platform, MLP. And in final contract negotiations with our customer, we expect to add several construction contracts to Bath's backlog in the first half of next year, including, DDG's 1001 and 1002, the second and third of the Zumwalt Class and DDG 115, the restart of the DDG 51 program.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, group sales will look similar to the third quarter with operating margins in the mid-9% range as the surface combatant mix shift at Bath Iron Works becomes more apparent. For the full year, sales should be up approximately 5% compared with last year and margins will be in the high-9% range, slightly better than my prior guidance. 
Looking ahead, our shipyards enjoy a healthy backlog and an attractive opportunity set. In addition to our Navy work, we continue to see renewed interest across the range of commercial shippers and anticipate that we can leverage our excellent commercial tanker performance to win new commericial work in 2011.
Over the next two to three years, you will see the potential for margin improvements as surface combatant fixed-price work builds, commercial ship building opportunities materialize and construction on two per year Virginia is realized.
Aerospace. The Aerospace group's third quarter results were marked by improved order activity, service volume and operational performance. Group sales were nearly $1.3 billion, up 15% from last year's third quarter due to more green aircraft deliveries and higher services volume. Earnings were $199 million, a nearly 60% increase over the same period last year while margins were 15.4%, a 420 basis point improvement.
When compared with this year's second quarter, sales, earnings and margins were down due to the two-week furlough at Gulfstream, which caused fewer green deliveries and the timing of R&D costs. I expect sales, earnings and margins to show improvement in the fourth quarter.
The business jet market, particularly in the large cabin long-range segment, continue to make strides toward recovery in the third quarter, including further reduction in preowned aircraft levels.
Gulfstream took one preowned aircraft in trade this quarter and sold two aircraft for a modest profit. At the end of the quarter, Gulfstream had no preowned aircraft in inventory.
Customer interest remains healthy as Gulfstream booked more orders in the third quarter than in any quarter since the economic downturn began in mid-2008. On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated book-to-bill was 1.2x. Orders handily outpaced defaults resulting in a modest 1% decline in the backlog from the end of the second quarter. The group's backlog remains a robust $17.6 billion.
In addition to current backlog, our pipeline of new opportunities remains strong. We continue to experience strong international order activity and interest, particularly in emerging markets. In the quarter, Latin America and Asia-Pacific represented nearly 1/3 of order activity and now comprise over 40% of backlog. Recent orders span the entirety of our in production and new aircraft portfolio.
Flying hours improved again this quarter, a reality that helped Gulfstream service facilities enjoy their highest quarterly volume ever. Year-to-date, Gulfstream's service business is up 18.5%. Beyond improved utilization figures and a growing installed fleet, Gulfstream's service volumes reflects their unwavering commitment to provide a best-in-class support.
In the quarter, Gulfstream's large cabin business jets were voted number one for the eighth consecutive year in the annual AIA Product Support survey. Jet Aviation Service business has also enjoyed healthy growth this year, up nearly 10% year-to-date. As the international install fleet grows, we are adapting by growing our Product Support organization, which is the largest in the industry today. Jet continues to enhance its service offerings across the globe with particular emphasis in Asia, a region whose installed base promises to grow rapidly over the next several years.
Although Jet's service-related sales were up in the quarter, overall volume was down modestly from last quarter on lower completion revenue. Business Jet completions work has been lighter this year as OEMs delivered fewer aircraft. Conversely, the narrow-body, wide-body pipeline remains robust. And Jet signed agreements to complete three more of these aircraft in August. Jet continues to take steps to improve profitability including consolidating its U.S. completions and MRO operations at its Cahokia, Illinois facility near St. Louis. 
Planned deliveries for large cabin aircraft are on track, at 75 this year. Mid-cabin orders were more plentiful than anticipated in the quarter and I now expect the total approaching 30 this year, several more than I guided you to in July. We continue to make exciting progress on the product development front. With three G250 aircraft and four, soon to be five, G650 aircraft in flight test, we are on glide slope toward 2011, FAA IASA certification for both aircraft. In fact, recently, the fourth G650 test article and the first ever Gulfstream test article with a fully-outfitted interior, flew the fastest ultra-range, long-range flight ever flown by a business jet. This is a compelling demonstration of the G650's exceptional high-speed cruise capabilities. That was 5,000 nautical miles at 0.9 Mach in nine hours and 45 minutes. Both aircraft flew to NBAA in Atlanta, Georgia last week, with the G250 making its maiden transatlantic voyage en route. 
For the full year, I expect the Aerospace group's sales to be up mid-single-digit above last year, slightly higher than my prior guidance, due to better than anticipated service volume. Operating margins will also be better than previously anticipated, close to 16%. 
As we look to the future, the group will enjoy steady top line growth, driven by new product introduction and improving service volume. We will continue to manage this business with great discipline on the up cycle as we did through the down. 
In summary, General Dynamics continues to perform well and remains positioned for a good fourth quarter. For the year, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $6.70 to $6.75, an increase from my prior guidance. As we look toward 2011, the Defense and Aerospace markets remain dynamic. Amidst the uncertainty of a fast-changing marketplace and budget adjustments, we remain focused on execution as we believe this will enable us to leverage our incumbency to win new opportunities. Our Defense backlog already includes a solid order book for next year and we are encouraged by the Congressional support our programs have received in the 2011 Defense budget appropriations process. 
Consequently, as we look to the future, I believe General Dynamics will offer a sustaining Defense business with excellent operating margins and strong free cash flow. In addition, our Aerospace business will be the growth engine throughout the near and intermediate timeframe. We are aggressively managing our businesses for profitability, with continued emphasis on earnings growth and efficient conversion of earnings to cash. Our strong balance sheet and excellent cash outlook afford us tremendous flexibility to continue deploying capital in a balanced manner in order to create the greatest long-term value for our shareholders.
And with that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?"

I'll start with some observations about our cash performance and financing activities. As you know, we experienced growth in working capital through the first half of the year due to timing of contract payments,",349,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some observations about our cash performance and financing activities. As you know, we experienced growth in working capital through the first half of the year due to timing of contract payments, particularly in our IS&T business. Continued focus on this area has begun to yield positive results. In the third quarter, we reversed the trend and trimmed 2010 OWC growth by 1/3. You can see the impact of that effort and the impact that had on strong free cash flow performance in the quarter. In addition, as Jay noted, we repaid $700 million of fixed rate notes in the third quarter. As a result of strong free cash flow and debt repayment, we've reduced our net debt by almost $400 million in the quarter. This leaves us at the end of the third quarter with a strong balance sheet and a debt to equity ratio of just under 24%. With the third quarter debt repayment, we're expecting net interest expense for the year of between $155 million to $160 million, consistent with our previous guidance but probably toward the lower end of that range. I should point out that in 2011, we're planning a $750 million debt repayment and a $300 million pension contribution, very similar to the debt repayment in the pension contribution made in 2010.
Finally, a quick note on our tax rate. I previously guided you to a range which was as low as 31.2%. That range was predicated largely on a then in process 2009 tax return. As we finalized the return in the third quarter, we identified some additional R&D tax credits that drove the rate to the lower end of our range. At this point, we're forecasting an effective rate of 31.2% for the year with some opportunity to improve. That compares with the full year rate of 31.5% last year. The tax rate in the third quarter reflects the true up to the reduced full year rate. 
That completes my remarks and I'll turn it back to Amy to begin the Q&A."

So that will be an ever-growing and you know we're passing through LRIP and WIN-T and we're expecting an LRIP decision on JTRS here within the next two quarters, I think. So that business will continue to mature and develop going forward. The IT Services piece for us is very, very good business, both in the infrastructure, the support, the healthcare, IT. So we've got many opportunities across what I'd call a diverse growth portfolio in IT. And with that, we've got our ISR that I talked about, which is 20% of the portfolio, but again, in recognized and necessary fast current in both DoD space and frankly, in agency space and commercial applications. All around that, cyber, which will take a big tent with lots of players in it for as long as the eye can see, we believe, and we're well grounded in cyber, as I mentioned in my remarks.

So we've got a great team doing superb work across a global scale here. I'm very proud of them. Now as to the sales, attendant to that performance, we had, as you know, a very, what I would call with a clarity of hindsight, a very aggressive sales plan at the start of the year, which has been softened by the reality, mostly timing realities of the world scene. So I would tell you that the first half of the year, in terms of sales growth, if you will, pretty much happened the way we thought it would, and I think I've been saying all along that we were heavily loaded to the second half of the year, which is not terribly unusual for Combat, but it was more so this year than I think perhaps historically. So we're heavily loaded to the second half of the year. I would tell you, in addition to what I said in my remarks about year-over-year comparisons with MRAP volume growing away and NCSD being canceled, a lot of what we are seeing, Howard, is just the timing of these programs. The indigenous vehicle programs, we are seeing the European sovereign debt realities impact us in Spain with the 8x8 competition that was going to happen this year has been moved into the mid-year of 2011 but reaffirmed by the Spanish Ministry of Defense as being essential to the Spanish Army. So we believe that one will still come. There are others in Portugal and other European countries that have pushed out a little bit, prolonging contract negotiations. I am sure things, if you will, the Canadian LAV is probably the best example of that, $850 million, I mentioned it in my remarks. It's happening, as we speak, we're in development, contract execution right now. We'll get the production contract in 2011 and off we go. And oh, by the way there, Howard, I should just mentioned on the Canadian side, when we talk about that LAV upgrade, we also talk about the technical Armored Patrol Vehicles and the CCV as downrange programs that are coming, but just in the last few days, it's been reaffirmed by my source with the Army chief up there, who basically ties this as a family of land combat vehicles that will all be, the RFPs for TAPV and CTV are going to happen this year, according to him, and so we'll be in production. Whoever gets that, will be in production from 2012 to 2015. So it's coming, it's just not here this year. Ditto with the UK Scout vehicle, which we're in contract right now on development, but it will be more to follow in the coming years. The International Vehicle Export business we've talked about before, the FMS LAVs and some of the tanks, we've got some of them, we've got more to come. Some of them we expect here in the fourth quarter. Would I bet everything on the fourth quarter? No. But if it's not in the fourth quarter, it will be in 2011. So it's all coming. The U.S. Vehicle business, we've had D-scope on some of the programs that we've talked about earlier in the year, Cougar MOD is one of them, the remote weapon system for Stryker is another one that comes to mind. We've had to lay our new programs like the GCV as I talked about and honestly, a little bit of lumpiness, I guess you could say, in kind of the reset and modification work on Stryker and Abrams as the force reconstitutes or repositions itself in some measures. And then on the Weapon Systems business, we've seen some delay as well. Armor is a classic example and then we had some softness in the commercial axle market and some of the aftermarket that goes with that, that actually is coming in now but anyway, I think that's probably more than you asked me for but to sum it all, I would say it was also a very strong order quarter for Combat which also bodes well, I think, for the rest of the year and for 2011. Historically, European Land Systems has been the strongest in the fourth quarter, I expect that to happen again this year."

As to the debt market, I know it's a favorite question that we get a lot, but I would just tell you that truly keeping with the way General Dynamics does business, which I like to think is very disciplined, we kind of don't go to the debt market unless we have a specific reason for going to the debt market. If I got a purpose in mind and we need to go, we've got plenty of access to go there, but we don't do it just to get some cash. We've got $2 billion in credit facilities, we're great cash generators, we have lots of cash on hand right now, and so we'll continue to generate more. It gives us the flexibility we need to be acquisitive, which we historically, as you know, have been and will continue to be as opportunities present themselves. So we're not inclined to go to the debt market for good deals because actually the commercial paper market right now, which we have got great access to, would give us more attractive rates than the debt market. We also retired our $700 million notes this year at par with essentially no economic cost to us. So we think we're managing that side in a pretty balanced manner."

And I'm being realistic in terms of how I think of Defense, it's not going to grow like it has been, very obviously. But we do believe that there may be some modest growth opportunity in there and what I cited and the fast curents in IS&T, are a classic example of that. On the Combat side, that's a steady business as we see it right now. We see a lot of 2011 already in program or record. And if you look at the United States Army, for example, and look at the 20-some heavy brigade combat teams and the seven going to eight and probably going to nine, Stryker Brigade Combat Teams with the former at 60 Abrams per brigade and the latter at 330-plus Strykers per brigade, that kid is not going to change out until you see a fundamental change in the forestructure of the United States Army. So we try to think of it in pragmatic terms, threat-based and core-based, if you will, and that really I think formed the core basis of my comments as much as anything, Joe. And on the Aerospace side, that is clearly a growth engine for everyone, I would say, in the industry, but particularly when you're driving the premier brand, the Gulfstream, with new products about to hit the street with 200-plus airplanes in the G650 queue, et cetera. So put all that together and you've got, I believe, a very steady, sustaining Defense business. Could things change? That depends on budgets and all the realities, but I still believe with everything I've got that the threat and the appetite for risk-taking at a national strategic level will drive the Defense budget as much as anything. Will there be pressure? Is there pressure? Good lord, yes. Will it tighten, it already is in every segment we deal with. There's no question about that, so we're not denying any of that. But we deal with it day by day, contract by contract, platform by platform, system by system and we think we deal with it very well."

General Dynamics delivered another solid operating performance in the third quarter with sales of $8 billion nearly 4% better than the same quarter a year ago. Operating earnings of $966 million were up 10.5% o",3093," Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics delivered another solid operating performance in the third quarter with sales of $8 billion nearly 4% better than the same quarter a year ago. Operating earnings of $966 million were up 10.5% over the year-ago quarter. Company margins improved 80 basis points to 12.1%. Earnings per share were $1.70 on a fully diluted basis, $0.22 better than last year's third quarter.
 Third quarter free cash flow, after capital expenditures, was $784 million, 121% of earnings from continuing operations. This includes a voluntary payment of $270 million to our pension plan. In terms of capital deployment, we used $700 million in the quarter to retire our 4.5% fixed rate notes. We also purchased 2.7 million shares of General Dynamics' stock in the open market for $163 million. Year-to-date, we have spent $726 million to repurchase 11.2 million shares. Through share repurchases and dividends, we have returned almost 90% of year-to-date free cash flow to shareholders.
 Third quarter orders were the strongest we've seen this year. Aerospace and IS&T's book to bill exceeded 1:1 while Combat's book to bill was nearly 1:1. At the end of the quarter, total backlog stood at a robust $61.8 billion.
 Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups, starting with the largest of our four businesses, IS&T. IS&T enjoyed strong orders, sales, earnings and margins in the third quarter. Sales were nearly $3 billion for the second consecutive quarter, an 8% increase over last year's third quarter. This is healthy growth in light of the fact that last year's third quarter was the group's highest sales quarter in 2009. Year-to-date, sales are up 7%. The group's third quarter earnings were $306 million up 3.4% year-over-year. Operating margins were 10.4% in the quarter, essentially in line with my 10.5% full year guidance.
 The group's book to bill exceeded 1x for the third consecutive quarter causing backlog to increase by $230 million. If the group maintains this win rate, as I expect, 2010 will stand as the 12th year that book-to-bill has been at or above 1x, an excellent track record for a business of this size and diversity.
 Award activity in the quarter was particularly strong at our tactical communications and IT services businesses. Several of these contracts are detailed in today's earnings press release. Total estimated contract value, which adds the potential value of IDIQ contracts to total backlog, stood at $24.9 billion at quarter-end. This represents well over 2x expected 2011 sales and a 5% increase above the year-ago value.
 Fourth quarter sales and margins will be essentially in line with the third quarter. For the full year, I expect group sales to increase approximately 8% to 8.5% over last year driven by double-digit sales growth in our Tactical Communications and Information Technology Services businesses. Margins for the year will remain around 10.5%.
 As we look to the future, IS&T is particularly well positioned. I want to spend a few minutes this morning giving you a sense for why. First, a few facts that highlight the group's diverse business base. Group sales are derived from thousands of contracts at any given time with no single contract totaling more than 2% of company sales. Approximately 40% of sales come from civil agencies, restricted, commercial and international customers. Product and systems integration dominate the group's efforts, representing over 50% of sales. The remaining sales consist of approximately 25% high-end engineering services and 20% pure IT service work. Nearly half of sales result from fixed price contracts while approximately 38% are cost plus and the remainder, time and materials.
 Over the past decade, we have evolved the group's products and services offerings into a balanced portfolio that remains at the forefront of Defense and Federal spending priorities. Let me briefly review the three key pieces of this business.
 First, Tactical Communications and Battle Space Management. This segment represents approximately only 45% of the group's sales and comprises a U.S. and a smaller U.K.-based business. The group's products and services provide critical command and control capability and enables secure, continuous communications all the way to the dismounted soldier. Programs include the Army's battlefield network, known as WIN-T and the new handheld software defined Joint Tactical Radio System unknown as JTRS HMS. We have dramatically diversified our overseas C4 business from a purely U.K.-based avionics house to a provider of vehicles, force protection, security, avionics and C4I products to a global clientele.
 Earlier this year, GD U.K. was awarded the development contract for the British Army scout reconnaissance vehicle. This program remains a top funding priority and was included as a component of the Army's future land forces in the U.K.'s recent strategic defense and security review.
 Next, Information Technology and Mission Services. Our IT services unit comprises a little over 1/3 of the group's sales. This business enjoys excellent market positions in the Defense Department and the intelligence community as a provider of IT infrastructure, simulation and training services and key mission support. This business also provides an array of IT Healthcare Services to military, federal and commercial customers.
 And finally, Intelligence, Surveillance And Reconnaissance, ISR systems. Comprising about 20% of IS&T sales, this business specializes in signals intelligence, tactical imagery and information collection, processing, exploitation and distribution.
 In 2009, as many of you know, we added Access to this unit. As a best in class supplier of high-performance electrical optical and infrared sensors and systems, Access provides sensor components that enhance the ability of war fighters and government agencies alike to provide timely, actionable intelligence.
 Although not a designated business unit within IS&T, Cyber security encompasses core capabilities resident in each of our businesses including encryption and information assurance, network security and forensics. General Dynamics is a market leader in the cyber arena with approximately $2 billion in 2009 sales across a diversed customer base, including the Pentagon, homeland security and the commercial markets.
 As prime contractor on many sophisticated national Cyber security programs, we employ more than 50% of U.S. cleared digital forensics investigators. Government agencies and private corporations alike will spend billions to protect and defend their networks in the years ahead. General Dynamics will be a major part of that fast-growing market.
 The IS&T group, by leveraging its current capabilities to capture new business in faster growing market segments, has the opportunity to deliver steady growth over the next several years. Each of the group's businesses remain focused on maintaining their competitive edge by aggressively cutting costs, encouraging continues improvement initiatives and selectively pursuing those opportunities that offer the most attractive returns.
 Combat Systems. Combat Systems sales were $2.1 billion in the third quarter. This result represented less volume than the year-ago quarter primarily in vehicle modifications, combat logistic support and development programs. Year-to-date, over 50% of the group's sales decline is related to last MRAP volume and less engineering work which is largely the result of the cancellation of future Combat Systems.
 Despite a reduction in sales, earnings were essentially flat with last year's third quarter as margins expanded in several of our businesses. The 150 basis point year-over-year margin improvement is the result of strong operating performance and less engineering and development content.
 Total backlog for Combat Systems was essentially unchanged from second quarter at $12.8 billion. Notable orders in the quarter included approximately $475 million for Stryker vehicles and Abrams tanks, $80 million for Iraqi tank logistic support, $260 million for reactive armor, guns and biological detection systems and a $120 million award to supply ammunition to the Canadian Armed Forces.
 Because of the success of Stryker double-V hull testing, we received another series of orders for the new hulls subsequent to the quarter. Double-V modifications of the current Stryker fleet remain another promising opportunity. We were also notified earlier this month that our U.S. Vehicle business was selected to negotiate a contract to produce Merkava APC main hulls and kits for the Israeli government. We expect to add this program to backlog in the first half of next year and we'll deliver these hulls over the next overall years.
 We made progress on several international programs in the quarter delivering the first of 140 Iraqi tanks, finalizing preparations for FMS LAV productions and progressing through Canadian LAV upgrade engineering work. Despite these progress, international sales are coming more slowly than anticipated but should grow more significantly in 2011. Consistent with my earlier report, a number of international programs have been slowed by their country's financial status, but none have been canceled or withdrawn.
 Combat expects to book several additional international orders in the fourth quarter including an FMS LAV order totaling $250 million, the first production contract for an FMS tank upgrade program totaling $300 million and a $100 million order for German EAGLE vehicles.
 In the first half of 2011, we expect to add the first tranche of production funding for the $850 million Canadian LAV upgrade program to the backlog. The pacing of U.S. awards has also lagged our expectations this year. Some of the awards expected in the first half including armor and biological detection systems came late in the third quarter and will result in lower sales than previously expected in 2010. Other program awards, most notably the ground combat vehicle competition, will push out until 2011. Looking forward for the group, sales in the fourth quarter will be this year's strongest by far. For the full year, I expect the group's sales to be around $9 billion.
 My expectation for the group's full-year earnings remain unchanged. Margins, therefore, will be around 14%, 40 to 50 basis points higher than my prior guidance. This margin performance is the result of strong operational execution in the first nine months of the year and a favorable program mix that includes less development and initial stage international work than originally anticipated.
 As we look ahead, combat's international opportunities, combined with current backlog, provide relative top line stability as international workflow mitigates some slowing in our U.S. programs. The group's mature program mix will result in attractive margins and cash flow for the next several years.
 Marine systems. The Marine Systems group had another good quarter with sales of $1.7 billion, up 12% over the year-ago period and 4% sequentially. Earnings totaled $169 million, up 9% over last year and consistent with last quarter's results. Sales and earnings growth were driven by growing Virginia class volume and SSBN replacement design efforts. The group's third quarter operating margin was 9.9%, down modestly from both the year-ago period and the prior quarter due to mixed shift in our surface combatant programs. With that said, this operating margin exceeded my expectations due to particularly good performance at Electric Boat and NASSCO. Electric Boat's third quarter delivery of USS Missouri is representative of the focus on execution resident at each of our three ERs. EB delivered this submarine in a record 65 months, five months faster than any of the six prior Virginia class boats. Missouri required 600,000 fewer labor hours than EB's last Virginia class sub and was 8% under target cost.
 Marines backlog totaled $20.6 billion at the end of the third quarter down 3% from the end of last quarter. Despite this decline, the group booked several key orders in the quarter including funding for Bath Iron Works to continue providing management, engineering and detailed design developments for the DDG 51 program. NASSCO also received funding for advanced engineering and long lead materials for the new mobile landing platform, MLP. And in final contract negotiations with our customer, we expect to add several construction contract to vast backlog in the first half of next year, including, the DDG's 1001 and 1002, the second and third of the Zumwalt Class and the DDG 115, the restart of the DDG 51 program.
 Looking forward to the fourth quarter, group sales will look similar to the third quarter with operating margins in the mid-9% range as the surface combatants mix shift of Bath Iron Works becomes more apparent. For the full year, sales should be up approximately 5% compared with last year and margins will be in the high-9% range, slightly better than my prior guidance.
 Looking ahead, our shipyards enjoy a healthy backlog and an attractive opportunity set. In addition to our Navy work, we continue to see renewed interest across the range of commercial shippers and anticipate that we can leverage our excellent commercial tanker performance to win new commericial work in 2011.
 Over the next two to three years, you will see the potential for margin improvements as surface combatant fixed-price work builds, commercial ship building opportunities materialize and construction on two per year Virginia is realized.
 Aerospace. The Aerospace group's third quarter results were marked by improved order activity, service volume and operational performance. Group sales were nearly $1.3 billion, up 15% from last year's third quarter due to more green aircraft deliveries and higher services volume. Earnings were $199 million, a nearly 60% increase over the same period last year while margins were 15.4%, a 420 basis point improvement.
 When compared with this year's second quarter, sales, earnings and margins were down due to the two-week furlough at Gulfstream, which caused fewer green deliveries and the timing of R&D cost. I expect sales, earnings and margins to show improvement in the fourth quarter.
 The business jet market, particularly in the large cabin long-range segment, continue to make strides toward recovery in the third quarter, including further reduction in preowned aircraft levels.
 Gulfstream took one preowned aircraft and trade this quarter and sold two aircraft for a modest profit. At the end of the quarter, Gulfstream had no preowned aircraft in inventory.
 Customer interest remains healthy as Gulfstream booked more orders in the third quarter than in any quarter since the economic downturn began in mid-2008. On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated book-to-bill was a 1.2x. Orders handily outpaced defaults resulting in a modest 1% decline in the backlog from the end of the second quarter. The group's backlog remains a robust $17.6 billion.
 In addition to current backlog, our pipeline of new opportunities remain strong. We continued to experience strong international order activity and interest, particularly in the emerging markets. In the quarter, Latin America and Asia-Pacific represented nearly 1/3 of order activity and now comprise over 40% of backlog. Recent orders span the entirety of our in production and new aircraft portfolio.
 Flying hours improved again this quarter, a reality that helped Gulfstream service facilities enjoy their highest quarterly volume ever. Year-to-date, Gulfstream's service business is up 18.5%. Beyond improved utilization figures and a growing installed fleet, Gulfstream service volumes reflects their unwavering commitment to provide a best-in-class support.
 In the quarter, Gulfstream's large cabin business jets were voted number one for the eighth consecutive year in the annual AIA Product Support survey. Jet Aviation Service business has also enjoyed healthy growth this year, up nearly 10% year-to-date. As the international install fleet grows, we are adapting by growing our Product Support organization, which is the largest in the industry today. Jet continues to enhance its service offerings across the globe with particular emphasis in Asia, a region whose installed base promises to grow rapidly over the next several years.
 Although Jet's service related sales were up in the quarter, overall volume was down modestly from last quarter on lower completion revenue. Business jet completions work has been lighter this year as OEMs delivered fewer aircraft. Conversely, the narrow-body wide-body pipeline remains robust. And Jet signed agreements to complete three more of these aircraft in August. Jet continues to take steps to improve probability including consolidating its U.S. completions and MRO operations at its Skokie, Illinois facility near St. Louis.
 Planned deliveries for large cabin aircraft are on track at 75 this year. Mid-cabin orders were more plentiful than anticipated in the quarter and I now expect the total approaching 30 this year, several more than I guided you to in July. We continue to make exciting progress on the product development front. With three G250 aircraft and four soon to be five, G650 aircraft in flight test, we are on glide slope toward 2011 FAA IASA certification for both aircraft. In fact, recently, the fourth G650 test article and the first ever Gulfstream test article with a fully-outfitted interior, flew the fastest ultra range, long-range flight ever flown by a business jet. This is a compelling demonstration of the G650's exceptional high-speed cruise capabilities. That was 5,000 nautical miles at 0.9 mach in nine hours and 45 minutes.  Both aircraft flew to NBAA in Atlanta, Georgia last week, with the G250 making its maiden transatlantic voyage en route.
 For the full year, I expect the Aerospace group sales to be up mid-single-digit above last year, slightly higher than my prior guidance due to better than anticipated service volume. Operating margins will also be better than previously anticipated, close to 16%.
 As we look to the future, the group will enjoy steady top line growth, driven by new product introduction and improving service volume. We will continue to manage this business with great discipline on the up cycle as we did through the down.
 In summary, General Dynamics continues to perform well and remains positioned for a good fourth quarter. For the year, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $6.70 to $6.75, an increase from my prior guidance. As we look toward 2011, the defense and Aerospace markets remain dynamic. Amidst the uncertainty of a fast changing market place and budget adjustments, we remain focused on execution as we believe this will enable us to leverage our incumbency to win new opportunities. Our defense backlog already includes a solid order book for next year and we are encouraged by the Congressional support our programs have received in the 2011 defense budget appropriations process.
 Consequently, as we look to the future, I believe General Dynamics will offer a sustaining Defense business with excellent operating margins and strong free cash flow. In addition, our Aerospace business will be the growth engine throughout the near and intermediate timeframe. We are aggressively managing our businesses for profitability, with continued emphasis on earnings growth and efficient conversion of earnings to cash. Our strong balance sheet and excellent cash outlook afford us to tremendous flexibility to continue deploying capital in a balanced manner in order to create the greatest long-term value for our shareholders.
 And with that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?

I'll start with some observations about our cash performance and financing activities. As you know, we experienced growth in working capital through the first half of the year due to timing of contract payments, particularly in our IS&T business. Continued focus on this area has begun to yield positive results. In the third quarter, we reversed the trend and trimmed 2010 OWC growth by 1/3. You can see the impact of that effort and the impact that had on strong free cash flow performance in the quarter. In addition, as Jay noted, we repaid $700 million of fixed rate Notes in the third quarter. As a result of strong free cash flow and debt repayment, we've reduced our net debt by almost $400 million in the quarter. This leaves us at the end of the third quarter with a strong balance sheet and a debt to equity ratio of just under 24%. With the third quarter debt repayment, we're expecting net interest expense for the year of between $155 million to $160 million, consistent with our previous guidance but probably toward the lower end of that range. I should point out that in 2011, we're planning a $750 million debt repayment and a $300 million pension contribution, very similar to the debt repayment in the pension contribution made in 2010.
 Finally, a quick note on our tax rate, I previously guided you to a range, which was as low as 31.2%. That range was predicated largely on a then in process of 2009 tax return. As we finalized the return in the third quarter, we identified some additional R&D tax credits that drove the rate to the lower end of our range. At this point, we're forecasting an effective rate of 31.2% for the year with some opportunity to improve.  That compares with the full year rate of 31.5% last year. The tax rate in the third quarter reflects the true up to the reduced full year rate.
 That completes my remarks and I'll turn it back to Amy to begin the Q&A.

I mean the battle space management, technical communications piece, as I described, which is what, 45% of the business, really in one instance is the core network communication systems for the United States Army in the 21st century going forward. So that will be an ever-growing and you know we're passing through LRIP and WIN-T and we're expecting an LRIP decision on JTRS here within the next two quarters, I think. So that business will continue to mature and develop going forward. The IT services piece for us is very, very good business, both in the infrastructure, the support, the healthcare, IT. So we've got many opportunities across what I'd call a diverse growth portfolio in IT. And with that, we've got our ISR that I talked about which is 20% of the portfolio but again, it recognized and necessary fast current in both DoD space and frankly, in agency space and commercial applications. All around that, cyber, which will take a big tent with lots of players in it for as long as the eye can see, we believe, and we're well grounded in cyber, as I mentioned in my remarks.

So we've got a great team doing superb work across a global scale here. I'm very proud of them. Now as to the sales, a tendency of that performance, we had as you know, a very, what I would call with a clarity of hindsight, a very aggressive sales plan at the start of the year, which has been softened by the reality, mostly timing realities of the world scene. So I would tell you that the first half of the year, in terms of sales growth, if you will, pretty much happened the way we thought it would and I think I've been saying all along that we were heavily loaded to the second half of the year, which is not terribly unusual for combat, but it was more so this year than I think perhaps historically. So we we're heavily loaded to the second half of the year. I would tell you, in addition to what I said in my remarks about year-over-year comparisons with MRAP volume growing away and NCSD being canceled, a lot of what we are seeing, Howard, is just the timing of these programs. The indigenous vehicle programs we are seeing the European sovereign debt realities impact us in Spain with the 8x8 competition that was going to happen this year has been moved into the mid year of 2011 but reaffirmed by the Spanish Ministry of Defense has being essential to the Spanish Army. so we believe that one will still come. There others in Portugal and other European countries that have pushed out a little bit, prolonging contract negotiations. I am sure things, if you will, the Canadian LAV is probably the best example of that, $850 million, I mentioned it in my remarks. It's happening, as we speak, we're in development, contract execution right now. We'll get the production contract in 2011 and off we go. And by the way there, Howard, I should just mentioned on the Canadian side, when  we talk about that LAV upgrade, we also talk about the technical Armored Patrol Vehicles and the CCV as a downrange programs that are coming, but just in the last few days, it's been reaffirmed by my source with the Army chief up there, basically ties this as a family of land combat vehicles that will all be, the RFPs for TAPV CTV are going to happen this year according to him and so we'll be in production, whoever gets that will be in production from 2012 to 2015. So it's coming, it's just not here this year. With the UK scout vehicle, which in contract right now on development but it will be more to follow in the coming years. The international vehicle export business we've talked about before, the FMS LAVs and some of the tanks, we've got some of them, we've got more to come. Some of them we expect here in the fourth quarter. Would I bet everything on the fourth quarter, no. But if it's not in the fourth quarter, it will be in 2011. So it's all coming. The U.S. vehicle business, we've had D-scope on some of the programs that we've talked about earlier in the year, Cougar MOD is one of them, the remote weapon system for Stryker is another one that comes to mind. We've had to lay our new programs like the GCV as I talked about and honestly, a little bit of lumpiness, I guess you could say, in kind of the reset and modification work on Stryker and Abrams as the force reconstitutes or repositions itself in some measures. And then on the weapon systems business, we've seen some delay as well. Armor is a classic example and then we had some softness in the commercial axle market and some of the aftermarket that goes with that actually is coming in now but anyway, I think that's probably more than you ask me for but to sum it all, I would say it was also a very strong order quarter for combat which also bodes well, I think, for the rest of the year and for 2011. Historically, European Land Systems has been the strongest in the fourth quarter, I expect that to happen again this year.

As to do debt market, I know it's a favorite question that we get a lot, but I would just tell you that truly keeping with the way General Dynamics does business, which I'd like to think is very disciplined, we kind of don't go to the debt market unless we have a specific reason for going to the debt market. If I got a purpose in mind that we need to go, we've got plenty of access to go there but we don't do it just to get some cash. We've got $2 billion in credit facilities, we're great cash generators, we have lots of cash on hand right now and so we'll continue to generate more. It gives us the flexibility we need to be acquisitive, which we historically as you know have been and will continue to be as opportunities present themselves. So we're not inclined to go to the debt market for good deals because actually the commercial paper market right now, which we have got great access to, would give us more attractive rates than the debt market. We also retired our $700 million notes this year at par with essentially no economic cost to us. So we think we're managing that size in a pretty balanced manner.

And on the Aerospace side, that is clearly a growth engine for everyone, I would say, in the industry but particularly when you're driving the premier brand, the Gulfstream with new products about to hit the street with 200 plus airplanes in the G650 queue, et cetera. So put all that together and you've got, I believe, a very steady, sustaining Defense business. Could things change? That depends on budgets and all the realities, but I still believe with everything I've got that the threat and the appetite for risk taking at a national strategic level will drive the defense budget as much as anything. Will there be pressure? Is there pressure? Good lord, yes. Will it tighten, it already is in every segment we deal with. There's no question about that so we're not denying any of that. But we deal with it day by day, contract by contract, platform by platform, system by system and we think we deal with it very well.

General Dynamics finished 2009 with a very good fourth quarter marked by strong operational performance, excellent cash flow and the achievement of several key milestones. Sales in the quarter were $7.9 billion,",1909,"Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics finished 2009 with a very good fourth quarter marked by strong operational performance, excellent cash flow and the achievement of several key milestones. Sales in the quarter were $7.9 billion, up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2008 but somewhat lighter than I had anticipated, primarily because of timing on several international vehicle contracts and the delayed passage of the 2010 Defense Bill.
Net earnings from continuing operations were $618 million or $1.58 per fully diluted share. In the quarter, we achieved the 12% company-wide operating margin, our best performance in 2009. For the full year, sales were nearly $32 billion, a 9% increase over 2008 driven entirely by our Defense businesses. Demand for our Defense products and services generated 12.7% top line growth, more than offsetting the 6% decline at Aerospace. Nearly 10% of the growth in our Defense businesses was organic.
2009 earnings from continuing operations were $2.4 billion or $6.20 per fully diluted shares. Operating earnings totaled $3.7 billion in 2009, with Combat Systems and IS&T both topping $1 billion of EBIT. I should also highlight that Marine Systems delivered their best ever earnings performance, and Aerospace exceeded $700 million in earnings, an impressive performance in a very challenging market environment.
Free cash flow after capital expenditures totaled $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Each of the business groups contributed to this excellent fourth quarter results, which brought total cash for the year to $2.5 billion or 103% of earnings from continuing operations. This included a pension contribution of nearly $250 million.
Fourth quarter orders reached $7.4 billion, the strongest quarter this year. General Dynamics finished 2009 with a total backlog of $65.5 billion, more than two times annual sales. Total potential contract value, which includes backlog, unexercised options and indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity IDIQ contracts totaled $83 billion. Now I'd like to focus on the performance and outlook for each of our business segments, starting with our three defense groups.
First, Combat. Combat Systems had a very successful fourth quarter. Sales were $2.5 billion, 6.6% higher than the fourth quarter of 2008 due primarily to increased Stryker, Abrams, Armor and Weapon Systems volume. Double-digit earnings growth in the fourth quarter was the result of 14.8% margins, 160 basis points of improvement over last year's fourth quarter. Margin performance resulted from increased booking rates on several of our U.S. and European vehicle programs and a more favorable mix' in our Guns and Weapons Systems business. 
For the full year, sales were up 17.7% compared with 2008, including 12.5% organic sales growth. The group's organic growth was driven by Stryker, Abrams and European vehicle volumes. The remainder of the growth came from AxleTech.
While I am pleased with this double-digit growth, I had anticipated over 20% sales growth. The difference is the result of timing on several contract awards in year end vehicle deliveries. For the year, the group generated operating earnings in excess of $1.2 billion, margins were 13.1%, 50 basis points lower than 2008 due to mix shift. Year-end backlog for Combat Systems totaled $13.4 billion, of which $11.4 billion is fully funded.
Fourth quarter orders, which totaled over $3 billion were greater than sales, causing backlog to grow $500 million from the third to the fourth quarter. Foreign Military Sales contract were particularly strong in the fourth quarter, including $160 million for Iraqi tank upgrades, $18 million for Saudi Arabian tank work and $2.2 billion for Light Armored Vehicles. These international programs will begin to take hold in 2010, with growing volumes over the next several years.
The group also made significant progress towards several future opportunities in the fourth quarter. In early November, our JLTV [Joint Light Tactical Vehicle] became the first vehicle to successfully complete critical design review with our first prototypes due to be delivered to our customers this spring. Additionally, our European Land Systems group, led by General Dynamics U.K., submitted its first bid to provide the British army's next-generation reconnaissance armored fighting vehicles. European Land System is also bidding on the Spanish program for several hundred 8x8 armored vehicles. For this year, based on the strength of our backlog and continued support for our core programs, I expect Combat Systems to deliver 4% to 5% sales growth with operating margins in the high 12% range. 
Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group finished their best year with another very good quarter. Quarterly sales totaled $1.6 billion, a 12.4% increase over 2008, and operating earnings increased 18.2% to $156 million. This quarter's double-digit sales and earnings growth is particularly impressive since the same quarter a year ago saw sales and earnings growth 13.3% and 30.7%, respectively when compared with 2007. Virginia Class Submarine and repair volume drove revenue growth, and increased booking rates on several programs drove earnings improvement. The group's 10.1% margins in the fourth quarter were up 50 basis points over fourth quarter 2008. For the full year, sales and operating earnings increased 14.5% and 23.2%, respectively. Margins for the full year were 10.1%, a noteworthy accomplishment resulting from hard work and sustained disciplined execution in all three shipyards.
Marine's U.N. backlog totaled $22.5 billion, down from year end 2008 but robust by any measure. We anticipate adding orders for several ships in the first half of 2010 including, T-AKE's 13 and 14, DDG's-1001 and 1002 [ph]  And advance procurement for another DDG-51 destroyer. For this year, I expect Marine Systems sales growth to be between 7% and 8%. Margins will degrade somewhat maybe in the mid-9% range as the group experiences some mix shift in the surface combatant workload.
IS&T. Fourth quarter sales in the IS&T group were $2.7 billion, a 2.8% increase over the same quarter last year. Margin rates increased 80 basis points, causing earnings to grow 11.5% compared to fourth quarter 2008. Margin improvement was particularly strong at our Tactical Communications and ISR businesses. Sales for the full year grew 7.6%, while operating earnings grew 7.1%. Organic sales growth was 4.4%. The group's 2009 margin rate was constant at 10.7%, a very good result.
Demand for products across the group's portfolio continued in the fourth quarter, resulting in over $2.3 billion in new orders. IS&T's year-end backlog totaled $10.3 billion, up slightly from fourth quarter 2008. Total potential contract value, backlog and estimated potential contract value under IDIQ contracts grew 12.9% through 2009 to $23.1 billion at year-end, positioning IS&T for another successful year in 2010. Sales growth in 2010 should be between 8% and 9%, while margins will be in the mid-10% range.
Now before moving to the Aerospace group, let me comment briefly on our overall Defense outlook. 2009 was clearly a successful year for our Defense businesses. Operating performance was very good, and we will continue to build on those successes moving forward. Execution remains paramount. The 2010 Defense Bill passed in late December fully supported our core programs, positioning our Defense business for success in the year ahead. Most of our procurement programs were funded in the 2010 base budgets, as supplemental funding targeted the operations and maintenance requirements. In the coming weeks, we will get more detailed insight in the defense funding priorities and requirements for the next several years. I am confident that GD will fare well. Our products are at the center of today's fight, and we will continue to evolve our offerings to address changing war fighting requirements in a way that is affordable to our customer.
Now let's move to Aerospace. The Aerospace group finished an exceedingly difficult year with a solid fourth quarter. Several of the quarter highlights include: Continued strength in order activity, substantially fewer customer defaults, improved service volume and the first flights of our new G250 and G650 aircraft. The group's fourth quarter sales were $1.2 billion, and operating earnings were $167 million. While sales and earnings were down significantly when compared to fourth quarter 2008, sales were up 5.4%, and operating earnings were up 33.6% compared with third quarter 2009.
The group's 14.1% operating margin was up 290 basis points from third quarter 2009 due to a better delivery mix and improved pricing in the Services business. For the full year, sales were $5.2 billion, down 6.2% from 2008. The sales decline resulted from fewer green-aircraft deliveries and a 15% reduction in our Services business, somewhat offset by the addition of a full year of Jet Aviation. Operating earnings for the year were $707 million, and margins were 13.7%. While earnings and margins were also down from 2008, they were outstanding given the environment. These are the earnings of the market leader.
Gulfstream's proactive approach to managing production and internally driven cost-cutting initiatives protected profitability in an unpredictable and decidedly difficult market. All indications point to continued market improvement in 2010. The improved trend in flying hours in the third quarter of 2009 held through year end, and our service centers continue to work full weeks. Pre-owned inventory levels are continuing to decline, particularly for large cabin models. We have four remaining pre-owned aircraft in inventory, after selling one in the fourth quarter and taking one in trade. In 2010, our aircraft deliveries include potential trade-in options for nine pre-owned aircraft.
Orders outpaced deliveries again in the quarter, and customer defaults slowed significantly. New aircraft book to bill was 1.47x on a dollar-denominated basis, leading to a slight increase in backlog. Backlog now stands at $19.3 billion. Our 2009 orders were 60% international, with great diversity in the customer mix. Given the continued pace of order activity in the fourth quarter and new customer interests, the backlog remains durable. Our large cabin backlog is essentially sold in 2010, three quarters sold in 2011, and we're already making significant progress in 2012. We plan to produce 77 large green aircraft in 2010, several more than we produced last year.
Mid-sized production, on the other hand, will decrease to 14 aircraft. Mid-cabin activity represented around 5% of Aerospace's 2009 sales and less than 5% of their earnings. Our product development efforts remain on track in the fourth quarter with successful first flights of the G250 and G650 aircraft. Both aircraft continue to undergo rigorous flight testing in preparation for 2011 FAA certification. Given the success of the testing to date, we believe that the Aerospace group is well-positioned to begin delivering the G250 in 2011 and the G650 in 2012. Revenues and earnings on these programs will begin driving growth in 2011.
For 2010, I think it's reasonable to expect low to mid single-digit sales growth in Aerospace, with margins around 14%. This admittedly conservative guidance reflects the market as we see it today. If market conditions continue to improve, particularly in the mid-sized market, we have the flexibility to adjust, and I will factor any upside into subsequent guidance updates.
In summary, 2009 was a good year for General Dynamics, and we anticipate continued success in 2010. The guidance I provided this morning implies mid-single digit growth in sales. Margins will be in the low to mid-11% range, causing earnings from continuing operations to grow at the mid-single digit rate. I expect earnings per share from continuing operations in a range of $6.40 to $6.50. I should note that this guidance does not include or anticipate the results of capital deployment. It is purely an operating forecast. And with that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on several key financial highlights. Hugh?"

I'd like to cover a few items, the impact and comparison of the 2009 results to 2008 and to communicate to you our expectations for 2010 with respect to same items. First, I'll mention our corporate operating ex",511,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to cover a few items, the impact and comparison of the 2009 results to 2008 and to communicate to you our expectations for 2010 with respect to same items. First, I'll mention our corporate operating expense, you can see on Exhibit B and D for the quarter and for the full year, respectively.
Of the increase, year-over-year is attributable to increased stock option expense, which we report for the entire company in the corporate expense line. We expect corporate operating expense for 2010 in the range of $95 million. Next, our interest expense is up for the quarter and the year. Focusing now on the full year, net interest expense is up due to a reduction in interest income of about $55 million. That was driven by lower market interest rates and lower average invested cash balances during the year.
In addition, we issued fixed rate notes in December of 2008 and June of 2009, that increased our interest expense during the year. Strong cash performance in the fourth quarter reduced our net debt by $1.2 billion, preserving our strong balance sheet and the financial flexibility that comes with it. With the reduction in net debt and the scheduled repayment of $700 million of fixed rate notes in August, we're expecting our 2010 interest expense to be down from 2009, a little around $150 million.
Regarding taxes, you may recall that our 2008 tax provision included the favorable settlement of long-standing tax litigation. That reduced our provision by $35 million or $0.09 per share and resulted in an effective tax rate of 31.2%. Of the effective tax rate for 2009 was 31.5%, which was in line with our expectations. The expected 2010 rate to be in the same range, perhaps up by 20 to 30 basis points.
With respect to our shares outstanding, you can see that diluted count effectively unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2008 to 2009. We did repurchase 1.5 million shares in the fourth quarter of 2009, but that activity was late enough in year that had minimal effects on our weighted average share count.
This was in addition to 2.1 million shares repurchased in the first quarter of the year. As Jay pointed out, the 2010 guidance does not assume the impact of the future capital deployment activities, including potential share repurchases. Finally, a couple of thoughts with respect to pensions, you'll notice that the impact of changes in our funded status in several places in our financial results. First, as Jay pointed out, our strong cash generation in 2009 includes contributions of about $250 million to our pension plans. This, combined with asset returns of approximately 20% in 2009, improved our plans funded status by $500 million. This, of course, had a positive impact on shareholders equity, it reflects changes in the funded status of our retirement plans. For 2010, we're planning approximately $270 million in contributions to our pension plan.
That completes my remarks and Amy, I'll turn this back over to you for Q&A."

General Dynamics delivered a good first quarter, marked by strong operating performance across our businesses. Revenues in the quarter were $7.8 billion, down from the first quarter of 2009. You may recall tha",1980,"Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics delivered a good first quarter, marked by strong operating performance across our businesses. 
Revenues in the quarter were $7.8 billion, down from the first quarter of 2009. You may recall that in last year's first quarter, revenues were unusually high. In fact, it was the company's single largest revenue quarter ever. Unlike last year's experience, we expect sales to continue to increase as the year progresses, more consistent with our historical pattern. 
Operating earnings were $918 million in the quarter, up slightly from last year's first quarter, resulting in an 11.8% operating margin. A favorable program mix and disciplined execution contributed to the 80 basis point year-over-year margin improvement, with particularly strong performance at Aerospace and Combat Systems.
Earnings from continuing operations were $599 million, up slightly from last year's first quarter. This drove a 7.7% return on sales, 50 basis points better than last year. Earnings per share from continuing operations were $1.54 on a fully diluted basis, flat when compared with first quarter 2009. 
Free cash flow after capital expenditures totaled $150 million, somewhat light but better than last year's first quarter. In the quarter, we experienced some growth in operating working capital at our IS&T group in general and at C4 Systems in particular. This is largely a timing issue that will reverse itself as the year progresses. We should be around 100% net earnings to free cash conversion again this year.
First quarter orders totaled $7.2 billion, significantly higher than last year, with robust award activity across our business portfolio. Backlog totaled $63.9 billion at the end of the quarter, down modestly from year end. Funded backlog however, was up 3% at $47 billion. Total potential contract value, which includes backlog, unexercised options and indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contracts reached nearly $81 billion. 
Now I'd like to focus on the performance of each of our business segments starting with our three Defense groups. And I'll begin with Combat Systems.  Sales were $2 billion, down $400 million or approximately 17% from last year's first quarter. The volume decline resulted from several factors: A significant decrease in MRAP volume when compared with the first quarter of 2009; the absence of deliveries of weapons systems that protect soldiers from roadside explosive threats; lower small caliber ammunition volume; and last year's cancellation of the future Combat Systems program. Higher volume on Abrams, Stryker and several European vehicle programs somewhat offset these declines.
Our Combat Systems businesses delivered $269 million of operating earnings in the first quarter, down just $10 million from last year on significantly less volume. Consequently, the group's operating margin was 13.4%, 180 basis points higher than last year. This performance was the result of a favorable program mix and strong execution on several vehicle and ammunition programs.
Combat Systems backlog declined modestly from year end to $12.9 billion. Despite the decline in backlog, award activity was healthy in the quarter. We received new orders on our core programs and also won several new opportunities. These new opportunities include an additional 250 RG-31 MRAP vehicles and MRAP Axle awards beyond the retrofit work we had expected this year. The MRAP deliveries are scheduled largely in the second half of the year.
In March, we were selected as the preferred vehicle provider for the United Kingdom FRES program. This opportunity includes both the Scout variant and the common-base platform for up to 580 specialist vehicles. The FRES program also anticipates several other blocks of vehicles for which we will provide the common-base platform. We are working with the United Kingdom on the initial FRES contract, and we expect to add it to backlog later this year. The FRES program provides good upside to Combat's outlook over the next five years. 
There are several other opportunities that could generate additional awards this year, including the Canadian lab upgrade program for which, we expect to receive a contract in the second quarter, and the Spanish 8x8 Vehicle Competition, which we expect to be awarded in the second half. Other potential 2010 awards include the ground combat vehicle competition, the next phase of the Saudi tank program, additional Iraqi tank options and the opportunity to enhance Stryker combat vehicle protection. For the year, I expect Combat Systems sales and earnings to grow each quarter. This trend is typical for Combat Systems, as the group's European Vehicle business generally realizes a significant portion of annual sales and earnings in the third and fourth quarters.
Much of the top line growth I have guided to for the year comes from international programs, including the lab FMS program and several European vehicle programs. Our plan anticipates these programs building in the second half. That said, it is worth noting that we have experienced delays on international programs in the past. While our current international programs are still on track, it is too early in the year to predict with certainty how they will unfold. I remain comfortable with the earnings implied in my guidance for the group, although they could come from slightly higher margins and lower revenue than originally forecast.
Marine Systems. The Marine Systems group had a solid first quarter. Revenues were $1.6 billion in the quarter, down very slightly compared to a year ago. Operating earnings were $161 million, and operating margins were 9.8%, essentially flat when compared to first quarter 2009. This margin reflects improved performance on our auxiliary ship programs and negative mix shift in our surface combatant programs as DDG-51 work declines and DDG 1000 volume increases. 
Marines backlog totaled $22.1 billion at the end of the quarter, down slightly from year end 2009. We added orders for two T-AKEs in the quarter, as well as long-lead funding for another DDG-51 destroyer. I anticipate orders for two additional DDG 1000s later this year, which will again increase the size of the backlog. 
Marine Systems will see growth in volume as the year progresses, although mix shift in the destroyer program will continue to pressure the group's margins. Given their excellent execution to date, however, I think there is a chance that they will outperform my mid-9% margin guidance for the year.
IS&T. The Information Systems and Technology group began 2010 with their largest sales quarter ever at $2.8 billion. Earnings were $290 million and operating margins were 10.5%. Margins were particularly strong at our IT Services business, which enjoyed a favorable program mix in the quarter. IS&T's backlog was $10.3 billion at the end of the quarter, and once again, the group achieved a book-to-bill of 1x. This reflects continued demand for the group's products and services, particularly in light of their robust first quarter sales. 
This quarter's order activity was very strong at our Tactical Communications and IT Services businesses, reflecting our success in capturing business in faster growing market segments, such as tactical networks and communication, healthcare services, simulation and training and IT infrastructure. 
We had a number of notable IS&T awards in the quarter, some of which, you'll find at Exhibit G of our press release. Work on these contracts will help drive the group's revenues this year, especially in the second half.
IS&T's the estimated potential contract value under ID/IQ contracts grew 3% in the first quarter to $13.2 billion. When combined, backlog and estimated potential contract value totaled $23.5 billion, providing IS&T ample opportunity for continued growth. IS&T remains well-positioned to achieve my guidance of approximately 8% to 9% sales growth and mid-10% margins this year.
Now let's move to Aerospace. The Aerospace group is off to a very good start in 2010. When compared to last year's first quarter, the group's revenues were down 6.7%. However, first quarter 2009's results reflected a higher annual production rate, including three additional green deliveries and 17 additional completions. Of those 17 additional completions, 15 were mid-cabin aircraft. You may remember that we reduced Gulfstream's annual production in March of 2009, as a result of the change in market conditions. The most significant production cut was in the mid-cabin aircraft. 
On the other hand, first quarter revenues were $1.4 billion, up nearly 15% over the fourth quarter of last year, due to additional Gulfstream new aircraft volume. Gulfstream green deliveries in the first quarter included seven additional mid-size jets when compared to last quarter and one additional large cabin aircraft. The group's operating earnings were $218 million and margins were 16.1%, improved when compared with both last quarter and the prior-year period. Last year's cost-cutting efforts helped to drive some of the margin improvement in the quarter. 
We continue to see gradual improvement in the business aviation market in 2010, including healthy customer interest, particularly for our largest jets. We also see declining pre-owned inventory levels and healthy aftermarket demand. Gulfstream enjoyed their largest order intake since mid-2008 in the first quarter, with international orders dominating the order book. Orders were representative of every major international region, and demand was particularly strong for our large cabin aircraft. 
Gross new aircraft book-to-bill was 1.2x on a dollar-denominated basis. Despite good order intake, new aircraft deliveries and default activity led backlog to decline modestly from year end to $18.5 billion. Orders outpaced defaults for the fourth consecutive quarter, and with continued economic recovery, I expect orders to increasingly outpace defaults as the year progresses.
Pre-owned inventory levels continue to decline. We sold three pre-owned aircraft this quarter, took none in trade and have one aircraft remaining in inventory. For the remainder of 2010, we have no more than four trade-in commitments. 
Aircraft maintenance, repair and overhaul demand was solid in the quarter, although the first quarter does tend to be somewhat lighter than other periods of the year. Jet Aviation's global FBO, Aircraft Management and Charter businesses were particularly strong. As we expected, it appears the Group Services business will be up for the year in the low to mid single-digit range. 
We continue to make great strides in our product development programs in the first quarter. Both the G250 and G650 have two aircraft in flight test at this time, and we are extremely pleased with the results we've seen. Certification plans for both models remain on track. 
For the year, we remain on pace to achieve our delivery plan, which includes approximately 77 large cabin aircraft and 14 mid-sized. Large cabin deliveries will be slower in the third quarter as we are planning a two-week furlough at Savannah. Slight improvement in the mid-cabin market could provide upside to planned deliveries. I remain optimistic on the outlook for the business aviation market, and I'm encouraged by the generally positive trends we've seen thus far in 2010. Aerospace is well positioned to achieve low to mid single-digit sales growth, with some upside to the 14% margin guidance I've provided.
With regard to capital deployment, our solid balance sheet affords us ample flexibility to enhance shareholder returns. In the quarter, we continued our balanced strategy, repurchasing 2.9 million shares at attractive prices. We also expanded our tactical communications portfolio with the acquisition of a software company that facilitates battlefield information collection and dissemination for soldiers, a capability at the forefront of defense spending priorities. The board also increased the quarterly dividend by 10.5%, the 13th increase in as many years. 
In summary, we've hit the deck running in the first quarter, and we're on our way to another successful year. The year is still young, so I'm going to reiterate my full year guidance of 640 to 650. I think I've provided some indication of where I believe there may be upside to that guidance, but it would be imprudent to make any adjustments at this point. The improving business jet market and 2011 Defense budget request provide a good foundation for the company moving forward. 
And with that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on several key financial highlights. Hugh?"

This improvement can be attributed to our strong cash performance and comes after deploying approximately $700 million in acquisitions of new businesses, $600 million in payment of dividends, $500 million in company-sponsored research and development, $400 million in capital expenditures and $300 million in share repurchases. Over this period, our debt-to-equity ratio has dropped to 30.2% from 37.8%, and our debt-to-capital ratio is 23.2%, down from 27.4%. 
Our next scheduled debt repayment is $700 million of fixed-rate notes due in August of this year. Finally, I would also like to remind everyone that we plan to make a voluntary contribution to our pension plan of about $270 million in the third quarter of this year. 
That completes my remarks. Amy, I'll turn it back to you to begin the Q&A."

That's the general description I would offer."

We've got ground combat vehicle competition that will lay itself out later this year. JLTV is still playing, Stryker is in play right now. Reset, modernization, all of those elements, it's not just new production. So it's multifaceted and very robust as we go forward. So I don't see a big tail off, if that's perhaps the implication here, because our core programs are being very well-supported. We also have on the international side, things that perhaps, more reality as the last time we talked, like as I mentioned in my remarks, the FRES contract, which will be a significant add to the portfolio for Combat Systems."

To your point on margins, I'd start it off by saying I'm very pleased with the performance that Aerospace, both in Gulfstream and in Jet Aviation. So let's just get that on the table at the start. And it's reflected in the margin performance that you saw. There have been several things that play in realizing those margins, relative to both year-over-year, first quarter '09 and the sequential from last quarter. Example, year-over-year, on margins, this quarter were positively impacted, certainly by mix, as I mentioned, I think, in my remarks. So we had 15 fewer mid-sized completions this year than we did last year. Also, we didn't have pre-owned charges this year, which we had last year. And as is usually the case, when we're talking about Aerospace here, they lowered their SG&A this quarter through great discipline, continuous improvement and cost savings. So those are three, I'd say, elements that differentiate this quarter from year-ago quarter on the margin side. Let's talk about sequential now, from fourth quarter '09 to first quarter '10 and the positive influencers, if you will, are somewhat different this quarter. I'll leave that lower SG&A in there because indeed, that made a big difference again this quarter, as it did in the year-over-year comparison, but we also had improvement at Jet Aviation, which is consistent with what we've been telling you was happening and will continue to happen. We saw that quarter-over-quarter here. And we're very pleased with that. And I would also say, as I mentioned in my remarks, that we did have some liquidated damages. So that's kind of the summation, if you will, of elements that I think impacted the differentiation, quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Now that said, I would caution not to get too far ahead of me on margins this year because we have some things to think about going forward. One is that we are planning a furlough at Gulfstream in the third quarter, not as long as we had last year, but nonetheless, we've got a furlough in the plan, which will impact us. And also, the mid-size mix is still a little bit uncertain in all of this, depends on how the market recovers, depends on how many completions, et cetera, et cetera. So that will definitely have an impact, could definitely have an impact on margins going forward. And then I would also say that we expect the liquidated damages to be less of a factor going forward, and we can talk about the backlog later. But point of fact, what we see didn't surprise us, and we see less of it in the next and subsequent quarters going forward. So that's probably more than you asked for, but that's kind of my rundown on the margin side. And I hope it's responsive to your question."

It was, on the orders side, the best quarter we've had since the third quarter of 2008 across the product line. And as I mentioned, orders did outpace default for the fourth consecutive quarter. So we feel very good about that. $18.5 billion is a very robust backlog by any measure. So I feel very good about that, even though it moves around a little bit. Now the default activity in this quarter, we'll talk about it a little. A couple of things. For example, it was greater than it was the quarter before. Were we surprised by that? Honestly, not really. And here are a couple of reasons why. Let's talk about 650. We had, actually by number, five 650 defaults in the quarter. They were all tied to, if you recall, the first flight payment milestone. Anyway, that's a fourth quarter event that manifested itself in activity in the first quarter. So we lost five of those. Not surprisingly, they were instantly backfilled and we're still taking orders, and the 650 backlog is still just south of 200 aircrafts. But it did, in fact, impact us on the liquidated damages side. In addition to that, Cai, we had a number of defaults, frankly, that we've been working with the customer for a while, and you could have brought some of them to default in the fourth quarter. And in the year, we've got payment milestones moved to the first quarter. And so some of that just triggered, as a result of timing and things our folks have been working with for a while. So again, not a big surprise. Having said all of that, as we've told you before, Joe Lombardo, Larry Flynn, the Gulfstream team and I spent a lot of time together going through the backlog, customer by customer, and we still do that almost weekly. And what we see ahead of us is an order book that is still very robust and a default activity that would decrease as the year progresses. And I would expect the spread between orders and defaults to continue to increase as the year goes forward. I hope that answers your question."

But on the international side indeed, that is a portfolio that will build as we go. We can see it. I just can't time it out to the day. That's the reality and it's not a surprise. We can talk about backlog a little bit just as it applies across the corporation. It's not a one-size-fits-all package. What do I mean by that? Let's just talk about the Defense businesses. The Aerospace backlog, we've talked about. But in the Defense businesses, you've heard us say before, I think, in the Marine Systems group, the backlog is very lumpy. And we're usually talking big lumps when they come. We're at 22 or so million dollars right now, and we don't have the next two DDG 1000s in the backlog yet, et cetera. You understand that. On the IS&T side, relatively speaking, it's pretty Steady Eddy. Now that oversimplifies how difficult it is to sustain a 1x book-to-bill, as they're very good at doing, but they're very, very disciplined and very accomplished at that. So that's pretty steady. On the Combat side, it's almost in between those two that I just described. But it tends to come, particularly when you see some of this international business in pretty lumpy orders. So all that said, we can see a lot out ahead of us. But how it comes and in what size lumps, I think it's something we're just going to have to work our way through. But clearly, for Combat Systems, the bill will be throughout the year, and the programs that we see on the international side, FRES, as I mentioned, the labs in Canada, there's another vehicle competition that we anticipate in Canada called the Tactical Armored Patrol Vehicle that were partnered with Oshkosh on that will realize itself, we believe, based on what they're saying now, and next year and stream up for several years. We've got the FMS labs at great scale, $2.2 billion that are just coming into design work right now that'll play out for the next several years. We've got more labs from that customers, countries that we believe will come in the second half of this year. We've got Iraqi tanks, we've got Saudi Arabian tanks. So there's lots of business that we can see building over the next five years, probably longer than you wanted."

But I'm okay with that because as you mentioned, we've got 15 months until it becomes an entry into service reality. And when people see, touch and fly in this airplane, they won't be able to get enough of it. So that is my profound belief.

What do I mean by that? These ships are being built in their shipyard. They are clearly ready to prime. And quite frankly, to be as competitive as we could be with the Austal boats, we felt that having them so low, if you will, rather than having them and Bath Iron Works in there would make them more cost competitive because you don't have two yards. You're only working with one. Embedded in all of that for us, is the fact that the core mission system of that great ship is ours. It comes from our IS&T team, AIS in particular. And it's working beautifully and it's open architecture, and we are very excited about that. So that's a long way around saying we felt that for this round, it was most appropriate for Austal to prime this. They felt that way, and we are in complete alignment with them on that. By the way, for round two, that the way they are appear set up by the Navy for round two, it also, then, would give us the opportunity to bid for the second source in 2012, should we choose to do so.

In fact, it's doing superbly in execution. Every product carrier we've put out has been ahead of schedule and below budget. So we know how to build those ships better than anybody. That said, the challenge there is the market space. And so, you know we're building one through five in the product carriers, six through nine are not in the build. And right now, today's answer is we don't expect them to come to us anytime soon. They are not in our plan anymore. But that market too, shall return. And we are getting some interest in commercial activity that could be resonant at NASSCO. And I don't want to get much more specific than that except to say, and I think we've talked about this before. You've got Jones Act ships that are out there in some number that are getting very old and very tired and very inefficient. And frankly, you've got environmental disciplines that are going to be kicking in here in terms of single-hulled versus double-hulled oilers et cetera, et cetera. So there's a lot going on that will come. It's just a question of when it comes. NASSCO's Navy side is coming out with 14 T-AKEs which are being done very well as you might expect. And that will bring us out through 2012 there, the mobile landing platform is being put into the '11 budget. We're already doing some of the front end work on that and so we expect at least three of those mobile landing platform, mobile landing ships. And then you also got a significant book of business out there with repair. There's no Navy shipyard in San Diego, and there are over 50 Navy combatants that need to be maintained out there. So that, I think last year was like 24%, I think, of NASSCO's revenues. So there's plenty of work in that book of business. The commercial side just needs to have the market come back. It will be very competitive when it does."

General Dynamics' second quarter performance was solid, delivering $8.1 billion in sales and record operating earnings of $985 million. This led to earnings per share of $1.68 on a fully diluted basis, $0.07 ahe",3104,"Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics' second quarter performance was solid, delivering $8.1 billion in sales and record operating earnings of $985 million. This led to earnings per share of $1.68 on a fully diluted basis, $0.07 ahead of last year's second quarter and $0.14 ahead of last quarter. Operating margins in all four groups were very strong in the quarter, driving 12.2% company margins, 50 basis points better than last year's second quarter and 40 basis points better than last quarter.
Second quarter free cash flow after capital expenditures was $414 million, approximately 64% of earnings from continuing operations. Year-to-date, free cash flow is $564 million, relatively consistent with last year's performance. I expect strong cash generation in the second half. 
We deployed $190 million of cash in the quarter to make two acquisitions that complement our core Combat Systems and IS&T businesses. We also took advantage of market conditions to buy 5.5 million shares of GD common stock in the open market. 
Orders this quarter exceeded $7 billion, over $1 billion more than last year's second quarter with robust activity in the Combat Systems and Information Systems and Technology groups. At the end of the quarter, total backlog stood at $62.5 billion.
Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups. And first, let's talk about Combat Systems. Combat Systems second quarter was marked by excellent operational performance across the business. Sales volume totaled $2.1 billion, up from the first quarter, but down from the same period a year ago, due to less MRAP volume, the cancellation of FCS and Stryker timing. In the second half, we anticipate stronger MRAP and Stryker volume. 
Earnings were essentially flat when compared with last year's second quarter, despite the decline in sales, as margins expanded across the portfolio. The 150-basis-point margin improvement is the result of better program mix, with volume concentrated in more mature procurement programs and improved operating performance. Compared to last quarter, earnings grew nearly 10% to $295 million. 
Total backlog for Combat Systems decreased modestly to $12.8 billion in the quarter. Order activity outpaced sales at three of the four businesses, including European Land Systems, which had its strongest order activity since the second quarter of last year. 
Notable orders in the quarter included approximately $500 million for Stryker vehicles and Abrams tanks, $200 million for United Kingdom's Scout vehicle development work, $35 million for the development phase of the Canadian LAV upgrade program and nearly $300 million for Hydra rockets. We expect to book several additional large international orders this year. 
Looking forward for the group, sales in the remainder of the year will be higher than both year-to-date and last year's second half, with particular strength in the fourth quarter. That said, my overall assessment now shows sales in 2010 to be essentially flat to slightly below 2009. 
As I mentioned on the first quarter call, the growth originally projected in 2010 was influenced heavily by international work in the second half of the year. A confluence of factors, including the European sovereign debt crisis, prolonged contract negotiations and the decline in the euro has changed our international sales outlook for this year. 
The sovereign debt crisis has delayed the award of the Spanish 8x8 program until 2011. However, the Spanish government remains committed to this program, having stated publicly that it remains a top defense priority. 
Prolonged contract negotiations slowed the award of our Canadian LAV program, which will now transition to production in 2011 rather than this year. A several hundred million dollar FMS LAV Award will also push out until late this year or early next year. Additionally at current exchange rates, the decline in the euro would reduce sales by nearly $150 million by year and. This is translation rather than meaningful economic impact, and obviously could vary depending on where the euro settles relative to the dollar at year end.
Our U.S. Core business received some unanticipated awards in the first half to include 250 RG-31s, stronger than expected EXCEL awards and Stryker development work. These positives have been somewhat offset by delays in awards at our Weapons Systems business and some reduction in contract scope in other programs. Not withstanding the adjusted sales outlook for 2010, full year earnings will be consistent with my original expectations. Margins will be in the mid-13% range, up approximately 50 to 60 basis points from my prior guidance, due to the favorable mix mentioned earlier.
As we look to the future, Combat's portfolio is well positioned. Let me briefly review four key components of this group's business. First, U.S. vehicles, comprised just over 50% of 2009 Combat sales, obviously driven by the Stryker and Abrams programs, which are core to today's army and will remain so for years to come. Current backlog, continued vehicle enhancements and reset opportunities will sustain these two mature programs. 
We are also competing on an array of next-generation vehicle programs, including the Ground Combat Vehicle and the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle, which could offer upside in the longer term. In the event that any of these developmental programs are delayed, we see continued opportunity for our current vehicles.
Secondly, U.S. weapons systems and ammunition. At approximately 1/3 of 2009 combat sales, they provide an array of critical systems and ammunition products to a wide range of U.S. and international customers. The core programs in these businesses remain well supported in the midterm, while new opportunities in precision munitions, armor, commercial axles, Denel and international ammunition bode well for the longer term. 
Thirdly, international FMS and export vehicles. We expect to grow substantially over the next four years as we begin delivering light-armored vehicles and tanks to a variety of Middle Eastern customers. We are currently working four contracts, totaling close to $4 billion, with deliveries between 2011 and 2014. Two of those contracts, worth nearly $2.5 billion for FMS LAVs and Iraqi tanks are now in backlog. The other two contracts for additional FMS LAVs and tanks could add $1.4 billion to backlog before year end. These FMS sales present a meaningful opportunity, around $800 million to $1 billion of volume per year between 2011 and 2014.
And finally, international indigenous vehicles. One of our key market discriminators here is that we are residents in many of the countries where we manufacture and sell vehicles, thus making our employees an important component of local GDP. There have been several recent positive developments in this business, including: solidifying the first complement of the Canadian LAV upgrade program, which when added to backlog next year, will contribute another $850 million to sales between 2011 and 2013; selection as the preferred supplier for a five-year $100 million deal to sustain Australia's armored fighting vehicle fleet; and finalizing a contract worth several hundred million dollars over the next three years to develop and deliver Scout Specialist Vehicles to the British Army. 
Clearly the sovereign debt crisis has added some uncertainty to our European business over the past quarter. In June, I visited our European businesses. And while their situation remains dynamic, it was clear that in spite of timelines moving to the right, our programs remain in high demand. No programs have been eliminated or taken off the table. 
National security remains an important spending priority, even when times are austere and our indigenous workforce provides an important economic engine in many of these economies. We are setting the international standard for the next generation of armored vehicles, and I feel confident in our opportunities to provide best-in-class vehicles at affordable prices for years to come.
In summary, the Combat Systems portfolio of products is well placed in today's fighting force and is complemented by a healthy set of near and long-term opportunities. These opportunities, combined with the current backlog, provide relative stability in our core Domestic businesses and growth in our international workload. This will result in attractive margins and cash flow for the next several years.
Marine Systems. Marine Systems group delivered another solid quarter. Revenues were up slightly, though earnings were consistent with last year's second quarter at $1.6 billion and $167 million, respectively. This is a particularly good performance as last year's results reflected 17% sales and 32% earnings growth. 
Sales in the quarter were up at Electric Boat and Bath Iron Works reflecting increased Virginia and DDG 1000 volume and expand an SSBN replacement design efforts. This growth was somewhat offset by a decline in NASSCO sales due to repair volume timing and the ramp down of the commercial product carrier program. 
Marines margins in the quarter were 10.2%, up 40 basis points from the first quarter. The Marine group's backlog totaled $21.3 billion at the end of the second quarter, down 3.6% from the first quarter. We anticipate adding the second and third DDG 1000 ships to this backlog, either later this year or early next year, pending final contract negotiations with our customer.  In the second quarter, the group received funding for long-lead materials for these ships. 
Group sales will grow progressively through the second half, driven by the continued ramp to two-per-year Virginia class submarine production. Overall, sales should be up approximately 5% compared with last year, somewhat below my prior guidance. This change reflects continued weakness in the Commercial Shipbuilding business. 
We are, however, seeing renewed interest across the range of commercial shippers, including the dry cargo market, container ships and some tankers. Our excellent performance on the current five-ship product carrier program positions us to capitalize on a number of these contracts, most likely starting next year. 
Group margins for the year should be around the mid 9% range, consistent with my earlier guidance. Margins will decline as the year progresses, due to the surface combatant workload mix shift, which will escalate in the second half. Given the group's consistently excellent operating performance in managing for profitability, there may be some upside to my 9.5% margin guidance. 
Looking longer term, our shipyards are poised for slow, steady top line growth predicated on a healthy backlog and opportunities set. While the group faces a margin headwind in the near term, I see opportunity to expand margins, as surface combatant fixed price work builds, commercial shipbuilding opportunities materialize and two-per-year Virginia is realized.
IS&T. Our IS&T group had its highest ever revenue and earnings quarter. Sales were nearly $3 billion, up 12% over second quarter 2009 and 6.3% year-to-date. Sales growth was driven by continued demand for our ruggedized mobile computing and tactical communications products, an increased intelligence, IT and infrastructure support work. The group's second quarter operating earnings were $312 million, up 10% year-over-year and 7.6%, sequentially. Operating margins were 10.5%, in line with the first quarter and my expectation for this year.
Backlog for the group increased by over $300 million this quarter, as book to bill exceeded 1x again. Awards were particularly strong in our Tactical Communications and IT Services businesses. The businesses were also selected to compete on several large multiyear IDIQ contracts, which contributed to a 28% increase in our potential contract value. Many of these awards are detailed in our press release. 
IS&T's volume in the second half will exceed both last year's second half and this year's first half. Overall, I expect group sales to be up 8% to 9%, perhaps closer to the midpoint of that range. And margins will remain around 10.5%, both consistent with previous guidance.
Looking beyond 2010, IS&T's highly diverse portfolio positions the group to leverage its current capabilities to capture new business in fast-growing market segments. Tactical communications and battlefield management remain high customer spending priorities. 
Two weeks ago, many of our tactical communications products, including WIN-T and JTRS were part of a U.S. Army, Brigade Combat Team integration exercise that showcased their technical maturity and critical networking capabilities. As these programs transition to production over the next several years, they will enhance sales growth and margins. 
IT intelligence, infrastructure and healthcare support represents some of the other faster currents in the groups' marketplace. Sales growth will also be driven by the rapidly expanding cyber market, where IS&T has a very strong position with an array of government and commercial customers.
Aerospace. The Aerospace group's results were marked by excellent operational performance and new product development progress. Order intake was somewhat slower than anticipated, but year-to-date orders are in line with expectations. The group's second quarter sales were $1.38 billion, down modestly from last year's second quarter, due to fewer pre-owned aircraft sales at Gulfstream and less completions volume at Jet Aviation. The group's earnings were up 8.4%. Margins were 16.8%, a 160-basis-point improvement resulting from expanded Gulfstream volumes and margins, improved jet aviation completions margin and lower SG&A and R&D costs.
We continue to see signs of gradual improvement in the business jet market. Gulfstream flying hours are up. And we enjoyed a 16% improvement in the group's services sales versus last year's second quarter and a 7% improvement year-to-date. Additionally, market pre-owned aircraft levels continue to decline. At the end of the second quarter, Gulfstream had one pre-owned aircraft and inventory, and it is under contract. We anticipate receiving no more than three additional pre-owned aircraft before year end.
Customer interest in Gulfstream aircraft remains healthy, despite a slowdown in order intake in the second half of the quarter. Orders outpaced defaults by 3:1, while defaults were at their lowest level of this downturn. On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated book to bill was 0.6x. At $17.8 billion, our backlog includes nearly 200 G650 orders and approximately $6 billion in orders for our in-service aircraft. This is a very solid and sustaining backlog.
Orders in the quarter spanned the entirety of our product portfolio, with roughly 2/3 for the large-cabin aircraft and 1/3 for the mid cabins. Second quarter orders also reflected renewed interest in our North American markets, which were essentially dormant following last year's financial crisis and ensuing anti-business jet rhetoric. We also continue to see relative orders strength across several emerging markets including the Asia Pacific region, one of the strongest markets for business aviation and from for in particular. 
In addition to current backlog, we have a healthy pipeline of new opportunities, which we believe will translate to orders as the financial markets recover from a turbulent second quarter. Large cabin deliveries remain on track and will total 76 this year. As you may recall, Gulfstream completed a two-week furlough in July, which will result in fewer large cabin deliveries in the third quarter. The mid cabin business continue to show improvement in the second quarter and now exceeds my original expectations for 14 deliveries this year. I expect to deliver a total of 21 midsized jets this year, with some further upside if second half demands, nears what we've seen in the first half.
For the full year, I expect the group's sales to be up low to mid-single digits consistent with my prior guidance. Operating margins will be better than previously anticipated, probably in the mid-15% range with some upside. 
On the product development front, there are now three G250 aircraft and four G650 aircraft in flight test and 2011 FAA and EASA certification for both aircraft remain on track. As we look toward the next several years, the group will enjoy steady top line growth as we begin G650 deliveries in the second half of 2011, and the Services business continues to expand commensurate with the growing installed base. 
Our current order book and a healthy pipeline of potential new customer orders bode well for sustaining production of our G450 and G550 aircraft at or near current levels. The group's margins should continue to expand, driven in part by continued improvement of Jet Aviation and the transition to full rate production on our new aircraft models. We will continue to aggressively manage this business for profitability on the up as we did through the down.
In summary, General Dynamics executed well in the first half of 2010 and is well positioned for similar success in the second half. For the year, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $6.60 to $6.65, an increase from my prior guidance. 
Before concluding my remarks, I'd like to comment on today's dynamic business environment, particularly as it relates to our Defense businesses. Within this environment, the Pentagon's commitment to maintaining current force structure levels, which are sized to address the evolving threat environment, remains unchanged. While the post-9/11 world allows for little near-term defense budget reduction, pressures to manage discretionary spending will undoubtedly increase in the out years. 
I certainly appreciate the challenge the deficit-reduction emphasis represents for future defense spending. Over the past quarter, Secretary of Defense, Gates, and his senior leadership team have aggressively embarked upon a series of initiatives focused on making the Pentagon, a more cost-effective, efficient organization. Improving efficiency is particularly important to achieving the Pentagon's goal of preserving for structure, to appropriately organize, train and equip today's force to fight, weapons spending will have to show some growth in the years ahead. 
In a flat-budget environment, the Defense Department must extract savings from within its own budget to achieve this required growth. Having focused on achieving savings in the weapons accounts last year, the Pentagon now appears focused primarily on extracting overhead savings from operations and maintenance budget, the tail, to support investment account requirements, the tooth. 
The specifics of the Pentagon's efficiency initiatives are not yet evident, but what is clear, is that the environment is changing and that all stakeholders will have a role to play. I am personally involved with other CEOs in a cooperative dialogue to develop procedures that will achieve needed results while protecting the viability of the Defense industrial base. I'm encouraged that the Pentagon has engaged the industry as it embarks on shaping these measures. 
General Dynamics is already a very lean and efficient operator. We will continue to support our customer in pursuing even greater value for the defense dollar. Our Defense businesses have all experienced strong support in the ongoing 2011 budget deliberations. While there are several steps remaining before the 2011 budget, Defense bill becomes law, I remain confident that GD's core programs will receive solid Congressional support. 
General Dynamics is particularly well positioned to excel in this fast-changing environment. Low costs and quality production continue to enhance our competitiveness. Our streamlined business model limits overhead expense and empowers our business unit presidents to remain entrepreneurial and agile. 
And with that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?"

We have $700 million of fixed rate notes that are still due to mature in August. We plan to satisfy that obligations with cash on hand. As a result, we'll see lower interest expense in the second half of the year, and we expect full year interest expense to be somewhere between $155 million and $160 million. We are also scheduled to make a voluntary contribution to our pension plans of approximately $270 million in September. 
I would like to also point out that we recently renewed our 364-day bank line, increasing it by about $200 million and extending the term to three years. This increases our commercial paper capacity to approximately $2 billion. The increased commercial paper capacity, along with the debt repayment in the third quarter, further bolsters our strong balance sheet and gives us capacity to execute on future opportunities.
Finally, an update on our expectations for our effective tax rate. I had previously guided you to a rate of 31.5% with some 20 to 30 basis points of exposure, meaning risk that the rate could be as high as 31.8%. Given our experience in the first half and what we see ahead of us for the remainder of the year, the rate is still looking like 31.5%, but with the opportunity to come in 20 to 30 basis points lower rather than higher. 
So that completes my remarks, and I'll turn it back to Amy to begin the Q&A. Amy?"

And you've captured it and I said it in my remarks, I mean, I'm very pleased with the performance at all three of our shipyards. The margins are representative of the excellence of those yards in doing what they do best. And really, the margin guidance that I'm giving is purely reflective of the mix shift, predominantly at Bath Iron Works. But also, somewhat, as we move block to block with Virginia Class, we're now into Block III, I think, as you know, and then also coming to the end of the product carrier line, if you will, at NASSCO. So what does all that mean? In the Bath instance, you know we're in the build on the first cost-plus DDG 1000. It's about, I think, like 17% complete, okay? No big surprises. We're pleased with what we've got. We like it a lot. We're in contract negotiations for the next two fixed-price 1001 and 1002 by hull number. And so that will work itself through. And so you'll see the DDG 1000 that's in the build becoming more of Bath's portfolio here as the year advances, and the DDG 51s, the mature fixed price, we know how to build these babies better than anybody. And you'll see all of that tailing down a little bit as the last two boats are in the build right now and the next one comes in, on the '11 budget, DDG 115 by hull number. Beyond that, the DDG 51s will arrive in some number. But it's just not parsed out in the budget beyond the '11 budget, as you well know. So the point of all that is you're going to see the margins come down as that cost-plus boat dominates, if you will, relatively speaking, Bath Iron Works. And then as we get into the fixed price, DDG 1000s and back into the fixed-price, DDG 51s, you're going to see those margins go back up again. I would also then comment in terms of Electric Boat, I mentioned the transition that we're still doing with Block IIs, and we're now starting Block IIIs. So the margins, I would expect, as we mature into Block III, I would expect, given that we continue to perform as a team, the way we perform right now, and going forward, we can enhance the margins in Virginia Class. And that's going to be, as you know, the major muscle mover for the Marine group. I would also add in terms of margin opportunity, the SSBN at Electric Boat, and I think you know, we're doing early engineering and development work on the SSBN Replacement, which is timelined into about a 2019 start to replace the Ohio Class SSBNs some years later. But that will also provide opportunity there. At the NASSCO side, you know that the T-AKE 14 in number will complete at the end of 2012. The product carrier's completed at the end of 2010. And that's why I changed the guidance, because the product carriers are going away. And that's a great margin opportunity that will tail out here very shortly. On the Navy side, we've got the MLP coming in on the '11 budget to enhance that side of it as the T-AKEs run out, if you will. And then on the Commercial side, as I mentioned in my remarks, we're very encouraged by the discussions we're having right now. The commercial market is coming back. And I believe that the time's up, the way we think it will, you're going to see contracts here for 2011 in that market, okay? And I'd also comment at NASSCO as it applies to all shipyards, but the most relevant current example is at NASSCO. We manage those businesses for profitability, and we're very disciplined in so doing. We just let go close to 600 people at NASSCO, because the volume was not appropriate to keep them, and we'll continue to do that as necessary, down and up, to make sure that we maintain profitability. So that's probably more than you asked for. But that's kind of my Marine view."

I'm going to give you more of the tutorial than you asked for, okay? Because this is the way I've got it stacked in my head. The forfeiture profits, liquidated damages, were not a margin driver for us, because it was as low as it's been since the downturn. So let's just take that off the table at the top. If you look at the margins year-over-year, okay, this time was better, positively impacted, because of the Aircraft Services volume improvement, which I talked to in my remarks, less pre-owned aircraft sales and frankly, those that did sell, sold at a modest profit versus the loss they sold at a year ago. And then the things you'd expect me to say, lower SG&A and then less, unless this is R&D expenditure, because we have larger supplier payments in the quarter, okay? That's kind of the year-over-year up to the 16.8%. If you look at it sequentially against the first quarter of 2010, really the difference there is the R&D expenditure, okay? So that's the lift that they got there. Looking forward for the rest of the year, why am I not sticking my nose up in the 16s, like I think, you're implying in the question? And the answer is we had the two-week furlough at Gulfstream, the overhead absorption attached to that. I do expect the forfeiture profits, the liquidated damages or whatever, to continue to decline, okay, with fewer anticipated defaults in the second half. And I expect the R&D expenditures to increase. Normally, historically, I guess, you'd say, the R&D expenditure net is more weighted in our favor on the second half of the year, and this year, it was favored to the first half of the year. So anyway, I think those are probably the major margin factors I would have for you today."

I mentioned in my remarks that I was very pleased with the Combat Systems and IS&T growth and all that is true, better than 1:1 in IS&T and close to it in Combat. If you add the IDIQs to that, it goes in excess of 1:1. So those two, okay, better than okay. On the Aerospace side -- well, on the Marine side, I think you used the word, but I'll use it again, that's the lumpiest of all in terms of how you add to the backlog. It comes in big slugs, and then it doesn't for a while, and then it comes in big slugs again. And what you're seeing right now, quite honestly is the impending, but not yet arrival of the number two or number three DDG 1000. That's really what you're seeing there. On Aerospace, look, it's $17.8 billion worth of backlog. Yes, it came down. But here's the way I look at it, and we look at it. If you take the 650 and give that, let's say, $12 billion of that $18 billion, put that aside, you got almost $6 billion in backlog in your in-production aircraft, largely in the large cabin. That's a very robust backlog. But here's the way I look at it. I look at it in terms of who's in there and how long will it take for you to get in entering the service with an airplane you want to buy today. And the answer to that, in terms of the 450 and the 550 is 18 to 24 months. And in our thinking, in my thinking, that's kind of the sweet spot. If that backlog, given the production rates we have, the fat backlog carries an 18-to-24-month delivery time with it, that backlog is sized appropriately. If it gets less than that, okay, then we got some sales work to do. If it's more than that, then the customer base waits too long for their airplane. So that's kind of where I am with that."

We look at what we're engaged in and what environment we're operating in back to the entrepreneurial agility of my business unit Presidents. They're looking, all the time, to see how they can enhance the portfolio we have in ensuring its relevance, and also looking at adjacencies that may give us more opportunity, or quite frankly, also looking in new areas or harvesting things that are in our portfolio that aren't appropriate for us anymore that might do someone else, something better.

General Dynamics delivered another solid operating performance in the third quarter with sales of $8 billion, nearly 4% better than the same quarter a year ago. Operating earnings of $966 million were up 10.5% o",3082,"Thank you, Amy, and good morning, everyone. General Dynamics delivered another solid operating performance in the third quarter with sales of $8 billion, nearly 4% better than the same quarter a year ago. Operating earnings of $966 million were up 10.5% over the year-ago quarter. Company margins improved 80 basis points to 12.1%. Earnings per share were $1.70 on a fully diluted basis, $0.22 better than last year's third quarter.
Third quarter free cash flow, after capital expenditures, was $784 million, 121% of earnings from continuing operations. This includes a voluntary payment of $270 million to our pension plan. In terms of capital deployment, we used $700 million in the quarter to retire our 4.5% fixed rate notes. We also purchased 2.7 million shares of General Dynamics' stock in the open market for $163 million. Year-to-date, we have spent $726 million to repurchase 11.2 million shares. Through share repurchases and dividends, we have returned almost 90% of year-to-date free cash flow to shareholders.
Third quarter orders were the strongest we've seen this year. Aerospace and IS&T's book to bill exceeded 1:1 while Combat's book to bill was nearly 1:1. At the end of the quarter, total backlog stood at a robust $61.8 billion. 
Now let me turn to the results and outlook for each of our groups, starting with the largest of our four businesses, IS&T. IS&T enjoyed strong orders, sales, earnings and margins in the third quarter. Sales were nearly $3 billion for the second consecutive quarter, an 8% increase over last year's third quarter. This is healthy growth in light of the fact that last year's third quarter was the group's highest sales quarter in 2009. Year-to-date, sales are up 7%. The group's third quarter earnings were $306 million up 3.4% year-over-year. Operating margins were 10.4% in the quarter, essentially in line with my 10.5% full year guidance.
The group's book to bill exceeded 1x for the third consecutive quarter causing backlog to increase by $230 million. If the group maintains this win rate, as I expect, 2010 will stand as the 12th year that book-to-bill has been at or above 1x, an excellent track record for a business of this size and diversity.
Award activity in the quarter was particularly strong at our Tactical Communications and IT Services businesses. Several of these contracts are detailed in today's earnings press release. Total estimated contract value, which adds the potential value of IDIQ contracts to total backlog, stood at $24.9 billion at quarter-end. This represents well over 2x expected 2011 sales and a 5% increase above the year-ago value.
Fourth quarter sales and margins will be essentially in line with the third quarter. For the full year, I expect group sales to increase approximately 8% to 8.5% over last year driven by double-digit sales growth in our Tactical Communications and Information Technology Services businesses. Margins for the year will remain around 10.5%. 
As we look to the future, IS&T is particularly well positioned. I want to spend a few minutes this morning giving you a sense for why. First, a few facts that highlight the group's diverse business base. Group sales are derived from thousands of contracts at any given time with no single contract totaling more than 2% of company sales. Approximately 40% of sales come from civil agencies, restricted, commercial and international customers. Product and systems integration dominate the group's efforts, representing over 50% of sales. The remaining sales consist of approximately 25% high-end engineering services and 20% pure IT service work. Nearly half of sales result from fixed price contracts while approximately 38% are cost plus and the remainder, time and materials. 
Over the past decade, we have evolved the group's products and services offerings into a balanced portfolio that remains at the forefront of Defense and Federal spending priorities. Let me briefly review the three key pieces of this business.
First, Tactical Communications and Battle Space Management. This segment represents approximately only 45% of the group's sales and comprises a U.S. and a smaller U.K.-based business. The group's products and services provide critical command and control capability and enables secure, continuous communications all the way to the dismounted soldier. Programs include the Army's battlefield network, known as WIN-T and the new handheld software defined Joint Tactical Radio System known as JTRS HMS. We have dramatically diversified our overseas C4 business from a purely U.K.-based avionics house to a provider of vehicles, force protection, security, avionics and C4I products to a global clientele.
Earlier this year, GD U.K. was awarded the development contract for the British Army Scout reconnaissance vehicle. This program remains a top funding priority and was included as a component of the Army's future land forces in the U.K.'s recent strategic defense and security review.
Next, Information Technology and Mission Services. Our IT services unit comprises a little over 1/3 of the group's sales. This business enjoys excellent market positions in the Defense Department and the intelligence community as a provider of IT infrastructure, simulation and training services and key mission support. This business also provides an array of IT Healthcare Services to military, federal and commercial customers. 
And finally, Intelligence, Surveillance And Reconnaissance, ISR systems. Comprising about 20% of IS&T sales, this business specializes in signals intelligence, tactical imagery and information collection, processing, exploitation and distribution. 
In 2009, as many of you know, we added Axsys to this unit. As a best in class supplier of high-performance electrical optical and infrared sensors and systems, Axsys provides sensor components that enhance the ability of war fighters and government agencies alike to provide timely, actionable intelligence.
Although not a designated business unit within IS&T, Cyber security encompasses core capabilities resident in each of our businesses including encryption and information assurance, network security and forensics. General Dynamics is a market leader in the cyber arena with approximately $2 billion in 2009 sales across a diverse customer base, including the Pentagon, Homeland Security and the commercial markets.
As prime contractor on many sophisticated national Cyber security programs, we employ more than 50% of U.S.-cleared digital forensics investigators. Government agencies and private corporations alike will spend billions to protect and defend their networks in the years ahead. General Dynamics will be a major part of that fast-growing market.
The IS&T group, by leveraging its current capabilities to capture new business in faster growing market segments, has the opportunity to deliver steady growth over the next several years. Each of the group's businesses remain focused on maintaining their competitive edge by aggressively cutting costs, encouraging continuous improvement initiatives and selectively pursuing those opportunities that offer the most attractive returns.
Combat Systems. Combat Systems sales were $2.1 billion in the third quarter. This result represented less volume than the year-ago quarter primarily in vehicle modifications, combat logistic support and development programs. Year-to-date, over 50% of the group's sales decline is related to last MRAP volume and less engineering work, which is largely the result of a cancellation of future Combat Systems. 
Despite a reduction in sales, earnings were essentially flat with last year's third quarter as margins expanded in several of our businesses. The 150 basis point year-over-year margin improvement is the result of strong operating performance and less engineering and development content.
Total backlog for Combat Systems was essentially unchanged from second quarter at $12.8 billion. Notable orders in the quarter included approximately $475 million for Stryker vehicles and Abrams tanks, $80 million for Iraqi tank logistic support, $260 million for reactive armor, guns and biological detection systems and a $120 million award to supply ammunition to the Canadian Armed Forces.
Because of the success of Stryker double-V hull testing, we received another series of orders for the new hulls subsequent to the quarter. Double-V modifications of the current Stryker fleet remain another promising opportunity. We were also notified earlier this month that our U.S. Vehicle business was selected to negotiate a contract to produce Merkava APC main hulls and kits for the Israeli government. We expect to add this program to backlog in the first half of next year and we'll deliver these hulls over the next several years.
We made progress on several international programs in the quarter, delivering the first of 140 Iraqi tanks, finalizing preparations for FMS LAV production and progressing through Canadian LAV upgrade engineering work. Despite this progress, international sales are coming more slowly than anticipated but should grow more significantly in 2011. Consistent with my earlier report, a number of international programs have been slowed by their country's financial status, but none have been canceled or withdrawn. 
Combat expects to book several additional international orders in the fourth quarter including an FMS LAV order totaling $250 million, the first production contract for an FMS tank upgrade program totaling $300 million and a $100 million order for German EAGLE vehicles.
In the first half of 2011, we expect to add the first tranche of production funding for the $850 million Canadian LAV upgrade program to the backlog. The pacing of U.S. awards has also lagged our expectations this year. Some of the awards expected in the first half including armor and biological detection systems came late in the third quarter and will result in lower sales than previously expected in 2010. Other program awards, most notably the ground combat vehicle competition, were pushed out until 2011. Looking forward for the group, sales in the fourth quarter will be this year's strongest by far. For the full year, I expect the group's sales to be around $9 billion. 
My expectation for the group's full-year earnings remain unchanged. Margins, therefore, will be around 14%, 40 to 50 basis points higher than my prior guidance. This margin performance is the result of strong operational execution in the first nine months of the year and a favorable program mix that includes less development and initial- stage international work than originally anticipated.
As we look ahead, Combat's international opportunities, combined with current backlog, provide relative top line stability as international workload mitigates some slowing in our U.S. programs. The group's mature program mix will result in attractive margins and cash flow for the next several years.
Marine systems. The Marine Systems group had another good quarter with sales of $1.7 billion, up 12% over the year-ago period and 4% sequentially. Earnings totaled $169 million, up 9% over last year and consistent with last quarter's results. Sales and earnings growth were driven by growing Virginia class volume and SSBN replacement design efforts. The group's third quarter operating margin was 9.9%, down modestly from both the year-ago period and the prior quarter due to mixed shift in our surface combatant programs. With that said, this operating margin exceeded my expectations due to particularly good performance at Electric Boat and NASSCO. Electric Boat's third quarter delivery of USS Missouri is representative of the focus on execution resident at each of our three ERs. EB delivered this submarine in a record 65 months, five months faster than any of the six prior Virginia class boats. Missouri required 600,000 fewer labor hours than EB's last Virginia-class sub and was 8% under target cost.
Marine's backlog totaled $20.6 billion at the end of the third quarter, down 3% from the end of last quarter. Despite this decline, the group booked several key orders in the quarter including funding for Bath Iron Works to continue providing management, engineering and detailed design developments for the DDG 51 program. NASSCO also received funding for advanced engineering and long lead materials for the new mobile landing platform, MLP. And in final contract negotiations with our customer, we expect to add several construction contracts to Bath's backlog in the first half of next year, including, DDG's 1001 and 1002, the second and third of the Zumwalt Class and DDG 115, the restart of the DDG 51 program.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, group sales will look similar to the third quarter with operating margins in the mid-9% range as the surface combatant mix shift at Bath Iron Works becomes more apparent. For the full year, sales should be up approximately 5% compared with last year and margins will be in the high-9% range, slightly better than my prior guidance. 
Looking ahead, our shipyards enjoy a healthy backlog and an attractive opportunity set. In addition to our Navy work, we continue to see renewed interest across the range of commercial shippers and anticipate that we can leverage our excellent commercial tanker performance to win new commericial work in 2011.
Over the next two to three years, you will see the potential for margin improvements as surface combatant fixed-price work builds, commercial ship building opportunities materialize and construction on two per year Virginia is realized.
Aerospace. The Aerospace group's third quarter results were marked by improved order activity, service volume and operational performance. Group sales were nearly $1.3 billion, up 15% from last year's third quarter due to more green aircraft deliveries and higher services volume. Earnings were $199 million, a nearly 60% increase over the same period last year while margins were 15.4%, a 420 basis point improvement.
When compared with this year's second quarter, sales, earnings and margins were down due to the two-week furlough at Gulfstream, which caused fewer green deliveries and the timing of R&D costs. I expect sales, earnings and margins to show improvement in the fourth quarter.
The business jet market, particularly in the large cabin long-range segment, continue to make strides toward recovery in the third quarter, including further reduction in preowned aircraft levels.
Gulfstream took one preowned aircraft in trade this quarter and sold two aircraft for a modest profit. At the end of the quarter, Gulfstream had no preowned aircraft in inventory.
Customer interest remains healthy as Gulfstream booked more orders in the third quarter than in any quarter since the economic downturn began in mid-2008. On an absolute basis, dollar-denominated book-to-bill was 1.2x. Orders handily outpaced defaults resulting in a modest 1% decline in the backlog from the end of the second quarter. The group's backlog remains a robust $17.6 billion.
In addition to current backlog, our pipeline of new opportunities remains strong. We continue to experience strong international order activity and interest, particularly in emerging markets. In the quarter, Latin America and Asia-Pacific represented nearly 1/3 of order activity and now comprise over 40% of backlog. Recent orders span the entirety of our in production and new aircraft portfolio.
Flying hours improved again this quarter, a reality that helped Gulfstream service facilities enjoy their highest quarterly volume ever. Year-to-date, Gulfstream's service business is up 18.5%. Beyond improved utilization figures and a growing installed fleet, Gulfstream's service volumes reflects their unwavering commitment to provide a best-in-class support.
In the quarter, Gulfstream's large cabin business jets were voted number one for the eighth consecutive year in the annual AIA Product Support survey. Jet Aviation Service business has also enjoyed healthy growth this year, up nearly 10% year-to-date. As the international install fleet grows, we are adapting by growing our Product Support organization, which is the largest in the industry today. Jet continues to enhance its service offerings across the globe with particular emphasis in Asia, a region whose installed base promises to grow rapidly over the next several years.
Although Jet's service-related sales were up in the quarter, overall volume was down modestly from last quarter on lower completion revenue. Business Jet completions work has been lighter this year as OEMs delivered fewer aircraft. Conversely, the narrow-body, wide-body pipeline remains robust. And Jet signed agreements to complete three more of these aircraft in August. Jet continues to take steps to improve profitability including consolidating its U.S. completions and MRO operations at its Cahokia, Illinois facility near St. Louis. 
Planned deliveries for large cabin aircraft are on track, at 75 this year. Mid-cabin orders were more plentiful than anticipated in the quarter and I now expect the total approaching 30 this year, several more than I guided you to in July. We continue to make exciting progress on the product development front. With three G250 aircraft and four, soon to be five, G650 aircraft in flight test, we are on glide slope toward 2011, FAA IASA certification for both aircraft. In fact, recently, the fourth G650 test article and the first ever Gulfstream test article with a fully-outfitted interior, flew the fastest ultra-range, long-range flight ever flown by a business jet. This is a compelling demonstration of the G650's exceptional high-speed cruise capabilities. That was 5,000 nautical miles at 0.9 Mach in nine hours and 45 minutes. Both aircraft flew to NBAA in Atlanta, Georgia last week, with the G250 making its maiden transatlantic voyage en route. 
For the full year, I expect the Aerospace group's sales to be up mid-single-digit above last year, slightly higher than my prior guidance, due to better than anticipated service volume. Operating margins will also be better than previously anticipated, close to 16%. 
As we look to the future, the group will enjoy steady top line growth, driven by new product introduction and improving service volume. We will continue to manage this business with great discipline on the up cycle as we did through the down. 
In summary, General Dynamics continues to perform well and remains positioned for a good fourth quarter. For the year, I expect earnings per share from continuing operations to be $6.70 to $6.75, an increase from my prior guidance. As we look toward 2011, the Defense and Aerospace markets remain dynamic. Amidst the uncertainty of a fast-changing marketplace and budget adjustments, we remain focused on execution as we believe this will enable us to leverage our incumbency to win new opportunities. Our Defense backlog already includes a solid order book for next year and we are encouraged by the Congressional support our programs have received in the 2011 Defense budget appropriations process. 
Consequently, as we look to the future, I believe General Dynamics will offer a sustaining Defense business with excellent operating margins and strong free cash flow. In addition, our Aerospace business will be the growth engine throughout the near and intermediate timeframe. We are aggressively managing our businesses for profitability, with continued emphasis on earnings growth and efficient conversion of earnings to cash. Our strong balance sheet and excellent cash outlook afford us tremendous flexibility to continue deploying capital in a balanced manner in order to create the greatest long-term value for our shareholders.
And with that, I'll now ask Hugh Redd to touch on some additional financial details. Hugh?"

I'll start with some observations about our cash performance and financing activities. As you know, we experienced growth in working capital through the first half of the year due to timing of contract payments,",349,"Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some observations about our cash performance and financing activities. As you know, we experienced growth in working capital through the first half of the year due to timing of contract payments, particularly in our IS&T business. Continued focus on this area has begun to yield positive results. In the third quarter, we reversed the trend and trimmed 2010 OWC growth by 1/3. You can see the impact of that effort and the impact that had on strong free cash flow performance in the quarter. In addition, as Jay noted, we repaid $700 million of fixed rate notes in the third quarter. As a result of strong free cash flow and debt repayment, we've reduced our net debt by almost $400 million in the quarter. This leaves us at the end of the third quarter with a strong balance sheet and a debt to equity ratio of just under 24%. With the third quarter debt repayment, we're expecting net interest expense for the year of between $155 million to $160 million, consistent with our previous guidance but probably toward the lower end of that range. I should point out that in 2011, we're planning a $750 million debt repayment and a $300 million pension contribution, very similar to the debt repayment in the pension contribution made in 2010.
Finally, a quick note on our tax rate. I previously guided you to a range which was as low as 31.2%. That range was predicated largely on a then in process 2009 tax return. As we finalized the return in the third quarter, we identified some additional R&D tax credits that drove the rate to the lower end of our range. At this point, we're forecasting an effective rate of 31.2% for the year with some opportunity to improve. That compares with the full year rate of 31.5% last year. The tax rate in the third quarter reflects the true up to the reduced full year rate. 
That completes my remarks and I'll turn it back to Amy to begin the Q&A."

So we've got a great team doing superb work across a global scale here. I'm very proud of them. Now as to the sales, attendant to that performance, we had, as you know, a very, what I would call with a clarity of hindsight, a very aggressive sales plan at the start of the year, which has been softened by the reality, mostly timing realities of the world scene. So I would tell you that the first half of the year, in terms of sales growth, if you will, pretty much happened the way we thought it would, and I think I've been saying all along that we were heavily loaded to the second half of the year, which is not terribly unusual for Combat, but it was more so this year than I think perhaps historically. So we're heavily loaded to the second half of the year. I would tell you, in addition to what I said in my remarks about year-over-year comparisons with MRAP volume growing away and NCSD being canceled, a lot of what we are seeing, Howard, is just the timing of these programs. The indigenous vehicle programs, we are seeing the European sovereign debt realities impact us in Spain with the 8x8 competition that was going to happen this year has been moved into the mid-year of 2011 but reaffirmed by the Spanish Ministry of Defense as being essential to the Spanish Army. So we believe that one will still come. There are others in Portugal and other European countries that have pushed out a little bit, prolonging contract negotiations. I am sure things, if you will, the Canadian LAV is probably the best example of that, $850 million, I mentioned it in my remarks. It's happening, as we speak, we're in development, contract execution right now. We'll get the production contract in 2011 and off we go. And oh, by the way there, Howard, I should just mentioned on the Canadian side, when we talk about that LAV upgrade, we also talk about the technical Armored Patrol Vehicles and the CCV as downrange programs that are coming, but just in the last few days, it's been reaffirmed by my source with the Army chief up there, who basically ties this as a family of land combat vehicles that will all be, the RFPs for TAPV and CTV are going to happen this year, according to him, and so we'll be in production. Whoever gets that, will be in production from 2012 to 2015. So it's coming, it's just not here this year. Ditto with the UK Scout vehicle, which we're in contract right now on development, but it will be more to follow in the coming years. The International Vehicle Export business we've talked about before, the FMS LAVs and some of the tanks, we've got some of them, we've got more to come. Some of them we expect here in the fourth quarter. Would I bet everything on the fourth quarter? No. But if it's not in the fourth quarter, it will be in 2011. So it's all coming. The U.S. Vehicle business, we've had D-scope on some of the programs that we've talked about earlier in the year, Cougar MOD is one of them, the remote weapon system for Stryker is another one that comes to mind. We've had to lay our new programs like the GCV as I talked about and honestly, a little bit of lumpiness, I guess you could say, in kind of the reset and modification work on Stryker and Abrams as the force reconstitutes or repositions itself in some measures. And then on the Weapon Systems business, we've seen some delay as well. Armor is a classic example and then we had some softness in the commercial axle market and some of the aftermarket that goes with that, that actually is coming in now but anyway, I think that's probably more than you asked me for but to sum it all, I would say it was also a very strong order quarter for Combat which also bodes well, I think, for the rest of the year and for 2011. Historically, European Land Systems has been the strongest in the fourth quarter, I expect that to happen again this year."

And so we don't anticipate any cosmic changes there in terms of what our requirements will be. As to the debt market, I know it's a favorite question that we get a lot, but I would just tell you that truly keeping with the way General Dynamics does business, which I like to think is very disciplined, we kind of don't go to the debt market unless we have a specific reason for going to the debt market. If I got a purpose in mind and we need to go, we've got plenty of access to go there, but we don't do it just to get some cash. We've got $2 billion in credit facilities, we're great cash generators, we have lots of cash on hand right now, and so we'll continue to generate more. It gives us the flexibility we need to be acquisitive, which we historically, as you know, have been and will continue to be as opportunities present themselves. So we're not inclined to go to the debt market for good deals because actually the commercial paper market right now, which we have got great access to, would give us more attractive rates than the debt market. We also retired our $700 million notes this year at par with essentially no economic cost to us. So we think we're managing that side in a pretty balanced manner."

But I think if you look at the portfolios and you look at the relevance of the businesses, I mean, the Marine group is going to be building Virginia class submarines for a long time. As we've talked before, the Navy will need surface combatants of scale that we build for a long time, so that workload and the repair appended to that will be, certainly, I would categorize is as steady, if not some growth going forward. And I'm being realistic in terms of how I think of Defense, it's not going to grow like it has been, very obviously. But we do believe that there may be some modest growth opportunity in there and what I cited and the fast curents in IS&T, are a classic example of that. On the Combat side, that's a steady business as we see it right now. We see a lot of 2011 already in program or record. And if you look at the United States Army, for example, and look at the 20-some heavy brigade combat teams and the seven going to eight and probably going to nine, Stryker Brigade Combat Teams with the former at 60 Abrams per brigade and the latter at 330-plus Strykers per brigade, that kid is not going to change out until you see a fundamental change in the forestructure of the United States Army. So we try to think of it in pragmatic terms, threat-based and core-based, if you will, and that really I think formed the core basis of my comments as much as anything, Joe. And on the Aerospace side, that is clearly a growth engine for everyone, I would say, in the industry, but particularly when you're driving the premier brand, the Gulfstream, with new products about to hit the street with 200-plus airplanes in the G650 queue, et cetera. So put all that together and you've got, I believe, a very steady, sustaining Defense business. Could things change? That depends on budgets and all the realities, but I still believe with everything I've got that the threat and the appetite for risk-taking at a national strategic level will drive the Defense budget as much as anything. Will there be pressure? Is there pressure? Good lord, yes. Will it tighten, it already is in every segment we deal with. There's no question about that, so we're not denying any of that. But we deal with it day by day, contract by contract, platform by platform, system by system and we think we deal with it very well."
