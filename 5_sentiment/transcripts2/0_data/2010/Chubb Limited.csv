As you saw from the numbers, we had a very strong fourth quarter, which contributed to an excellent year. After-tax operating income in the quarter was $2.01 per share bringing full year operating income to $8.17 or $2.8 billion, an all-time",1715,"Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had a very strong fourth quarter, which contributed to an excellent year. After-tax operating income in the quarter was $2.01 per share bringing full year operating income to $8.17 or $2.8 billion, an all-time high for the company. Given the difficult economic and financial conditions we faced in 2009, this were simply excellent results and with all divisions of the company making a meaningful contribution.Book value grew $930 million in the quarter, bringing full-year growth to 36% and tangible was up 47% for the year. This was a standout performance that restored last year's book value erosion and set a new high for the company. In fact, for the last five years, we have grown book value and tangible book at a compound annual rate of 15% and 17%, respectively. Our P&C combined ratio for the year was 88.3% and the '09 accident year combined so excluding prior period development was 93.2. These are both excellent results that speak to the broad global balance of our operations and the quality and strength of our fundamental business.Our balance sheet including our loss reserves position is very strong. Our total capital increased 29% to $23 billion in the year. Our net loss reserves grew 4%, now stand to $24 billion. I might add that our loss reserves are reviewed not only by our own actuaries, each portfolio is reviewed by outside actuaries and our external auditors. Our P&C reserves are in very good shape in each of our divisions, North America, International and Global Re. Our ROE for the year was 16.2%, an efficient and excellent return on capital and I believe borrowing unforeseen circumstances, our ROEs will remain superior.On a related note, some shareholders judge at a given moment in time, the best way to increase earnings per share and book value per share is by buying back stock. We understand the argument and recognize the validity of that option, but it's not applicable to all companies at all times. We believe for ACE a more strategic way to increase EPS in book value per share is by growing the company not shrinking it, which is essentially what share buybacks do.We are a global diversified company with a long-term strategic plan. There is plenty of opportunity around the world to grow our company overtime. Even if you cannot see the opportunity at the moment, it doesn't mean it doesn't or won't exist. On the other side of the coin, we believe it is prudent to also hold capital for risks. We are after all in the Risk business. For example, where we'll be today if we encountered a major risk event that needed to raise capital during the market upheaval of last year. Just in time, capital management sounds great in concept but it ignores reality. For both good times and bad, we have a long-term patient view for managing our capital. We truly thoughtful and methodical when thinking about this issue and take seriously our responsibility to be good stewards of our shareholders money. And I might add that our track record is measured by ROE and book value is good, as well as our track record for acquisition. The Combined our most recent two years on is right on target financially compared to where we said it would be, and so we'll add a little more detail to that.As part of our stewardship responsibility, rest assured, if we build up what we consider to be surplus capital, it cannot be put to work productively over a reasonable period, we will consider tactics to return that capital to our shareholders including share repurchases. And we, management and the Board of Directors, mean it.Turning to market conditions, given the current reasonable health of the industry's balance sheet and cash flow, and industry cycle at least 'till now typically turn on the balance sheet and cash, we're in a soft market to state the obvious. From an underwriting risk reward perspective, prices are inadequate in many classes and industry profitability is under pressure. Our management team has lived through soft markets and seen what happens when companies are not willing to make sacrifices in terms of market share and value. At ACE, we won't knowingly forfeit future profitability for short-term benefits. We've made it clear, we'd rather write less business than kid ourselves about price or reserve adequacy, and I believe that our actions over the last couple of years have proven just that.On the other hand, the profile of who we are and what we have to offer including the size and strength of our balance sheet, our local presence globally and broad product capability and technical underwriting prowess continue to attract business to our company. Because of our increased product and geographic presence, we see so much more opportunity. Even if we don't ultimately write the business because it does not meet our standards, our submission counts were significantly higher during '09 and the number of accounts we wrote also increased substantially as a result of our increased presence, particularly in specialty middle market. Our new business premium writings, however, were down as a result of underwriting discipline. For example, for the quarter, submissions for our principal North America commercial retail insurance lines were up 12.5% while our new business premium writings were up just over 6%. Similarly in our International business, submissions were up 12% while new business premium writings dropped 11%.Our total P&C net written premiums were up about 9% in the quarter, an excellent result that was helped in part by foreign exchange. In constant dollar, we were up 4% and for the year in constant dollar, P&C premiums grew 3%, with global retail up 8% and global whole sale down 5%. Our renewal pricing for our commercial P&C portfolio was up about 1% in the quarter with some classes up single to double digit and others down modestly, modest single-digit. Our renewal retention rates are moving up and stood at 88% for our U.S. Retail business. We are emphasizing renewal retention and conserving where possible the risks we know. Terms and conditions are holding and are relatively steady for the business we wrote although there are increased requests for terms and conditions we find unacceptable.Revenue growth for our Retail P&C Insurance business followed a few broad themes in the quarter. First, our increased local and global presence allowed us to take advantage of the weakness of other companies that damaged the confidence of their clients and producers who are turning to ACE as an attractive alternative. We continue to experience this flight to capability and balance sheet, especially in those lines of insurance or risk players where more than price matters. We also gained business in lines and areas in which we have been making investments in our underwriting talent, servicing capability and where there was a reasonable underwriting margin.Second, we benefit in the quarter from growth in those harder market lines of business that have and are experiencing losses, and where prices have risen. These include areas such as financial institution, professional liability, offshore and onshore energy and aviation. Lastly, we benefited in North America in the quarter from a couple of large transactions, where our balance sheet and technical ability made us an attractive choice. Both Brian Dowd and John Keogh can provide more color on growth and pricing if you want. Turning to Reinsurance, Global refinished an outstanding year with another strong quarterly performance. As I've explained on previous calls, after several years of shrinking due to market conditions, Global re-experienced good growth in the fourth quarter and benefited particularly from business written in the first half of the year when pricing was better. Global Re's fourth quarter and full-year net premiums were up 14% over prior year. For the year, growth came from both long tail and short tail lines. For Reinsurance market conditions January 1, we're in general more competitive with reduced demand on the part of buyers and more suppliers, reinsurers had stronger balance sheet, partially due to the recovery of the financial markets and lack of major cats in 2009. As such, property cat pricing was off mid-single digit but still at sufficiently attractive levels, particularly for U.S. peak exposure.Pricing in non-cat areas or lines of business continued to decrease moderately, creating greater pressure on already stressed margins. As it stands, we wrote modestly less Reinsurance business January 1 this year than last. Concerning our Global Accident and Health business, we experienced the best growth in the year in the fourth quarter, with premiums up about 8% compared to prior. Adjusting for foreign exchange, premiums were flat in the quarter, but up 11% for the year in constant dollar. The underlying long-term trends of a growing middle-class, particularly in Latin America and Asia, where we have substantial presence and capability continued to favor this business. Economically, these regions are also recovering the fastest and this will benefit our business. Our A&H business is solid and in good shape. The transient effects of recession diminish as we progress through '10 and I expect growth to pick up.In addition, while our results may not show this, last year we gained ground in securing more distribution particularly in retail travel, corporate customers who buy accident insurance to cover employees and more sponsors for direct-response marketing. We also used this time to tactically shift our strategy to put increased focus on Corporate and Travel segments without neglecting our direct-response distribution. And I believe ultimately, these result in a better balanced portfolio.In summary, I believe ACE's results for the quarter and the full year were excellent and clearly distinguishing as demonstrated by our strong operating performance, book value growth and ROEs. All while continuing to invest in our product and geographic presence globally in spite of economic and financial conditions, I don't know many companies that can say this. Despite the soft market conditions, we have plenty of opportunity in front of us, although it will take place over time. 2010 will mark the 25th anniversary of our company and I'm confident in ACE's ability to continue producing superior results this year and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil and then we'll conduct take your questions."

Shareholders equity increased by more than $5 billion for the year. Our operating cash flow for the year was $3.3 billion and our cash and invested assets grew by 16% to over $47 billion.Our investment portfolio is in an overall unrealized gain position of more than $650 million. Our portfolio continues to be predominantly invested in publicly traded investment grade fixed income securities, as well diversified across geographies, sectors and issuers. The average credit rating remains AA, with over half invested in AAA securities. The duration of the portfolio is relatively short at approximately 3.7 years.Investment income was $2 billion for the year. Income on new cash flow was offset by falling reinvestment rates and our investment income was about flat with last year adjusted for foreign exchange. The average yield on our invested asset is 4.5% with new money rates between 4% and 4.25% assuming we invest funds in a similar distribution to our existing portfolio. Net loss reserves increased about $930 million for the year and our paid to incurred ratio was 93.6%.Adjusted for the impact of our positive prior period development, the ratio was 86.8%. Underwriting cash flow exceeded $2 billion for the year.Financial flexibility at the holding company level remains strong, given our operating company's dividend capacity and low levels of debt refinancing needs over the next five years. Our debt to total capital leverage ratio of 14.2% continues to be conservative relative to our current rating level, and our Reinsurance recoverable leverage is down to 69%. Evan mentioned the strength of our A&H business. It's worth noting that our acquisition of Combined has produced a cumulative $0.53 of EPS accretion and 100 basis points of ROE accretion, which are both in line with our original estimates.Our ownership in AGO dropped from 21% at the beginning of 2009 to about 3% currently. The change resulted from dilution caused by AGO share issuance and from our share divestitures during the quarter. We will continue to account for our remaining investment of approximately $125 million by recording any change in market value in unrealized gains and losses.Before you ask, I'll mention that the increase in goodwill is predominantly related to foreign currency movements on our goodwill that we're experiencing for the first time because we felt it was preferable to allocate goodwill to the legal entity level rather than keeping at aggregate at the reporting unit level. We issued our 2010 guidance in our press release dated January 5. The guidance range for operating earnings per share of $6.25 to $6.75 for 2010 compares to our actual 2009 current accident year earnings per share of $6.10, which has been adjusted to reflect the 2009 original plan cat losses. Since this is an accident year number, the $6.10 by definition includes no prior period reserve development.  I'll turn the call back to Helen."

On the CMBS, actually the LTV remained unchanged on a quarter and if we're just focusing on CMBS rather than non-agency, these securities are super senior that predominantly rated AAA. And there are still broadly over 23,000 loans and so forth. I think the key to focus on there is the fact that 73% of that portfolio was originated before '06. So when we say that the current annual delinquency rate is 9%, maybe we should have clarified that, that's the market. We're not seeing that in our portfolio and what would have to happen to our portfolio is that thing cumulatively will have to rise to over 40% and real estate values will have to fall 10% from current levels for us to have any principal impairment. But that's why these ratings have really held up there. So we feel that this portfolio is in good shape. When we run this analysis, by the way, we have assumed in terms of further price depreciation that real estate values have come down generally by 40% already. So that's where you're seeing some movement there."

And then when you get it to price to book, yes, we're mindful of that but remember and this is what I said to begin with, fundamentally, Brian, a share buyback is shrinking the company. It is not growing the company. It's increasing EPS by shrinking it. Our job, first of all, is to grow the company. And by the way, what shareholder does it benefit. It benefits the guy who's trading out of your stock. Now you can say -- look, are you going to use the capital well? Well, we have a good track record for doing that and if we don't think we can, then we will return it to shareholders. And I hear the last one it's almost we're going to beat it to death [ph] Look, you bought the Combined Insurance accretive. It's done what you say, you do it. But you bought it at a certain price in 2007. Wouldn't you bought it cheaper if you've waited? Yes, okay. But it did everything we said it would do, number one. But let's imagine I did share buybacks in 2007 and share prices then versus now, is that accretive? I don't think so. So that's what we come from and yes, there is a price I agree with you. But that certain return on an EPS is simplistic because it's not a return for the company, it's a return on EPS at that moment. And we all get that in the math. Could there be a price? Of course, and as part of the total mix and it's not just about price and what we think is transient price. We're not contrary about this and we're not emotional. I think we're thoughtful about the subject. And at the end of the day, why we don't get so angst about our share price in the short-term and we don't. Is that we know that results are ultimately what drives share price. And we're very confident about that, and we're confident in the results we're producing and in the quality and distinction of the franchise we're building. We're believes on that. And we believe that ultimately drive share price. And if our share price is going to stay low for a period of time because of what we think is this emotional view on buybacks and that's what's going to do it fundamentally, well then our share price won't rise in a smooth way. They don't just rise in a lumpy way when somebody wakes up and discovers, wow, this is a great company selling cheap."

I look at the fourth quarter as our profitable growth opportunities present themselves in a number of ways, frankly mainly as a result of the investments we've made in our underwriting and our product capability. In the quarter, we saw improved submission flow, increased retention ratio and an adequate rate environment in targeted classes. In particular, we had strong success in Professional Risks, Construction, ACE Global Underwriting, ACE Financial Solution and ACE Private Risk. First, in our Professional Risk division. Our submission activity was up 23% as both our distribution partners and customers recognized the strength of the ACE brand and our product diversity and the ability to respond and handle complex claims. Rates in professional risk did, in fact, flattened in the fourth quarter. However, rates in the financial institutions market portion rose about 8%. In 2009, we invested in our private company and in our not-for-profit segment. And we increased our local presence nationally. In fact, we added over 50 underwriters in this area as we saw opportunity as our customers frankly did respond to the opportunities, our competition. We are gaining transaction. We are gaining momentum in this market. Additionally, our focus on customer service led to premium renewal retention ratio of about 90%. In the Construction Practice, even in this economic environment, we have the ability to profitably grow this segment. ACE's financial stability, customers need a multiyear commitment and our ability to seamlessly package our products from builders risk to construction wrap-up to access to environmental, along with our loss prevention and claims services had differentiated us. Submission activity was up modestly at 5%. However, our bound [ph] improved as customers made ACE their number one choice. Our new business relative rate adequacy in construction was very strong at a 115%, reflecting new business price better than renewal on this line. In our ACE Global Underwriting division, which underwrites services at our large complex global companies, we also had a strong quarter. There are only handful of companies with the infrastructure to successfully handle these types of accounts. While submission activity was basically flat, our new business grew at 11% and our new business rate adequacy was 105%. No question, we were a beneficiary of right to quality balance sheet and strong service capabilities. Another area where we remain committed is our ACE Financial Solutions team where we have an underwriting legal and claim service teams. In the fourth quarter, we completed a number of loss portfolio transfers where we're virtually the only company with the expertise to structure and execute on these transactions. Finally, our Private Risk Services division's net revenue premium growth in the fourth quarter was 42%. Submission activity was up 108%. This growth is reflection of our successful nationwide capability expansion. As of year-end, we had ACE Private Services Platinum Portfolio of products in 45 states, which represent states that are 99% of the high net worth clientele. Our hit ratio on the new business improved to 22% in the fourth quarter, reflecting steady improvement from the 12% in the first quarter as we built our brand in the space, and we appointed new agents and brokers and that they became more familiar with our capabilities.

And that has come down to a degree. It's not as much as it was. And we're not mindlessly defending our renewal book, but it is the business we know. And I gave you the rate movement on the renewable books, so you can square the circle with that. Clearly, you take flat rate 1% and you take what you consider to be lost cost trends depending on the line of business, an accident year deteriorates as you project that going forward or policy year does. And we're very mindful of that on each portfolio, and we're watching it closely. In some, the retention rate is lower, in some the retention rate is higher. Our risk management business for instance in the quarter, the retention rate was more like 90%. But then, we have some other business where the retention rate's in the 70s because we're mindful of price and what we think is the ultimate accident year or policy year development on that business."

I guess I think maybe what people are missing is that there's a lot of M&A targets out there that are hopefully as cheap as your stock possibly. So it seems to me the only sort of risk in the strategy is if you wait too long to find a target and then, you pass on the opportunity, buy the stock cheap and you pay up for a deal. But in the current environment, I think that's necessary to risk other than the size of a deal you can do. And I guess that's my question is. I would hope at the stock price, you'd have an incredibly high bar for issuing equity for a deal. So I guess one, is that the case?

You think about seriously when loss portfolio opportunities are available, it's usually interest rate-driven. And this unique period of time is a little bit different.

So now, the average charge on getting rid of an LOC at 400 to 500 basis points on a portfolio really drive the dynamics of now why you can come to a bid-ask price spread that makes sense to the customer and for us.

If you structure it right for writing that business, in example, could be the financial institution professional liability area. They're areas where it's not simply about price, and there has been a flight to our capability and to the balance sheet. Construction is one of those areas right now. Large projects, casualty-driven, low property losses this year versus last year. You didn't have the same level of large loss.

203028,78932117,58420,"ACE Limited, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Chubb Limited","Executives","Good morning. All things considered, an eventful quarter for natural catastrophes, the continued impact of recession, and competitive market conditions, ACE had a good first quarter and start to 2010.After tax operating income for the quarter was $579 m",1526,"Good morning. All things considered, an eventful quarter for natural catastrophes, the continued impact of recession, and competitive market conditions, ACE had a good first quarter and start to 2010.
After tax operating income for the quarter was $579 million or $1.70 per share, while net income in the period was $755 million. All divisions of the company made a strong contribution to the results. We recorded a $149 million in after tax CAT losses for the quarter, which was marked by a large number of significant natural catastrophes globally.
As you know, we previously reported a first quarter loss estimate of $125 million after tax. That estimate for the cohort [ph] catastrophes known at that time has improved. However, subsequent to the announcement, there were a number of additional events, including the storms in Perth, Australia and the northeast United States, both of which resulted in historic levels of flooding. Losses from those additional storms are estimated at $32 million after tax. We’ve included an exhibit in our supplement that sheds more light on our CAT losses both gross and net.
I believe ACE’s level of losses in total demonstrate good underwriting discipline in risk management. It’s worth noting, that of the total CAT losses, global REs [ph] were $29 million, a relatively modest number that reflects what has been our underwriting position regarding non-US CAT RE. Namely, that we are underweight exposure because of inadequate pricing, and in many instances, lack of creditable data.
Some analysts have expressed surprise at the level of our net CAT losses. I would refer you to our 10-K, where we provide disclosure about our catastrophe reinsurance protections. Including the fact that we purchase, in certain regions of the world, drop down covers. Knowing this fact may help you better understand the level of our losses. We benefited in the quarter from positive prior period reserve development in the amount of approximately $96 million, nearly all of which were short tail lines related.
Over $40 billion [ph] of the $96 million would be ’09 year crop insurance adjustment. As you might recall, the first quarter's results typically include a prior year crop adjustment, which in a good year, helps the loss ratio that hurts the expense ratio. Our combined ratio for the first quarter was 92.8%, which was very good.
The underlying health of our business is in good shape as demonstrated by our current accident year combined EX-CAT of 90.2% versus 88.6% last year. The expense ratio was up about three points in the quarter compared to the same period last year, two thirds of which was due to crop profit sharing and CAT reinstatement premiums. Phil will provide more details.
I want to make a few comments about growth, pricing and the environment. Total company net written premiums were up 4%. And adjusting for foreign exchange, they were up 1%, reflecting both the economic environment and insurance market pricing pressures. We are obviously operating in a competitive insurance market. In my judgment, for the industry overall, the CAT losses in the first quarter are an income event, not a balance sheet event, or for most companies, a reassessment of risk event.
As a result, I believe we are going to continue facing competitive market conditions. On the other hand, the economy in general has stabilized and is showing some signs of improvement. With that said, generally speaking for ACE, while there is less opportunity to write new business at an acceptable return, there is still much opportunity around the globe nonetheless, because of our capability with geographic and product.
We saw many of the same competitive trends I’ve spoken about in the past continuing in the quarter. For example, retail insurance perform better than wholesale, while retail growing - with retail growing 4.5% in constant dollars and wholesale shrinking 1%. In the US, retail P&C insurance net premiums grew 6% in the first quarter. And our renewal to retention ratio is steady at around 88%. However, because of our decision to invest and grow last year, particularly in numerous specialty casualty related areas, our available renewal premium in the first quarter was up rather significantly over prior in a number of areas such as professional lines, excess casualty, environmental and construction.
Our premium growth in North America also benefited in the quarter, the more capability to handle complex and front-end business, which added to growth in both gross and net. Specifically, we wrote a couple of loss portfolio transfer type accounts as well as a number of large global and risk management type property and casualty accounts. We also wrote last year - late last year as a result of a flight to quality, a couple of large workers' comp programs and these are contributing to our new business growth as well. Excluding these items, our total new - our total new business writings were down, even though our submission counts continue to rise.
Pricing for the business we wrote in the quarter was down about 1.25% in North America. In general, pricing on new business was worse than on renewals by about 3%, although it varies by line. And let me give you some renewal pricing specifics.
Casualty related lines, umbrella access, environmental, construction, and custom casualty overall, was up by about 2%. Energy type property rates were down about 4%. Commercial property and marine, they were down about 5%, and for risk management business, which is GL and Comp, was flat. Medical professional liability pricing is down five and professional lines, D&O, E&O and FI, all blended together, we’re down by 3.5%.
On the international side, retail P&C insurance grew 5% in constant dollar during the first quarter. The renewal-retention ratio was steady for the quarter. Pricing for the business we wrote was down 1%, property was flat, and financial lines were down about 3% and casualty was down by about 1%.
On the wholesale side of our business, our London based business shrank 16%, while our US wholesale was down 25%. However, this included a decline in crop insurance premiums of over 30% offset to some extent by about a 10% increase in other lines, made up predominantly of growth in CAT related property, increased retentions in our professional liability business and good growth in wholesale environmental. Our Bermuda-based wholesale business was flat.
One last thought on the insurance market environment. Client business exposures that we use for rating purposes were down approximately to 5 to 6% in the quarter, particularly client sales related exposures. These obviously impacted premium revenue.
As we have said in the past, insurance lags, broader economic activity for our clients renewing in the first quarter, we are rating off a base that begins with their own line exposures, both for retro premium adjustments and for calculating current year’s renewal.
Turning briefly to some of our other businesses, global RE saw reasonable growth in the quarter although was primarily a consequence of the business we wrote in 2009. Annualized underwriting year premiums written in the quarter actually shrank. Our high net worth personal lines business in the US had another good quarter and is growing rapidly and according to plan. Net premiums were up 43%. We have developed an excellent reputation for underwriting and servicing in this business and is continuing - it is contributing nicely to our growth.
Finally, turning to our accident health insurance business, A&H grew 8% in the quarter benefiting from foreign exchange. In constant dollar, A&H was essentially flat. A&H growth rates are stabilizing, though it varies by region and business. Growth continues to be impacted by the recession globally, lower employee counts, fewer travelers and a slow return or no return to consumer credit.
Combined Insurance has improved and growth and constant dollar began to pick up modestly in the quarter. Their new model for modernizing agency in the US is showing the best result in terms of agent productivity we’ve seen yet. In fact, equally or exceeding our expectations. As a result, I am optimistic about the future for our US business and we are adopting and exporting the model to other markets.
For the quarter and combines other large markets, Australia, New Zealand are doing very well and growth has picked up. Spain, which is small but has good potential, is beginning to show signs of improvement. And the UK is stabilizing and is showing a better trend, while Ireland continues to lag.
ACE International, our other major A&H portfolio, has stabilized but is not yet demonstrating real growth. And constant dollar premiums were down 1% when you include some of the A&H premium that was more appropriately moved to the life insurance division.
We have a lot of activity and opportunity in the pipeline and expect both Combined Insurance and International ANH to continue to improve and resume positive and meaningful growth as the year progresses, particularly in the second half.
Lastly, we have received calls about the impact of volcanic ash on our travel accident business. We expect losses to be de minimus.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil, then we'll be back to take your questions.

Our balance sheet continued to grow stronger in the first quarter. Our cash and invested assets grew by almost $1.3 billion. Our tangible book value per share increased by 5.8% to $49.48, and our operating cash flow was strong at about $820 million.
Operating ROE for the quarter was 12%. Net realized and unrealized gains from our investment portfolio were $574 million before tax. Our investment portfolio was in overall unrealized gain position of $1.2 billion pre-tax as of March 31st. Included in our unrealized gain and our realized gain, is about $44 million related to the sale of our AGO shares. We have now sold all of our remaining interest in AGO. Our portfolio continues to be predominantly invested in publicly traded investment grade fixed income securities and is well diversified across geographies, sectors and issuers.
The average credit rating remains at AA with over half invested in AAA securities. The duration of our portfolio is relatively short at 3.7 years. Investment income was $504 million. Income on new cash flow was offset by lower new money yields and our investment income was about flat with last year. The average yield on our invested assets is 4.4% with new money rates around 4%, assuming we invest funds in a similar distribution to our existing portfolio.
Net loss reserves were up about $25 million for the quarter. They were impacted by foreign exchange, which reduced the growth by approximately $200 million. Our paid-to-incurred ratio was 92% and has been steady for the past four, five quarters. Our expense ratio is up 3% points compared to last year. This increase includes the effect of our annual crop settlement, which was about half of the increase, and foreign exchange with the impact of reinstatement premiums for this quarter's CAT losses.
Adjusted for these three items, the expense ratio increased by about 70 basis points.
Given a number of unusual items impacting the expense ratio this quarter, we’ve included an additional page of disclosure in the supplement. Financial flexibility at the holding company level remains strong, given our operating company's dividend capacity and low levels of debt refinancing needs over the next five years. Our debt-to-total capital leverage ratio of 13.6% continues to be conservative relative to our current rating level, and our reinsurance recoverable leverage is down to about 65%.
With that, I’ll turn the call back to Helen.

Number two, if they have - and right now, as of last night, it appears that the fund - the pre-funded fund, is - or post-funded is out for the moment.

Now, they’ve really diluted it in terms of the parameters under which they would assess, and therefore, the impact on P&C.

And we were already paying into for systemic. And we already pay into a solvency fund. And P&C is not systemic. And so, we’re making those arguments to not simply dilute what P&C’s contribution could be if there was a fund, but get us out completely because it’s redundant.
And secondly, for systemic, let’s not have duplication of the Feds' oversighting and the states. Let’s be clear within the bill that it leaves it to the states even if there is some kind of scanning and oversight by the Feds in systemic. That answered it for you?

And broadly, retail insurance versus wholesale, retail is up significantly more. I say significantly, a couple of points. Wholesale is actually down a little bit. And what you adjust for is crop insurance. We wrote less crop for the current accident year. And Brian could explain why. And crop carries a higher loss ratio with it. So that’s a mix - that becomes a mix change.
And by the way, some of the rest of you may notice in our supplement that it looks like casualty is a bigger percentage of our business. It’s really not. It’s that we wrote less crop because we booked in property. And if you adjust for that - and that’s just a - that's just a matter of commodity prices, really, that’s dropping that, I believe. And Brian will talk more about it. But anyway that also impacts to current accident year loss ratio. Predominantly, that’s the main reason.
And then, in the Westchester we also wrote more - we wrote more property CAT-related business in the quarter than casualty. And that carries a lower loss ratio. So it’s those sorts of things that actually I’m asking what is - when you go product by product, cohort by cohort, a higher and increasing trend in current accident year, which is perfectly normal and natural given pricing and what we think is enduring trend.

In particular, I went through it, financial lines, environmental, excess casualty, and construction. We increased our presence both in the US and overseas. In those areas, we wrote a - we wrote more new business in the first half last year. And that increased our renewal base. And so we grew from that. And though new business writings, we wrote new business, but new business was down a bit. So the two together, between the - our ability to handle very complex, and on the other hand those specialty classes, that’s where you’re seeing it from.

And there's also the SSAP adjustment that you have to do based on the profitability of the business. So I look at 2010 in the first quarter if the winter - wheat prices were about 38% lower year-over-year. So that amounts to a big portion of the drop in premium.
But on the second piece, which is about half, is tripled to the - when you make a larger profit in the crop business, you have to see more of the premium to the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation under the terms of the SRA. So 2009, as a year-over-year, was a very profitable year, so we made more profit. So you actually see under the accounting adjustment premium to the government at a greater proportion on our higher profit year. And we make that adjustment here in the first quarter.

The change is - the New SRA until 2011, so the 2010 crop you’re under the old SRA. So that won’t affect it until next year’s rate. 2010 premium, though, when you start to see it in the second and third quarter, will probably be impacted again because commodity prices are lower and more stable against it. You may see that. If you have the same market share, you’d likely see lower premium in 2010 than you would have seen in 2009.

Net income was $677 million and was up abo",1470,"Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, ACE had an excellent second quarter which contributed to a strong first six months. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $688 million, just over $0.02 a share. Net income was $677 million and was up about 27% from the second quarter last year. All divisions of the company made a contribution to results, a strong contribution.
Per share book value grew almost 4% and now it stands at over $63 and book value per share is up 8% year-to-date and our ROE was 13.8% in the quarter, up from 12% in the first quarter. Our combined ratio for the quarter was 89.7%, which included net catastrophe losses mostly from U.S. events of $76 million and favorable prior period reserve development of about $150 million.
Cat losses were more than double the amount from last year, but largely in line with our expectations, while prior period development was a little less than prior. Our accident year combined for the quarter excluding cats and PPD was $92.1 million, a very good result and flat with prior year, with the loss ratio down and expense ratio up. Phil will provide more detail around the current accident year numbers.
I want to make a few comments about the macro and insurance market environment and its impact on our company. Economic growth was weak, particularly in Europe and the U.S. and it remains so, while conditions are considerably better in Asia and Latin America. Unemployment in the U.S. and Europe remains high and likely will for years to come.
In the U.S., there is generally a lack of confidence among consumers and business alike and with little meaningful impetus for sustained economic growth; we are likely in a period of prolonged slow growth. In addition, insurance market conditions remain competitive with prices generally soft and softening around the world. I expect these macro conditions will be with us for the foreseeable future though there is much uncertainty.
On a reported basis, our total company net premiums were flat in the quarter. Commercial P&C was down. A&H, personal lines and Life were up. We continue to practice what we believe is prudent cycle management in our commercial P&C businesses, shedding exposure where prices in terms are inadequate to generate an underwriting profit.
Our new business writings were down year-on-year and our renewal retention rates, particularly in our retail P&C businesses were up. Recession-related reduction and exposures are moderating and had less than a 2 point impact on revenue in the quarter, the lowest in a number of quarters.
Retail insurance again performed better than wholesale with retail up about 1.5% while wholesale was shrinking about 6%. Adjusting for a large loss portfolio transaction we wrote last year in North America, as well as less crop premium in our U.S. wholesale business, retail commercial P&C was actually up over 7% and wholesale was up 3%, though our growth benefited from a positive foreign exchange impact of about 2 points.
On the wholesale side of the business, we continue to shrink our book where necessary due to inadequate pricing. For example, premiums were down about 8% in our London wholesale business where competitive London market conditions continue to impact nearly all lines including marine, aviation, energy and property. In our U.S. wholesale business premiums were down about 7%. Adjusting for the crop, however, premiums were up 15%.
As I mentioned in the fourth quarter, we wrote a large program that moved to ACE because the insured was seeking a more secured carrier and we had the capability. This had a substantial benefit on our U.S. wholesale growth rate.
On the retail side, commercial P&C in the U.S. was down on a reported basis, but grew 7% after adjusting for that one large LPT transaction we wrote last year.
U.S. retail revenue and wholesale for that matter benefited from a very large new construction project we wrote, as well as higher renewal retention rates, which were up about 2%, though again we wrote substantially less new business than a year ago.
As we detailed during last month’s Investor Day, for those areas of our business where a client is engaging us for our capability and not simply price, business is less cyclical, less commodity-like.
We experienced higher retentions, better pricing and firmer terms and conditions. These include areas such as the primary lead layers of excess casualty and D&O, our risk management business, construction and multinational global programs. Once you leave these kinds of areas, were specialties such as crop, etc., the business becomes more cyclical, more commodity-oriented.
On the international side, retail P&C was up about 8% on a reported basis and up 4% on a constant dollar basis, driven by double-digit growth in both Latin America and Asia Pacific. Concerning the rate environment, rates for the business we wrote in the U.S. were down about 2.7%, while rates for our international business were down about 1%.
Let me give you two new business examples for our commercial lines. The first illustrates our product capability, the second our on-the-ground local presence globally.
In our North American Insurance division, net premiums in our construction practice were up substantially in the quarter, driven by a large complex long-term public infrastructure project in the New York, New Jersey area where ACE was selected as the lead carrier for the primary, excess casualty and builders’ risk covers.
ACE won the business as a result of our underwriting, claims and risk control expertise. Not to mention our A plus balance sheet, a critical requirement for this long-term project.
In our International Insurance business, I just came back from a visit to Latin America, including the stop in Sao Paulo. Our business in Brazil is doing very well, driven by a fast growing and liberalized economy, major infrastructure spending and newly modernized insurance regulation.
Net premiums are up serious double-digits year-to-date. We’re experiencing robust growth in commercial P&C, A&H and Life insurance.
Another area where we continue to experience solid growth in the quarter is our young and growing personal lines business both domestically and internationally.
In the United States, net premiums in ACE Private Risk Services are up significantly year-to-date, while our specialty-oriented international personal lines business experienced reasonable growth as well, driven by Latin America and Europe.
Our global personal lines businesses, which are again by-design specialty and focus, are approaching 1 billion at annual premiums and we believe we’ll continue to experience solid growth in these areas for the foreseeable future.
In reinsurance, we experienced a reduction in premium levels in our global re-business with both casualty and short-tail lines shrinking in the quarter. Our international life insurance business on the other hand, premiums were up double-digit in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.
Turning to our access in health insurance business, A&H growth globally was up 5% on a reported basis. That’s essentially flat in constant dollars, improving in line with our expectations and what we said in the previous quarters.
Latin America, in particular, exhibited strong double-digit growth in the quarter, while our business in Asia has stabilized and is on solid footing and should return to positive growth.
Meanwhile, earnings at combined insurance were up substantially in the quarter year-on-year, with improvement in both the loss and expense ratio. Combined customer retention ratios, new business writings and growth in agents are all moving in the right direction. In sum, we expect global A&H growth to steadily pick up in the second half of the year.
Before I turn things over to Phil, there are a couple of other noteworthy events. First, as all of you know, earlier this month, ACE returned to both the S&P 500 Index and the Russell 1000 Index. These moves were anticipated as a result of recent changes in their eligibility criteria.
The second event I want to mention concerns the job we have been performing in the last three months, the BP in the Gulf of Mexico. In late April, at the request of BP, our third-party claims administrator, ESIS went into action and assumed the oversight and administration role for the tens of thousands of claims generated by the Deepwater Horizon oil leak catastrophe. ESIS put in place over 1,000 claims professionals, established call centers and opened dozens of claims offices in four states.
After processing more than 100,000 claims, we are now working with BP on transitioning claims handling over to Ken Feinberg, the federally appointed Administrator and his firm. As many of you saw during our Investor Day, our company has very broad capabilities and I think this assignment illustrates that fact as well as our nimbleness and ability to respond quickly.
With that, I’ll turn the call over to Phil, and then we’ll be back to take your questions.

Our tangible book value per share has increased about 5% for the quarter and almost 11% for the first half of the year. Our cash flow was $870 million and included positive underwriting cash flow of about $500 million. Our invested assets grew by about $750 million driven by our strong cash flow and the increase in the market value of the portfolio offset by a reduction due to foreign exchange.
Net realized and unrealized gains were about $400 million before tax. The investment portfolio gains including foreign exchange were about $560 million, which were offset by a $160 million increase in the fair value liability of our variable annuity business, driven principally by declines in interest rates and a decline in equity markets. Overall, our investment portfolio is in a $1.6 billion pre-tax unrealized gain position.
Investment income was $518 million. Income on new cash flow was offset by lower new money yields and our investment income was up only slightly from last year. Our net loss reserves were about flat with last quarter adjusted for foreign exchange. Our paid-to-incurred ratio of 103% is higher than a run rate over the past several quarters and was affected by the payment of a number of one-time large claims in ACE Bermuda.
Our reinsurance recoverable leverage continues to drop and now stands at 61%. As Evan said earlier, our accident year combined ratio before cat losses is about flat compared to the prior year.
Our P&C accident year loss ratio before cat losses decreased 1.4 percentage points over the last year. This is principally due to large LPT contract we wrote last year, and higher risk management, and crop premiums in 2009, which carry higher loss ratios.
Excluding these items the loss ratio was flat. In addition, we had changes in our mix of business in North America to lines with lower loss ratios, both long-tail and short-tail. This occurred as we restricted writings in lines where pricing is inadequate and emphasized writings were pricing remains reasonable. In certain causality lines loss ratios are not rising as rapidly as rate and trend might suggest because of the favorable impact from prior year experience.
Finally, loss ratios in all the other lines rose as appropriate. Our expense ratio is up 1.3 percentage points over last year’s quarter. This increase is driven again by the large 2009 LPT transaction and less crop, both of which carry low expense ratios. Excluding these items, the expense ratio will be about flat with last year.
The tax rate for the quarter is lower than our normal run rate because of a reduction in tax reserves as a result of the most recent tax audit. Financial flexibility at the holding company level remains strong given our operating company’s dividend capacity and low levels of debt refinancing needs over the next five years.
Finally, we now expect to be at the top end of the range of our original guidance which was $6.25 to $6.75.
With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Helen.

So, while the inflation environment has been reasonably tamed for insurance, when we look out into the future, we do see reason to believe it might tick up.

One of the feature of the SRA, it redistributed some of the risk reward from the Midwest states to the non-Midwest states, because you think about the underwriting impact is actually going to vary by company, right, and what their individual makes a businesses.
So, regional underwriters focus on just Midwest business while it will clearly have a greater impact than the national underwriters, right? We underwrite the business through Rain and Hail, our MGA and we are one of two national underwriter. So we’ve remodeled our book over the last years and put the new SRA effect and we think it is a two point impact to our underwriting returns.
The other thing that I’d note about the SRA, it also reduces the downside exposures by reducing the maximum possible loss on SRA and again, that benefit the national underwriters more than the regional underwriters, because there is redistribution of the risk reward. So overall, we think as a national underwriter’s business, we come out of the new SRA with some impact to our margin, but it’s still a pretty good business for us.

Look, my view on contingent commissions, it’s fairly well known, if you like I’ll elaborate for you a little bit. First, what I ought to say because brokers are our partners, ACE’s is a brokerage company and brokerage is our chosen means of distribution, and we have a high regard to the management of all the major brokerages. I consider the leaders of these firms thoughtful, earnest executives. In fact, I believe we have a constructive relationship with each of them, and that’s to the benefit of clients and each of our respective firms, and every firm is different, and each is going to independently determine strategy in the interest of their company.
As a company, ACE has had a long-standing position on the subject of contingent commissions that is in agreement with many customers and certain large brokerages. Mainly, unlike agents, who represent insurance companies, brokers represents their client and as such, we believe contingent commissions for brokers by their nature create a conflict of interest. In fact, if I had my way, clients and not insurers would compensate brokers, but that’s just not reality.
Regulators in the U.S. have recently opined on the subject of contingents once again, and they have deemed them acceptable and acceptable practice. Therefore, how prevalent they become will be determined by the marketplace. I have no doubt that if customers tolerate the practice of contingents their use over time will likely become more prevalent, and frankly, I hope that does not occur.

Now whether that’s adequate or not given what’s now understood to be the operational exposure as well as the weather exposure in the Gulf of Mexico is for people to decide, but rates were up there on the property side. Really no effect on the onshore market coming from BP, rates continue to on-property, onshore go down.
As respects the liability market, there we are seeing and have seen in terms of submission an increase of activity coming from both E&P companies and drillers, looking primarily to buy more insurance as a result of what they saw going on with BP and what we are seeing there is additional limits being purchased in the neighborhood about $100 million roughly on average, so someone who may be had $750 million of liability cover is now buying $850 million as a general outcome over the last 60 days of purchasing.
On the pricing side, a very different buy type of risk. The big exploration or petroleum companies are seeing market and serious increases in their rates. We’ve seen renewals go anywhere from 100% to 300% increases in rate per mill for excess liability for the big E&P companies. On the other hand, drillers are seeing more moderate 5% to 15% rate increases as a result of the BP situation. So I think that’s a sense of what at least we are seeing in the activity as a result of that catastrophe.

First, your question on how to think about it from a return point of view, ACE has an objective to earn 15% return on capital over a cycle, and that means on all capital. So hardly are we going to deploy capital whether it is organically or for acquisition where it will not meet that standard and any acquisition has to stand up to that exact same standard, number one.
Number two, on how we think about it and how we think about buybacks? Look, regarding the equity capital, I think we’ve been good fiduciaries of shareholder money. We do have a successful track record for acquisitions and organic growth. As we have demonstrated, we’ve generated superior book value for share growth and ROEs over the last five years and ten years, especially compared to U.S. and P&C industry peers.
By the way, I think our ROE right now is still running pretty good. I mean, you look at it on a risk-adjusted basis, I think it’s excellent. We are running the company for the long-term. Our job is to grow the company’s book value by growing the company. That is our first objective, our first priority. We need capital to do this. Therefore, we do hold shareholder capital for growth and whether that means through organic means or through acquisitions and the growth would come. We’re confident about that. It’s just a matter of time. We’re patient and the money is not burning a hole in our pocket.
We’re also aware, by the way, that we live in turbulent, very uncertain times and there is a lot of risk and a lot of volatility, and you just look at the current environment sub [ph], country crisis, debt crisis, fragile nature of recovery in U.S. and Europe, political or regulatory risk around the globe. So the notion of access to capital markets also, there is sort of just in time capital management that’ll always be there for you at any given time at a reasonable price is overly optimistic.
Look at financial market volatility. We’re mindful of our responsibility to be good stewards of shareholder money and this means achieving a reasonable return on shareholder capital over any reasonable period of time. If we cannot put it to work productively over a reasonable period, we’re not opposed to employing tactical strategies to return that to shareholders, including repurchasing shares.
Frankly, at the end of the day and we give it a lot of thought; we’re very confident that the company’s interest and those of our long-term shareholders are clearly aligned. Now, making any decision about capital management it includes our Board, and we evaluate the amount of capital we’re holding above that which we believe we should hold for risk, we measure that against the environment and have potential opportunities over a reasonable time horizon. We look out two years to three years and we do see plenty of potential opportunity in many parts of the globe, and it is just a matter of timing. So we’re patient, we’re mindful, and I think we’re pretty balanced in our approach about those.

ACE had a very good and very busy third quarter, marked by strong financial performance and a number of announcements related to major actions, taken to further our strategy.
After-tax operating income for the quarter was $688 million or just over $0.02 per share. All of our principal businesses made a positive contribution to results.
Per share book value was up 7% and 15% in the quarter and year-to-date respectively. Our annualized ROE was over 13% for both the quarter and the year.
We had excellent underwriting results in the quarter. The combined ratio was 88.4%, which included net cat losses of $97 million pre-tax and favorable prior period reserve development of about $201 million.
Cat losses were double the amount from last year with about half coming from the New Zealand earthquake. PPD or prior period development was roughly equal with prior year.
Our accident year combined ratio for the quarter, excluding cats, was a very healthy 92%, compared to 93.3% prior year. In accidents, as expected by-line loss ratios have increased, but this was offset by underwriting induced business mix changes.
Phil, Brian and John will provide more detail around the current accident year-end prior period numbers.
During the quarter and in recent days, we announced a number of acquisitions we are making that are consistent with the strategies we described to you during our Investor Day in June. In September, we announced we had signed a definitive agreement to acquire all the outstanding common stock of Rain and Hail Insurance Services, not currently owned by ACE, for approximately $1.1 billion in cash.
As most of you already know, ACE currently owns approximately 20% of the outstanding common stock of R&H, which is the second largest crop insurance underwriter in the country. The transaction makes a lot of sense for a number of reasons. This is a great company and a business we know well and has an excellent track record for producing results.
Rain and Hail was an old franchise. It was established in 1919. It is a pioneer in crop insurance and a great brand, known and trusted throughout the agricultural community for the services it provides. The Company is rich in data. It has granular details on over $2 million farm fields, with some date going back 40 to 50 years.
The business is substantial and has 400 staff and field offices all over the country, serving agents and farmers. It also has considerable distribution, 7,000 agents in small towns in rural communities. They have excellent systems and technology. Also, their transactions are automated, giving it a real strategic advantage.
The leadership and employees of Rain and Hail are simply terrific, hardworking professionals, who take a great deal of pride in what they do. They will make our Company better.
Lastly given ACE's product breadth and capabilities and the reach of those 7,000 agents, who have been asking Rain and Hail for more product, this is simply another opportunity we will capitalize on years to come.
The financial returns are particularly attractive with results that are immediately accretive to our earnings, return on equity and book value per share. We expect to achieve a return on capital in excess of our 15% hurdle rate.
Also in the quarter, we announced that we had reached a definitive agreement to acquire Jerneh Insurance, a top 10 general insurer in Malaysia with a strong presence in both personal lines, small commercial P&C, as well as a respectable presence in industrial commercial P&C. Our agreed price is approximately two times book or about $200 million.
The transaction offers good industrial logic and attractive financial returns to our shareholders. We like the strategic fit between ACE and Jerneh, and believe our two companies are quite complementary. Jerneh has strong distribution with about 1,300 agents and 22 branches, whereas, ACE Malaysia is more of a brokerage company. Jerneh's particular expertise is personal lines and small and mid-size commercial, whereas ACE is focused primarily on medium-sized and large commercial accounts, specialty products our global capability and A&H.
Jerneh is a great brand in Malaysia. They have the best underwriting reputation of any local Malay P&C Company. We project a reasonable level of efficiencies, both expense-related and through a higher net retention of their premiums. In terms of returns, we expect to achieve our target hurdle rate reasonably quickly.
Earlier this week you saw we signed a definitive agreement to purchase New York Life's operations in Hong Kong and Korea for $425 million. New York Life is a venerable and highly professional agency-oriented Life Company, though their focus and management capability is predominantly in the U.S. The two Life companies we are buying are relatively small, solid agency operations that have been managed conservatively.
ACE has a good track record for building and managing insurance companies globally, including the young, but successful track record for building and managing Life companies in Asia. We view these two companies like later stage Greenfield operations. If we started from scratch, it would take seven and nine years at least to grow to the scale required to achieve breakeven, and that assumes we could even get a Life license in Korea, which has not issued any new licenses in more than five years.
We have approached this opportunity conservatively, assuming modest expense savings and a conservative increase in agents and revenues, and even with these assumptions, these two companies represent reasonable growth opportunities for ACE, since their current size is so small. We expect to benefit from coordination with our P&C operations including distribution, client support ops and basic management knowledge of the two markets.
In terms of financial returns, we've bought these operations at a very good price that reflects their state of development and current financial profile. From an ROE perspective, we project immediate mid-teen returns that are sustainable. Again, assuming relatively modest growth in agent count, and new product, not to mention a broadening of distribution, in fact, I expect we'll exceed ROE targets over a reasonable period of time.
The non-life transactions were expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, while the Asia Life companies are targeted to close in the first quarter. All subject to regulatory approvals in closing conditions. In sum, the three acquisitions we have announced not only have strong industrial and strategic logic, but have good financial return characteristics.
Before I hand the call off to Phil, I want to make a few comments about the insurance market environment and its impact on ACE. We are observing typical soft market behavior with prices continuing to soften around the world and more competition around terms and conditions, all of which is natural for this part of the cycle.
On a reported basis, total Company net premiums were up 4% in the quarter, adjusting for FX, premiums were up 5%. As with previous quarters, we're seeing a similar pattern where primary commercial P&C was up about 2%, with retail growing 4% and wholesale shrinking 2%. Global REIT was up significantly in the quarter, over 30%, predominantly due to a large casualty related structured transaction in the U.S.
Barring that, reinsurance premiums were down, as we would be expected given our underwriting discipline.
In U.S. retail P&C Insurance, our new business writings were down substantially year-on-year, while our renewal retention rates held steady. Overseas new business writings were up driven by new multinational business opportunities. Renewal retention rates were up slightly everywhere, except continental Europe where inadequate casualty rates led us to shed some business.
Rates overall in U.S. retail were down 2%, ranging from plus 2% to minus 4%. In our international business, overall P&C rates were down 1% with a range of flat to minus 2%.
Recession-related reductions and exposure of about 0.5% had a modest impact this quarter on revenue, continuing the improving trends of recent quarters. Brian Dowd and John Keogh are available to provide more detail on what areas of their business grew or shrink as well as color on the rate environment in their territories. Please ask them questions.
Turning to our accident and health insurance business, A&H growth globally was essentially flat on a reported and constant dollar basis. As predicted though our international A&H growth has begun to pickup in the second half of the year.
Our ACE International business was up 4% in the quarter with Latin America in particular showing strong double-digit growth and our business in Asia, returning to solid single-digit growth and Europe has well did better with single-digit growth.
Combined insurance premiums were down from prior year. While customer retention ratios are steadily improving quarter-on-quarter, new business sales continued to feel the impact of recession.
With that I'll turn the call over to Phil and then we'd be back to take your question.

Our financial leverage has dropped to 12.5%. Operating cash flow remains strong at $1.1 billion. Our cash and invested assets grew by $2.2 billion, almost 5% to about $51 billion. The growth was driven by unrealized gains of about $830 million pre-tax and our operating cash flow. Overall, our investment portfolio is in an unrealized gain position of about $2 billion after tax.
Investment income was $516 million, up 2% adjusted for foreign exchange. Income on new cash flow was offset by declining yields in the portfolio. There is nothing unusual in the investment income in the quarter. Current new money rates are 3.25%, if we invested in a similar distribution to our existing portfolio.
Our paid-to-incurred ratio was 99% for the quarter and 98% for nine months. We had favorable prior period development of about $200 million pre-tax, primarily related to long-tail lines from accident years 2005 and prior.
Adjusting for the favorable PPD, our paid-to-incurred ratios for the quarter and nine months were 89% and 90%. Cat losses for the quarter were $86 million after-tax, with about 55% coming from reinsurance and the balance from insurance.
Overall, the P&C current accident year loss ratio before cat losses dropped 1.7 percentage points over last year. In North America, if you eliminate crop, the current accident year is about flat. Line by line, the loss ratio was actually up as one would expect that there is a change in mix, we wrote less business, and higher loss ratio lines.
In AOG, a number of large property at losses, distorted our loss ratios in the third quarter 2009. Secondly, our loss ratio regions of the world are growing faster than our higher loss ratio regions, again a mix change.
Finally, last quarter we updated our guidance to upper end of our original range, which was $6.25 to $6.75. This included actual results through June 30, including actual cat losses and our accident year forecast for the second half including our original cat projections for the second half.
Our third quarter accident year results, including cats are slightly over target and we did have positive prior period development in the quarter of about $157 million after-tax or $0.46 per share.
We now expect a range of $7.20 to $7.40, which includes our actual experience for the first three quarters, including PPD in cats, and our forecast for the fourth quarter current accident year results, which includes our original estimate of fourth quarter cat losses.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Helen.

Internationally, we have a more specialty-oriented personal lines business that we have been steadily growing traditional personal lines in Asia and with the beginnings of that in Latin America. Again in those regions of the world, we are growing small commercial business. You look at the Jerneh acquisition and that's an example of complementing what we're doing organically with acquisition in a targeted way, and Juan's role will be to bring more executive level - and by the way, as you just heard, as I went through about Rain and Hail, don't miss the Rain and Hail has 7,000 agents and a great brand in rural and small town America and that is an opportunity for us, over time and we wanted to bring more executive level focus and experience and expertise to that whole basket I just described that we think is globally an opportunity for ACE and Juan will worry that bone full time.

It's a very small operation and I am mindful that Korea is a difficult environment. Culturally, it's difficult, done business there for many years. Asia has decent non-Life business there. The Korean Life market while some will say it's mature, I disagree with that statement. I don't think it's a particularly well run Life industry. There are some decent players, but I don't think it's particularly well run. New York Life's operation there is quite small and the opportunity, it doesn't take a tremendous amount of growth and you don't need to be in the top 10 for it to be a meaningful growth opportunity for ACE. There is no negative spread issue, the in-force portfolio of assets yield a rate that more than equals any guarantees, and in fact, an awful lot of the businesses is BUL at separate account and there is no real guarantee rate on that. There is more compression on new money, because there is as you know in Asia duration mismatch and so as you get the roll over, there is some compression, where the current new money rate about equals and it does equal the yield required on the older portfolio it rolls over grows over, and any of that its been priced into the deal and as you know we priced on the cash flow on embedded values to earn a 15%. I do believe as we go forward and you can grow more scale, we should be able to exceed that mid-digits return, that's our objective, and I'd be disappointed if we don't achieve that.

Our wholesale business remained a little bit more competitive than the retail business. Our commodity accounts were more competitive than account that we use our service capabilities. The lines we experienced the most price competition were property with rates falling about 5.5% especially in liability, particularly financial institutions where rates fell about 4%. Remember these were the lines that we saw the largest increases since the third quarter of '09 with rates rising 11% and 6% respectively. We also saw increasing competition on medical liability lines, especially long-term care, where pricing was down 4%. Finally we lost a number of smaller risk management accounts to guaranteed cost worker's comp carriers who were underwriting at significant discounts. In all of these lines, competition caused rate erosion, decreased retention rates and lower new business. On the other hand, our retail and wholesale umbrella pricing held up at about plus 2% on pricing. We also saw modest increase in some E&O classes and energy-related casualty accounts and also, while the rates remain constant from quarter-to-quarter, the market is trying to get a little more competitive in terms and conditions. We are seeing more request for broker managed scripts and endorsement, as well as more request for multi-year deals. Frankly, broker competition remains robust, and as a result, our submission activity continues to be strong, increasing at about 6%. While it varied by line of business our efficient metrics bound to quote were basically flat. So, overall I'd say the market stayed about the same in the third quarter as it was in the second quarter.

So it's really is a stay tuned, but I can tell you as a company we are quite focused on both in accounting and on a regulatory basis and right now Solvency II is more of a burden than a benefit to insurers, who have to participate in it though it has the promise of benefit in its original construction.

About irrational competitiveness, table business practices, xenophobia, aggressive poaching, unions, aggressive unions, in fact, I don't mind telling you that when I first took over Korea from Japan, in my prior life, we were in a union negotiation they actually locked our manager in his office and lit it on fire. So, I'm telling you this because, eyes wide open, Korea is difficult. With all that said we have built a non-Life operation that is maybe modest of size that earns good money and has a good, solid and does a good job. You got to understand how to manage in that environment and it is difficult. When we built our plans we were not Pollyannaish. In fact, the guys gave me a plan and while I'm going to hold them to it, for pricing purposes I lagged it another year figuring that execution will be even more difficult. But with that said it is a big wealthy country. I think there is lack of professionalism that increases stress, that if you were disciplined and you were focused over time, you can take what is a very small company and you can make it a lot bigger than it is today relatively to what it is today, though it still may be and will be of relatively small size in the country.

I don't know how to change like that in eight years from what I can tell. We have now rolled it out throughout United States and half of the agency force, half of the territories are performing as we expect them to perform to the new models. Their productivity per agent is up to or in excess of what we expect from that modernization. The other half lags and so that to me is a consequence of time. It's how long that other half has had it, and it's a consequence of managers who I think have to get on Board or just aren't capable of living with it. So, you have to keep working that and so it's going slowly and surely right as we expected to. So, the agent productivity is getting there and I expect the rest of country will come up to that same level. New agent growth recruitment - so productivity is good. New agent recruitment lags and getting new agents - once we get them on Board they are sticking but new agent product, new agent recruitment lags and that's the focus in North America. In Europe, we are at the beginning of that modernization of this and then it's very interesting, regions where you don't have the same economics stress Australia, New Zealand, Canada revenue growth is better.

Most of our profits are in fourth and first quarter as the crops come in, and you do the settlement with the governments. So, it's virtually no effect to the third quarter, you look for though. Overall, I'm reasonably optimistic about overall crop conditions, year-to-date crop conditions remain favorable, and the crop is well ahead of last year in terms of development, which eases your concerns around potential freeze impact or the weather this last weekend in the Midwest. So, we feel pretty good about that. Hail losses so far are trending lower than historical years, but the year is not over. The other thing to keep in mind is the current projected corn or soybean harvest prices are about 30% over the 2010 base price, which significantly reduces the risk of loses, rising in 2010 just from dropping commodity prices. So, overall, we would expect a pretty good circumstance in terms of both yield and commodity prices. So I would expect if things don't change, a pretty good crop here, while we settle out in the fourth and first quarters.

So to add to this point, we're seeing less business coming to London wholesale market. More and more of it is staying whether that's in U.S. standard market or international standard markets as opposed to having to come into the London wholesale market, so there's less opportunity, fewer submissions. If you look at the market itself over the last year and just take a look at how many new competitors have come into that market, how much new capital has entered that market, be it in the aviation space, D&O space, energy space, marine space, there's more supply of capital against a shrinking demand.

That our model in Chinese minds has been discredited and may be isn't the best model. China did well through the crisis and is well. We helped the world out during the crisis, why isn't the world a little more grateful to us? At the same time, China is doing well. There is a rising self-confidence, it has seriously grown in the country, but it's self-confidence that has crossed the line and borders on arrogance. Just like the United States, politics is local and there is a lot of internal focus in the country. They're not used to and they've never been really engaged in international relations and they approach it reluctantly. They are very self-centered and very inwardly focused and they don't quite understand how their own actions because of their mediocre rise in size, how their own actions are in fact affecting the rest of the world. They continue to misunderstand that and that creates tensions. At the end of the day it's not about the renminbi when you want to look at trade differences. That sits nicely on a bumper sticker. It's about other issues that are more structural in nature. But at the end of the day, the United States has to save more and we have to get out of the business and innovate more and allow people to get back to work. China has to understand, it cannot continue to just grow economically by export and has to grow more internally and there you go.
