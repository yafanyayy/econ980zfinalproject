277746,84103444,48905,"Hasbro Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 08, 2010",2010-02-08,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Karen.

We're extremely pleased with our 2009 performance, it demonstrates Hasbro's strategy is working. Across our business, Hasbro employees came together to deliver our fifth consecutive year of revenue growth and our ninth consecutive year of EPS growth. These results include the dilution from our television investments in our joint venture with Discovery Communications and the launch of Hasbro Studios. These investments are part of our strategy to invest in our business for the long-term, while returning cash to shareholders.We achieved these results despite challenging global economic trends. Overall in 2009, the global economic environment did not improve significantly, but it also did not deteriorate further. There was a continued lower level of consumer spending and poor market conditions in countries like the U.K., Spain and Mexico. Because we stayed committed to our strategy, adopting it to best meet changing consumer spending habits, we were well-positioned for when the consumer came out to shop. And the consumer did come out to shop albeit late in the fourth quarter.At the same time, 2009 was an extremely important year in the evolution of Hasbro as we endeavor to become a branded play company. Over the past 12 months, we further assembled the tools we need to be successful in the execution of our strategy over the long-term. First and foremost, we delivered and remained committed to delivering innovative compelling branded products at appropriate price points coupled with strong marketing programs. We extended key strategic licenses with our partners Marvel and Lucas who continue to be important contributors to our business.We announced a 10-year global strategic alliance with Sesame Workshop, an extremely valuable new partner. We believe there's opportunity to grow our businesses together. We further expanded Hasbro's presence in emerging markets through share gains in our key markets such as Brazil and China, growing our existing businesses in emerging Eastern European, Asian and Latin American countries and establishing new offices in important geographies including Russia and Romania. As a result, we grew revenues in our emerging markets in Asia Pacific, Latin America and Europe, where key brands like TRANSFORMERS, Nerf, Littlest Pet Shop and PLAY-DOH, as well as games contributed to the increase in revenues. We continued the activation of our brands across platforms, growing revenues and lifestyle licensing and digital gaming, and making key strides in entertainment, including movies, TV and online. In the entertainment arena, we partnered with Discovery Communications to form a new children's television network, The Hub, launching in the fall of this year. Simultaneously, we established Hasbro Studios to develop compelling programming based on Hasbro brands. In motion pictures with more than $1.1 billion in box office revenue, between TRANSFORMERS and G.I. Joe, and strong product sales in 2009, we are working with Paramount on Transformers 3 and G.I. Joe 2. In addition, we are pleased to add Sony as a studio partner, as we reached an agreement to develop risk at major motion picture.For the full year, we grew key brands including TRANSFORMERS, G.I. Joe, Nerf, Littlest Pet Shop, PLAY-DOH, TONKA and Magic: the Gathering, and we gained share in our major markets. This quarter, we included the performance of our major product categories in the press release. I will review high-level points behind this performance from a total brand perspective. The total brand performance of TRANSFORMERS, G.I. Joe and Nerf delivered double-digit growth in 2009 across multiple product categories. TRANSFORMERS had a record year, posting $592 million in revenues, a 23% increase from our last movie year in 2007. G.I. Joe recorded revenue in excess of $125 million and Nerf continued its growth, increasing 25%, driven by continued growth in the U.S. and the expansion of the brand internationally. PLAY-DOH and TONKA also turned in double-digit growth, both growing approximately 25% in 2009. Littlest Pet Shop, our largest girl's brand, also grew in 2009. However, as we discussed last quarter, several areas of our business were impacted by a number of high priced products not being carried forward from 2008. Both Kota and the DREAM TOWN ROSE PETAL Cottage were not carried forward into the 2009 pre-school line and we decided not to produce several products in the FURREAL FRIENDS lines, which created difficult year-over-year comparisons. Finally, Hasbro's Family Game Night campaign was embraced by our retailers and consumers around the world and drove an outstanding fourth quarter in Games & Puzzles. For the full year, total Games & Puzzles increased slightly, overcoming the revenue decline in the category reported through the first nine months of the year. In addition to Family Game Night, we grew our games business by reimagining brands like CONNECT 4, Operation and BOP IT, and through the creation of our new card game product line. Our Digital Games business grew with partners EA, Activision and Glu Mobile. We also delivered a  strong with Magic: the Gathering trading card games. As we look back over the past 12 months, we focused on our strategy while continuing to invest in our business and developing the tools we need to be successful in the years to come. I required every member of the Hasbro team to perform in a high-level, and they did.As we go forward into 2010 and beyond, the strength of our brands, the growth of our business globally including emerging markets, and a commitment to our strategy of creating fully immersive brand experiences will continue unlocking the potential of our brands while creating long-term value for our shareholders. At Hasbro, we are building this value each year and over time. So before I turn the call over to Deb, let me highlight some major initiatives we're particularly excited about in 2010 and beyond.First, we will continue to build on our core brand momentum globally with brands like Nerf and Littlest Pet Shop. In 2010, we'll continue to reinvent and drive our Preschool business. We are very pleased Jerry Perez has joined us to lead these efforts as we take our PLAYSKOOL business to the next level and begin to develop Sesame Street products for launch in 2011. In 2010, from partners Marvel and Disney Pixar, we have two major theatrical releases: Iron Man 2 and Toy Story 3. For Toy Story 3, we are rolling out a wonderful line of MR. and MRS. POTATO HEAD products, as well as co-branded Games & Puzzles. In addition, our partners at Lucas film will introduce Star Wars: The Clone Wars for a third season this fall. For 2011, I'd expect to see Star Wars continue on television.Also for 2011, Michael Bay and Paramount are working with us on Transformers 3, expected to be released on July 1, 2011, and we're excited about two new Marvel features, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger (sic) [The First Avenger: Captain America]. You may have already seen Universal Studios' announcement on BATTLESHIP. We are so pleased Universal sees the same major potential in our brands as we do and Universal is investing in BATTLESHIP to make it a global summer tent pole release in 2012. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, together with Paramount, we are developing the sequel to G.I. Joe. These are only a few highlights from our ongoing initiatives. We will provide more detail during our investor presentation and showroom tours on Friday of this week at Toy Fair. With that, let me now turn the call over to Deb."

I want to take a moment to tell you how pleased we are to be reporting as we expected higher revenue and earnings per share than we did in 2008.

I want to take a moment to tell you how pleased we are to be reporting as we expected higher revenue and earnings per share than we did in 2008. Our focus on core global brands coupled with product and marketing animation enabled us to grow revenues in the year. As Brian said, the consumers did come out and the economy, while not fully rebounding, did not significantly deteriorate in 2009. Foreign exchange was also less of a negative impact than expected. Throughout 2009, the Hasbro team pulled together to decrease cost in our underlying business. At the same time, we continue to investing in the future, including our joint venture with Discovery, establishing Hasbro Studios and making strategic investments in our business, including emerging markets. We were also able to return just under $200 million to shareholders through our dividend and share buyback program.For the full year 2009, worldwide net revenues of $4.07 billion grew 1% compared to $4.02 billion last year. Excluding the $65.2 million negative impact of foreign exchange, revenues were up 3% from 2008. Operating profit improved for the year to a record $588.6 million. Operating profit, as a percentage of revenue was 14.5%, a level Hasbro has not achieved since the mid-eighties. This compares to $494.3 million or 12.3% of revenue last year.Moving on to our segments. U.S. and Canada segment net revenues at $2.45 billion increased 2% compared with $2.41 billion last year. There was strong performance in the Boys category and growth in our Preschool category, partially offset by declines in Girls and the Games and Public categories. U.S. and Canada operating profit for the year was $380.6 million compared to $283.2 million last year. Operating profit increased to 15.5% from 11.8% in 2008. Net revenues in the International segment were $1.46 billion compared to $1.5 billion a year ago, a decrease of 3%. Absent the negative foreign exchange impact of 64.5 million net revenues 2%. The results of a gross in the Boys category offset by declines in Preschool, Girls and the Games and  Puzzle categories. Within the segment, several countries experienced challenging market conditions, while emerging markets in Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Europe grew although of smaller bases.The International segment reported operating profit of $162.2 million compared to $165.2 million last year. As a percent of revenue, operating profit was essentially flat at 11.1% versus 11%, as we continue to invest in emerging markets. The Entertainment & Licensing segment net revenues were $155 million compared to $107.9 million a year ago an increase of 44%. This is primarily due to growth in TRANSFORMERS and G.I. Joe, as our brands continue to expand outside of traditional toys and games in new categories, including lifestyle licensing and digital gaming.  The Entertainment & Licensing segment reported operating profit of $65.6 million compared to $51 million last year.Now let's look at earnings. For the year, we reported net earnings of $374.9 million or $2.48 per diluted share compared to $306.8 million or $2 per diluted share a year ago. 2009 includes a $0.12 per share impact from our television investment. For 2009, average diluted shares outstanding were $152.8 million compared to $155.2 million last year. Earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization were $772.3 million compared to $654.3 million a year ago. Gross margin for the year was 58.8% compared to 57.9% a year ago. 2009 gross margin benefited from lower obsolescence and growth in our higher-margin Entertainment & Licensing segments. In addition, we did not have the same level of mark downs as we did in the fourth quarter of 2008.Moving to expenses, operating margin improved to 14.5% from 12.3% due to lower spending in research and development, advertising and SG&A. Based on the mix of revenue, royalties increased in both dollars and as a percent of revenue. At the beginning of the year, we outlined cost-saving initiatives including freeze in salaries, hiring only in critical positions and reducing travel expenses. These efforts combined with the focus on prudent spending resulted in an overall reduction in cost within our underlying business, which is the baseline we will begin from in 2010. Below the operating profit line, interest expense increased by $14.5 million to $61.6 million, primarily due to the new long-term debt we issue related to our investment in the joint venture with Discovery. Other income net totaled $2.7 million compared to an expense of $6.1 million a year ago. 2009 includes income of $3.9 million, representing our 50% share of earnings in the joint venture with Discovery. Our underlying 2009 tax rate is 29% compared to our 2008 full-year underlying tax rate of 32.8%. Now, let's turn to the balance sheet. At year end, cash totaled $636 million compared to $630.4 million a year ago. In the last 12 months, we raised $425 million through debt offering. We also made significant investments in our business, including spending $300 million to our 50% investment in the joint venture with Discovery, $95 million to extend our agreement with Marvel and Lucas, and $25 million in royalty advances to the joint venture network. Additionally, we returned cash to shareholders. During 2009 we spent $111.5 million through our dividend program, and last week announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per common share, an increase of $0.05 per share or 25%. We also repurchased $3.2 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $91 million and an average price of $28.67 per share. At year-end, 161.4 million remained available in the current share repurchase authorization. Since restarting our buyback program in June 2005, the company has repurchased 260.9 million shares at a total cost of $1.5 billion in an average price of $25.28 per share. Overall, the quality of our receivables portfolio remains good. Receivables were $1 billion compared to $611.8 million last year. The increase is due to a number of reasons, including the timing of revenues in the fourth quarter and foreign-exchange. This is reflected in our DSOs, which excluding securitization were 68 days compared to 63 days last year. In addition, we did not utilize our securitization facility in the fourth quarter of 2009. This resulted in $250 million of the increase in receivables. Given the changing environment and government regulations impacting with securitization market, it's likely we will not securitized receivables effectively in the future.Finally, I'd like to reiterate the quality of our receivables portfolio remains good, and we do not have any significant customer concerns. Inventories decreased to $207.9 million compared to $300.5 million a year ago. Throughout 2009, both Hasbro and our retailers closely managed the inventory level. After lowering inventories during the year, retailers required additional product to meet demand in the fourth quarter. We are comfortable with our inventory on hand and at retail. In closing, we're very pleased with our 2009 performance, which demonstrates our ability to grow our brands globally and invest in our business for future year. After reducing our underlying costs in 2009, we'll continue we closely manage our expenses in 2010 although we believe the economy is entering into a sustainable recovery, improvements will likely be at a cautious pace. As we continue to execute our strategy to reimagine, reinvent and reignite our global brands. We believe we should be able to grow revenues and earnings per-share for the full year 2010, including the dilution from our television investment and absent a deterioration in consumer spending, global economic conditions or the value of currencies. With that, Brian, David and I will be happy to take your questions."

I think if you get the revenues, given the leverage in our business you tend to get the higher earnings. The reason we think we'll grow revenues is because whilst we recognize that there will be a delta on Joe [G.I. Joe] and TRANSFORMERS, given that regard on them, given that we got all other product [ph] Toy Story, current term the co-branded games and MR. and MRS. POTATO HEAD. And given that between Joe and TRANSFORMERS, we did about $700 million of business this year, that means it's about $3.5 billion worth of business, which has nothing to do with movies. And that brands like Nerf, Littlest Pet Shop, MY LITTLE PONY, PLAY-DOH, PLAYSKOOL and those are the brands that have been growing  consistently and globally over the last 10 years and accounted for majority of our growth. And we've got a lot  of newness across all categories in all of those brands, and we believe that we will be able to grow most of those brands again in 2010. And if you get the revenue growth, as I've said, you should clearly should get growth in earnings per share. And obviously, a little bit of that will be offset by the increased dilution. But also, we'll continue to manage our expenses fairly tightly. I think the other thing is well is that we've been saying since early '01 that we were going to build our core brands, the bigger global brands and that would give us a lot more leverage in our cost structure, and that would make us more profitable as a company. I think that's happened. I mean one of the reasons we're posting the kind of operating margins that we are now, which we haven't seen in Hasbro since the early eighties, is because we have grown our core brands globally and we're starting to get a lot of leverage in our cost structures [indiscernible]."

One of the things we've been working on with Universal is ensuring that we provide enough time to develop the motion pictures to be as big as we all believe they could be, and provide us an opportunity to put out a number of new initiatives over a number of years to take full advantage of those versus having so many initiatives than in one year.

Our feeling was to take the time to make BATTLESHIP more of a global tent pole for 2012. We've also, late Friday night, announced we've signed Taylor Lautner as our lead in Stretch Armstrong, and we will produce that movie in 3D. So as we go out now, we have a number of pictures that are in the Universal relationship, BATTLESHIP and Stretch, which would be 2012.

I think that first of all, we're very excited that Jerry Perez has joined us to run our Preschool business, and Jerry is certainly a very accomplished executive with a lot of experience in the Preschool business.

And even a brand that's celebrating its 75th anniversary like MONOPOLY is [ph] a 12% CAGR over the last five years. So we're going to continue to grow our Games business, continue to reinvent -- reimagine and introduce a number of new games this year. Our Preschool business, Tonka and Play-Doh in particular, have shown lots of momentum. We believe PLAYSKOOL will have that as well, with some new initiatives. Our Girls business Littlest Pet Shop grew last year. We certainly had year on year tough comparisons because of FURREAL FRIENDS taking a lot of of the high price points out, and we'll have some of those back in. Certainly, not quite as high as it were a few years ago but certainly, more of a range of price points for FURREAL FRIENDS. Our Boys business should be very robust, both from Iron Man and Toy Story, as well as the continuation of Transformers. If you recall in 2008, Transformers was one of our lowest declines in the Boys arena off of a movie year that we'd had in the last decade. So again, we feel good about our overall product line. We feel good about our growth opportunities in established markets, but even more importantly, in the emerging markets where we see some high growth rates."

And as we've designed and engineered, and as we've costed, and as we have priced the new product, we've clearly done so in order to protect our margins. Now under carryover products, in general, once a vendor gives us a cost, it's good for the life cycle of that product, obviously, if we refresh it, it may change and everything. So to some extent, we are a bit on carryover product, we're a bit insulated from prices going up. In the same way, we don't actually get to benefit quite as much, if they turn around and go down a bit. So we probably didn't get quite as much benefit in '09 as a result of that, but we've been insulated in '10."

In other words, the ability to go online, have an immersive experience, and play with your friend and play with some of your favorite characters, is clearly a critical element that was really in a joint partnership with Electronic Arts that was developed. There's analog product that goes along with it but also, the opportunity for subscription and micro-transactions. It's off to a very good start. The great part about the digital arena is you can continue to upgrade and advance the experience over time. So unlike an analog product, where you ship it and it is what it is, we get to continue to upgrade and evolve the experience for the users, and that's our intention there to continue to invest and involve that experience. And again, off to a very good start, which is certainly contributing to Littlest Pet Shop. But also, Littlest Pet Shop has had great success in not only domestically, but around the world. But particularly in several European countries, as well as Latin American countries and countries like France, where it's really the biggest Girls brand."

Across our business, Hasbro employees came together to deliver our fifth consecutive year of revenue growth and our ninth consecutive year of EPS growth. These results include the dilution from our television investments in our joint venture with Discovery Communications and the launch of Hasbro Studios. These investments are part of our strategy to invest in our business for the long term, while returning cash to shareholders.We achieved these results despite challenging global economic trends. Overall in 2009, the global economic environment did not improve significantly, but it also did not deteriorate further. There was a continued lower level of consumer spending and poor market conditions in countries like the U.K., Spain and Mexico. Because we stayed committed to our strategy, adapting it to best meet changing consumer spending habits, we were well-positioned for when the consumer came out to shop. And the consumer did come out to shop albeit late in the fourth quarter.At the same time, 2009 was an extremely important year in the evolution of Hasbro as we endeavor to become a branded play company. Over the past 12 months, we further assembled the tools we need to be successful in the execution of our strategy over the long term. First and foremost, we delivered and remained committed to delivering innovative compelling branded products at appropriate price points coupled with strong marketing programs. We extended key strategic licenses with our partners, Marvel and Lucas, who continue to be important contributors to our business.We announced a 10-year global strategic alliance with Sesame Workshop, an extremely valuable new partner. We believe there's opportunity to grow our businesses together. We further expanded Hasbro's presence in emerging markets through share gains in our key markets such as Brazil and China, growing our existing businesses in emerging Eastern European, Asian and Latin American countries and establishing new offices in important geographies including Russia and Romania. As a result, we grew revenues in our emerging markets in Asia Pacific, Latin America and Europe, where key brands like TRANSFORMERS, Nerf, Littlest Pet Shop and PLAY-DOH, as well as games contributed to the increase in revenues. We continued the activation of our brands across platforms, growing revenues and lifestyle licensing and digital gaming, and making key strides in entertainment, including movies, TV and online. In the entertainment arena, we partnered with Discovery Communications to form a new children's television network, The Hub, launching in the fall of this year. Simultaneously, we established Hasbro Studios to develop compelling programming based on Hasbro brands. In motion pictures with more than $1.1 billion in box office revenue, between TRANSFORMERS and G.I. Joe, and strong product sales in 2009, we are working with Paramount on Transformers 3 and G.I. Joe 2. In addition, we are pleased to add Sony as a studio partner as we reached an agreement to develop Risk as a major motion picture.For the full year, we grew key brands including TRANSFORMERS, G.I. Joe, Nerf, Littlest Pet Shop, PLAY-DOH, TONKA and Magic: the Gathering, and we gained share in our major markets. This quarter, we included the performance of our major product categories in the press release. I will review high-level points behind this performance from a total brand perspective. The total brand performance of TRANSFORMERS, G.I. Joe and Nerf delivered double-digit growth in 2009 across multiple product categories. TRANSFORMERS had a record year, posting $592 million in revenues, a 23% increase from our last movie year in 2007. G.I. Joe recorded revenue in excess of $125 million and Nerf continued its growth, increasing 25%, driven by continued growth in the U.S. and the expansion of the brand internationally. PLAY-DOH and TONKA also turned in double-digit growth, both growing approximately 25% in 2009. Littlest Pet Shop, our largest girls' brand, also grew in 2009. However, as we discussed last quarter, several areas of our business were impacted by a number of high-priced products not being carried forward from 2008. Both Kota and the DREAM TOWN ROSE PETAL Cottage were not carried forward into the 2009 pre-school line and we decided not to produce several products in the FURREAL FRIENDS lines, which created difficult year-over-year comparisons. Finally, Hasbro's Family Game Night campaign was embraced by our retailers and consumers around the world and drove an outstanding fourth quarter in Games & Puzzles. For the full year, total Games & Puzzles increased slightly, overcoming the revenue decline in the category reported through the first nine months of the year. In addition to Family Game Night, we grew our Games business by reimagining brands like CONNECT 4, Operation and BOP IT, and through the creation of our new card game product line. Our Digital Games business grew with partners EA, Activision and Glu Mobile. We also delivered a  strong result with Magic: the Gathering trading card games. As we look back over the past 12 months, we focused on our strategy while continuing to invest in our business and developing the tools we need to be successful in the years to come. I required every member of the Hasbro team to perform at a high-level, and they did.As we go forward into 2010 and beyond, the strength of our brands, the growth of our business globally including emerging markets, and a commitment to our strategy of creating fully immersive brand experiences will continue unlocking the potential of our brands while creating long-term value for our shareholders. At Hasbro, we are building this value each year and over time. So before I turn the call over to Deb, let me highlight some major initiatives we're particularly excited about in 2010 and beyond.First, we will continue to build on our core brand momentum globally with brands like Nerf and Littlest Pet Shop. In 2010, we'll continue to reinvent and drive our Preschool business. We are very pleased Jerry Perez has joined us to lead these efforts as we take our PLAYSKOOL business to the next level and begin to develop Sesame Street products for launch in 2011. In 2010, from partners, Marvel and Disney Pixar, we have two major theatrical releases: Iron Man 2 and Toy Story 3. For Toy Story 3, we are rolling out a wonderful line of MR. and MRS. POTATO HEAD products, as well as co-branded Games & Puzzles. In addition, our partners at Lucas film will introduce Star Wars: The Clone Wars for a third season this fall. For 2011, I'd expect to see Star Wars continue on television.Also for 2011, Michael Bay and Paramount are working with us on Transformers 3, expected to be released on July 1, 2011, and we're excited about two new Marvel features, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger (sic) [The First Avenger: Captain America]. You may have already seen Universal Studios' announcement on BATTLESHIP. We are so pleased Universal sees the same major potential in our brands as we do and Universal is investing in BATTLESHIP to make it a global summer tent pole release in 2012. Finally, as I mentioned earlier, together with Paramount, we are developing the sequel to G.I. Joe. These are only a few highlights from our ongoing initiatives. We will provide more detail during our investor presentation and showroom tours on Friday of this week at Toy Fair. With that, let me now turn the call over to Deb."

I want to take a moment to tell you how pleased we are to be reporting as we expected higher revenue and earnings per share than we did in 2008. Our focus on core global brands coupled with product and marketing animatio",1263,"Thank you, Brian and good morning. I want to take a moment to tell you how pleased we are to be reporting as we expected higher revenue and earnings per share than we did in 2008. Our focus on core global brands coupled with product and marketing animation enabled us to grow revenues in the year. As Brian said, the consumers did come out and the economy, while not fully rebounding, did not significantly deteriorate in 2009. Foreign exchange was also less of a negative impact than expected. Throughout 2009, the Hasbro team pulled together to decrease cost in our underlying business. At the same time, we continue to investing in the future, including our joint venture with Discovery, establishing Hasbro Studios and making strategic investments in our business, including emerging markets. We were also able to return just under $200 million to shareholders through our dividend and share buyback program.For the full year 2009, worldwide net revenues of $4.07 billion grew 1% compared to $4.02 billion last year. Excluding the $65.2 million negative impact of foreign exchange, revenues were up 3% from 2008. Operating profit improved for the year to a record $588.6 million. Operating profit, as a percentage of revenue was 14.5%, a level Hasbro has not achieved since the mid-eighties. This compares to $494.3 million or 12.3% of revenue last year.Moving on to our segments. U.S. and Canada segment net revenues at $2.45 billion increased 2% compared with $2.41 billion last year. There was strong performance in the Boys category and growth in our Preschool category, partially offset by declines in Girls and the Games and Public categories. U.S. and Canada operating profit for the year was $380.6 million compared to $283.2 million last year. Operating profit increased to 15.5% from 11.8% in 2008. Net revenues in the International segment were $1.46 billion compared to $1.5 billion a year ago, a decrease of 3%. Absent the negative foreign exchange impact of 64.5 million net revenues 2%. The results of a gross in the Boys category offset by declines in Preschool, Girls and the Games and  Puzzle categories. Within the segment, several countries experienced challenging market conditions, while emerging markets in Latin America, Asia-Pacific and Europe grew although of smaller bases.The International segment reported operating profit of $162.2 million compared to $165.2 million last year. As a percent of revenue, operating profit was essentially flat at 11.1% versus 11%, as we continue to invest in emerging markets. The Entertainment & Licensing segment net revenues were $155 million compared to $107.9 million a year ago an increase of 44%. This is primarily due to growth in TRANSFORMERS and G.I. Joe, as our brands continue to expand outside of traditional toys and games in new categories, including lifestyle licensing and digital gaming.  The Entertainment & Licensing segment reported operating profit of $65.6 million compared to $51 million last year.Now let's look at earnings. For the year, we reported net earnings of $374.9 million or $2.48 per diluted share compared to $306.8 million or $2 per diluted share a year ago. 2009 includes a $0.12 per share impact from our television investment. For 2009, average diluted shares outstanding were $152.8 million compared to $155.2 million last year. Earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization were $772.3 million compared to $654.3 million a year ago. Gross margin for the year was 58.8% compared to 57.9% a year ago. 2009 gross margin benefited from lower obsolescence and growth in our higher-margin Entertainment & Licensing segments. In addition, we did not have the same level of mark downs as we did in the fourth quarter of 2008.Moving to expenses, operating margin improved to 14.5% from 12.3% due to lower spending in research and development, advertising and SG&A. Based on the mix of revenue, royalties increased in both dollars and as a percent of revenue. At the beginning of the year, we outlined cost-saving initiatives including freeze in salaries, hiring only in critical positions and reducing travel expenses. These efforts combined with the focus on prudent spending resulted in an overall reduction in cost within our underlying business, which is the baseline we will begin from in 2010. Below the operating profit line, interest expense increased by $14.5 million to $61.6 million, primarily due to the new long-term debt we issue related to our investment in the joint venture with Discovery. Other income net totaled $2.7 million compared to an expense of $6.1 million a year ago. 2009 includes income of $3.9 million, representing our 50% share of earnings in the joint venture with Discovery. Our underlying 2009 tax rate is 29% compared to our 2008 full-year underlying tax rate of 32.8%. Now, let's turn to the balance sheet. At year end, cash totaled $636 million compared to $630.4 million a year ago. In the last 12 months, we raised $425 million through debt offering. We also made significant investments in our business, including spending $300 million to our 50% investment in the joint venture with Discovery, $95 million to extend our agreement with Marvel and Lucas, and $25 million in royalty advances to the joint venture network. Additionally, we returned cash to shareholders. During 2009 we spent $111.5 million through our dividend program, and last week announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per common share, an increase of $0.05 per share or 25%. We also repurchased $3.2 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $91 million and an average price of $28.67 per share. At year-end, 161.4 million remained available in the current share repurchase authorization. Since restarting our buyback program in June 2005, the company has repurchased 260.9 million shares at a total cost of $1.5 billion in an average price of $25.28 per share. Overall, the quality of our receivables portfolio remains good. Receivables were $1 billion compared to $611.8 million last year. The increase is due to a number of reasons, including the timing of revenues in the fourth quarter and foreign-exchange. This is reflected in our DSOs, which excluding securitization were 68 days compared to 63 days last year. In addition, we did not utilize our securitization facility in the fourth quarter of 2009. This resulted in $250 million of the increase in receivables. Given the changing environment and government regulations impacting with securitization market, it's likely we will not securitized receivables effectively in the future.Finally, I'd like to reiterate the quality of our receivables portfolio remains good, and we do not have any significant customer concerns. Inventories decreased to $207.9 million compared to $300.5 million a year ago. Throughout 2009, both Hasbro and our retailers closely managed the inventory level. After lowering inventories during the year, retailers required additional product to meet demand in the fourth quarter. We are comfortable with our inventory on hand and at retail. In closing, we're very pleased with our 2009 performance, which demonstrates our ability to grow our brands globally and invest in our business for future year. After reducing our underlying costs in 2009, we'll continue we closely manage our expenses in 2010 although we believe the economy is entering into a sustainable recovery, improvements will likely be at a cautious pace. As we continue to execute our strategy to reimagine, reinvent and reignite our global brands. We believe we should be able to grow revenues and earnings per-share for the full year 2010, including the dilution from our television investment and absent a deterioration in consumer spending, global economic conditions or the value of currencies. With that, Brian, David and I will be happy to take your questions."

I think if you get the revenues, given the leverage in our business you tend to get the higher earnings. The reason we think we'll grow revenues is because whilst we recognize that there will be a delta on Joe [G.I. Joe] and TRANSFORMERS, given that we've got online, given that we got all our other product around Toy Story, current term the co-branded games and MR. and MRS. POTATO HEAD. And given that between Joe and TRANSFORMERS, we did about $700 million of business this year, that means it's about $3.5 billion worth of business, which has nothing to do with movies. And that brands like Nerf, Littlest Pet Shop, MY LITTLE PONY, PLAY-DOH, PLAYSKOOL and those are the brands that have been growing  consistently and globally over the last 10 years and accounted for majority of our growth. And we've got a lot  of newness across all categories in all of those brands, and we believe that we will be able to grow most of those brands again in 2010. And if you get the revenue growth, as I've said, you should clearly should get growth in earnings per share. And obviously, a little bit of that will be offset by the increased dilution. But also, we'll continue to manage our expenses fairly tightly. I think the other thing is well is that we've been saying since early '01 that we were going to build our core brands, the bigger global brands and that would give us a lot more leverage in our cost structure, and that would make us more profitable as a company. I think that's happened. I mean one of the reasons we're posting the kind of operating margins that we are now, which we haven't seen in Hasbro since the early eighties, is because we have grown our core brands globally and we're starting to get a lot of leverage out of our cost structures as a result of that."

One of the things we've been working on with Universal is ensuring that we provide enough time to develop the motion pictures to be as big as we all believe they could be, and provide us an opportunity to put out a number of new initiatives over a number of years to take full advantage of those versus having so many initiatives than in one year. So for 2011, given that there's TRANSFORMERS as well as two Marvel theatrical releases in Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger (sic) [The First Avenger: Captain America ]and then also the first year of Sesame Street plus Marvel TV and we'd expect Star Wars TV. Our feeling was to take the time to make BATTLESHIP more of a global tent pole for 2012. We've also, late Friday night, announced we've signed Taylor Lautner as our lead in Stretch Armstrong, and we will produce that movie in 3D. So as we go out now, we have a number of pictures that are in the Universal relationship, BATTLESHIP and Stretch, which would be 2012. As well, we're working on his scripts for OUIJA and CANDY LAND and MONOPOLY. And the relationship does go out now. We've extended it to go out through 2015.

So we're going to continue to grow our Games business, continue to reinvent -- reimagine and introduce a number of new games this year. Our Preschool business, TONKA and PLAY-DOH in particular, have shown lots of momentum. We believe PLAYSKOOL will have that as well, with some new initiatives. Our Girls business, Littlest Pet Shop, grew last year. We certainly had year-on-year tough comparisons because of FURREAL FRIENDS taking a lot of of the high price points out, and we'll have some of those back in. Certainly, not quite as high as it were a few years ago, but certainly more of a range of price points for FURREAL FRIENDS. Our Boys business should be very robust, both from Iron Man and Toy Story, as well as the continuation of TRANSFORMERS. If you recall in 2008, TRANSFORMERS was one of our lowest declines in the Boys arena off of a movie year that we'd had in the last decade. So again, we feel good about our overall product line. We feel good about our growth opportunities in established markets, but even more importantly, in the emerging markets where we see some high growth rates."

The consumer certainly responded to that, and you saw that both in the full year as well as fourth quarter numbers.

In other words, the ability to go online, have an immersive experience, and play with your friend and play with some of your favorite characters, is clearly a critical element that was really in a joint partnership with Electronic Arts that was developed. There's analog product that goes along with it but also, the opportunity for subscription and micro-transactions. It's off to a very good start. The great part about the digital arena is you can continue to upgrade and advance the experience over time. So unlike an analog product, where you ship it and it is what it is, we get to continue to upgrade and evolve the experience for the users, and that's our intention there to continue to invest and involve that experience. And again, off to a very good start, which is certainly contributing to Littlest Pet Shop. But also, Littlest Pet Shop has had great success in not only domestically, but around the world. But particularly in several European countries, as well as Latin American countries and countries like France, where it's really the biggest Girls brand."

So on both selective items, much more a rifle than a shotgun approach, we did go back and redo some pricing in '09. As I said a few minutes ago, as we come into '10, all our new product has been costed to reflect the current commodity levels, and there's no price increase as such on those.

Hasbro grew its business across all our major product categories including boys, games and puzzles, girls, and preschool. We grew revenues in the US and Canada segment and across all regions of the international segment, including Europe, Mexico and Latin America and Asia/Pacific.
As we look at Hasbro’s mega brand performance; Littlest Pet Shop, Monopoly, Magic the Gathering, Nerf, and Playskool all grew in the quarter. In addition, Baby Alive, Play-doh, Tonka, FurReal Friends, and Super Soaker were all up versus a year ago. The Iron Man brand also contributed to the growth in our global boys business in the quarter. We are excited for the opening of Iron Man 2 scheduled for May 7th.
In February, we shared with you that in order grow our business in 2010 we needed to deliver growth across our portfolio of brands. The first quarter is a good first step toward that end. The comparisons in the second quarter become more of a challenge as we anniversary the movie ship ins for both Transformers and G.I. Joe in 2009.
Foreign currency trends have also become less of a tailwind than we initially anticipated for the year. Having said this, we continue to believe we should be able to grow revenues and earnings per share for the full year 2010, including the dilution from our television investments and absent a further deterioration in the value of foreign currencies, consumer spending, or global economic conditions.
Next, we will execute our global strategy as we continue to transform Hasbro into a branded play company. Our entertainment initiatives remain on track. Transformers 3 is scheduled for release on July 1, 2011. Frances McDormand and John Malkovich have been added to the already great cast. Stretch Armstrong is slated for summer 2012 staring Taylor Lautner and its being filmed in 3-D. Battleship is planned for May 25, 2012 and will be production shortly. Taylor Kitsch, who stared in the television series Friday Night Lights, as well as in Marvel’s Wolverine, is our lead for Battleship.
In support of our television initiatives, Hasbro studios continues to ramp up development and production in line with our plans. The team currently has 317 half hours of programming in development and production for distribution to The Hub network and international markets. We are delighted with the talent on board at the studio and all key roles are filled with the most recent addition being Finn Arnesen. Finn joins Hasbro Studios from Cartoon Network in Europe and will be Senior Vice President International Distribution and Development, charged with selling Hasbro Studios programming in all key markets around the world.
The Hub, our joint venture children’s television network with Discovery Communications, will be launching on 10/10/10. Margaret Loesch and her team have been meeting with potential advertisers over the past several weeks and the reception has been very positive. The Hub will feature a number of day parts targeting preschool and kids during the day and in the evening will offer families an opportunity to enjoy television together. We will provide more details on Hasbro Studios productions and the launch of The Hub in the coming weeks.
In 2010 we are driving strong innovation, creating immersive experiences and expanding internationally. As in every year, we are focused on delivering growth across our business while unlocking the potential of our brands geographically as well as across platforms. 
You’ve heard me say this before but it stands repeating. Not every brand should be supported by a motion picture but every Hasbro brand must be regularly re-imagined. This concept is central to our success this year and every year as we execute our strategy across our business. We have the tools in place to accomplish our long term objective of re-imagining, re-inventing, and re-igniting our brands, of creating immersive experiences and of growing our business in the emerging markets. With these tools and strong execution from the Hasbro team globally we believe we can grow our business in 2010 and in the years to come.
With that I’ll turn the call over to Deb.

277746,100329603,56446,"Hasbro Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-19-2010",2010-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","We are pleased with the strength of our first quarter results which reflect momentum we carried forward into 2010 and an improved consumer and retail environment versus the first quarter 2009.

Our business grew in all major geographies and product categories.
For the first quarter 2010 worldwide net revenues of $672.4 million grew 8% compared to $621.3 million last year. Excluding the $20.4 million positive impact of foreign exchange, revenues were up 5% for 2009. Operating profit increased 68% to $69.3 million versus $41.2 million a year ago. 
Looking at our segments in the first quarter 2010 the US and Canada segment net revenues were $424.7 million an increase of 5% compared with $404.5 million last year. The segment benefited from growth in the preschool, girls, and games and puzzles categories. US and Canada operating profit for the quarter was $61.1 million or 14.4% of revenues, compared to $41.6 million or 10.3% of revenues last year. The year over year improvement is primarily due to increased volume, lower amortization and royalty expenses, as well as continued improved leverage and product development, advertising, and SD&A costs.
Net revenues in the international segment increased 17% to $221.7 million compared to $189.2 million a year ago. Absent a positive foreign exchange impact of $16.3 million, net revenues grew 9%. The segment experienced growth in major product category and grew in all regions. The international segment reported an operating loss of $2.4 million compared to an operating loss of $14.5 million last year. The year over year improvement was the result of the mix of products sold, lower amortization expense and leverage in operating expenses.
The entertainment and licensing segment net revenues were $25.1 million compared to $27.2 million a year ago a decrease of 8%. This is primarily due to lower revenues in digital gaming. The entertainment and licensing segment reported operating profit of $9.4 million compared to $13.6 million last year, reflecting the reduction in revenues as well as costs for Hasbro Studios which we did not have in the prior year.
Now let’s look at earnings. For the quarter, we reported net earnings of $58.9 million of $0.40 per diluted share compared to $19.7 million or $0.14 per diluted share a year ago. Net earnings for the first quarter 2010 include a favorable tax adjustment of $21.2 million or $0.14 per diluted share. This relates to previously unrecognized tax benefits and other adjustments resulting from the completion of a tax audit. Excluding this favorable adjustment, net earnings for the quarter were $37.7 million or $0.26 per diluted share. Additionally, the first quarter 2010 includes a -$0.04 per share impact from our television investments.
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization were $100.3 million compared to $73.4 million a year ago. Cost of sales in the quarter was $262.7 million or 39.1% of revenues versus $244.8 million or 39.4% of revenues in 2009. 
In today’s earnings press release we’ve changed the presentation of our statement of operations. Hasbro’s business continues to evolve as we move forward with revenues and expenses related to our entertainment efforts in both television and movies. As a result, we will now publish our financials similar to many other companies and no longer include a gross profit line on our P&L. The remainder of the P&L is unchanged and cost of sales will continue to be available to you for your calculations.
Moving to expenses, operating margin improved to 10.3% from 6.6% last year primarily due to lower royalties and amortization as well as improved leverage in major expense areas including product development and SD&A. In the quarter we continued investing in our business including our television initiative, growing our presence in emerging markets, as well as marketing and advertising our products.
Below the operating profit line, interest expense increased by $7.1 million to $16.8 million due to the debt offering completed in 2009 related to our joint venture with Discovery as well as the offering we completed in the first quarter 2010. Other income net totaled $1.7 million compared to an expense of $2.9 million a year ago. The first quarter 2010 includes income of $500,000 representing our 50% share of the earnings in the joint venture with Discovery.
Excluding the favorable tax adjustment in the first quarter 2010 our underlying tax rate was 29% essentially flat with last year’s underlying tax rate of 29.1%.
Now let’s turn to the balance sheet. At quarter end cash totaled $1.3 billion compared to $590.4 million a year ago. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $265.1 million. In the last 12 months we raised $925 million through two debt offerings. We also made significant investments in our business including spending $300 million for our 50% investment in the joint venture with Discovery, $45 million to extend our agreement with Lucas and $25 million in royalty advances to the joint venture network.
Additionally, in the first quarter we announced a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per common share, an increase of $0.05 per share per quarter. In the first quarter we also repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $97.7 million at an average share price of $35.35 per share. As we announced today, the Board has authorized an additional $625 million for use in our common stock buyback program.
On March 29th we called our outstanding 2 3/4% convertible debt. As a result of calling this debt, we reclassified the convertible debt from long term to current. During the first quarter, holders converted $111.2 million of the diventures into 5.1 million shares of stock and we anticipate the remaining $138.7 million of diventures will be converted into 6.4 million shares in the second quarter.
The proceeds of our first quarter $500 million debt offering are primarily going to repurchase and retire into treasury an equivalent number of shares resulting from the conversion of these diventures. As a result of our decision to redeem these bonds, we’re not able to be in the market repurchasing share until after the redemption is complete. Following the redemption and subject to market conditions we plan to continue to repurchase and retire shares.
The quality of our receivables portfolio remains good and receivables at quarter end were $526 million up $161 million from $365 million last year. In the first quarter 2010 we did not utilize our securitization facility. However, in the first quarter 2009 we securitized $100 million of receivables. As we mentioned during our year end earnings conference call, given the changing environment in government regulations impacting the securitization market, it’s likely we will not securitize receivables as actively in the future.
Absent the impact of securitization in 2009 DSOs increased three days to 70 days due primarily to higher sales in markets that have longer terms. Inventories were $226.8 million in the quarter compared to $295.2 million a year ago.
In closing, we began 2010 in a strong financial position. We will continue to closely manage our costs while making strategic investments in our business. As we go forward in 2010 we believe currency will be less of a tailwind than we originally anticipated but given the strength of our business, as Brian stated, we continue to believe we should be able to grow revenues and earnings per share for the full year 2010, including the dilution from our television investments and absent a further deterioration and the value of foreign currencies, consumer spending, or global economic conditions.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Brian, David and I are happy to take your questions.

At this stage does it look like they could trend up a little bit more than we anticipated? Certainly on paper and board at the moment partly because of the Chilean capacity situation. We have seen a pretty significant spike in paperboard costs. At this stage I wouldn’t say that resins or electric components or Chinese labor is materially different to what we expected.
I think we’ve said many times before that we are to some extent isolated from rising commodity costs because just about everything we buy out of the orient comes from third party vendors, we don’t have our own facilities. The way we get our vendors to quote a price is they competitively bid amongst our people but once they’ve won the business or won a product line essentially they have to live with that price.
Clearly in truly exceptional circumstances like the fourth quarter ’07 and into early ’08 when commodities went up very dramatically we had to go back and revisit that. In general, the first increases in commodity costs at any given year will be absorbed by our vendors. Indeed we’re working very hard to help them be more profitable businesses growing, we’re giving them more work, and we’re level loading them. They can absorb a bit of this without losing money on our business.

I think probably a lot of international retailers had actually more aggressive goals in cutting inventory last year than did the US. I think they probably started with a bit less and therefore as economies start to recovery I do get a sense that international retailers in particular are willing to open the spigot a little bit and to take a bit more in. That doesn’t mean it’s a material change but it seems to be a bit of a change.
The other reason why our international revenues grew a bit more is we clearly did get a little bit of help from FX and of course we had this pretty aggressive investment we’re making in emerging markets. We would expect to see higher growth rates international because of the investments we’re making in companies like Brazil and Peru and Czech Republic and China.

Margaret is out meeting with potential advertisers, we will make more formal announcements about our lineup and programming and schedule in the next four to five weeks and then we’ll be able to come back to you with what our schedule looks like, she’s going to lead that process.
Again, the feedback has been very positive overall. I would sense both from our own plans as well as our sense in the market is that people do want to advertise and market their products that consumers are very brand centric, would like to purchase brands and innovative products and brands like Hasbro’s brands are being met with great reception in the marketplace.
On the third question, on digital gaming, I think what you’re seeing overall is a shifting out year on year in our business and overall where you may have a bit less in console gaming but you’re getting more in online gaming, on mobile gaming, on iPhones and now the iPad. The absolute dollars or the ticket is changing. Console game is one price point and online game or and iPhone app is a different price point so you’re selling more items at a different price point. It’s really heartening to see that brands like Family Game Night was named as a favorite game for families, as number one game for families during the Xbox Live Arcade awards. 
As you look at Xbox Live Arcade if you look at Scrabble on the iPad it’s one of the top apps already on the iPad. It’s a matter of activating brands across a number of different platforms of providing those immersive experiences and I think you’re seeing that overall shift in the marketplace where there’s a combination of console game sales this year for our products like Transformers has a new product coming out called Transformers: War for Cybertron in June which is from Activision in a non-movie year it’s a great game and great expectations there. Also a lot more in online, a lot more in mobile and iPhone and those games don’t carry the same purchase price as do console games.

Then of course Hasbro branded content, the fact is we are very much open for business and historically being an advertiser we understand what advertisers are looking for in terms of promotional opportunities and marketing opportunities. The Hub stands apart from a lot of the other kids networks because we really are going to celebrate what kids and what kids and families are looking for in terms of entertainment and both consumers as well as advertisers are seeing that as unique in the marketplace, certainly something worth supporting.

But just as there are dozens of successful networks focused on the 18 to 49 year old adult demo or the 25 to 54 adult demo, advertisers and consumers are seeing an opportunity for another network to be successful in the marketplace for kids and for families.

The Hasbro team globally continued to execute our strategy well, and we delivered a strong first quarter performance. Hasbro grew its business across all our major product categories, including Boys, Games & Puzzles, Girls and Preschool. We grew revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment and across all regions of the International segment, including Europe, Mexico and Latin America and Asia Pacific.
As we look at Hasbro's megabrand performance, Littlest Pet Shop, MONOPOLY, Magic: the Gathering, NERF and PLAYSKOOL, all grew in the quarter. In addition, Baby Alive, Play-Doh, Tonka, Furreal Friends and Super Soaker were all up versus a year ago. The Iron Man brand also contributed to the growth in our global Boys business in the quarter. We are excited for the opening of Iron Man 2 scheduled for May 7.
In February, we shared with you that in order to grow our business in 2010, we needed to deliver growth across our portfolio of brands. The first quarter is a good first step toward that end. The comparisons in the second quarter become a more of a challenge, as we anniversary the movie ship-ins for both Transformers and G.I. Joe in 2009.
Foreign currency trends have also become less of a tailwind than we initially anticipated for the year. Having said this, we continue to believe we should be able to grow revenues and earnings per share for the full year 2010, including the dilution from our television investments and absent a further deterioration in the value of foreign currencies, consumer spending or global economic conditions.
Next, we will execute our global strategy as we continue to transform Hasbro into a branded play company. Our entertainment initiatives remain on track. Transformers 3 is scheduled for release on July 1, 2011. Frances McDormand and John Malkovich have been added to the already great cast. Stretch Armstrong is slated for summer 2012, starring Taylor Lautner, and is being filmed in 3D. Battleship is planned for May 25, 2012, and will begin production shortly. Taylor Kitsch, who starred in the television series Friday Night Lights as well as in Marvel's Wolverine, is our lead for Battleship.
In support of our television initiatives, Hasbro Studios continues to ramp up development and production in line with our plans. The team currently has 317 half hours of programming in development and production for distribution to The Hub network and international markets. 
We are delighted with the talent on board at the studio, and all key roles are filled with the most recent addition being Finn Arnesen. Finn joined Hasbro Studios from Cartoon Network in Europe and will be Senior Vice President, International Distribution and Development, charged with selling Hasbro Studios' programming in all key markets around the world.
The Hub, our joint venture children's television network with Discovery Communications, will be launching on 10/10/10. Margaret Loesch and her team have been meeting with potential advertisers over the past several weeks, and the reception has been very positive. The Hub will feature a number of day parts, targeting preschool and kids during the day; and in the evening will offer families an opportunity to enjoy television together. We will provide more details on Hasbro Studios' productions and the launch of The Hub in the coming weeks.
In 2010, we are driving strong innovation, creating immersive experiences and expanding internationally. As in every rear, we are focused on delivering growth across our business while unlocking the potential of our brands geographically, as well as across platforms.
You've heard me say this before, but it stands repeating. Not every branch should be supported by a motion picture, but every Hasbro brand must be regularly reimagined. This concept is central to our success this year and every year, as we execute our strategy across our business. We have the tools in place to accomplish our long-term objectives of reimagining, reinventing and reigniting our brands, of creating immersive experiences and of growing our business in the emerging markets. With these tools and strong execution from the Hasbro team globally, we believe we can grow our business in 2010 and in the years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Deb."
277746,100329603,56464,"Hasbro Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-19-2010",2010-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning. We are pleased with the strength of our first quarter results, which reflect the momentum we carried forward into 2010 and an improved consumer and retail environment versus the first quarter of 2009. Our business grew",1274,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning. We are pleased with the strength of our first quarter results, which reflect the momentum we carried forward into 2010 and an improved consumer and retail environment versus the first quarter of 2009. Our business grew in all major geographies and product categories. 
For the first quarter 2010, worldwide net revenues of $672.4 million grew 8% compared to $621.3 million last year. Excluding the $20.4 million positive impact of foreign exchange, revenues were up 5% from 2009. Operating profit increased 68% to $69.3 million versus $41.2 million a year ago.
Looking at our segments in the first quarter of 2010, the U.S. and Canada segment net revenues were $424.7 million, an increase of 5% compared with $404.5 million last year. The segment benefited from growth in the Preschool, Girls and Games & Puzzles categories. 
U.S. and Canada operating profits for the quarter was $61.1 million or 14.4% of revenues compared to $41.6 million or 10.3% of revenues last year. The year-over-year improvement is primarily due to increased volume, lower amortization and royalty expenses, as well as continued improved leverage and product development, advertising and SG&A costs. 
Net revenues in the International segment increased 17% to $221.7 million compared to $189.2 million a year ago. Absent a positive foreign exchange impact of $16.3 million, net revenues grew 9%. The segment experienced growth in every major product category and grew in all regions. 
The International segment reported an operating loss of $2.4 million compared to an operating loss of $14.5 million last year. The year-over-year improvement was the result of the mix of products sold, lower amortization expense and leverage in operating expenses.
The Entertainment and Licensing segment net revenues were $25.1 million compared to $27.2 million a year ago, a decrease of 8%. This is primarily due to lower revenues in digital gaming. And the Entertainment and Licensing segment reported operating profit of $9.4 million compared to $13.6 million last year, reflecting the reduction in revenues as well as cost for Hasbro Studios, which we do not have in the prior year.
Let's look at earnings. For the quarter, we reported net earnings of $58.9 million or $0.40 per diluted share compared to $19.7 million or $0.14 per diluted share a year ago. Net earnings for the first quarter 2010 include a favorable tax adjustment of $21.2 million or $0.14 per diluted share. This relates to previously unrecognized tax benefits and other adjustments resulting from the completion of a tax audit. Excluding this favorable adjustment, net earnings for the quarter was $37.7 million or $0.26 per diluted share.  Additionally, the first quarter 2010 includes a negative $0.04 per share impact from our television investments. 
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were $100.3 million compared to $73.4 million a year ago. Cost of sales in the quarter was $262.7 million or 39.1% of revenues versus $244.8 million or 39.4% of revenues in 2009. 
In today's earnings press release, we changed the presentation of our statement of operations. Hasbro's business continues to evolve as we move forward with revenues and expenses related to our entertainment efforts in both television and movies. As a result, we will now publish our financial similar to many other companies and no longer include a gross profit line on our P&L. The remainder of the P&L is unchanged, and cost of sales will continue to be available to you for your calculations. 
Moving to expenses, operating margin improved to 10.3% from 6.6% last year, primarily due to lower royalties and amortization, as well as improved leverage in major expense areas including product development and SG&A. In the quarter, we continued investing in our business, including our television initiative, growing our presence in emerging markets, as well as marketing and advertising our products. 
Below the operating profit line, interest expense increased by $7.1 million to $16.8 million to the debt offering completed in 2009 related to our joint venture with Discovery, as well as the offering we completed in the first quarter of 2010. Other income net totaled $1.7 million compared to an expense of $2.9 million a year ago. The first quarter of 2010 includes income of $500,000, representing our 50% share of the earnings in the joint venture with Discovery. 
Excluding the favorable tax adjustment in the first quarter of 2010, our underlying tax rate was 29%, essentially flat with last year's underlying tax rate of 29.1%.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At quarter end, cash totaled $1.3 billion compared to $590.4 million a year ago. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $265.1 million. In the last 12 months, we raised $925 million through two debt offerings. We also made significant investments in our business, including spending $300 million for our 50% investment in the joint venture with Discovery, $45 million to extend our agreement with Lucas [LucasArts] and $25 million in royalty advances to the joint venture network. 
Additionally, in the first quarter, we announced a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per common share, an increase of $0.05 per share per quarter. In the first quarter, we also repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $97.7 million at an average share price of $35.35 per share. As we announced today, the board has authorized an additional $625 million for use in our common stock buyback program. 
On March 29, we called our outstanding 2 ¾% convertible debt. As a result of calling this debt, we reclassified the convertible debt from long term to current. During the first quarter, holders converted $111.2 million of the debentures into 5.1 million shares of stock, and we anticipate the remaining $138.7 million of debentures will be converted into 6.4 million shares in the second quarter.
The proceeds of our first quarter of $500 million debt offering are primarily going to repurchase and retire into treasury, an equivalent number of shares resulting from the conversion of these debentures. As a result of our decision to redeem these bonds, we're not able to be in the market repurchasing shares until after the redemption is complete. Following the redemption and subject to market conditions, we plan to continue to repurchase and retire shares. 
The quality of our receivables portfolio remains good, and receivables at quarter end were $526 million, up $161 million from $365 million last year. In the first quarter of 2010, we did not utilize our securitization facility. However, in the first quarter of 2009, we securitized $100 million of receivables. As we mentioned during our year-end earnings conference call, given the changing environment in government regulations impacting the securitization market, it's likely we will not securitize receivables as actively in the future.
Absent the impact of securitization in 2009, DSOs increased to three days to 70 days, due primarily to higher sales in markets that have longer term.  Inventories were $226.8 million in the quarter compared to $295.2 million a year ago. 
In closing, we began 2010 in a strong financial position. We will continue to closely manage our costs, while making strategic investments in our business. As we go forward in 2010, we believe currency will be less of a tailwind than we originally anticipated. But given the strength of our business, as Brian stated, we continue to believe we should be able to grow revenues and earnings per share for the full year 2010, including the dilution from our television investments and absent of further deterioration in the value of foreign currencies, consumer spending or global economic conditions. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Brian, David and I are happy to take your questions."

Clearly, when we spoke at our analyst meeting in November and again in February, we clearly said we expected most costs to be trending up. At this stage, does it look like they could trend up a little bit more than we anticipated? Certainly, on paper and board at the moment, partly because of the Chilean capacity situation, we have seen a pretty significant spike in paperboard costs. At this stage, I wouldn't say that resins or electric components or Chinese labor is materially different to what we expected. I think we have said many times before that we are to some extent isolated from rising commodity costs. Because just about everything we buy out of the Orient comes from third-party vendors. We don't have our own facilities. And the way we get our vendors to call the price is they competitively bid amongst other people. But once there's -- won the business or won a product line, essentially they had to live with that price. Now clearly, in truly exceptional circumstances like the fourth quarter of '07 and into early '08 when commodities went up very dramatically, we had to go back and revisit that. But in general, the first increases in commodity costs in any given year will be absorbed by our vendors. And indeed, we're working very hard to help them be more profitable. Our businesses is growing. We're giving them more work. We're level-loading them, so they can absorb a bit of it without losing money on our business, certainly."

I think probably a lot of international retailers had actually more aggressive goals in cutting inventory last year than did the U.S. So as should think they probably started with a bit less. And therefore, as economies start to recover, I do get a sense that international retailers in particular are willing to open the spigot a little bit and to take a bit more in. That doesn't mean there's some material change, but it seems to be a bit of a change. The other reason why international revenues grew a bit more is we clearly did get a little bit of help from FX. And of course, we had this pretty aggressive investment we'll be making in emerging markets. So we would expect to see higher growth rates international, because of the investments we're making in companies like Brazil and Peru and Czech Republic and China."

And they see a great opportunity in the marketplace, a great gap in the marketplace for a network that focuses on kids and their families. Margaret is out meeting with potential advertisers. We will make more formal announcements about our lineup in programming and schedule in the next four to five weeks, and then we'll be able to come back to you with what our schedule looks like. She's going to lead that process. But again the feedback's been very positive. Overall, I would sense both from our own plans as well as our sense in the market is that people do want to advertise and market their products that consumers are very brand centric, would like to purchase brands and innovative products and brands like Hasbro's brands are being met with a great reception in the marketplace. On the third question, on digital gaming, and I think what you're seeing overall is kind of a shifting out year-on-year in our business and overall where you may have a bit less in console gaming, but you're getting more in online gaming, on mobile gaming, on iPhones and now the iPad. So the absolute dollars or the ticket is changing. A console game is one price point, and an online game or an iPhone app is at different price point. So you're selling more items at different price points. It's really heartening to see that brands like Family Game Night was named as the favorite gave for families. During the Xbox LIVE Arcade Awards. So as you look at Xbox LIVE arcade, if you look at Scrabble on the iPad, it's one of the top apps already on the iPad. So it's a matter of activating brands across a number of different platforms that providing those immersive experiences. And I think you're seeing that overall shift in the marketplace, where there's a combination of console game sales this year for our products like Transformers, has a new product coming out called Transformers: War for Cybertron in June, which is from Activision in a non-movie year. It's a great game, and great expectations there. But also a lot more in online, a lot more in mobile and iPhone, and those games don't carry the same purchase price as to console games."

These forward-looking statements may include comments concerning our product and entertainment plan, anticipated product performance, business opportunities and strategies, costs, financial goals and expectations for our future financial performance in achieving our objective.
There are many factors that could cause actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. Some of those factors are set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K, in today's press release and in our other public disclosures.

Our global teams continued to execute our long-term strategy through the second quarter. Heading into Q2, we knew it would be a challenging quarter, as we faced difficult comparisons with the initial movie ship-ins last year for both TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE.
In fact, the revenue decline from these two brands combined was $174 million in the quarter. This decline was partially offset by gains of $120 million across the remainder of our brand portfolio and backed by strong execution of our team globally. Overall, revenue declined 7% in the quarter, as several of our brands and product categories grew. I will provide more insight on this performance in a moment.
Despite lower year-over-year revenues, we increased operating profit 9% from the second quarter last year. Our ability to improve operating profit clearly illustrates the operating leverage we are unlocking in our business. We continue to expect our revenue to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year, as our major initiatives are beginning to launch.
For the full year 2010, we still believe we should be able to grow revenues and earnings per share, including the dilution from our television investments and barring a further decline in foreign exchange, consumer spending or global economic conditions.
Reviewing our second quarter performance, the Games and Puzzles category up 22% and Preschool up 32%, both posted strong growth as did several of our mega brands including Magic
The Gathering, which continues to perform extremely well; MONOPOLY celebrating its 75th anniversary this year; NERF showing strong growth both in the U.S. and through international expansion; and PLAYSKOOL, which is seeing growth across a number of initiatives including infant learning and MR. and MRS. POTATO HEAD, who are leading characters in TOY STORY 3.
Other brands contributing the growth include FURREAL FRIENDS, PLAY-DOH, OPERATION, BABY ALIVE, STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE, TONKA and IRON MAN. We have said this year would be about singles and doubles, meaning it would be a year when we are driving growth across the breadth of our portfolio. Year-to-date, revenue is down just $3 million versus year ago. Over the coming months we have number of initiatives launching.
In the Boys' category, BEYBLADES is off to a promising early start in Canada and is just staring to hit shelves in the U.S. Programming is on air in both markets. Programming in products are also scheduled for major European markets, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand this year. NERF and the newly rebranded NERF SUPER SOAKER have been strong contributors to growth in the first half of the year, and in the second half, we have major new products launches slated.
In Girls, LITTLEST PET SHOP is adding an exciting new play pattern inspired by our consumer insight work with BLYTHE LOVES LITTLEST PET SHOP. Also, FURRY FRENZIES within our FURREAL FRIENDS line will be hitting retail this fall. In Preschool, our entrance into the electronic learning aid category with ALPHIE is off to a good start. PLAY-DOH is adding SESAME STREET to its line and CHUCK MY TALKING TRUCK will get additional support from new programming on THE HUB.
Finally, in Games and Puzzles, we continued to innovate our evergreen brands with creative play, while introducing exciting new brands. CUPONK, our new seen ball in cup game, is off to a good start. SCRABBLE FLASH, MONOPOLY REVOLUTION and our new line of construction games under the U-Build brand are just a few additional highlights for the second half of the year.
We will support these initiatives with the continuation of our successful, global FAMILY GAME NIGHT initiative including a new marketing campaign this fall. We also feel very positive about our new network. This fall, THE HUB, our children's television network with Discovery, is on schedule to launch on 10/10/10. At this point, Margaret Loesch and her team have announced much of the programming, completed all the acquisition deals for the fall launch and continue to finalize the schedule.
As part of these announcements, Hasbro Studios has seven shows announced to be on THE HUB. These include TRANSFORMERS PRIME, G.I. JOE RENEGADES, MY LITTLE PONY FRIENDSHIP IS MAGIC, THE ADVENTURES OF CHUCK AND FRIENDS, POUND PUPPIES, PICTUREKA and FAMILY GAME NIGHT.
Additionally, several of our partners have programs slated for the network, including STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE from American Greetings, IN THE NIGHT GARDEN from the BBC and The WOTWOTS, Weta Workshop. More programming announcements are expected from THE HUB in early August during the TCAs, a major press event for the Television Critics Association.
From a product standpoint, in addition to product already available in the market, we have a number of new product initiatives which tie to our new programming on THE HUB. The majority of new product tied to programming is scheduled to launch in fall 2011.
MY LITTLE PONY is undergoing a reinvention along with the new animation. A sneak peek of the new look will hit retail shelves this fall to coincide with THE HUB launch with the whole new look from MY LITTLE PONY coming in 2011.
From an advertising perspective, Margaret in THE HUB's ad sales teams have had many one-on-one meetings with potential advertisers. As a result, Blue Chip advertisers are getting onboard with THE HUB and its programming for kids and their families. They are enthusiastic about the mission of the network and it provides them with an opportunity to reach a wide cross-section of viewers, including adults, moms, families, and kids.
Prior to the launch of the network, THE HUB will kick off a concentrated high impact marketing campaign. This campaign will have additional support in the late November, early December time period as well as in early 2011.
Turning to our movie pipeline, production is underway for TRANSFORMERS III, which is scheduled for release on July 1, 2011. This year TRANSFORMERS shipments are showing a more typical post movie decline than the smaller decline we saw in 2008, when we had television to support the brand throughout the year. In 2011, we will have the support of both a major theatrical release and television behind the brand.
I started today's call reiterating that Hasbro's global teams are executing our long-term strategy. A strategy built on a number of core elements designed to guide our business for years to come. Our brands, including Hasbro's core brands and our vast portfolio of active involve brands remain at the center of the strategy and guide the direction and decisions we are making globally in toys and games and immersive brand experiences.
We add to our efforts through alliances with Marquee Partners, who are also re-imagining their brands including MARVEL and its extensive Universal Characters, STAR WARS from Lucasfilm and our newest partners Sesame Workshop.
Finally, we are working with the industry's best creative stewards at Paramount, DreamWorks, Universal, Sony, Discovery, THE HUB, Electronic Arts and Activision who are actively developing Hasbro brands into immersive experience through movies, television, and digital gaming.
Our global Hasbro teams are activating the elements of our strategy each and every day as we re-imagine, reinvent, and reignite our brands today and for years to come.
I will now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?

The continued execution of our strategy and our attention to cost has enabled us to deliver improved profitability and maintain our strong balance sheet despite the revenue challenges in the quarter.For the second quar",1436,"Thank you, Brian and good morning. The continued execution of our strategy and our attention to cost has enabled us to deliver improved profitability and maintain our strong balance sheet despite the revenue challenges in the quarter.
For the second quarter, worldwide net revenues were $737.8 million compared to $792.2 million last year, a decline of 7%. Foreign exchange had a positive impact of $1.6 million to revenue in the quarter. While revenue was down from last year as expected, operating profit of $79.7 million or 10.8% of revenue increased 9% or $6.6 million compared to $73.1 million or 9.2% of revenue last year.
Looking at our second quarter segment results, the U.S. and Canada segment net revenues were $444.5 million, a decrease of 9% compared to $490.9 million last year. The results reflect growth in the Games and Puzzles, Girls and Preschool categories, offset by a decline in the Boys category primarily due to lower TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE shipment. U.S. and Canada operating profit for the quarter increased 4% to $58.7 million or 13.2% of revenues compared to $56.3 million or 11.5% of revenue.
Net revenues in the International segment decreased 5% to $261.4 million compared to $276.2 million a year ago. Foreign exchange had a negative $800,000 impact on revenue in the quarter. The results reflect growth in the Games and Puzzles and Preschool categories, offset by declines in the Boys and Girls product categories. The International segment reported an operating profit of $11.6 million compared to an operating profit of $16.5 million last year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily the result of lower revenues.
Entertainment and Licensing segment net revenues increased 26% to $30.5 million compared to $24.2 million a year ago. This is primarily due to an increase in movie-related revenues. The Entertainment and Licensing segment operating profit increased to $13 million compared to $2.9 million last year, reflecting higher revenue as well as the fact that the second quarter 2009 included $7.2 million in one-time advisory fees and deal costs associated with our investments in the joint venture television network. While we continue to have costs associated with our television initiative, our current run rate of expenses is lower than last year's one-time fees and costs.
Now, let's look at earnings. For the quarter, we reported net earnings of $43.6 million or $0.29 per diluted share compared to $39.3 million or $0.26 per diluted share a year ago. The second quarter 2010 includes a negative $0.05 per share impact from our television-related activities, while our second quarter 2009 included a negative $0.06 per diluted share impact. Cost of sales in the quarter was $300.3 million or 40.7% of revenues versus $319.5 million or 40.3% of revenues in 2009.
During the past quarter, there has been a great deal of discussion around input cost trends, and I want to just take a moment to discuss how these impact Hasbro. Hasbro outsources between 80% and 85% of its manufacturing to vendors in China. We purchase this product in Hong Kong dollar, a currency which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. The costs we agree to with our vendors are based on the estimated market level of input costs, which includes commodities and labor during the delivery stage of the product.
As a general rule, once we agree on a cost with a vendor, we expect that cost to remain in place for the next 12 months to 15 months. As a result, the impact we experience from input cost increases and decreases would be primarily reflected in 2011 and beyond. For these products, we take into account the current cost environment as we design, engineer, and price our product with an objective to maintain our desired level of profitability on the product sale.
There have been instances when we have accepted higher prices from our vendors despite having agreements in place, but this is during periods of extraordinary inflationary pressure and is not a general practice. While costs had been rising in the first quarter, currently several input costs appear to have peaked and are now coming down in select areas, including resins and paperboard.
Overall, our operating margin increased to 10.8% from 9.2% last year. Operating profit improved despite lower revenue, primarily due to lower royalties and amortization. Royalties declined due to lower entertainment-based revenue including the decline in TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE. Amortization is down as the intangible assets associated with the WIZARDS OF THE COAST and Larami acquisitions have been fully amortized.
We continue to invest in our business including our television initiatives, our emerging markets business as well as product development, which has grown this year in support of major product initiatives we have planned for 2011. Our investment in television programming is reflected in our balance sheet with another current assets.
As we begin to generate revenue associated with our programs, programming costs will be expensed over the revenue curve of the program. No programming costs have been expensed on our P&L to-date, and we do not anticipate these costs to be significant in 2010.
Below the operating profit line, interest expense increased by $4.4 million to $21.9 million, primarily due to the debt offering we completed in March 2010. Other income net totaled $3.2 million compared to $1.3 million a year ago.
Our 50% share of our joint venture results is included in this line on the P&L. This quarter, our share of the earnings in the joint venture inclusive of amortization expense was a loss of $76,000. In the second quarter 2009, our share of the earnings in the joint venture was a positive $1 million. In the second quarter 2010, our underlying tax rate was 28.5% compared to 29.5% last year.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At quarter end, cash totaled $872.3 million compared to $392 million a year ago. Over the past 12 months, we've generated over $600 million in cash from operations. Our cash generation is healthy and we continue investing in our business. This includes approximately $19 million in television programming costs, and $25 million royalty advanced to THE HUB. Our next $25 million royalty advanced payment to the network is due in the fourth quarter 2010.
In March, 2010, we raised $500 million through a debt offering, and on March 29, we called our outstanding 2.75% convertible debt. Prior to the end of the call period, substantially all of the debentures were converted into 11.6 million shares.
In the second quarter, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $271.4 million in an average price of $40.49 per share. In the first two quarter of 2010, we repurchased 9.5 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $369.1 million at an average price of $38.99 per share. At the end of the second quarter, there was $417.5 million remaining in our current share repurchase authorization.
The quality of our receivables portfolio remains good, and receivables at quarter end were $663.5 million, up $10.9 million from $652.6 million last year. In the second quarter of 2010, we did not utilize our securitization facility. However, in the second quarter 2009, we securitized $85.1 million of receivables.
As we've previously mentioned, given the changing environment and government regulations impacting the securitization market, it's likely we will not securitize receivables as actively in the future, and we have not securitized receivables since the second quarter of 2009. Absent the impact of securitization in 2009, DSOs decreased 3 days to 81 days due to the timing of sales and collections in the quarter compared with the year ago. Inventories of $342.1 million in the quarter compared to $346.8 million a year ago.
In closing, there are a number of factors we're watching over the remainder of the year; namely, foreign exchange, consumer spending and global economic conditions. In particular, foreign exchange rates continue to be very volatile and difficult to predict, and they do affect our reported revenues. Our largest currency impact is the Euro, followed by the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the Australian dollar.
What we are certain about is the breadth of our brand portfolio. Brian outlined a number of exciting initiatives launching in the coming months that will help drive our business for the rest of the year. In 2010 and beyond, the global Hasbro teams will remain committed to the execution of our strategy and the investment in our business for the long-term. We look forward to keeping you updated.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And now, Brian, David and I are happy to take your questions.

So we again would reiterate our broad and long-term guidance, $300 million feels good to us.

First, if you look at the plan and we've talked about the dilution this year as a financial metric, that dilution is primarily around the multimillion-dollar marketing campaign we have lined up for THE HUB. In addition to the campaign that the team is putting together to launch THE HUB, which will be in all kinds of forms of advertising, marketing and promotions, certainly the two parents are also using their skill sets to help bring viewership to THE HUB.
We have a great partner in Discovery that has a number of domestic networks. We're working on promotions on air across a number of their different channels where our audience is lined up. You will see things for THE HUB across a number of different platforms and those plans will be announced and outlined a little bit later; I'll let Margaret and the team do that, but suffice it to say, between being on our packaging, being on the Discovery's channels, our multimillion-dollar campaign.
Having said that, we won't get there all at once, but we are planning this growth over time. If you look at the growth of major networks, it happens over some period of time. And yet, we feel very comfortable that this network can contribute to increases in our toys and games sales as we've outlined over the next several years.

We remain very skeptical of acquisitions.

So clearly, some of our growth is absent for TRANSFORMERS and JOE is still coming in the Western Europe as well is still pretty strong. In particular, this year Spain had a very bad year last year. Their economy was probably one in worst in a road, and that bounced back pretty well. Mexico was also one of the worst places last year because of the economy, because of bird flu, and a number of other reasons, and Mexico bounced back pretty well.

What I talked about is there are expectations for a non-movie year coming off of a movie year. We have certain benchmarks around that. Obviously, without the TV series and support of the brand, we're seeing that typical type of decline. We believe once we have the TV on the air for the most part in late ‘10 and ‘11, we'll get the support of television, because we know that television does drive toys and games sales, and it does so around the world.

Advertising and promotions for you typically would then kind of pick up, and the sum of royalties and advertising as a percentage of sales kind of remain relatively constant over time. So in second quarter, we saw those two things have about 300 basis points decline. So is there a shift in your marketing dollars towards the second half of the year, or anything going that would drive that?

But just to talk about the core brand reinvention, a couple of years ago, we changed the management team. We have great leadership out on the West Coast. The team had really re-thought that business entirely, really went back out after a trial mechanism in getting young people and people who may have lapsed as users to get back into the brand. They really reinvented the entire play pattern in many ways, but kept the things that were always important to the core player and to the fan. The fruits of that effort are starting to come to be borne out, both in the analog card business as well as the digital business. So I really compliment the team for their efforts in - this is a true case of brand reinvention, re-imagination, all yet keeping the core methodology very consistent for that core fan.

Our global teams continue to execute our long-term strategy through the second quarter. 
Heading into Q2, we knew it would be a challenging quarter, as we face difficult comparisons with the initial movie ship-ins last year for both TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE. In fact, the revenue decline from these two brands combined was $174 million in the quarter. This decline was partially offset by gains of $120 million across the remainder of our brand portfolio and backed by strong execution of our team globally. Overall, revenue declined 7% in the quarter as several of our brands and product categories grew. I will provide more insight on this performance in a moment.
Despite lower year-over-year revenues, we increased operating profit 9% from the second quarter last year. Our ability to improve operating profit clearly illustrates the operating leverage we are unlocking in our business. We continue to expect our revenue to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year as our major initiatives are beginning to launch. For the full year 2010, we still believe we should be able to grow revenues and earnings per share, including the dilution from our television investments and barring a further decline in foreign exchange, consumer spending or global economic conditions.
Reviewing our second quarter performance, the Games and Puzzles category, up 22% and Preschool, up 32%, both posted strong growth as did several of our mega brands, including Magic: The Gathering, which continues to perform extremely well; MONOPOLY, celebrating its 75th anniversary this year; NERF, showing strong growth both in the U.S. and through international expansion; and PLAYSKOOL, which is seeing growth across a number of initiatives including infant, learning and MR. and MRS. POTATO HEAD who are leading characters in Toy Story 3.  Other brands contributing to growth include FURREAL FRIENDS, PLAY-DOH, OPERATION, BABY ALIVE, STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE, TONKA and Iron Man. 
We have said this year would be about singles and doubles, meaning it would be a year when we are driving growth across the breadth of our portfolio period. Year-to-date, revenue is down just $3 million versus year ago. Over the coming months, we have a number of initiatives launching.
In the Boys category, BEYBLADE is off to a promising early start in Canada and is just starting to hit shelves in the U.S. Programming is on-air in both markets. Programming and products are also scheduled for major European markets, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand this year. NERF and the newly re-branded NERF Super Soaker had been strong contributors to growth in the first half of the year. And in the second half, we have major new products launches slated.
In Girls, LITTLEST PET SHOP is adding an exciting new play pattern inspired by our consumer insight work with BLYTHE LOVES LITTLEST PET SHOP. Also, FURRY FRENZIES within our FURREAL Friends line will be hitting retail this fall. In Preschool, our entrance into the electronic learning aid category with ALPHIE is off to a good start. PLAY-DOH is adding Sesame Street to its line, and Chuck My Talking Truck will get additional support from new programming on The Hub.
Finally, in Games and Puzzles, we continue to innovate our evergreen brands with creative play, while introducing exciting new brands. 
CUPONK, our new themed ball and cup game, is off to a good start. SCRABBLE FLASH, MONOPOLY Revolution and our new line of construction games under the U-BUILD brand are just a few additional highlights for the second half of the year. We will support these initiatives with the continuation of our successful global Family Game Night initiative including a new marketing campaign this fall.
We also feel very positive about our new network. This fall, The Hub, our children's television network with Discovery, is on schedule to launch on 10/10/10. At this point, Margaret Loesch and her team have announced much of the programming, completed all the acquisition deals for the fall launch and continue to finalize the schedule. 
As part of these announcements, Hasbro Studios has seven shows announced to be on The Hub. These include Transformers: Prime; G.I. Joe: Renegades; MY LITTLE PONY: Friendship is Magic; The Adventures of Chuck and Friends; Pound Puppies; PICTUREKA! and Family Game Night. Additionally, several of our partners have programs slated for the network, including Strawberry Shortcake from American Greetings, In the Night Garden from the BBC and The WotWots from Weta Workshop. More programming announcements are expected from The Hub in early August during the TCA, and major press event for the Television Critics Association.
From a product standpoint, in addition to product already available in the market, we have a number of new product initiatives which tie to our new programming on The Hub. The majority of new product tied to programming is scheduled to launch in fall 2011. MY LITTLE PONY is undergoing a reinvention along with the new animation. A sneak peek of the new look will hit retail shelves this fall to coincide with The Hub launch with the whole new look from MY LITTLE PONY coming in 2011.
From an advertising perspective, Margaret and the Hub's ad sales teams have had many one-on-one meetings with potential advertisers. As a result, blue-chip advertisers are getting on board with The Hub and its programming for kids and their families. They are enthusiastic about the mission of the network, and it provides them with an opportunity to reach a wide cross section of viewers including adults, moms, families and kids. 
Prior to the launch of the network, The Hub will kick off a concentrated high impact marketing campaign. This campaign will have additional support in the late November/early December time period as well as in early 2011.
Turning to our movie pipeline, production is underway for Transformers 3, which is scheduled for release on July 1, 2011. This year, TRANSFORMERS shipments are showing a more typical post-movie decline than the smaller decline we saw in 2008 when we had television to support the brand throughout the year. In 2011, we will have the support of both in major theatrical release and television behind the brand.
I started today's call reiterating that Hasbro's global teams are executing our long-term strategy, a strategy built on a number of core elements designed to guide our business for years to come. Our brands, including Hasbro's core brands and our vast portfolio of active and bulk brands, remain at the center of this strategy and guide the direction of decisions we are making globally in toys and games and immersive brand experiences.
We add to our efforts through alliances with marquee partners who are also reimagining their brands, including Marvel and its expanded universe of characters, Star Wars from Lucasfilm, and our newest partner Sesame Workshop. Finally, we are working with the industry's best creative stewards at Paramount, DreamWorks, Universal, Sony, Discovery, The Hub, Electronic Arts and Activision, who are actively developing Hasbro brands into immersive experience through movies, television and digital gaming. 
Our global Hasbro teams are activating the elements of our strategy each and everyday as we reimagine, reinvent and reignite our brands today and for years to come. I will now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"
277746,108856647,67690,"Hasbro Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-19-2010",2010-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning. The continued execution of our strategy and our attention to cost has enabled us to deliver improved profitability and maintain our strong balance sheet despite the revenue challenges in the quarter. For the second qu",1438,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning. The continued execution of our strategy and our attention to cost has enabled us to deliver improved profitability and maintain our strong balance sheet despite the revenue challenges in the quarter. 
For the second quarter, worldwide net revenues were $737.8 million, compared to $792.2 million last year, a decline of 7%. Foreign exchange had a positive impact of $1.6 million to revenue in the quarter. While revenue was down from last year as expected, operating profit of $79.7 million or 10.8% of revenue increased 9% or $6.6 million, compared to $73.1 million or 9.2% of revenue last year.
Looking at our second quarter segment results, the U.S. and Canada segment net revenues were $444.5 million, a decrease of 9% compared to $490.9 million last year. The results reflect growth in the Games and Puzzles, Girls and Preschool categories, offset by a decline in the Boys category primarily due to lower TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE shipment. U.S. and Canada operating profit for the quarter increased 4% to $58.7 million or 13.2% of revenues, compared to $56.3 million or 11.5% of revenue.
Net revenues in the International segment decreased 5% to $261.4 million, compared to $276.2 million a year ago. Foreign exchange had a negative $800,000 impact on revenue in the quarter. The results reflect growth in the Games and Puzzles and Preschool categories offset by declines in the Boys and Girls product categories. 
The International segment reported an operating profit of $11.6 million compared to an operating profit of $16.5 million last year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily the result of lower revenues.
Entertainment and Licensing segment net revenues increased 26% to $30.5 million compared to $24.2 million a year ago. This is primarily due to an increase in movie-related revenues. The Entertainment and Licensing segment operating profit increased to $13 million compared to $2.9 million last year, reflecting higher revenue as well as the fact that the second quarter 2009 included $7.2 million in onetime advisory fees and deal costs associated with our investment in the joint venture television network. While we continue to have costs associated with our television initiatives, our current run rate of expenses is lower than last year's onetime fees and costs.
Now let's look at earnings. For the quarter, we reported net earnings of $43.6 million or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to $39.3 million or $0.26 per diluted share a year ago. The second quarter 2010 includes a negative $0.05 per share impact from our television-related activities, while our second quarter 2009 included a negative $0.06 per diluted share impact. Cost of sales in the quarter was $300.3 million or $40.7 million of revenues, versus $319.5 million or 40.3% of revenues in 2009. 
During the past quarter, we spent a great deal of discussion around input cost trends, and I want to just take a moment to discuss how these impact Hasbro. Hasbro outsources between 80% and 85% of its manufacturing to vendors in China. We purchased this product in Hong Kong dollars, a currency which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. The cost we agreed to with our vendors are based on the estimated market level of input cost, which includes commodities and labor during the delivery stage of the product. As a general rule, once we agree on the cost with the vendor, we expect that cost to remain in place for the next 12 to 15 months. As a result, the impact we experience from input cost increases and decreases would be primarily reflected in 2011 and beyond. 
For these products, we take into account the current cost environment as we design, engineer and price our product with an objective to maintain our desired level of profitability on the product sale. There have been instances when we've accepted higher prices from our vendors despite having agreements in place, but this is during periods of extraordinary inflationary pressure and is not our general practice.
While costs had been rising in the first quarter, currently, several input costs appear to have peaked and are now coming down in select areas including resin and paper board. Overall, our operating margin increased to 10.8% from 9.2% last year. Operating profit improved despite lower revenue primarily due to lower royalties and amortization. Royalties declined due to lower entertainment-based revenue, including the decline in TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE. Amortization is down as the intangible assets associated with the Wizards of the Coast and Laramie acquisitions had been fully amortized.
We continue to invest in our business including our television initiatives, our emerging markets business as well as product development, which has grown this year in support of major product initiatives we have planned for 2011. Our investment in television programming is reflected in our balance sheet with another current asset. 
As we begin to generate revenue associated with our programs, programming costs will be expensed over the revenue curve of the program. No programming costs have been expensed on our P&L to date, and we do not anticipate these costs to be significant in 2010. Below the operating profit line, interest expense increased by $4.4 million to $21.9 million primarily due to the debt offering we completed in March 2010. 
Other income net totaled $3.2 million, compared to $1.3 million a year ago. Our 50% share of our joint venture results is included in this line on the P&L. This quarter, our share of the earnings in the joint venture, inclusive of amortization expense, was a loss of $76,000. In the second quarter 2009, our shares of the earnings in the joint venture was a positive $1 million. In the second quarter 2010, our underlying tax rate was 28.5% compared to 29.5% last year. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At quarter end, cash totaled $872.3 million, compared to $392 million a year ago. Over the past 12 months, we've generated over $600 million in cash from operations. Our cash generation is healthy, and we continue investing in our business. This includes approximately $19 million in television programming costs and a $25 million royalty advance to The Hub. Our next $25 million royalty advance payment of the network is due in the fourth quarter 2010. 
In March 2010, we raised $500 million through a debt offering. And on March 29, we called our outstanding 2 3/4% convertible debt. Prior to the end of the call period, substantially all of the debentures were converted into 11.6 million shares.
In the second quarter, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $271.4 million and an average price of $40.49 per share. In the first two quarters of 2010, we've repurchased 9.5 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $369.1 million and an average price of $38.99 per share. At the end of the second quarter, there was $417.5 million remaining in our current share repurchase authorization. 
The quality of our receivables portfolio remains good, and receivables at quarter end were $663.5 million, up $10.9 million from $652.6 million last year. In the second quarter of 2010, we did not utilize our securitization facility. However, in the second quarter 2009, we securitized $85.1 million of receivables.
As we've previously mentioned, given the changing environment and government regulations impacting the securitization market, it's likely we will not securitize receivables as actively in the future and we have not securitized receivables since the second quarter 2009. Absent the impact of securitization in 2009, DSO decreased three days to 81 days due to the timing of sales and collections in the quarter compared with a year ago. Inventories at $342.1 million in the quarter compared to $346.8 million a year ago.
In closing, there are a number of factors we're watching over the remainder of the year, namely: foreign exchange, consumer spending and global economic conditions. In particular, foreign exchange rates continue to be very volatile and difficult to predict, and they do affect our reported revenues. Our largest currency impact is the euro followed by the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the Australian dollar. What we are certain about is the breadth of our brand portfolio. 
Brian outlined a number of exciting initiatives launching in the coming months that will help drive our business for the rest of the year.

We look in PLAYSKOOL, really a number of initiatives driving that growth. Certainly, in the learning arena, we've just launched ALPHIE. That's a great category for us. We're already seeing some good numbers there. A major category in EXPLORE ‘N GROW is growing for us. WHEEL PALS is growing. Our TONKA Preschool business is growing. So those are all scenarios.

Those numbers that we cited, the $300 million dollars over time in contributing an additional toys and games sales, is consistent with what we believe today, because it's not only what we're going to do domestically on The Hub but as we distribute those shows internationally, we believe we'll get those increases in international markets as those shows go globally. So we, again, would reiterate our broad and long-term guidance, $300 million feels good to us.

Mexico was also one of the worst places last year because of the economy, because of bird flu and a number of other reasons. And Mexico has bounced back pretty well. So pretty good everywhere. But Mexico and Spain, good bounce back in emerging markets show more growth, which is to be expected."

Our global teams continue to execute our long-term strategy through the second quarter. 
Heading into Q2, we knew it would be a challenging quarter, as we face difficult comparisons with the initial movie ship-ins last year for both TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE. In fact, the revenue decline from these two brands combined was $174 million in the quarter. This decline was partially offset by gains of $120 million across the remainder of our brand portfolio and backed by strong execution of our team globally. Overall, revenue declined 7% in the quarter as several of our brands and product categories grew. I will provide more insight on this performance in a moment.
Despite lower year-over-year revenues, we increased operating profit 9% from the second quarter last year. Our ability to improve operating profit clearly illustrates the operating leverage we are unlocking in our business. We continue to expect our revenue to be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year as our major initiatives are beginning to launch. For the full year 2010, we still believe we should be able to grow revenues and earnings per share, including the dilution from our television investments and barring a further decline in foreign exchange, consumer spending or global economic conditions.
Reviewing our second quarter performance, the Games and Puzzles category, up 22% and Preschool, up 32%, both posted strong growth as did several of our mega brands, including Magic: The Gathering, which continues to perform extremely well; MONOPOLY, celebrating its 75th anniversary this year; NERF, showing strong growth both in the U.S. and through international expansion; and PLAYSKOOL, which is seeing growth across a number of initiatives including infant, learning and MR. and MRS. POTATO HEAD who are leading characters in Toy Story 3.  Other brands contributing to growth include FURREAL FRIENDS, PLAY-DOH, OPERATION, BABY ALIVE, STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE, TONKA and Iron Man. 
We have said this year would be about singles and doubles, meaning it would be a year when we are driving growth across the breadth of our portfolio period. Year-to-date, revenue is down just $3 million versus year ago. Over the coming months, we have a number of initiatives launching.
In the Boys category, BEYBLADE is off to a promising early start in Canada and is just starting to hit shelves in the U.S. Programming is on-air in both markets. Programming and products are also scheduled for major European markets, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand this year. NERF and the newly re-branded NERF Super Soaker had been strong contributors to growth in the first half of the year. And in the second half, we have major new products launches slated.
In Girls, LITTLEST PET SHOP is adding an exciting new play pattern inspired by our consumer insight work with BLYTHE LOVES LITTLEST PET SHOP. Also, FURRY FRENZIES within our FURREAL Friends line will be hitting retail this fall. In Preschool, our entrance into the electronic learning aid category with ALPHIE is off to a good start. PLAY-DOH is adding Sesame Street to its line, and Chuck My Talking Truck will get additional support from new programming on The Hub.
Finally, in Games and Puzzles, we continue to innovate our evergreen brands with creative play, while introducing exciting new brands. 
CUPONK, our new themed ball and cup game, is off to a good start. SCRABBLE FLASH, MONOPOLY Revolution and our new line of construction games under the U-BUILD brand are just a few additional highlights for the second half of the year. We will support these initiatives with the continuation of our successful global Family Game Night initiative including a new marketing campaign this fall.
We also feel very positive about our new network. This fall, The Hub, our children's television network with Discovery, is on schedule to launch on 10/10/10. At this point, Margaret Loesch and her team have announced much of the programming, completed all the acquisition deals for the fall launch and continue to finalize the schedule. 
As part of these announcements, Hasbro Studios has seven shows announced to be on The Hub. These include Transformers: Prime; G.I. Joe: Renegades; MY LITTLE PONY: Friendship is Magic; The Adventures of Chuck and Friends; Pound Puppies; PICTUREKA! and Family Game Night. Additionally, several of our partners have programs slated for the network, including Strawberry Shortcake from American Greetings, In the Night Garden from the BBC and The WotWots from Weta Workshop. More programming announcements are expected from The Hub in early August during the TCA, and major press event for the Television Critics Association.
From a product standpoint, in addition to product already available in the market, we have a number of new product initiatives which tie to our new programming on The Hub. The majority of new product tied to programming is scheduled to launch in fall 2011. MY LITTLE PONY is undergoing a reinvention along with the new animation. A sneak peek of the new look will hit retail shelves this fall to coincide with The Hub launch with the whole new look from MY LITTLE PONY coming in 2011.
From an advertising perspective, Margaret and the Hub's ad sales teams have had many one-on-one meetings with potential advertisers. As a result, blue-chip advertisers are getting on board with The Hub and its programming for kids and their families. They are enthusiastic about the mission of the network, and it provides them with an opportunity to reach a wide cross section of viewers including adults, moms, families and kids. 
Prior to the launch of the network, The Hub will kick off a concentrated high impact marketing campaign. This campaign will have additional support in the late November/early December time period as well as in early 2011.
Turning to our movie pipeline, production is underway for Transformers 3, which is scheduled for release on July 1, 2011. This year, TRANSFORMERS shipments are showing a more typical post-movie decline than the smaller decline we saw in 2008 when we had television to support the brand throughout the year. In 2011, we will have the support of both in major theatrical release and television behind the brand.
I started today's call reiterating that Hasbro's global teams are executing our long-term strategy, a strategy built on a number of core elements designed to guide our business for years to come. Our brands, including Hasbro's core brands and our vast portfolio of active and bulk brands, remain at the center of this strategy and guide the direction of decisions we are making globally in toys and games and immersive brand experiences.
We add to our efforts through alliances with marquee partners who are also reimagining their brands, including Marvel and its expanded universe of characters, Star Wars from Lucasfilm, and our newest partner Sesame Workshop. Finally, we are working with the industry's best creative stewards at Paramount, DreamWorks, Universal, Sony, Discovery, The Hub, Electronic Arts and Activision, who are actively developing Hasbro brands into immersive experience through movies, television and digital gaming. 
Our global Hasbro teams are activating the elements of our strategy each and everyday as we reimagine, reinvent and reignite our brands today and for years to come. I will now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"
277746,108856647,67717,"Hasbro Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-19-2010",2010-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning. The continued execution of our strategy and our attention to cost has enabled us to deliver improved profitability and maintain our strong balance sheet despite the revenue challenges in the quarter. For the second qu",1437,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning. The continued execution of our strategy and our attention to cost has enabled us to deliver improved profitability and maintain our strong balance sheet despite the revenue challenges in the quarter. 
For the second quarter, worldwide net revenues were $737.8 million, compared to $792.2 million last year, a decline of 7%. Foreign exchange had a positive impact of $1.6 million to revenue in the quarter. While revenue was down from last year as expected, operating profit of $79.7 million or 10.8% of revenue increased 9% or $6.6 million, compared to $73.1 million or 9.2% of revenue last year.
Looking at our second quarter segment results, the U.S. and Canada segment net revenues were $444.5 million, a decrease of 9% compared to $490.9 million last year. The results reflect growth in the Games and Puzzles, Girls and Preschool categories, offset by a decline in the Boys category primarily due to lower TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE shipment. U.S. and Canada operating profit for the quarter increased 4% to $58.7 million or 13.2% of revenues, compared to $56.3 million or 11.5% of revenue.
Net revenues in the International segment decreased 5% to $261.4 million, compared to $276.2 million a year ago. Foreign exchange had a negative $800,000 impact on revenue in the quarter. The results reflect growth in the Games and Puzzles and Preschool categories offset by declines in the Boys and Girls product categories. 
The International segment reported an operating profit of $11.6 million compared to an operating profit of $16.5 million last year. The year-over-year decrease was primarily the result of lower revenues.
Entertainment and Licensing segment net revenues increased 26% to $30.5 million compared to $24.2 million a year ago. This is primarily due to an increase in movie-related revenues. The Entertainment and Licensing segment operating profit increased to $13 million compared to $2.9 million last year, reflecting higher revenue as well as the fact that the second quarter 2009 included $7.2 million in onetime advisory fees and deal costs associated with our investment in the joint venture television network. While we continue to have costs associated with our television initiatives, our current run rate of expenses is lower than last year's onetime fees and costs.
Now let's look at earnings. For the quarter, we reported net earnings of $43.6 million or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to $39.3 million or $0.26 per diluted share a year ago. The second quarter 2010 includes a negative $0.05 per share impact from our television-related activities, while our second quarter 2009 included a negative $0.06 per diluted share impact. Cost of sales in the quarter was $300.3 million or $40.7 million of revenues, versus $319.5 million or 40.3% of revenues in 2009. 
During the past quarter, we spent a great deal of discussion around input cost trends, and I want to just take a moment to discuss how these impact Hasbro. Hasbro outsources between 80% and 85% of its manufacturing to vendors in China. We purchased this product in Hong Kong dollars, a currency which is pegged to the U.S. dollar. The cost we agreed to with our vendors are based on the estimated market level of input cost, which includes commodities and labor during the delivery stage of the product. As a general rule, once we agree on the cost with the vendor, we expect that cost to remain in place for the next 12 to 15 months. As a result, the impact we experience from input cost increases and decreases would be primarily reflected in 2011 and beyond. 
For these products, we take into account the current cost environment as we design, engineer and price our product with an objective to maintain our desired level of profitability on the product sale. There have been instances when we've accepted higher prices from our vendors despite having agreements in place, but this is during periods of extraordinary inflationary pressure and is not our general practice.
While costs had been rising in the first quarter, currently, several input costs appear to have peaked and are now coming down in select areas including resin and paper board. Overall, our operating margin increased to 10.8% from 9.2% last year. Operating profit improved despite lower revenue primarily due to lower royalties and amortization. Royalties declined due to lower entertainment-based revenue, including the decline in TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE. Amortization is down as the intangible assets associated with the Wizards of the Coast and Laramie acquisitions had been fully amortized.
We continue to invest in our business including our television initiative, our emerging markets business as well as product development, which has grown this year in support of major product initiatives we have planned for 2011. Our investment in television programming is reflected in our balance sheet with another current asset. 
As we begin to generate revenue associated with our programs, programming costs will be expensed over the revenue curve of the program. No programming costs have been expensed on our P&L to date, and we do not anticipate these costs to be significant in 2010. Below the operating profit line, interest expense increased by $4.4 million to $21.9 million, primarily due to the debt offering we completed in March 2010. 
Other income net totaled $3.2 million compared to $1.3 million a year ago. Our 50% share of our joint venture results is included in this line on the P&L. This quarter, our share of the earnings in the joint venture, inclusive of amortization expense, was a loss of $76,000. In the second quarter 2009, our share of the earnings in the joint venture was a positive $1 million. In the second quarter 2010, our underlying tax rate was 28.5% compared to 29.5% last year. 
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At quarter end, cash totaled $872.3 million, compared to $392 million a year ago. Over the past 12 months, we've generated over $600 million in cash from operations. Our cash generation is healthy, and we continue investing in our business. This includes approximately $19 million in television programming costs and a $25 million royalty advance to The Hub. Our next $25 million royalty advance payment to the network is due in the fourth quarter 2010. 
In March 2010, we raised $500 million through a debt offering. And on March 29, we called our outstanding 2 3/4% convertible debt. Prior to the end of the call period, substantially all of the debentures were converted into 11.6 million shares.
In the second quarter, we repurchased 6.7 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $271.4 million and an average price of $40.49 per share. In the first two quarters of 2010, we've repurchased 9.5 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $369.1 million and an average price of $38.99 per share. At the end of the second quarter, there was $417.5 million remaining in our current share repurchase authorization. 
The quality of our receivables portfolio remains good, and receivables at quarter end were $663.5 million, up $10.9 million from $652.6 million last year. In the second quarter of 2010, we did not utilize our securitization facility. However, in the second quarter 2009, we securitized $85.1 million of receivables.
As we've previously mentioned, given the changing environment and government regulations impacting the securitization market, it's likely we will not securitize receivables as actively in the future and we have not securitized receivables since the second quarter 2009. Absent the impact of securitization in 2009, DSO decreased three days to 81 days due to the timing of sales and collections in the quarter compared with a year ago. Inventories at $342.1 million in the quarter compared to $346.8 million a year ago.
In closing, there are a number of factors we're watching over the remainder of the year, namely, foreign exchange, consumer spending and global economic conditions. In particular, foreign exchange rates continue to be very volatile and difficult to predict and they do affect our reported revenues. Our largest currency impact is the euro followed by the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and the Australian dollar. What we are certain about is the breadth of our brand portfolio. 
Brian outlined a number of exciting initiatives launching in the coming months that'll help drive our business for the rest of the year. In 2010 and beyond, the global Hasbro teams will remain committed to the execution of our strategy and the investment in our business for the long term. We look forward to keeping you updated. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. And now Brian, David and I are happy to take your questions."

NERF is a superstar both domestically and internationally, growing at significant rates. We re-branded the Super Soaker segment to be NERF Super Soaker and reinvented that brand. That's also contributing significantly as we're getting great weather around the country and around the world, and Super Soaker is certainly performing. BEYBLADE is just beginning.

Currencies like the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar had strengthened. So we've got currencies really going in multiple direction. So currency isn't going to be the tailwind we thought it was going to be. It's really more of a headwind. And we'll watch it, but at current levels.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our business grew in the third quarter, reflecting the continued execution of our long-term strategy, our steadfast focus on innovation and immersive consumer experiences, backed by a strong performance from the Hasbro team globally.
Our growth was broad based, both geographically and across numerous world-class brands. While TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE shipments presented difficult challenge in 2010, we are overcoming this comparison through a number of global brand initiatives across categories.
This success is also translating to our bottom line. Operating profit reached record third quarter levels as we continued to unlock the profitability in our business and better leverage our investments globally.
Taking a closer look at our third quarter performance, we experienced growth in the Preschool, Boys, and Games and Puzzles category while the Girls category declined slightly in the quarter. Several of our mega brands contributed to growth this quarter, including NERF, which continues to post strong revenue gains globally. The new NERF Stampede launched globally on '99, and was the single most successful product launch in the history of the NERF brand. The Stampede is on a number of the hot toy list for this holiday season.
Magic: The Gathering again this quarter was a standout performer. The team has done a great job reigniting this brand over the past few years. PLAYSKOOL also continues to post strong year-over-year performances, with successful new initiatives including ALPHIE, WEEBLES and Juvenile products, as well as growth in MR. and MRS. POTATO HEAD.
As anticipated, TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE will continue to present difficult comparisons in 2010, although the revenue decline in the third quarter was not as great in absolute dollars as it was in the second quarter.
I spoke earlier to the broad-based brand strength and innovation driving our results. Beyond our mega brands, we have a number of brands contributing to growth this quarter, including BABY ALIVE, FURREAL FRIENDS, PLAY-DOH, TONKA, Iron Man and BEYBLADE. Our Board Game business grew in the quarter, with increases in a number of brands, including Operation, SCRABBLE, U-BUILD, BOP-IT and games based on Toy Story 3.
Must-have toy and award lists for this holiday reflect the broad portfolio of Hasbro brands we are showcasing this season, including the NERF Stampede, Tonka Chuck and Friends'  Chuck Stunt Park, Weebles Musical TreeHouse, PLAY-DOH Shape & Spin Elmo, Alphie and others, as well as games like SCRABBLE FLASH, MONOPOLY REVOLUTION, U-BUILD, Sorry Spin, Twister Hoopla and CUPONK, a new skill and action game in our line this year.
Through our ongoing efforts to deliver innovation at a great value, brands like FURREAL FRIENDS have brought technology into affordable price points for the consumer, with products such as Go Go My Walking Pup. For consumers looking for premium products and gifts this holiday, select higher price point items returned to our line including FURREAL FRIENDS BISCUIT and Butterscotch Pony, STAR WARS Millennium Falcon, Transformers Movie Ultimate Bumblebee and the Scrabble Premier Wood Edition.
Our marketing campaigns began in earnest in the fourth quarter and we are well positioned to meet demand with a good supply of high-quality, safe toys this holiday season, although some of the hotter items may run in short supply due to high consumer demand. We spoke with you last quarter about our efforts to ensure product availability this holiday season given the potential disruptions in the supply chain related to container availability.  
We believe the steps we took to secure appropriate shipping capacity will maintain a smooth flow of goods and avoid any impact to our supply chain this holiday season.  We have worked closely with our retailers to ensure they have the products on the shelves consumers want for the holidays.
We started the fourth quarter with the highly anticipated launch on 10-10-10 of The Hub, our new children's and family television network with Discovery Communications. We are very excited about the initial results, the look and feel of The Hub and the strong programming lineup which continues to roll out through the quarter.
Hasbro Studios has created a number of fantastic programs airing currently on The Hub, including Family Game Night, PICTUREKA!, MY LITTLE PONY Friendship is Magic, Pound Puppies and The Adventures of Chuck & Friends.
In addition, Margaret Loesch and The Hub team have put together a tremendous lineup of programs from the industry's best creative stewards, including R.L. Stein's The Haunting Hour: The Series, Dan Vs., Twisted Whiskers, In the Night Garden, The WotWots, and classic shows such as Happy Days, Doogie Howser, The Wonder Years and Family Ties. The network will also be the exclusive home for a limited series of original musical specials featuring singing sensation Taylor Swift produced for the network by Hasbro Studios. 
The Hub's launched marketing campaign is themed Where Great Things Come Together, reinforcing The Hub as a destination for kids and their families, as well as showcasing an array of great brands. The launch campaign will continue throughout the fourth quarter with substantial support for exciting programming and marketing events.
Hasbro continues to support The Hub's launch with marketing initiatives, including product stickers on at least 34 million retail packages promoting the network and the placement of TV schedules in shipments of all orders placed on HasbroToyShop.com during the holidays. If you haven't already tuned in, we encourage you to do so. You can find the schedule and channel locator at hubworld.com. The site also hosts program descriptions, videos and games to play. We know building a successful kids network is a long-term endeavor, but we are proud of what the Hasbro Studios team and The Hub team have accomplished in such a short period of time.
Additionally, from a film perspective, Transformers 3, which is scheduled for July 1, 2011, and Battleship, scheduled for May 18, 2012, are currently filming, and we continue to develop a number of additional brands with Universal, Paramount and Sony.
We are also remain excited about the movie slate from key partners. In 2011, Marvel will deliver Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger to theaters globally. In addition, Lucasfilm and Fox recently announced the Star Wars Saga will be converted to 3D, with the Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace expected to be released theatrically in 2012.
For the full year 2010, we continue to believe we should be able to grow revenues and earnings per share, including the dilution from our television investments and barring a further decline in consumer spending, global economic conditions or foreign exchange. As we look ahead to 2011 and beyond, our global teams are actively executing our long-term strategy by reimagining, reinventing and reigniting our brands to develop innovative toys, games and immersive experiences consumers can enjoy anytime and anywhere.
We look forward to updating you further at our Investor Day here in Rhode Island on November 9. I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"

Our third quarter performance highlights the strength of our brands and quality of execution from our global teams. To date, we've been able to offset the difficult revenue comparisons from Transformers and G.I. JOE in",1178,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning. Our third quarter performance highlights the strength of our brands and quality of execution from our global teams. To date, we've been able to offset the difficult revenue comparisons from Transformers and G.I. JOE in 2009 while improving profitability, investing in our business and returning cash to our shareholders.
For the third quarter, worldwide net revenues grew 3% to $1.31 billion compared to $1.28 billion last year. Excluding the negative $16.2 million impact of foreign exchange, net revenues grew 4% in the quarter. Operating profit in the quarter grew 3% to $237.8 million or 18.1% of revenue versus $230.7 million or 18% of revenue in 2009.
Looking at our third quarter segment results, the U.S. and Canada segment net revenues increased 4% to $825.5 million, compared to $791.9 million last year. The results reflect growth in the Preschool, Boys, and Games and Puzzles categories while revenue in the Girls category declined. U.S. and Canada operating profits for the quarter increased 23% to $158.8 million or 19.2% of revenue compared to $129.1 million or 16.3% of revenues last year.  Operating margin increased primarily due to lower royalty and amortization expense. 
Net revenues in the International segment increased 3% to $458.9 million compared to $444.1 million a year ago. Revenues in the International segment grew 7% excluding the negative $17.8 million impact from foreign exchange. The results reflect growth in the Preschool, and Games and Puzzles categories, as well as in the Girls category, which more than offset a decline in the Boys category. Growth in the emerging markets also contributed to the segments revenue gain. Operating profit in the International segment increased 10% to $70.8 million or 15.4% of revenues compared to $64.1 million last year or 14.4% of revenues. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of lower royalties due to the mix of products sold.
The Entertainment & Licensing segment net revenues decreased to $27.5 million compared to $41.6 million a year ago. This is primarily due to a decrease in movie-related revenues for Transformers and G.I. JOE. The Entertainment & Licensing segment operating profit decreased to $5.9 million compared to $19.8 million last year, reflecting lower revenues and additional expenses associated with our television initiative, including $5 million of programming amortization costs.
Now let's look at earnings. For the quarter, we reported net earnings of $155.2 million or $1.09 per diluted share compared to $150.4 million or $0.99 per diluted share a year ago. The third quarter 2010 includes a negative $0.07 per share impact from our television-related activities versus a negative $0.03 per share impact in the third quarter 2009.
Cost of sales in the quarter was $596.6 million, or 45.4% of revenues versus $550 million or 43% of revenues in 2009. This includes the $5 million in programming amortization I mentioned previously. In addition, the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue in the quarter was the result of a change in revenue mix, which includes the decline in Entertainment & Licensing revenue, as well as changes in foreign currency as opposed to an increase in commodity prices.
Operating profit increased 3% and represented 18.1% of net revenues versus 18% last year. Consistent with the second quarter 2010, royalties declined due to lower entertainment-based revenue, including the decline in Transformers and G.I. JOE. Amortization is down as the intangible assets associated with Wizards of the Coast and Larami acquisitions have been fully amortized.
Hasbro's profitability enables us to continue investing in our business, including investments in product development to drive innovation of future years, television programming and the overall support of our television initiative, and continued expansion and marketing of our business in emerging markets.
Below the operating profit line, interest expense increased by $4 million to $21.7 million, primarily due to the debt offering we completed in March 2010. And other income net totaled $3 million compared to $4.8 million a year ago.
Our 50% share of the joint venture results is included in this line in the P&L. This quarter, our share of the earnings in the joint venture was a loss of $874,000 as The Hub began spending to support its launch earlier this month. The bulk of the spending is slated for the fourth quarter of 2010.
In the third quarter 2009, our share of the earnings in The Hub was a positive $1.5 million. In the third quarter 2010, our underlying tax rate was 28.8% compared to 29.7% last year.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At quarter end, cash totaled $497.9 million compared to $297.4 million a year ago. Over the past 12 months, we have generated over $480 million in cash from operations. Our cash generation is healthy, and we continue investing in our business. This includes approximately $31 million in television programming costs to date. Our next $25 million royalty payment to The Hub is due later this quarter. 
In March 2010, we raised $500 million through a debt offering. And on March 29, we called our outstanding 2.75% convertible debt. Prior to the end of the call period, substantially all the debentures were converted into 11.6 million shares. In the third quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $260.1 million and at an average price of $42.39 per share.
In the first three quarters of 2010, we repurchased 15.6 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $629.2 million at an average price of $40.32 per share. At the end of the third quarter, $157.5 million remains in our current share repurchase authorization.
The quality of our receivables portfolio remains good, and receivables at quarter end were $1.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion last year. We did not utilize our securitization facility in the third quarter 2010 or 2009.
DSOs increased four days to 83 days due to the timing of sales and collections, as well as lower royalty revenue in the quarter compared with the year ago. Inventories of $468 million in the quarter compared to $399.9 million a year ago. We managed through potential shipping disruptions in the quarter and we brought product into our warehouses early. As a result, we're well positioned with good-quality inventory to meet demand this holiday season.
We're pleased with the growth in our business to date and our ability to not only increase revenues but earnings as well in a year with difficult comparisons and challenging economic condition. We're in a strong fiscally and have entered the important holiday season with a good supply of innovative toys, games and immersive experiences for our consumers.
For the full year 2010, we continue to believe we should be able to grow revenues and earnings per share, including the dilution from our television investments and barring a further decline in consumer spending, global economic conditions or foreign exchange. As Brian said, we look forward to sharing more of our future plans with you during our Investor Day on November 9.
Brian, David and I are now happy to take your questions."

There's much more -- the workforce, those people who live in the area then come to work from home on a bicycle. Migrants would come down as they're in dormitories. So I think in order to attract and retain this labor force throughout the year, we are going to have to build a little bit more earlier than historically. So I wouldn't be surprised to see our inventories in the sort of second and third quarter, ends a little bit higher than we've experienced in recent years. But not materially higher.

And then, you have two motion pictures from our partners at Marvel in the Avengers. And then, of course, you have Spiderman from Sony and from Marvel coming. And then, of course, our Battleship. So there is an opportunity we see potentially to move Stretch out of '12 and into '13. Obviously, between all of our motion picture initiatives and the TV initiatives, there may be an opportunity to begin to populate the 2013 timeframe. And if you look at the difference, really, for us, BATTLESHIP is a wonderful opportunity to brand it. Obviously, it's up in the quarter, and what we're seeing is a great array of online games and other digital games around Battleship. If you go to hubworld.com for example, there's a great Battleship interactive game that's there that you can play that was developed by our partners at Electronic Arts. And so, Battleship will be a completely immersive game-addict experience across a number of different platforms in time for the movie. Stretch Armstrong may be a little more traditional action figure business and Boys action business, albeit kind of comedic and fun and slightly younger skewing."

Additionally, whenever we discuss earnings per share or EPS, we are referring to earnings per diluted share.
This morning, Brian will discuss key factors impacting our results, and Deb will review the financials. We will then open the call to your questions. Before we begin, let me note that during this call and the question-and-answer session that follows, members of Hasbro management may make forward-looking statements concerning management's expectations, goals, objectives and similar matters. These forward-looking statements may include comments concerning our product and entertainment plans, anticipated product performance, business opportunities and strategies, costs, financial goals and expectations for our future financial performance and achieving our objectives.
There are many factors that could cause actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in these forward-looking statements. Some of those factors are set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, in today's press release and in our other public disclosures. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made today to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this call.

277746,114464398,80015,"Hasbro Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2010",2010-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our business grew in the third quarter, reflecting the continued execution of our long-term strategy, our steadfast focus on innovation and immersive consumer experiences, back",1157,"Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our business grew in the third quarter, reflecting the continued execution of our long-term strategy, our steadfast focus on innovation and immersive consumer experiences, backed by a strong performance from the Hasbro team globally.
Our growth was broad based, both geographically and across numerous world-class brands. While TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE shipments present a difficult challenge in 2010, we are overcoming this comparison through a number of global brand initiatives across categories.
This success is also translating to our bottom line. Operating profit reached record third quarter levels as we continue to unlock the profitability in our business and better leverage our investments globally.
Taking a closer look at our third quarter performance, we experienced growth in the Preschool, Boys and Games and Puzzles category while the Girls category declined slightly in the quarter. Several of our mega brands contributed to growth this quarter, including NERF, which continues to post strong revenue gains globally. The new NERF Stampede launched globally on 9/9 and was the single most successful product launch in the history of the NERF brand. The Stampede is on a number of the hot toy lists for this holiday season.
Magic: The Gathering again this quarter was a standout performer. The team has done a great job reigniting this brand over the past few years. PLAYSKOOL also continues to post strong year-over-year performances, with successful new initiatives including ALPHIE, WEEBLES and Juvenile products, as well as growth in MR. and MRS. POTATO HEAD.
As anticipated, TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE will continue to present difficult comparisons in 2010, although the revenue decline in the third quarter was not as great in absolute dollars as it was in the second quarter.
I spoke earlier to the broad-based brand strength and innovation driving our results. Beyond our mega brands, we have a number of brands contributing to growth this quarter, including BABY ALIVE, FURREAL FRIENDS, PLAY-DOH, TONKA, Iron Man and Beyblade. Our Board Game business grew in the quarter, with increases in a number of brands, including Operation, SCRABBLE, U-BUILD, BOP-IT and games based on Toy Story 3.
Must-have toy and award lists for this holiday reflect the broad portfolio of Hasbro brands we are showcasing this season, including the NERF Stampede, Tonka Chuck & Friends Chuck’s Stunt Park, Weebles Musical TreeHouse, PLAY-DOH Shape & Spin Elmo, Alphie and others, as well as games like SCRABBLE FLASH, MONOPOLY REVOLUTION, U-BUILD, Sorry Spin, Twister Hoopla and CUPONK, a new skill and action game in our line this year.
Through our ongoing efforts to deliver innovation at a great value, brands like FURREAL FRIENDS have brought technology into affordable price points for the consumer, with products such as Go Go My Walking Pup. For consumers looking for premium products and gifts this holiday, select higher price point items return to our line including FURREAL FRIENDS BISCUIT and Butterscotch Pony, STAR WARS Millennium Falcon, Transformers Movie Ultimate Bumblebee and the Scrabble Premier Wood Edition.
Our marketing campaigns begin in earnest in the fourth quarter and we are well positioned to meet demand with a good supply of high-quality, safe toys this holiday season, although some of the hotter items may run in short supply due to high consumer demand. We spoke with you last quarter about our efforts to ensure product availability this holiday season given the potential disruptions in the supply chain related to container availability.  
We believe the steps we took to secure appropriate shipping capacity will maintain a smooth flow of goods and avoid any impact to our supply chain this holiday season. We have worked closely with our retailers to ensure they have the products on the shelves consumers want for the holidays.
We started the fourth quarter with the highly anticipated launch on 10/10/10 of The Hub, our new children's and family television network with Discovery Communications. We are very excited about the initial results, the look and feel of The Hub and the strong programming lineup which continues to roll out through the quarter.
Hasbro Studios has created a number of fantastic programs airing currently on The Hub, including Family Game Night, PICTUREKA!, MY LITTLE PONY Friendship is Magic, Pound Puppies and The Adventures of Chuck & Friends.
In addition, Margaret Loesch and The Hub team have put together a tremendous lineup of programs from the industry's best creative stewards, including R.L. Stein's The Haunting Hour: The Series, Dan Vs., Twisted Whiskers, In the Night Garden, The WotWots, and classic shows such as Happy Days, Doogie Howser, The Wonder Years and Family Ties. The network will also be the exclusive home for a limited series of original musical specials featuring singing sensation Taylor Swift produced for the network by Hasbro Studios. 
The Hub's launch marketing campaign is themed Where Great Things Come Together, reinforcing The Hub as a destination for kids and their families, as well as showcasing an array of great brands. The launch campaign will continue throughout the fourth quarter with substantial support for exciting programming and marketing events.
Hasbro continues to support The Hub's launch with marketing initiatives, including product stickers on at least 34 million retail packages promoting the network and the placement of TV schedules in shipments of all orders placed on HasbroToyShop.com during the holidays. If you haven't already tuned in, we encourage you to do so. You can find the schedule and channel locator at hubworld.com. The site also hosts program descriptions, videos and games to play. We know building a successful kids network is a long-term endeavor, but we are proud of what the Hasbro Studios team and The Hub team have accomplished in such a short period of time.
Additionally, from a film perspective, Transformers 3, which is scheduled for July 1, 2011, and Battleship, scheduled for May 18, 2012, are currently filming, and we continue to develop a number of additional brands with Universal, Paramount and Sony.
We are also remain excited about the movie slate from key partners. In 2011, Marvel will deliver Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger to theaters globally. In addition, Lucasfilm and Fox recently announced the Star Wars Saga will be converted to 3D, with the Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace expected to be released theatrically in 2012.
For the full year 2010, we continue to believe we should be able to grow revenues and earnings per share, including the dilution from our television investments and barring a further decline in consumer spending, global economic conditions or foreign exchange. As we look ahead to 2011 and beyond, our global teams are actively executing our long-term strategy by reimagining, reinventing and reigniting our brands to develop innovative toys, games and immersive experiences consumers can enjoy anytime and anywhere.
We look forward to updating you further at our Investor Day here in Rhode Island on November 9. I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"
277746,114464398,80015,"Hasbro Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2010",2010-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning. Our third quarter performance highlights the strength of our brands and quality of execution from our global teams. To date, we've been able to offset the difficult revenue comparisons from Transformers and G.I. JOE in",1180,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning. Our third quarter performance highlights the strength of our brands and quality of execution from our global teams. To date, we've been able to offset the difficult revenue comparisons from Transformers and G.I. JOE in 2009 while improving profitability, investing in our business and returning cash to our shareholders.
For the third quarter, worldwide net revenues grew 3% to $1.31 billion compared to $1.28 billion last year. Excluding the negative $16.2 million impact of foreign exchange, net revenues grew 4% in the quarter. Operating profit in the quarter grew 3% to $237.8 million or 18.1% of revenue versus $230.7 million or 18% of revenue in 2009.
Looking at our third quarter segment results, the U.S. and Canada segment net revenues increased 4% to $825.5 million, compared to $791.9 million last year. The results reflect growth in the Preschool, Boys, and Games and Puzzles categories while revenue in the Girls category declined. U.S. and Canada operating profits for the quarter increased 23% to $158.8 million or 19.2% of revenue compared to $129.1 million or 16.3% of revenues last year. Operating margin increased primarily due to lower royalty and amortization expense. 
Net revenues in the International segment increased 3% to $458.9 million compared to $444.1 million a year ago. Revenues in the International segment grew 7% excluding the negative $17.8 million impact from foreign exchange. The results reflect growth in the Preschool, and Games and Puzzles categories, as well as in the Girls category, which more than offset a decline in the Boys category. Growth in the emerging market also contributed to the segment’s revenue gains. Operating profit in the International segment increased 10% to $70.8 million or 15.4% of revenues compared to $64.1 million last year or 14.4% of revenues. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of lower royalties due to the mix of products sold.
The Entertainment & Licensing segment net revenues decreased to $27.5 million compared to $41.6 million a year ago. This is primarily due to a decrease in movie-related revenues for Transformers and G.I. JOE. The Entertainment & Licensing segment operating profit decreased to $5.9 million compared to $19.8 million last year, reflecting lower revenues and additional expenses associated with our television initiative, including $5 million of programming amortization costs.
Now let's look at earnings. For the quarter, we reported net earnings of $155.2 million or $1.09 per diluted share compared to $150.4 million or $0.99 per diluted share a year ago. The third quarter 2010 includes a negative $0.07 per share impact from our television-related activities versus a negative $0.03 per share impact in the third quarter 2009.
Cost of sales in the quarter was $596.6 million, or 45.4% of revenues versus $550 million or 43% of revenues in 2009. This includes the $5 million in programming amortization I mentioned previously. In addition, the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue in the quarter was the result of a change in revenue mix, which includes the decline in Entertainment & Licensing revenue, as well as changes in foreign currency as opposed to an increase in commodity prices.
Operating profit increased 3% and represented 18.1% of net revenues versus 18% last year. Consistent with the second quarter 2010, royalties declined due to lower entertainment-based revenue, including the decline in Transformers and G.I. JOE. Amortization is down as the intangible assets associated with Wizards of the Coast and Larami acquisitions have been fully amortized.
Hasbro's profitability enables us to continue investing in our business, including investments in product development to drive innovation in future years, television programming and the overall support of our television initiative and continued expansion and marketing of our business in emerging markets.
Below the operating profit line, interest expense increased by $4 million to $21.7 million, primarily due to the debt offering we completed in March 2010. And other income net totaled $3 million compared to $4.8 million a year ago.
Our 50% share of the joint venture results is included in this line in the P&L. This quarter, our share of the earnings in the joint venture was a loss of $874,000 as The Hub began spending to support its launch earlier this month. The bulk of the spending is slated for the fourth quarter of 2010.
In the third quarter 2009, our share of the earnings in The Hub was a positive $1.5 million. In the third quarter 2010, our underlying tax rate was 28.8% compared to 29.7% last year.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At quarter end, cash totaled $497.9 million compared to $297.4 million a year ago. Over the past 12 months, we have generated over $480 million in cash from operations. Our cash generation is healthy, and we continue investing in our business. This includes approximately $31 million in television programming costs to date. Our next $25 million royalty payment to The Hub is due later this quarter. 
In March 2010, we raised $500 million through a debt offering. And on March 29, we called our outstanding 2 ¾% convertible debt. Prior to the end of the call period, substantially all the debentures were converted into 11.6 million shares. In the third quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $260.1 million and at an average price of $42.39 per share.
In the first three quarters of 2010, we repurchased 15.6 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $629.2 million at an average price of $40.32 per share. At the end of the third quarter, $157.5 million remains in our current share repurchase authorization.
The quality of our receivables portfolio remains good, and receivables at quarter end were $1.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion last year. We did not utilize our securitization facility in the third quarter 2010 or 2009.
DSOs increased four days to 83 days due to the timing of sales and collections, as well as lower royalty revenue in the quarter compared with the year ago. Inventories of $468 million in the quarter compared to $399.9 million a year ago. We managed through potential shipping disruptions in the quarter and we brought product into our warehouses early. As a result, we're well positioned with good-quality inventory to meet demand this holiday season.
We're pleased with the growth in our business to date and our ability to not only increase revenues but earnings as well in a year with difficult comparisons and challenging economic conditions. We're in a strong position fiscally and have entered the important holiday season with a good supply of innovative toys, games and immersive experiences for our consumers.
For the full year 2010, we continue to believe we should be able to grow revenues and earnings per share, including the dilution from our television investments and barring a further decline in consumer spending, global economic conditions or foreign exchange. As Brian said, we look forward to sharing more of our future plans with you during our Investor Day on November 9.
Brian, David and I are now happy to take your questions."

And some of the surcharges that were on at peak have now been taken off, so I think we’re through that. I think one of the things that you're going to find going forward is that the old days with most of our suppliers' labor in Southern China being migrants, who just came down during a peak period from June to November, that's kind of gone away. There's much more -- the workforce is people that live in the area and come to work from home on a bicycle, not migrants who come down and stay in dormitories. So I think in order to attract and retain this labor force throughout the year, we are going to have to build a little bit more earlier than historically. So I wouldn't be surprised to see our inventories in the sort of second and third quarter, ends a little bit higher than we've experienced in recent years. But not materially higher.

So that was really driving the rate down a bit more in 2009. So that's really the FX impact we're talking about between '09 and '10. And with respect to the costs, it wasn't so much a cost increase for us. It was more this FX impact as well as the mix in revenues. So with a decline in Entertainment & Licensing revenue, which has very low cost of sales associated with it, along with the impact of the programming cost amortization that hit in the quarter and this FX impact, it just made for a wider spread quarter-on-quarter than we normally see."

And if you look at the difference, really, for us, BATTLESHIP is a wonderful opportunity to brand it. Obviously, it's up in the quarter, and what we're seeing is a great array of online games and other digital games around Battleship. If you go to hubworld.com for example, there's a great Battleship interactive game that's there that you can play that was developed by our partners at Electronic Arts.

But of course, as you know, games sell late in the fourth quarter very significantly. And so, we felt that, that was warranted and would allow us to have a bigger impact. We have a number of new brands within Games or new lines within Games. The SCRABBLE FLASH is off to a tremendous start. CUPONK is a new line within the Games business, which is a lot of fun to play and is having great success. So overall, again, Games garnering great linear footage, great displays, great promotions. Our MONOPOLY promotion with McDonald's is going on presently. Maybe you've seen some of the advertising. So again, feel very good about where we are with our games. In fact, Drew, we're not only seeing Scrabble do well as our analog product, but on the Kindle, the Scrabble is the number App overall, even including books or other downloads. You can play Scrabble on your iPad. You can play Scrabble on other brands in a number of different forms and formats. So again, it's complementary and not cannibalistic to our Analog business."

I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that headwind and the way you might be responding to it?"

The team’s done a really terrific job of introducing our first pet sitter as BLYTHE. That will go forward, as well a number of new segments and initiatives for 2011. So like we've always said, we need to constantly reinvent and reimagine, reigniting our brands. And there are times and quarters where you'll hit an inflection point, but I do believe it's about timing more than anything. It's similarly, with MY LITTLE PONY, we're just launching the animation now domestically. We'll launch that in 2011 internationally. And then, the MY LITTLE PONY line is reflective of this new Friendship is Magic TV animation, which will roll out around the world. And meanwhile, we have an array of great Hasbro brands that are driving our business from FURREAL FRIENDS, BABY ALIVE and also, partnered brands with American Greetings, like STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE, so great broad array of brands."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our business grew in the third quarter, reflecting the continued execution of our long-term strategy, our steadfast focus on innovation and immersive consumer experiences, back",1157,"Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our business grew in the third quarter, reflecting the continued execution of our long-term strategy, our steadfast focus on innovation and immersive consumer experiences, backed by a strong performance from the Hasbro team globally.
Our growth was broad based, both geographically and across numerous world-class brands. While TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE shipments present a difficult challenge in 2010, we are overcoming this comparison through a number of global brand initiatives across categories.
This success is also translating to our bottom line. Operating profit reached record third quarter levels as we continue to unlock the profitability in our business and better leverage our investments globally.
Taking a closer look at our third quarter performance, we experienced growth in the Preschool, Boys and Games and Puzzles category while the Girls category declined slightly in the quarter. Several of our mega brands contributed to growth this quarter, including NERF, which continues to post strong revenue gains globally. The new NERF Stampede launched globally on 9/9 and was the single most successful product launch in the history of the NERF brand. The Stampede is on a number of the hot toy lists for this holiday season.
Magic: The Gathering again this quarter was a standout performer. The team has done a great job reigniting this brand over the past few years. PLAYSKOOL also continues to post strong year-over-year performances, with successful new initiatives including ALPHIE, WEEBLES and Juvenile products, as well as growth in MR. and MRS. POTATO HEAD.
As anticipated, TRANSFORMERS and G.I. JOE will continue to present difficult comparisons in 2010, although the revenue decline in the third quarter was not as great in absolute dollars as it was in the second quarter.
I spoke earlier to the broad-based brand strength and innovation driving our results. Beyond our mega brands, we have a number of brands contributing to growth this quarter, including BABY ALIVE, FURREAL FRIENDS, PLAY-DOH, TONKA, Iron Man and Beyblade. Our Board Game business grew in the quarter, with increases in a number of brands, including Operation, SCRABBLE, U-BUILD, BOP-IT and games based on Toy Story 3.
Must-have toy and award lists for this holiday reflect the broad portfolio of Hasbro brands we are showcasing this season, including the NERF Stampede, Tonka Chuck & Friends Chuck’s Stunt Park, Weebles Musical TreeHouse, PLAY-DOH Shape & Spin Elmo, Alphie and others, as well as games like SCRABBLE FLASH, MONOPOLY REVOLUTION, U-BUILD, Sorry Spin, Twister Hoopla and CUPONK, a new skill and action game in our line this year.
Through our ongoing efforts to deliver innovation at a great value, brands like FURREAL FRIENDS have brought technology into affordable price points for the consumer, with products such as Go Go My Walking Pup. For consumers looking for premium products and gifts this holiday, select higher price point items return to our line including FURREAL FRIENDS BISCUIT and Butterscotch Pony, STAR WARS Millennium Falcon, Transformers Movie Ultimate Bumblebee and the Scrabble Premier Wood Edition.
Our marketing campaigns begin in earnest in the fourth quarter and we are well positioned to meet demand with a good supply of high-quality, safe toys this holiday season, although some of the hotter items may run in short supply due to high consumer demand. We spoke with you last quarter about our efforts to ensure product availability this holiday season given the potential disruptions in the supply chain related to container availability.  
We believe the steps we took to secure appropriate shipping capacity will maintain a smooth flow of goods and avoid any impact to our supply chain this holiday season. We have worked closely with our retailers to ensure they have the products on the shelves consumers want for the holidays.
We started the fourth quarter with the highly anticipated launch on 10/10/10 of The Hub, our new children's and family television network with Discovery Communications. We are very excited about the initial results, the look and feel of The Hub and the strong programming lineup which continues to roll out through the quarter.
Hasbro Studios has created a number of fantastic programs airing currently on The Hub, including Family Game Night, PICTUREKA!, MY LITTLE PONY Friendship is Magic, Pound Puppies and The Adventures of Chuck & Friends.
In addition, Margaret Loesch and The Hub team have put together a tremendous lineup of programs from the industry's best creative stewards, including R.L. Stein's The Haunting Hour: The Series, Dan Vs., Twisted Whiskers, In the Night Garden, The WotWots, and classic shows such as Happy Days, Doogie Howser, The Wonder Years and Family Ties. The network will also be the exclusive home for a limited series of original musical specials featuring singing sensation Taylor Swift produced for the network by Hasbro Studios. 
The Hub's launch marketing campaign is themed Where Great Things Come Together, reinforcing The Hub as a destination for kids and their families, as well as showcasing an array of great brands. The launch campaign will continue throughout the fourth quarter with substantial support for exciting programming and marketing events.
Hasbro continues to support The Hub's launch with marketing initiatives, including product stickers on at least 34 million retail packages promoting the network and the placement of TV schedules in shipments of all orders placed on HasbroToyShop.com during the holidays. If you haven't already tuned in, we encourage you to do so. You can find the schedule and channel locator at hubworld.com. The site also hosts program descriptions, videos and games to play. We know building a successful kids network is a long-term endeavor, but we are proud of what the Hasbro Studios team and The Hub team have accomplished in such a short period of time.
Additionally, from a film perspective, Transformers 3, which is scheduled for July 1, 2011, and Battleship, scheduled for May 18, 2012, are currently filming, and we continue to develop a number of additional brands with Universal, Paramount and Sony.
We are also remain excited about the movie slate from key partners. In 2011, Marvel will deliver Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger to theaters globally. In addition, Lucasfilm and Fox recently announced the Star Wars Saga will be converted to 3D, with the Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace expected to be released theatrically in 2012.
For the full year 2010, we continue to believe we should be able to grow revenues and earnings per share, including the dilution from our television investments and barring a further decline in consumer spending, global economic conditions or foreign exchange. As we look ahead to 2011 and beyond, our global teams are actively executing our long-term strategy by reimagining, reinventing and reigniting our brands to develop innovative toys, games and immersive experiences consumers can enjoy anytime and anywhere.
We look forward to updating you further at our Investor Day here in Rhode Island on November 9. I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"
277746,114464398,80031,"Hasbro Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2010",2010-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning. Our third quarter performance highlights the strength of our brands and quality of execution from our global teams. To date, we've been able to offset the difficult revenue comparisons from Transformers and G.I. JOE in",1180,"Thank you, Brian, and good morning. Our third quarter performance highlights the strength of our brands and quality of execution from our global teams. To date, we've been able to offset the difficult revenue comparisons from Transformers and G.I. JOE in 2009 while improving profitability, investing in our business and returning cash to our shareholders.
For the third quarter, worldwide net revenues grew 3% to $1.31 billion compared to $1.28 billion last year. Excluding the negative $16.2 million impact of foreign exchange, net revenues grew 4% in the quarter. Operating profit in the quarter grew 3% to $237.8 million or 18.1% of revenue versus $230.7 million or 18% of revenue in 2009.
Looking at our third quarter segment results, the U.S. and Canada segment net revenues increased 4% to $825.5 million, compared to $791.9 million last year. The results reflect growth in the Preschool, Boys, and Games and Puzzles categories while revenue in the Girls category declined. U.S. and Canada operating profits for the quarter increased 23% to $158.8 million or 19.2% of revenue compared to $129.1 million or 16.3% of revenues last year. Operating margin increased primarily due to lower royalty and amortization expense. 
Net revenues in the International segment increased 3% to $458.9 million compared to $444.1 million a year ago. Revenues in the International segment grew 7% excluding the negative $17.8 million impact from foreign exchange. The results reflect growth in the Preschool, and Games and Puzzles categories, as well as in the Girls category, which more than offset a decline in the Boys category. Growth in the emerging market also contributed to the segment’s revenue gains. Operating profit in the International segment increased 10% to $70.8 million or 15.4% of revenues compared to $64.1 million last year or 14.4% of revenues. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of lower royalties due to the mix of products sold.
The Entertainment & Licensing segment net revenues decreased to $27.5 million compared to $41.6 million a year ago. This is primarily due to a decrease in movie-related revenues for Transformers and G.I. JOE. The Entertainment & Licensing segment operating profit decreased to $5.9 million compared to $19.8 million last year, reflecting lower revenues and additional expenses associated with our television initiative, including $5 million of programming amortization costs.
Now let's look at earnings. For the quarter, we reported net earnings of $155.2 million or $1.09 per diluted share compared to $150.4 million or $0.99 per diluted share a year ago. The third quarter 2010 includes a negative $0.07 per share impact from our television-related activities versus a negative $0.03 per share impact in the third quarter 2009.
Cost of sales in the quarter was $596.6 million, or 45.4% of revenues versus $550 million or 43% of revenues in 2009. This includes the $5 million in programming amortization I mentioned previously. In addition, the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue in the quarter was the result of a change in revenue mix, which includes the decline in Entertainment & Licensing revenue, as well as changes in foreign currency as opposed to an increase in commodity prices.
Operating profit increased 3% and represented 18.1% of net revenues versus 18% last year. Consistent with the second quarter 2010, royalties declined due to lower entertainment-based revenue, including the decline in Transformers and G.I. JOE. Amortization is down as the intangible assets associated with Wizards of the Coast and Larami acquisitions have been fully amortized.
Hasbro's profitability enables us to continue investing in our business, including investments in product development to drive innovation in future years, television programming and the overall support of our television initiative and continued expansion and marketing of our business in emerging markets.
Below the operating profit line, interest expense increased by $4 million to $21.7 million, primarily due to the debt offering we completed in March 2010. And other income net totaled $3 million compared to $4.8 million a year ago.
Our 50% share of the joint venture results is included in this line in the P&L. This quarter, our share of the earnings in the joint venture was a loss of $874,000 as The Hub began spending to support its launch earlier this month. The bulk of the spending is slated for the fourth quarter of 2010.
In the third quarter 2009, our share of the earnings in The Hub was a positive $1.5 million. In the third quarter 2010, our underlying tax rate was 28.8% compared to 29.7% last year.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At quarter end, cash totaled $497.9 million compared to $297.4 million a year ago. Over the past 12 months, we have generated over $480 million in cash from operations. Our cash generation is healthy, and we continue investing in our business. This includes approximately $31 million in television programming costs to date. Our next $25 million royalty payment to The Hub is due later this quarter. 
In March 2010, we raised $500 million through a debt offering. And on March 29, we called our outstanding 2 ¾% convertible debt. Prior to the end of the call period, substantially all the debentures were converted into 11.6 million shares. In the third quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $260.1 million and at an average price of $42.39 per share.
In the first three quarters of 2010, we repurchased 15.6 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $629.2 million at an average price of $40.32 per share. At the end of the third quarter, $157.5 million remains in our current share repurchase authorization.
The quality of our receivables portfolio remains good, and receivables at quarter end were $1.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion last year. We did not utilize our securitization facility in the third quarter 2010 or 2009.
DSOs increased four days to 83 days due to the timing of sales and collections, as well as lower royalty revenue in the quarter compared with the year ago. Inventories of $468 million in the quarter compared to $399.9 million a year ago. We managed through potential shipping disruptions in the quarter and we brought product into our warehouses early. As a result, we're well positioned with good-quality inventory to meet demand this holiday season.
We're pleased with the growth in our business to date and our ability to not only increase revenues but earnings as well in a year with difficult comparisons and challenging economic conditions. We're in a strong position fiscally and have entered the important holiday season with a good supply of innovative toys, games and immersive experiences for our consumers.
For the full year 2010, we continue to believe we should be able to grow revenues and earnings per share, including the dilution from our television investments and barring a further decline in consumer spending, global economic conditions or foreign exchange. As Brian said, we look forward to sharing more of our future plans with you during our Investor Day on November 9.

There's much more -- the workforce is people that live in the area and come to work from home on a bicycle, not migrants who come down and stay in dormitories. So I think in order to attract and retain this labor force throughout the year, we are going to have to build a little bit more earlier than historically. So I wouldn't be surprised to see our inventories in the sort of second and third quarter, ends a little bit higher than we've experienced in recent years. But not materially higher.

But of course, as you know, games sell late in the fourth quarter very significantly. And so, we felt that, that was warranted and would allow us to have a bigger impact. We have a number of new brands within Games or new lines within Games. The SCRABBLE FLASH is off to a tremendous start. CUPONK is a new line within the Games business, which is a lot of fun to play and is having great success. So overall, again, Games garnering great linear footage, great displays, great promotions. Our MONOPOLY promotion with McDonald's is going on presently. Maybe you've seen some of the advertising. So again, feel very good about where we are with our games. In fact, Drew, we're not only seeing Scrabble do well as our analog product, but on the Kindle, the Scrabble is the number App overall, even including books or other downloads.

Our business grew in the third quarter, reflecting the continued execution of our long-term strategy, our steadfast focus on innovation and immersive consumer experiences, back",1157,"Thank you, Debbie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our business grew in the third quarter, reflecting the continued execution of our long-term strategy, our steadfast focus on innovation and immersive consumer experiences, backed by a strong performance from the Hasbro team globally.
Our growth was broad based, both geographically and across numerous world-class brands. While TRANSFORMERS and G.I. Joe shipments present a difficult challenge in 2010, we are overcoming this comparison through a number of global brand initiatives across categories.
This success is also translating to our bottom line. Operating profit reached record third quarter levels as we continue to unlock the profitability in our business and better leverage our investments globally.
Taking a closer look at our third quarter performance, we experienced growth in the Preschool, Boys and Games and Puzzles category while the Girls category declined slightly in the quarter. Several of our mega brands contributed to growth this quarter, including NERF, which continues to post strong revenue gains globally. The new NERF Stampede launched globally on 9/9 and was the single most successful product launch in the history of the NERF brand. The Stampede is on a number of the hot toy lists for this holiday season.
Magic: The Gathering again this quarter was a standout performer. The team has done a great job reigniting this brand over the past few years. PLAYSKOOL also continues to post strong year-over-year performances, with successful new initiatives including Alphie, Weebles and Juvenile products, as well as growth in MR. and MRS. POTATO HEAD.
As anticipated, TRANSFORMERS and G.I. Joe will continue to present difficult comparisons in 2010, although the revenue decline in the third quarter was not as great in absolute dollars as it was in the second quarter.
I spoke earlier to the broad-based brand strength and innovation driving our results. Beyond our mega brands, we have a number of brands contributing to growth this quarter, including BABY ALIVE, FURREAL FRIENDS, PLAY-DOH, TONKA, Iron Man and BEYBLADE. Our Board Game business grew in the quarter, with increases in a number of brands, including OPERATION, SCRABBLE, U-BUILD, BOP IT and games based on Toy Story 3.
Must-have toy and award lists for this holiday reflect the broad portfolio of Hasbro brands we are showcasing this season, including the NERF Stampede, TONKA CHUCK & FRIENDS CHUCK'S STUNT PARK, WEEBLES Musical Treehouse, PLAY-DOH SHAPE & SPIN ELMO, Alphie and others, as well as games like SCRABBLE FLASH, MONOPOLY Revolution, U-BUILD, SORRY! SPIN, TWISTER HOOPLA and CUPONK, a new skill and action game in our line this year.
Through our ongoing efforts to deliver innovation at a great value, brands like FURREAL FRIENDS have brought technology into affordable price points for the consumer, with products such as GOGO MY WALKIN' PUP. For consumers looking for premium products and gifts this holiday, select higher price point items return to our line including FURREAL FRIENDS BISCUIT and BUTTERSCOTCH Pony, STAR WARS MILLENNIUM FALCON, TRANSFORMERS Movie Ultimate BUMBLEBEE and the SCRABBLE PREMIER WOOD Edition.
Our marketing campaigns begin in earnest in the fourth quarter and we are well positioned to meet demand with a good supply of high-quality, safe toys this holiday season, although some of the hotter items may run in short supply due to high consumer demand. We spoke with you last quarter about our efforts to ensure product availability this holiday season given the potential disruptions in the supply chain related to container availability. 
We believe the steps we took to secure appropriate shipping capacity will maintain a smooth flow of goods and avoid any impact to our supply chain this holiday season. We have worked closely with our retailers to ensure they have the products on the shelves consumers want for the holidays.
We started the fourth quarter with the highly anticipated launch on 10/10/10 of The Hub, our new children's and family television network with Discovery Communications. We are very excited about the initial results, the look and feel of The Hub and the strong programming lineup which continues to roll out through the quarter.
Hasbro Studios has created a number of fantastic programs airing currently on The Hub, including Family Game Night, PICTUREKA!, MY LITTLE PONY Friendship is Magic, Pound Puppies and The Adventures of Chuck & Friends.
In addition, Margaret Loesch and The Hub team have put together a tremendous lineup of programs from the industry's best creative stewards, including R.L. Stein's The Haunting Hour: The Series, Dan Vs., Twisted Whiskers, In the Night Garden, The WotWots, and classic shows such as Happy Days, Doogie Howser, The Wonder Years and Family Ties. The network will also be the exclusive home for a limited series of original musical specials featuring singing sensation Taylor Swift produced for the network by Hasbro Studios. 
The Hub's launch marketing campaign is themed Where Great Things Come Together, reinforcing The Hub as a destination for kids and their families, as well as showcasing an array of great brands. The launch campaign will continue throughout the fourth quarter with substantial support for exciting programming and marketing events.
Hasbro continues to support The Hub's launch with marketing initiatives, including product stickers on at least 34 million retail packages promoting the network and the placement of TV schedules in shipments of all orders placed on HasbroToyShop.com during the holidays. If you haven't already tuned in, we encourage you to do so. You can find the schedule and channel locator at hubworld.com. The site also hosts program descriptions, videos and games to play. We know building a successful kids network is a long-term endeavor, but we are proud of what the Hasbro Studios team and The Hub team have accomplished in such a short period of time.
Additionally, from a film perspective, Transformers 3, which is scheduled for July 1, 2011, and BATTLESHIP, scheduled for May 18, 2012, are currently filming, and we continue to develop a number of additional brands with Universal, Paramount and Sony.
We are also remain excited about the movie slate from key partners. In 2011, Marvel will deliver Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger to theaters globally. In addition, Lucasfilm and Fox recently announced the Star Wars Saga will be converted to 3D, with Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace expected to be released theatrically in 2012.
For the full year 2010, we continue to believe we should be able to grow revenues and earnings per share, including the dilution from our television investments and barring a further decline in consumer spending, global economic conditions or foreign exchange. As we look ahead to 2011 and beyond, our global teams are actively executing our long-term strategy by reimagining, reinventing and reigniting our brands to develop innovative toys, games and immersive experiences consumers can enjoy anytime and anywhere.
We look forward to updating you further at our Investor Day here in Rhode Island on November 9. I'll now turn the call over to Deb. Deb?"
277746,114464398,91163,"Hasbro Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2010",2010-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Hasbro, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Brian, and good morning. Our third quarter performance highlights the strength of our brands and quality of execution from our global teams.

Our third quarter performance highlights the strength of our brands and quality of execution from our global teams. To date, we've been able to offset the difficult revenue comparisons from Transformers and G.I. Joe in 2009 while improving profitability, investing in our business and returning cash to our shareholders.
For the third quarter, worldwide net revenues grew 3% to $1.31 billion compared to $1.28 billion last year. Excluding the negative $16.2 million impact of foreign exchange, net revenues grew 4% in the quarter. Operating profit in the quarter grew 3% to $237.8 million or 18.1% of revenue versus $230.7 million or 18% of revenue in 2009.
Looking at our third quarter segment results, the U.S. and Canada segment net revenues increased 4% to $825.5 million, compared to $791.9 million last year. The results reflect growth in the Preschool, Boys and Games and Puzzles categories while revenue in the Girls category declined. U.S. and Canada operating profits for the quarter increased 23% to $158.8 million or 19.2% of revenue compared to $129.1 million or 16.3% of revenues last year. Operating margin increased primarily due to lower royalty and amortization expense. 
Net revenues in the International segment increased 3% to $458.9 million compared to $444.1 million a year ago. Revenues in the International segment grew 7% excluding the negative $17.8 million impact from foreign exchange. The results reflect growth in the Preschool and Games and Puzzles categories, as well as in the Girls category, which more than offset a decline in the Boys category. Growth in the emerging markets also contributed to the segment’s revenue gains. Operating profit in the International segment increased 10% to $70.8 million or 15.4% of revenues compared to $64.1 million last year or 14.4% of revenues. The year-over-year increase was primarily the result of lower royalties due to the mix of products sold.
The Entertainment & Licensing segment net revenues decreased to $27.5 million compared to $41.6 million a year ago. This is primarily due to a decrease in movie-related revenues for Transformers and G.I. Joe. The Entertainment & Licensing segment operating profit decreased to $5.9 million compared to $19.8 million last year, reflecting lower revenues and additional expenses associated with our television initiative, including $5 million of programming amortization costs.
Now let's look at earnings. For the quarter, we reported net earnings of $155.2 million or $1.09 per diluted share compared to $150.4 million or $0.99 per diluted share a year ago. The third quarter 2010 includes a negative $0.07 per share impact from our television-related activities versus a negative $0.03 per share impact in the third quarter 2009.
Cost of sales in the quarter was $596.6 million or 45.4% of revenues versus $550 million or 43% of revenues in 2009. This includes the $5 million in programming amortization I mentioned previously. In addition, the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenue in the quarter was the result of a change in revenue mix, which includes the decline in Entertainment & Licensing revenue, as well as changes in foreign currency as opposed to an increase in commodity prices.
Operating profit increased 3% and represented 18.1% of net revenues versus 18% last year. Consistent with the second quarter 2010, royalties declined due to lower entertainment-based revenue, including the decline in Transformers and G.I. Joe. Amortization is down as the intangible assets associated with Wizards of the Coast and Larami acquisitions have been fully amortized.
Hasbro's profitability enables us to continue investing in our business, including investments in product development to drive innovation in future years, television programming and the overall support of our television initiative and continued expansion and marketing of our business in emerging markets.
Below the operating profit line, interest expense increased by $4 million to $21.7 million, primarily due to the debt offering we completed in March 2010. And other income net totaled $3 million compared to $4.8 million a year ago.
Our 50% share of the joint venture results is included in this line in the P&L. This quarter, our share of the earnings in the joint venture was a loss of $874,000 as The Hub began spending to support its launch earlier this month. The bulk of the spending is slated for the fourth quarter of 2010.
In the third quarter 2009, our share of the earnings in The Hub was a positive $1.5 million. In the third quarter 2010, our underlying tax rate was 28.8% compared to 29.7% last year.
Now let's turn to the balance sheet. At quarter end, cash totaled $497.9 million compared to $297.4 million a year ago. Over the past 12 months, we have generated over $480 million in cash from operations. Our cash generation is healthy, and we continue investing in our business. This includes approximately $31 million in television programming costs to date. Our next $25 million royalty payment to The Hub is due later this quarter. 
In March 2010, we raised $500 million through a debt offering. And on March 29, we called our outstanding 2 ¾% convertible debt. Prior to the end of the call period, substantially all the debentures were converted into 11.6 million shares. In the third quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $260.1 million and at an average price of $42.39 per share.
In the first three quarters of 2010, we repurchased 15.6 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $629.2 million at an average price of $40.32 per share. At the end of the third quarter, $157.5 million remains in our current share repurchase authorization.
The quality of our receivables portfolio remains good, and receivables at quarter end were $1.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion last year. We did not utilize our securitization facility in the third quarter 2010 or 2009.
DSOs increased four days to 83 days due to the timing of sales and collections, as well as lower royalty revenue in the quarter compared with a year ago. Inventories of $468 million in the quarter compared to $399.9 million a year ago. We managed through potential shipping disruptions in the quarter and we brought product into our warehouses early. As a result, we're well positioned with good-quality inventory to meet demand this holiday season.
We're pleased with the growth in our business to date and our ability to not only increase revenues but earnings as well in a year with difficult comparisons and challenging economic conditions. We're in a strong position fiscally and have entered the important holiday season with a good supply of innovative toys, games and immersive experiences for our consumers.
For the full year 2010, we continue to believe we should be able to grow revenues and earnings per share, including the dilution from our television investments and barring a further decline in consumer spending, global economic conditions or foreign exchange. As Brian said, we look forward to sharing more of our future plans with you during our Investor Day on November 9.

There's much more -- the workforce is people that live in the area and come to work from home on a bicycle, not migrants who come down and stay in dormitories. So I think in order to attract and retain this labor force throughout the year, we are going to have to build a little bit more earlier than historically.

And we've now demonstrated that by growing NERF several-fold and also growing it internationally. The opportunity to grow NERF far beyond where it is today is still there and apparent. New segments being introduced. The Stampede is just one among many. Marvel is continuing to perform very well this year and is up. Star Wars, we're really seeing now with the new season really coming into its own and feel very excited about the Star Wars plans, not only for television but as it comes back into movies. BEYBLADE, getting started. So overall, again, we talk about a broad portfolio of great brands, and Boys is no different."

The team’s done a really terrific job of introducing our first pet sitter as BLYTHE. That will go forward, as well a number of new segments and initiatives for 2011. So like we've always said, we need to constantly reinvent and reimagine, reigniting our brands. And there are times and quarters where you'll hit an inflection point, but I do believe it's about timing more than anything. It's similarly, with MY LITTLE PONY, we're just launching the animation now domestically. We'll launch that in 2011 internationally. And then, the MY LITTLE PONY line is reflective of this new Friendship is Magic TV animation, which will roll out around the world. And meanwhile, we have an array of great Hasbro brands that are driving our business from FURREAL FRIENDS, BABY ALIVE and also, partnered brands with American Greetings, like STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE, so great broad array of brands."
