Our goal this year is profitability in each and every quarter and for the entire fiscal year. Profitability in the second quarter will be challenging as we will not close as many homes in the second quarter as we did in the first quarter. We are entering the quarter with 4,136 homes in backlog and we will need to realize a backlog conversion ratio of greater than 100% to reach profitability. With the extension and expansion of the homebuyer tax credit and with our available housing inventory, a high backlog conversion rate is entirely achievable. But we do not expect to be as profitable as we were this quarter. In the third quarter, we expect strong closings since homes must close since June 30 for the extended tax credit. The third quarter will probably be our strongest quarter for profits this year. We expect our September quarter will be the most challenging, as the tax credit support for home sales would have expired. As we move past the selling season, we will be able to get a better read on core demand and we will adjust our business accordingly. Bill?"

Approximately 300 basis points of the sequential increase was due to the average cost of our homes declining by more than our average selling prices, partially due to our success constructing enclosing homes on recently acquired finished lots in new community. 15% of the first quarter closings were from new deals that were contracted for in fiscal 2009. Margins on closings in our new projects are approximately 350 basis points higher than on the remainder of our closings. Approximately 110 basis points of the sequential increase in gross margins was due to the current quarter change in our warranty and litigation accruals as a percentage of home sales revenue.

But to get back to a point where we have some appreciation in housing values, I think it's the only thing that's going to make our industry better going forward. We're going to be fighting the shadow foreclosure, the delinquencies, all of these people underwater on their mortgages. We have to get housing values back somewhere closer to where they were, which is a long-term process."

Currently, we still see an adequate supply of lots in most of our markets of what we call finished lots owned by others, who we can buy on an option basis. We do have land that is mothballed. We pull some of the land out every quarter and begin to develop it when it makes economic sense for us to develop it. So as a result, I think most of our lot inventory will be -- or houses will continue to be built on the 22,000 lots that we own. That's our goal, to work our way through our existing lot inventory, as well as to work our way through our 24,000 option lots and continue to add to those. We have some partially finished lots. Once we get finished with the vast majority of our 22,000 finished lots, then we'll start focusing on how we work our way through the partially finished lots. I somewhat am disappointed, as people continue to focus on our owned lot inventory. And I would say to you that we've done a wonderful job of continuing to work our way through our owned lot inventory as it makes economic sense and supplementing that with option deals. The fact that we have $1.9 billion in cash, we're one of the few builders starting specs in most of our markets, makes us the pre-eminent buyer for these option deals. So I look at our owned lot inventory and say, ""It's slowly but surely being merged in with our closings on option lots, and we're having a wonderful merged gross margin on both product lines.""."

I was reading the other day that we're expected to generate 100,000 new jobs in Texas in calendar year 2010. So I look at Texas as certainly a strong market. Now the weak markets continue to be Las Vegas and certainly Phoenix. There are a lot of people underwater on their mortgages on both of those markets, and there are foreclosures and delinquencies. The good thing about both of those markets is that the listings are declining in each one of those markets. And that's a function of a couple of things. I think people are taking their homes off the market because they can't sell them. And secondly, I think the banks are doing a good job of metering out the foreclosed homes ahead.

Both our homebuilding and financial services segment were profitable. Our net income for the quarter was $192 million or $0.56 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $62.6 million or $0.20 per share in the prior year quarter. Net income for the current quarter includes an income tax benefit of $149.2 million related to the recent change in the tax law for NOL carrybacks. Don?Let's be clear. Our goal this year is profitability in each and every quarter and for the entire fiscal year. Profitability in the second quarter will be challenging as we will not close as many homes in the second quarter as we did in the first quarter. We are entering the quarter with 4,136 homes in backlog and we will need to realize a backlog conversion ratio of greater than 100% to reach profitability. With the extension and expansion of the homebuyer tax credit and with our available housing inventory, a high backlog conversion rate is entirely achievable. But we do not expect to be as profitable as we were this quarter. In the third quarter, we expect strong closings since homes must close since June 30 for the extended tax credit.

Approximately 300 basis points of the sequential increase was due to the average cost of our homes declining by more than our average selling prices, partially due to our success constructing enclosing homes on recently acquired finished lots in new community. 15% of the first quarter closings were from new deals that were contracted for in fiscal 2009. Margins on closings in our new projects are approximately 350 basis points higher than on the remainder of our closings. Approximately 110 basis points of the sequential increase in gross margins was due to the current quarter change in our warranty and litigation accruals as a percentage of home sales revenue. The final 50 basis points was due to a decrease in the amortization of capitalized interest and property taxes.

These positive results were incorporated in our first quarter impairment analysis when we reviewed all projects in the company and determine the projects with a free impairment carrying value of $5.3 million were impaired. We recorded inventory impairments of $1.7 million as a charge to cost of sales. We refer to our projects which have indicators of potential impairment but we're not impaired as our watch list, which represents those projects deemed to be the highest risk for future impairments. Our watch list is currently $478.7 million, down from $542 million at September 30, 2009, and also down from $1.2 billion at June 30, 2009. The largest concentrations in our watch list are in California, Texas, Hawaii and Illinois.

I was reading the other day that we're expected to generate 100,000 new jobs in Texas in calendar year 2010. So I look at Texas as certainly a strong market. Now the weak markets continue to be Las Vegas and certainly Phoenix. There are a lot of people underwater on their mortgages on both of those markets, and there are foreclosures and delinquencies. The good thing about both of those markets is that the listings are declining in each one of those markets. And that's a function of a couple of things. I think people are taking their homes off the market because they can't sell them. And secondly, I think the banks are doing a good job of metering out the foreclosed homes ahead.

In addition, this quarter, we saw an increase in our home sales gross margin to 17.1%, an increase in our average sales price on our net sales and good sales volume. These positive results were incorporated in our first quarter impairment analysis when we reviewed all projects in the company and determine the projects with a pre-impairment carrying value of $5.3 million were impaired. We recorded inventory impairments of $1.7 million as a charge to cost of sales. We refer to our projects which have indicators of potential impairment but we're not impaired as our watch list, which represents those projects deemed to be the highest risk for future impairments. Our watch list is currently $478.7 million, down from $542 million at September 30, 2009, and also down from $1.2 billion at June 30, 2009. The largest concentrations in our watch list are in California, Texas, Hawaii and Illinois. Also, during our first quarter, we had net recoveries of $500,000 of earnest money and pre-acquisition costs. If our margins and absorptions stay at current levels, we expect our impairments to remain at a relatively low level in our second quarter. As we move past April 30, and the expiration of the tax credit, we will evaluate the impact on sales demand, sales prices and expected margins for sales written after April 30. And we will incorporate these market conditions in our inventory impairment process as necessary in the June and September quarters. We still expect our impairments in fiscal 2010 to be substantially lower than those we recorded in fiscal 2009. Don?"

The good thing about both of those markets is that the listings are declining in each one of those markets. And that's a function of a couple of things.

There are still challenges in the homebuilding industry: Rising foreclosures, significant existing home inventory, high unemployment, tight mortgage lending standards, the expiration of certain government support for the housing and mortgage markets and weak consumer confidence. However, new home inventory remains low. Interest rates are favorable, and housing affordability is near record highs. We will continue our focus on providing affordable homes for the first-time homebuyer, controlling our costs, contracting for new communities with attractively priced finished lots and maintaining our strong balance sheet.

As we saw an increase in our home sales gross margin to 18% and great sales volume this quarter, we continue to expect lower impairments in 2010 if our sales prices, sales absorptions and expected margins stay at the current levels. During our second quarter impairment analysis, we reviewed all projects in the company and determined if projects with a pre-impairment carrying value of $8.5 million were impaired. 
We recorded inventory impairments of $2.3 million as a charge to cost of sales. We refer to our projects which had indicators of potential impairment but were not impaired as our watch list, which represents those projects that are deemed to be the highest risk for future impairments. Our watch list is currently $525.3 million, up slightly from $478.7 million at December 31. The largest concentrations in our current watch list are in Illinois, California and Florida.
We will continue to evaluate sales demands, sales prices and expected margins in each of our markets as well as levels of job creation or losses of broader economy and their effects on the valuations of our assets. Our inventory impairment process in the June and September quarters will incorporate any changes in market conditions and any adjustments we make in our business. Don?

We have reduced our homebuilding debt this fiscal year to date by $524.8 million. We improved our gross margin further to 18.0% this quarter as we continued to improve the cost and design of our products and as we continued to open new communities on recently acquired lots at higher margins.
There are still challenges in the homebuilding industry: Rising foreclosures, significant existing home inventory, high unemployment, tight mortgage lending standards, the expiration of certain government support for the housing and mortgage markets and weak consumer confidence. However, new home inventory remains low. Interest rates are favorable, and housing affordability is near record highs. We will continue our focus on providing affordable homes for the first-time homebuyer, controlling our costs, contracting for new communities with attractively priced finished lots and maintaining our strong balance sheet. Again, we want to thank all of our DHI team members who continue to outsell and outperform the industry. Keep up the great work. D.R.

So far, this year has unfolded as we expected. We saw strong sales through April, and we just had our strongest third quarter homes closed in three years. We entered the year expecting the second half of the calendar year to be more challenging because of the pull-forward effect of the federal tax credit, combined with normal seasonality and a continued weak economy.

Our sales in April were extremely strong followed by a sharp decline in May, a 20% sequential increase in June and then an approximate 10% increase in July. 
As we look at our sales comps for the next three quarters, it will be difficult to achieve year-over-year increases since each of the quarter saw a strong sales volume, driven by the various tax credits in effect.

In the June quarter, our average sales price on net sales orders in the quarter was essentially flat at $208,400. Our cancellation rate was 28%. Our active selling communities were up 7% sequentially. 39% of our net sales came from communities opened in fiscal year 2009 or later. Our sales backlog decreased 18% from the prior year to 4,430 homes or $954.4 million. Stacey?"

Our gross margins have been in the 17% to 18% range in each of the first three quarters this year, with some volatility within the range. Our core margin increased 50 basis points from Q2 to Q3 as the average cost of our homes declined by more than our average selling prices. This was more than offset by the sequential gross margin impact from typical changes and estimates for development and construction completion cost and warranty and litigation accruals, which are magnified when quarterly revenues fluctuate significantly as they have this year.
A contributing factor to our core margin improvement was that 35% of third quarter closings were from new deals that were put under contract in fiscal 2009 or later. Margins on closings in our new projects are approximately 200 to 300 basis points higher than on the remainder of our closings. Our goal is to maintain our gross margin in the 17% to 18% range or higher. However, if current market conditions persist, we could see margin pressure in future quarters. Bill?"

There are still challenges in the homebuilding industry: rising foreclosures, significant existing home inventory, high unemployment, tight mortgage lending standards, the expiration of certain government support for the housing and mortgage markets and weak consumer confidence. However, new home inventory remains low, interest rates are favorable and housing affordability is near record highs. We will continue to focus on providing affordable homes for the first-time buyer, controlling our cost, contracting for new communities with attractive, priced-finished lots and maintaining our strong balance sheet. Consistent profitability at DHI is the ultimate goal.
D.R. and I celebrated our 28th anniversary in 12 days. In the 28 years we've been together, DHI is currently in the strongest position ever as evidenced by the strongest balance sheet in our history, a large national footprint with significant increasing penetrations in the majority of our markets and the best people in the industry. 
DHI is in a preeminent position to capitalize on the future of the homebuilding industry, whatever it may be. Again, we thank all of our DHI team members who continue to outsell and outperform the industry. Our third quarter is over. Now we need to focus intently on marching toward profitability in Q4. Keep up the great work.

And I would say to you that we're going to make small adjustments as necessary to continue to hit the sales volumes and the closing volumes that we want to have as a company."

This calls volatile sales and closings, but the year was consistent with our expectations and preparations. While the federal tax credit was in place, we experienced strong sales demand through the April 30 sales contract deadline, specially from first-time homebuyers. Our closings were strong through the June 30 closing deadline for the tax credit. However, after the tax credit expired, sales demand dropped sharply in May. From June through August, our sales trend showed sequential improvement, and then we began experiencing a normal, seasonal slowdown in September and October. 
Overall, housing demand is weak. Even with significant fluctuations in the level of demand for our homes in fiscal 2010, our approach was very consistent. Manager homes and inventory to current demand generate cash, reduce debt, position ourselves for profitability and maintain a strong balance sheet to be positioned to take advantage of opportunities.
As we look to fiscal 2011, we continue to be realistic in our expectations and will adjust our business to compete in the current market conditions. We expect another very challenging year for the homebuilding industry as a fundamental drivers of demand. The overall economy, job growth and consumer confidence are still very weak. In addition, we do not expect any stimulus in fiscal 2011 similar to the federal tax credits that were in effect last year. All of these factors make it likely that our sales and closing volumes will be below our volumes in fiscal 2010. 
However, we plan to continue to gain market share by opening new communities and adjusting our price points and product offerings due to demand we see in each of our individual markets. I want to congratulate each member of the D.R. Horton team for turning in a strong performance in fiscal 2010 despite continued difficult industry conditions. We appreciate very much your efforts.

This calls volatile sales and closings, but the year was consistent with our expectations and preparations. While the federal tax credit was in place, we experienced strong sales demand through the April 30, the sales contract deadline, especially from first time home buyers.
Our closings were strong through the June 30 closing deadline for the tax credit. However, after the tax credit expired sales demand dropped sharply in May. From June through August, our sales trend showed sequential improvement, and then we began experiencing a normal seasonal slowdown in September and October.
Overall, housing demand is weak. Even with significant fluctuations in the level of demand for our new homes in fiscal 2010, our approach was very consistent, manage our homes in inventory to current demand, generate cash, reduce debt, position ourselves for profitability and maintain a strong balance sheet to be positioned to take advantage of opportunities.
As we look to fiscal 2011, we continue to be realistic in our expectations, and will adjust our business to compete in the current market conditions. We expect another very challenging year for the homebuilding industry, as the fundamental drivers of demand, the overall economy, job growth, and consumer confidence are still very weak. In addition, we do not expect any stimulus in fiscal 2011 similar to the federal tax credits that were in effect last year.
All of these factors make it likely that our sales and closing volumes will be below our volumes in fiscal 2010. However, we plan to continue to gain market share by opening new communities and adjusting our price points and product offerings to the demand we see in each of our individual markets.

But most importantly, what this company has always focused on, Megan, and we continue to focus on everyday that we get up, and that is how do we consistently turn a profit in this company. So the sales, as Horton says, nothing happens until we sell something, but the reality of life is we have sell these houses at a profit and our focus is clearly how do we consistently be profitable in this corporation.

As far as SG&A cuts, yes, we have already identified with our regional presidents additional SG&A cuts to the extent that the sales do not materialize in accordance with our five year plan for fiscal year ‘11. So yes, I think those SG&A cuts will be more difficult than what they’ve been in the past, but we definitely have identified additional cuts that need to be made if the sales do not materialize.

I’m personally approving all the lot contracts and all the renegotiation. So, I can tell you we see a lot of renegotiated contracts there.
Additionally, I would say to you that we are going to put pressure on our vendors, and they have supported us throughout the years, and especially since we’re such a significant portion of every market, our vendors are very focused on additional business, and as we continue to aggregate market share in each one of our divisions, then we are going to be able to get price concessions from them.

I think the way that we continue to handle the softness is by virtue of offering incentives so we can maintain our pricing structure in most all of our communities, because the last thing we really want to do is to enter into a decrease in our prices.

I want to be certain that everyone understands that we believe that we had a very successful fiscal year 2010 and most importantly, we are prepared to meet whatever the market conditions are in fiscal 2011.
I can’t thank all of our sales people enough and each one of our communities, because you’ve done a very successful job out there and to all of our construction people who continue to build houses faster, more efficiently and better than ever, thank you. Our vendors, who have continued to support us over the years and we need your support on a go-forward basis to meet the market, we thank you too. We clearly continue and will plan to continue to outperform everyone else in the industry.
D.R. Horton is the largest builder in America for the eighth consecutive year, and our goal clearly is to be largest builder for the ninth consecutive year all the while focusing on the most important aspect of our business and that is profitability. Donald Horton has said this many times, it all starts with the people and I frankly believe we have the best people in the industry and we appreciate the phenomenal job that you have done for us. Thank you very much.

This calls volatile sales and closings, but the year was consistent with our expectations and preparations. While the federal tax credit was in place, we experienced strong sales demand through the April 30 sales contract deadline, especially from first-time homebuyers. Our closings were strong through the June 30 closing deadline for the tax credit. However, after the tax credit expired, sales demand dropped sharply in May. From June through August, our sales trend showed sequential improvement, and then we began experiencing a normal, seasonal slowdown in September and October. 
Overall, housing demand is weak. Even with significant fluctuations in the level of demand for our homes in fiscal 2010, our approach was very consistent. Manage our homes and inventory to current demand generate cash, reduce debt, position ourselves for profitability and maintain a strong balance sheet to be positioned to take advantage of opportunities.
As we look to fiscal 2011, we continue to be realistic in our expectations and will adjust our business to compete in the current market conditions. We expect another very challenging year for the homebuilding industry as a fundamental drivers of demand. The overall economy, job growth and consumer confidence are still very weak. In addition, we do not expect any stimulus in fiscal 2011 similar to the federal tax credits that were in effect last year. All of these factors make it likely that our sales and closing volumes will be below our volumes in fiscal 2010. 
However, we plan to continue to gain market share by opening new communities and adjusting our price points and product offerings due to demand we see in each of our individual markets. I want to congratulate each member of the D.R. Horton team for turning in a strong performance in fiscal 2010 despite continued difficult industry conditions. We appreciate very much your efforts.
