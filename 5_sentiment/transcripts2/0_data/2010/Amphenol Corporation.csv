I will provide some fina",1430,"Thank you. Good afternoon. My name is Diana Reardon. And I am Amphenol's CFO. I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we would like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter call.
The results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends
The Company closed 2009 with a strong fourth quarter achieving sequential growth in sales and earnings per share and exceeding the high end of the Company’s guidance. Sales were $758 million, up 6% in US Dollars and 5% in local currencies over Q3. This represents the third quarter of sequential sales growth for the Company in 2009.
Compared to last year, sales for the quarter were up slightly in US Dollars and down 2% from a local currency perspective. From an organic standpoint excluding both acquisitions and foreign exchange sales were down 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008.
Breaking down sales into our two major components our cable business which comprised 8% of our sales in the quarter was down 8% from last quarter in line with normal seasonal patterns and up about 1% from last year. The Interconnect business which comprise 92% of our sales was up slightly from last year and up 7% sequentially.
We saw sequential growth in the majority of our markets and Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income for the quarter was $138 million compared to $142 million last year. Operating margin was 18.3% compared to 18.9% last year and 17.3% last quarter. Operating income is net of stock option expense of about $5 million or 0.7% of sales in the '09 quarter compared to $4.5 million or 0.6% of sales in the '08 quarter.
From a segment perspective, in our Cable business, margins were 15.5%, up from 11.2% last year, and down from 16.1% in Q3. The margin decline from last quarter relates both to higher relative material costs and lower volume.
In the Interconnect business, margins were 20.6% compared to 21.4% last year and 19.6% in Q3. The improvement in margin over Q3 results from the combination of higher volume levels and continued aggressive management of all elements of costs.
Overall, we are extremely pleased with the Company's operating margin achievement of 18.3% in Q4, up a full 1% sequentially. This represents a conversion margin on incremental sales over Q3 of 34%.
We continue to believe that the Company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control will continue to allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner to achieve strong profitability going forward.
Interest expense for the quarter was $9.5 million compared to $10 million last year. The decrease over the prior year relates primarily to lower average interest rate in the 2009 quarter.
In the fourth quarter, the Company had an effective tax rate of 27.5% compared to a rate of 23.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008. The lower tax rate in Q4 2008 represents an accumulative adjustment to achieve a 27.5% rate for the full year 2008. From an EPS perspective, the lower tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 added $0.03 per share to the '08 results. We currently expect a tax rate of about 27.5% in the first quarter of 2010.
Net income for the quarter was $88 million, approximately, 12% of sales, a very strong performance on any industry comparative basis. Diluted earnings per share as reported was $0.50 for the 2009 quarter and $0.56 in the 2008 quarter. Both periods include one-time item.
In 2009, earnings were reduced by a $0.02 charge relating to our financing which I will talk about in a minute and in 2008 earnings were increased by $0.03 for the tax adjustment I mentioned earlier. Excluding one-time items, EPS was $0.52 in Q4 of '09 and $0.53 in Q4 of '08.
Orders for the quarter were $765 million, up 3% from Q3 and up 8% from last year resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.01 to 1.
In November the Company issued $600 million of senior notes due 2014. The notes were sold at a slight discount and carry a 4.75% coupon. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay the Company's revolving credit facility.
In conjunction with the issuance of notes the credit facility which matures in August of 2011 was amended to reduce the commitment from $1 billion to $752 million. At year-end borrowings and availability under the facility were $150 million and $602 million respectively.
The note issuance has a number of benefits for the Company including the extension of staggering of the Company's debt maturity schedule, expansion of the Company's investor base and an increase in the Company's availability and liquidity.
As mentioned earlier, in conjunction with the repayment of borrowings under the credit facility, the Company terminated certain interest swap agreements and incurred a one-time charge of approximately $0.02 per share. On the basis of the new debt structure, the Company expects Q1 interest expense to be comparable to Q4 level.
The Company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $152 million in the quarter. Cash from operations was increased by about $6 million as the Company increased the amount of receivables sold under securitization program. Excluding this impact, operating cash flow was over 160% of net income in the quarter.
Working capital reduction was a strong contributor to cash flow in the quarter with improvement in both receivable and inventory performance that I’ll talk about in a minute.
Cash flow from operations and net proceeds from the senior note offering of $594 million and proceeds and tax benefits relating to stock option exercises during the quarter of $36 million were used primarily for $17 million of capital expenditures, distributions to non-controlling interest of $18 million relating primarily to the purchase of a residual interest in a subsidiary during the quarter, acquisition-related expenditures of $7 million and $638 million of repayments under the Company's revolving credit facility.
In addition, short-term investments increased by $19 million and cash and cash investments increased by $77 million. In addition to its very strong operating cash flow and availability under its revolving credit facility the Company had cash and cash investments of approximately $424 million at the end of the year and has more than sufficient liquidity to meet its needs.
The Company also has a $100 million receivable securitization program that expires in May 2010 under which $82 million in receivables were sold at the end of the year. In accordance with existing accounting rules, this facility has been accounted for off balance-sheet as the sale of receivables and fees associated with the sale which were about $400,000 in Q4 have been included in other expense.
Effective January 1 of 2010, these rules have been modified by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 166 and as such in 2010, the Company will report transactions under the facility as short-term debt and the related receivables remain on the balance sheet. Fees associated with the facility will be included in interest expense. The Company's credit ratios and ratings have always treated the facility as debt and are therefore not affected by this accounting change.
During the quarter the Company continued its very strong focus on balance sheet performance and this contributed quite nicely to cash flow in the quarter. Days Sales Outstanding were reduced further to 64 days compared to 72 days at the end of last year, an excellent achievement for a global company.
In addition, inventory was held relatively flat in the quarter from Q3 levels and inventory days decreased to 80 days from 83 days at the end of September and 89 days at the end of last year. We are certainly very pleased with this achievement.
Debt at the end of the year was $753 million, down from $792 million at the end of September and net debt was under $370 million at the end of the year. If the receivables facility were included in debt at the end of 2009, debt would have been $835 million and net debt would have been $450 million at the end of the year.
The Company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1.3 times and 15.6 times respectively. And EBITDA in the quarter was approximately $173 million. Certainly from a financial perspective, we continue to be very pleased with the strength and consistency of the Company's performance.
Adam will now provide an overview of the business.

And I would like to also extend my welcome to all of you on the phone and hopefully it’s not too late to also wish all of you a Happy New Year here in January of 2010. We appreciate your joining the call. Today, I would like to first highlight the fourth quarter and 2009 full year some of our achievements, I will then discuss the trends and progress in our served markets and then finally, I will take a few moments to comment on our outlook going into the first quarter of 2010.
Relative to the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter was an excellent quarter for Amphenol as we continue to take advantage of a market environment that is recovering in many segments. Revenues were essentially flat to prior year and we increased sales sequentially by 6% representing the third consecutive quarter of sequential growth in both sales and income for Amphenol.
We were especially pleased to further expand our already strong operating margins to 18.3% as well to generate excellent cash flow of $152 million. Both of these are a reflection of the strength and discipline of our agile organization and the entrepreneurial management team that Diana mentioned.
For the full year of 2009, despite the impact of the global economic crisis, we are very proud of our strong results. For 2009, we achieved $2,820 billion of revenues. We achieved operating margins of 17.3%. And we achieved earnings per share of $1.85. Net of the expense related to the bond offering.
At the beginning of the downturn, early in 2009 and actually at the end of 2008 our team reacted quickly to adjust costs in face of the sudden reduction in demand thereby ensuring that we could preserve strong operating margins and continue to generate strong cash flow.
We continued at that same time to focus on technology innovation and customer support resulting in Amphenol strengthening our position across all of our end markets. In particular, even with the economic slow down the proliferation of electronics in all applications continued, driving more demand for our leading interconnect technology.
The continued efforts at diversification enabled Amphenol to further expand our market position into new markets, into new customers within those markets and into new applications within those existing customers. We believe that we’ve created a strong platform as we close 2009, which creates then optimism for the future.
Now relative to the trends and progress in our served markets, we are very pleased to return to year-over-year growth in several of those markets and to achieve sequential growth from the third quarter in most of those segments.
First, the Military Aerospace market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market increased by 4% from prior year with declines in sales related to the commercial aircraft segment more than offset by strength in military vehicles and communication systems as well as acquisition related gain. We’re especially pleased to experience 7% sequential growth in that aerospace market.
While trends in the commercial air and European military spending remain uncertain we have continued to see strengthening in orders throughout the quarter related to our North American military programs.
We are optimistic that our broad program participation together with the increasing electronic content and military equipment will drive performance despite any potential shift in government defense funding priorities. We expect demand in the Military Aerospace market to strengthen somewhat in the first quarter and look forward to a strong long-term outlook for that market.
The industrial market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market decreased 20% from prior year, but increased 12% from the third quarter, the first quarter of sequential improvement in the industrial market since the second quarter of 2008.
We are very pleased to see improvement in many segments of the industrial market including transportation, alternative and traditional energy generation, rail mass transit and the medical market. While it remains too soon to predict the degree of any full recovery in the industrial market we do expect further improvement in the first quarter and are optimistic that our efforts in these growth segments will build momentum into the future.
The automotive market represented 7% of our sales in the fourth quarter. Sales increased a very strong 51% from prior year and did not experience the expected seasonal downturn in the fourth quarter, instead growing 13% sequentially.
We have now experienced three consecutive quarters of increased vehicle production volumes due in part to government incentive program as well as inventory replenishment due to greater consumer demand.
We expect demand in the automotive markets to moderate in the first quarter yet remain very encouraged by the longer-term outlook due to increased electronics in cars, our strong position in new hybrid electric vehicle platforms as well as expanding opportunities in Asia.
The broadband market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market increased 3% from the prior year but declined seasonally 5% from the third quarter as expected. We expect this market to moderate in the first quarter and continue especially to be mindful of pricing dynamics as we've begun to see some reduction in discipline among the participants in the broadband cable market.
We are especially encouraged, however, by our ongoing development of new cable and Interconnect products for the broadband market, which we believe positions us very well for the future. The Information Technology and Datacom Communications market represented 23% of our sales in the market.
Sales were up slightly from prior year and we were very pleased to see continued strong momentum across the IT market with sales increasing 18% from the third quarter. In particular, we experienced in the fourth quarter strengthening demand for high speed and power products used in servers as well as enterprise storage and networking equipment.
While we expect demand to be stable in the first quarter we remain very excited by our ongoing new program wins with our new advanced technologies, which position us for continued expansion of our market position in the IT industry.
The mobile networks market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter. While sales decreased 6% from prior year the mobile networks market strengthened as expected in the fourth quarter, growing 5% sequentially. Our strong relationships with OEM customers and wireless operators positions us very well for future phases of network build-out, including importantly in emerging markets.
We expect demand to seasonally moderate in the first quarter. Longer-term, however, we believe we will benefit from our design-ins on new base station models, which are accelerating with the increasing data demand that new devices are imposing on the networks globally. In addition, we continued to diversify our business geographically, creating new platforms for growth in the wireless infrastructure market.
The mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market decreased 2% from prior year and 8% sequentially, unexpected seasonality. We expect further seasonal moderation of the global market demand in the first quarter. However, we continue to strengthen our position in expanding smartphone applications.
Our comprehensive portfolio of products for mobile devices as well as our preferred supplier relationships with all major device makers, positions us very strongly for the future.
In summary, I am very proud of our organization as we have continued to execute in the fourth quarter and to close 2009 very well in a dynamic demand environment. While 2009 no doubt was a very challenging year it’s very rewarding that we have sustained our long-term industry leading performance and strong profitability through capitalizing on our distinct competitive advantages.
Those are our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets, our worldwide presence, our lean and flexible cost structure, and most importantly, an agile, entrepreneurial management team who has a true passion for performance.
Now looking forward to the first quarter of 2010 and based on constant exchange rates as well as the return to normal seasonal pattern. We now expect in the first quarter the following outlook. We expect sales to be in a range of $735 million to $750 million. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.51.
Regardless of the size and the scale of the economic recovery, we are very confident in the ability of our outstanding organization to achieve superior performance and to capitalize on the many opportunities to expand our market position and very importantly, our profitability. With that operator, we would be very happy to entertain any questions that they may have.

There is a portion of that, about a third of that that perhaps you would prefer to as a structural change, which really just has to do with slightly higher stock option expense and some higher amortization in the non-cash charge that relates to some of the acquisitions that we did.
But I would say that the majority of the difference has I would say more to do with the fact that as we did take SG&A down in 2009 in response to lower sales levels we intentionally maintained a certain higher level of spending in areas like R&D and certain sales areas on certain important technologies that we view as high growth as we look out in 2010 and beyond.
And so while we did take SG&A down I think 5% or 6% on a year-over-year basis it does still when you look at Q4 to Q4 last year show us a slightly higher level and I think that’s probably the most significant change. Having said that we are certainly extremely pleased to have achieved 18.3% ROS in the fourth quarter and feel extremely good about the conversion margin from a sequential standpoint, which was 34% or so and is in excess of our goal of 25%. So I think that we from an overall profitability standpoint that we're in a very good place here to support good profitable growth and margin expansion in the future.

Certainly, there are certain areas in R&D and in selling that are variable with sales and need to be adjusted both up and down and then there are certain other elements of SG&A that we would like to keep pretty fixed.

If I just mention the Internet market, for example, where we’ve seen very strong growth, we continued to see excellent underlying drivers of strength there. The expansion of data demand, the acceleration of things like video on the Internet and other real data demand drivers.
In the aerospace market, we also see that proliferation of electronics that comes. We see it also in the mobile phone market where the smartphone expansion that continues to accelerate where Amphenol has excellent penetration across those platforms.

And we’ve just started to see some signs where maybe that discipline of other participants is not as strong as it was in the past. It’s not something that we raise alarm bells about, but rather it’s something that we stay very mindful of.
And we’re very fortunate that we have taken a lot of steps over the last several years to reduce our costs and remain competitive in that market where we have also excellent position with new technologies and new value add products. But relative to the cable portion of that where we see certainly there are a limited number of competition, we will watch very carefully how that pricing goes and we will be responsive if need be.

And that it’s a little bit different from what we’re hearing from other suppliers and semiconductors and components that continue to see a little bit better than seasonal strength. Does that have something to do with the fact that your lead times are still in good shape and customers don't have to sort of look out and maybe double order or book out further so your visibility perhaps is not as strong?

Relative to interest expense we would expect interest expense not to be all that different than it was in Q4 with the one exception that the fees on the receivables program, which in 2009, were included in other expense will now be included in interest expense under the new accounting rules.

We certainly have in the past gone through time periods where China has waxed and waned in terms of the cost and inflation. And currently it does seem that there may be some more degree of inflation in China. This is really not a different phenomenon that we’ve faced in the past especially in 2007 when you may recall that there were quite significant increases then in the minimum wage in China.
I think what we will do this year is really from the same playbook as we adopted that year, which is to hold our general manager on the ground accountable for an operating income line. And what that means is they will find other ways. So whether that is moving to other locations in China, implementing semi-automation in some of the facilities in China as well going to new location we continue to expand in other locations, now having four facilities in Africa, having three facilities in India, so China is not the only answer for Amphenol and we will continue on this kind of unending quest for low cost. At the same time, China is a very important market for us. So I'm very pleased with the diversification that we have in China.
We’ve 22 factories today in China, not on any one location, but rather dispersed around the country so that in the event there is a kind of locality where there is some issue to the total of Amphenol, that won’t be a material impact. And so that diversification that we have within China is also really a tremendous asset that we have as we face potential inflationary pressures around that country. Those factors include really in every region in China. So I'm very comfortable to see that even if we see some input prices or some input costs going up in China that we will be able to manage that as we have in the past.

We see great success with all of the smartphone makers with a real breadth of product offering. So there is not one product in particular that I would point to and say that only benefits from smartphones rather our entire portfolio of products does benefit from smartphones.
I think what is great about smartphones as well is that these are higher cost items that are sold to sometimes more discerning customers that the attention of the customer to a quality technology is maybe even more focused than it would be on the low-end phones. And that really plays very strongly into Amphenol's advantage of having a very high technology solution at the same time as we can have cost competitiveness from our very low cost base that we have in that market.

I think we went into 2009 when the recession and so forth started both from receivables and an inventory perspective with slightly higher ratios than we would have liked.

I think from an inventory perspective I would believe that we would be able to maintain, we’re around 80 days and I would think that, that would be a good estimate for what we would be able to do next year.
From a receivables perspective of 64 days, which we achieved at the end of this quarter is probably one of the best results I think that we’ve had and if I was going to model 2010, I probably would use a range that would be 65 to 67 type of days, which I think would still be certainly a great performance given the global nature of the business. And I think that from a cash flow perspective we would still expect to achieve certainly a very strong cash flow in 2010.

I think relative to automotive and then the first quarter we do expect this just to be slightly down, which is really from our perspective seasonality. In that market we did not actually expect it to be up in the fourth quarter and that continues to be a very resilient growth return for that market, which up 51% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, certainly from low numbers in the year prior, but that is still very fantastic performance for that market. And we would expect this to be in a more normal phase now going into the first quarter. Relative to Times Microwave, which we acquired about nine months ago now, that has been an outstanding acquisition for Amphenol.
And you mentioned the cross-selling. Certainly with acquisitions that we always look for opportunities to bring the technologies of that new Company, new family member as it were into the existing customer relationships that we have and vice versa. And I can tell you that with Times Microwave we have already seen good success there in really having a response from our major customers that say, now we see with Amphenol really the complete offering, which includes now this RF technology for the military. RF technology in the military is an area of really expansion potential.
If you look at all the new equipment whether that be vehicles, aeroplanes, boats, whatever that is that all of these equipment are now being fitted with detection devices whether it be IED detection with new radar system so that the amount of RF content in a system today is much greater than it was ten years ago. And certainly in the military you don’t always see moves happening in one quarter or two quarter, but we have certainly seen signs of real response from our customer that this can be a tremendous addition to the Amphenol family.

I mean certainly they reduced their inventories over the last year. And so our sale into distribution was certainly suffered during that time period. And I can tell you that in the fourth quarter our sales into distribution were strengthening by quite a large margin from what we had seen in the past.
Now what did that represent as a percent of the total growth in the aerospace, which grew sequentially by 7%? I couldn’t tell you exactly what that is with granularity, but certainly it was a component of that growth. Now, going forward are they going to build back inventory to the levels that they had one year ago? I wouldn’t personally think that they will. What I do think is that the distributors are adopting a policy where they say that we will service the business and we will continue to try to service the business that we see, but we won’t necessarily fill our coffers with inventory in the Military Aerospace. So I think that that is really real demand that we have seen from them as opposed to that pullback in inventory that we saw for a number of quarters before.

We’ve seen a tremendous amount of activity in the mobile infrastructure market with the new base station platforms that have come out to satisfy high speed devices, we see a lot of innovation among smartphones, which we talked about earlier.
And those are the three areas where clearly the innovation over the last year despite this very, very severe downturn that we all had to live through has continued to accelerate as if there were no downturn and the innovation that is really being driven by user experience being improved. Whether that be a smart Internet device that you hold in your hand, whether that be having the core systems just being really clogged with data, the number of servers that are being required to support some of these Internet sites.
All of this sort of totality of data demand is driving those three markets very, very strongly regardless of the downturn. At the same time, we see it also in the aerospace industry. One, where you don't expect quick technology innovation in aerospace. But then you do now see it as the wars that are being fought are more dynamic and you have to equip soldiers with new functionalities on a much more rapid basis. All of a sudden, we start to see actually innovation in that market accelerating as well.
So, I really believe that in everyone of our markets we see great opportunities for this innovation. And our goal as a Company has always been to create an Interconnect technology that can enable the application of our customer to be better and thereby sell their products more effectively. I think that very simple technology development strategy has paid strong dividends in 2009 and creates a great platform for the future as well.

And power is a huge deal in the data center today. Becoming almost on the same par with data transfer speeds. And on the data transfer, that is another area where our high speed connectors really lead the industry in providing a total solution. And what Amphenol can offer into these integrated systems more than almost any other supplier can do is a modeling of the end-to-end Interconnect system that our engineers can provide through our integrated approach to that system where that is something that creates a tremendous value for our customers if they are creating an integrated system.

I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter call. The results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends.The company closed 2009 with a strong fourth quarter, achieving sequential growth in sales and earnings per share, and exceeding the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were $758 million, up 6% in U.S. dollars and 5% in local currencies over Q3. This represents the third quarter of sequential sales growth for the company in 2009. Compared to last year, sales for the quarter were up slightly in U.S. dollars, and down 2% from a local currency perspective. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and foreign exchange, sales were down 7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Breaking down sales into our two major components: Our Cable business, which comprised 8% of our sales in the quarter, was down 8% from last quarter, in line with normal seasonal patterns, and up about 1% from last year; the Interconnect business, which comprised 92% of our sales, was up slightly from last year, and up 7% sequentially. We saw sequential growth in the majority of our markets, and Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.Operating income for the quarter was $138 million, compared to $142 million last year. Operating margin was 18.3%, compared to 18.9% last year and 17.3% last quarter. Operating income is net of stock option expense of about $5 million or 0.7% of shares in the '09 quarter, compared to $4.5 million or 0.6% of sales in the '08 quarter.From a segment perspective, in our Cable business, margins were 15.5%, up from 11.2% last year and down from 16.1% in Q3. The margin decline from last quarter relates both to higher relative material costs and lower volume.In the Interconnect business, margins were 20.6%, compared to 21.4% last year and 19.6% in Q3. The improvement in margin over Q3 results from the combination of higher volume levels and continued aggressive management of all elements of cost.Overall, we're extremely pleased with the company's operating margin achievement of 18.3% in Q4, up a full 1% sequentially. This represents the conversion margin on incremental sales over Q3 of 34%. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and cultured cost control will continue to allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner to achieve strong profitability, going forward.Interest expense for the quarter was $9.5 million, compared to $10 million last year. The decrease over the prior year relates primarily to lower average interest rates in the 2009 quarter. In the fourth quarter, the company had an effective tax rate of 27 1/2%, compared to a rate of 23.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008. The lower tax rate in Q4 2008 represents accumulative adjustment to achieve a 27 1/2% rate for the full year 2008. From an EPS perspective, the lower tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 added $0.03 per share to the '08 results. We currently expect a tax rate of about 27 1/2% in the first quarter of 2010. Net income for the quarter was $88 million, approximately 12% of sales, a very strong performance on any industry-comparative basis. Diluted earnings per share, as reported, was $0.50 for the 2009 quarter and $0.56 in the 2008 quarter, both periods include one-time items. In 2009, earnings were reduced by a $0.02 charge, relating to our refinancing, which I'll talk about in a minute. And in 2008, earnings were increased by $0.03 for the tax adjustment I mentioned earlier. Excluding one-time items, EPS was $0.52 in Q4 of '09 and $0.53 in Q4 of '08. Orders for the quarter were $765 million, up 3% from Q3, and up 8% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.01:1. In November, the company issued $600 million of senior notes due 2014. The notes were sold at a slight discount and carry a 4.75% coupon. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay the company's revolving credit facility. In conjunction with the issuance of notes, the credit facility, which matures in August of 2011, was amended to reduce the commitment from $1 billion to $752 million. At year end, borrowings and availability under the facility were $150 million and $602 million, respectively. The note issuance has a number of benefits for the company, including the extension of staggering of the company's debt maturity schedule, expansion of the company's investor base and an increase in the company's availability and liquidity.As mentioned earlier, in conjunction with the repayment of borrowings under the credit facility, the company terminated certain interest swap agreements and incurred a one-time charge of approximately $0.02 per share. On the basis of the new debt structure, the company expects Q1 interest expense to be comparable to Q4 level.The company continues be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $152 million in the quarter. Cash from operations was increased by about $6 million, as the company increased the amount of receivables sold under its securitization program. Excluding this impact, operating cash flow was over 160% of net income in the quarter. Working capital reduction was a strong contributor to cash flow in the quarter, with improvement in both receivable and inventory performance that I'll talk about in a minute.Cash flow from operations and net proceeds from the senior note offering of $594 million and proceeds in tax benefits relating to stock option exercises during the quarter of $36 million were used primarily for $17 million of capital expenditures; distributions to non-controlling interest of $18 million, relating primarily to the purchase of a residual interest in the subsidiary during the quarter; acquisition-related expenditures of $7 million and $638 million of repayments under the company's revolving credit facility. In addition, short-term investments increased by $19 million, and cash and cash investments increased by $77 million. In addition to its very strong operating cash flow and availability under its revolving credit facility, the company had cash and cash investments of approximately $424 million at the end of the year and has more than sufficient liquidity to meet its needs. The company also has a $100 million receivable securitization program that expires in May 2010, under which $82 million in receivables were sold at the end of the year. In accordance with existing accounting rules, this facility has been accounted for off balance sheet as a sale of receivables and fees associated with the sale, which were about $400,000 in Q4, have been included in other expense.Effective January 1, 2010, these rules have been modified by statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 166. And as such, in 2010, the company will report transactions under the facility as short-term debt, and the related receivables will remain on the balance sheet. Fees associated with the facility will be included in interest expense.  The company's credit ratios and ratings have always treated the facility as debt, and are therefore, not affected by this accounting change.During the quarter, the company continued its very strong focus on balance sheet performance, and this contributed quite nicely to cash flow in the quarter. Day sales outstanding were reduced further to 64 days, compared to 72 days at the end of last year, an excellent achievement for a global company. In addition, inventory was held relatively flat in the quarter from Q3 levels, and inventory days decreased to 80 days from 83 days at the end of September, and 89 days at the end of last year. We're certainly very pleased with this achievement.Debt, at the end of the year, was $753 million, down from $792 million at the end of September. And net debt was under $370 million at the end of the year. If the receivables facility weren't included in debt at the end of 2009, debt would have been $835 million and net debt would have been $450 million at the end of the year. The company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1.3x and 15.6x, respectively. And EBITDA in the quarter was approximately $173 million.

We appreciate you joining the call. Today, I would",1424,"Well, thank you very much, Diana. And I would like to also extend my welcome to all of you on the phone. And hopefully, it's not too late to also wish all of you a happy new year here in January of  2010. We appreciate you joining the call. Today, I would like to first highlight the fourth quarter and 2009 full year of some of our achievements. I'll then discuss the trends and progress in our served markets. And then finally, I'll take a few moments to comment on our outlook going into the first quarter of 2010.Relative to the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter was an excellent quarter for Amphenol, as we continue to take advantage of a market environment that is recovering in many segment. Revenues were essentially flat to prior year, and we increased sales sequentially by 6%, representing the third consecutive quarter of sequential growth in both sales and income for Amphenol. We were especially pleased to further expand our already strong operating margins to 18.3%, as well as to generate excellent cash flow of $152 million. Both of these are reflection of the strength and discipline of our agile organization and the entrepreneurial management team that Diana mentioned.For the full year of 2009, despite the impact of the global economic crisis, we are very proud of our strong results. For 2009, we achieved $2,820,000,000 of revenue, we achieved operating margins of 17.3% and we achieved earnings per share of $1.85, net of the expense related to the bond offering. At the beginning of the downturn, early in 2009 and actually at the end of 2008, our team reacted quickly to adjust costs in face of the sudden reduction in demand. Thereby, ensuring that we could preserve strong operating margins and continue to generate strong cash flow. We continued, at that same time, to focus on technology innovation and customer support, resulting in Amphenol strengthening our position across all of our end market. In particular, even with the economic slowdown, the proliferation of electronics in all applications continued, driving more demand for our leading interconnect technologies.The continued efforts of diversification enabled Amphenol to further expand our market position into new markets, into new customers within those markets and into new applications within those existing customers. We believe that we have created a strong platform as we close 2009, which creates then optimism for the future.Now relative to the trends and progress in our  served markets, we are very pleased to return to year-over-year growth in several of those markets and to achieve sequential growth from the third quarter in most of those segments. First, the military/aerospace market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market increased by 4% from prior year, with declines in sales related to the Commercial Aircraft segment more than offset by strength in military vehicles and communication systems, as well as acquisition-related gains. We were especially pleased to experience 7% sequential growth in that aerospace market. While trends in the commercial air and European military spending remain uncertain, we have continued to see strengthening in orders throughout the quarter related to our North American military program. And we are optimistic that our broad program participation, together with the increasing electronic content in military equipment, will drive performance despite any potential shift in government defense funding priorities. We expect demand in the military/aerospace market to strengthen somewhat in the first quarter, and look forward to a strong long-term outlook for that market.The industrial market represented 9% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market decreased 20% from prior year, but increased 12% from the third quarter, the first quarter of sequential improvement in the industrial market since the second quarter of 2008. We are very pleased to see improvement in many segments of the industrial market, including transportation, alternative and traditional energy generation, rail mass transit and the medical market. While it remains too soon to predict the degree of any full recovery in the industrial market, we do expect further improvement in the first quarter, and are optimistic that our efforts in these growth segments will build momentum into the future.The automotive market represented 7% of our sales in the fourth quarter. Sales increased to a very strong 51% from prior year, and did not experience the expected seasonal downturn in the fourth quarter, instead, growing 13% sequentially. We have now experienced three consecutive quarters of increased vehicle production volumes, due in part to government incentive programs, as well as inventory replenishment due to greater consumer demands. We expect demand in the automotive market to moderate in the first quarter, yet remain very encouraged by the longer-term outlook, due to increased electronics in cars, our strong position in new hybrid electric vehicle platforms, as well as expanding opportunities in Asia.The broadband market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market increased 3% from the prior year, but declined seasonally 5% from the third quarter as expected. We expect this market to moderate in the first quarter, and continue, especially to be mindful of pricing dynamics, as we have begun to see some reduction in discipline among the participants in the broadband cable market. We are especially encouraged, however, by our ongoing development of new cable and interconnect products for the broadband market, which we believe positions us very well for the future.The information technology and datacom communications market represented 23% of our sales in the market. Sales were up slightly from prior year. And we were very pleased to see continued strong momentum across the IT market, with sales increasing 18% from the third quarter. In particular, we experienced in the fourth quarter, strengthening demand for high speed and power products used in servers, as well as enterprise storage and networking equipment. While we expect demand to be stable in the first quarter, we remain very excited by our ongoing new program win with our new, advanced technologies, which position us for continued expansion of our market position in the IT industry.The mobile networks market represented 14% of our sales in the quarter. While sales decreased 6% from prior year, the mobile networks market strengthened, as expected, in the fourth quarter, growing 5% sequentially. Our strong relationships with OEM customers and wireless operators positions us very well for future phases of network buildout, including importantly in emerging markets. We expect demand to seasonally moderate in the first quarter. Longer term, however, we believe we will benefit from our design-ins on new base station models, which are accelerating with the increasing data demand that new devices are imposing on the networks globally. In addition, we continue to diversify our business geographically, creating new platforms for growth in the wireless infrastructure market.The mobile devices market represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market decreased 2% from prior year and 8% sequentially on expected seasonality. We expect further seasonal moderation of the global market demand in the first quarter. However, we continue to strengthen our position in expanding smartphone applications. Our comprehensive portfolio of products for mobile devices, as well as our preferred supplier relationships with all major device makers, positions us very strongly for the future.In summary, I am very proud of our organization, as we have continued to execute in the fourth quarter, and to close 2009 very well in a dynamic demand environment. While 2009, no doubt, was a very challenging year, it's very rewarding that we have sustained our long-term, industry-leading performance and strong profitability through capitalizing on our distinct competitive advantages. Those are our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets, our worldwide presence, our lean and flexible cost structure, and most importantly, an agile entrepreneurial management team who was a true passion for performance.  Now looking forward to the first quarter of 2010 and based on constant exchange rates, as well as a return to normal seasonal pattern, we now expect, in the first quarter, the following outlook: We expect sales to be in a range of $735 million to $750 million. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.51. Regardless of the size and the scale of the economic recovery, we are very confident in the ability of our outstanding organization to achieve superior performance, and to capitalize on the many opportunities to expand our market position, and very importantly, our profitability. With that, operator, we would be very happy to entertain any questions that they may have."

And our team around the world did just a fantastic job of executing on that. We certainly have heard of semiconductor shortages and certain things, but have not seen any material impact to our business from shortages of other components."

And there's a portion of that, about a third of that, that perhaps you would refer to as a structural change. It really just has to do with slightly higher stock option expense and some higher amortization in the non-cash charge that relates to some of the acquisitions that we did. But I would say that the majority of the difference has, I would say, more to do with the fact that as we did take SG&A down in 2009 in response to lower sales levels, we intentionally maintained a certain higher level of spending in areas like R&D and certain sales areas on certain important technologies that we view as high growth, as we look out in 2010 and beyond. And so, while we did take SG&A down, I think 5% or 6%, on a year-over-year basis, it does still, when you look at Q4 to Q4 of last year, show us a slightly higher level. And I think that's probably the most significant change. Having said that, we're certainly extremely pleased to have achieved 18.3% ROS [return on sales] in this fourth quarter. And feel extremely good about the conversion margin from a sequential standpoint, which was 34% or so, and is in excess of our goal of 25%. So I think that we, from an overall profitability standpoint, feel that we're in a very good place here to support good, profitable growth and margin expansion in the future."

But I think, in general, we would look for SG&A to grow at about half of what sales would grow at, and would look to really maximize the conversion margin through that process. Certainly, there are certain areas in R&D and in selling that are variable with sales and need to be adjusted, both up and down.

Can you talk about does that logically make sense?"

And the fourth quarter was a little bit higher than the prior quarter's largely due to just the increase in the stock price, which as you know mathematically has an impact on the value of options that are outstanding which go into the diluted weighted average share calculation. Relative to interest expense, we would expect interest expense not to be all that different than it was in Q4. With the one exception that the fees and the receivable program, which in 2009 were included in other expense, will not be included in interest expense under the new accounting rule. And so this $400,000 or so a quarter that will move from other expense up to interest expense. But if you make that adjustment in Q '09, I think that the first quarter of 2010 would be about the same."

And currently, it does seem that there maybe some more degree of inflation in China. This is really not a different phenomenon than we've faced in the past especially in 2007 when you may recall that there were quite significant increases then in the minimum wage in China. I think what we will do this year is really from the same playbook as we adopted that year, which is to hold our general manager on the ground, accountable for an operating income line. And what that means is they will find other ways. So whether that is moving to other locations in China, implementing semi-automation in some of the facilities in China, as well as going to new location. We continue to expand in other locations. Now having four facilities in Africa, having three facilities in India. So China is not the only answer for Amphenol and we will continue on this kind of unending quest for low cost. At the same time, China is a very important market for us and so I'm very pleased with the diversification that we have in China. We have 22 factories today in China, not on any one location, but rather dispersed around the country. So that in the event there is a kind of a locality, where there is some issue to the total of Amphenol that won't be a material impact. And so that diversification that we have within China is also really a tremendous asset that we have as we face potential inflationary pressures around that country. And those factories include really in every region in China, so I am very comfortable, Steve, that even if we see some input prices or some input costs going up in China that we'll be able to manage that as we have in the past."

So there's not one product in particular that I would point to and say, ""That only benefits from smartphones,"" rather our entire portfolio of products does benefit from smartphones. I think what is great about smartphones as well is that since these are higher cost items that are sold to sometimes more discerning customer, that the attention of the customer to a quality technology is maybe even more focused than it would be on the low end phone.

RF technology in the military is an area of really expansion potential. If you look at all the new equipment, whether that be vehicles, airplanes, boats, wherever that is, all of these equipment are now being fitted with detection devices, whether it be IED detection with new radar system. So that the amount of RF content in the system today is much greater than it was 10 years ago.

And all of those are areas where our devices and our Interconnect products can enable further functionality of those products. Whether it be a more efficient power consumption, and power is a huge deal in the data center today. It's becoming almost on the same par with data transfer speeds. And on the data transfer, that is another area where our high-speed connectors really lead the industry in providing a total solution. And what Amphenol can offer into these integrated systems more than almost any other supplier can do is a modeling of the end-to-end Interconnect system that our engineers can provide through our sort of integrated approach to that system where that is something that creates a tremendous value for our customer, if they're creating an integrated system."

I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter call. Q1 results were released this morning.  I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company had a strong first quarter, achieving sequential growth in sales and earnings per share and exceeding the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were $771 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies over the fourth quarter of 2009, a strong performance in a normally seasonally softer quarter. Compared to last year, sales for the quarter were up 17% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currencies. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency effects, sales in the first quarter 2010 were up 11% over last year.
Breaking down sales into our two major components: Our cable business, which comprised 9% of our sales in the quarter, was up 16% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currencies over last year and up about 7% from last quarter. Sales grew in all regions.
The interconnect business, which comprised 91% of our sales, was up 17% from last year and 1% sequentially. We continue to see strengthening demand in the majority of our markets. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income for the quarter was $145 million. Operating margin was 18.8%, compared to 16.8% last year and 18.3% last quarter. Operating income is net of stock option expense of approximately $5.4 million this year and $4.8 million last quarter. This is about 0.7% percent of sales both in Q1 2010 and Q1 2009. 
From a segment perspective, in the cable segment, margins were 14.9%, up from 13.5% last year and down from 15.5% last quarter. The margin decline from last quarter relates to both higher relative material costs and the impact of price reductions.
In the interconnect business, margins were 21.1%, compared to 19.3% last year and 20.6% last quarter. The improvement in margin reflects the benefits of proactive and aggressive cost control as volumes begin to ramp back up. Overall, we are extremely pleased with the company's operating margin achievement of 18.8%. This represents the conversion margin on incremental sales over Q1 2009 of 31%. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and cultured cost control will allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner to achieve strong operating leverage and profitability going forward.
Interest expense for the quarter was $10 million, compared to $9 million last year. The increase over the prior year relates primarily to the inclusion in interest expense of fees on the company's receivable securitization program in accordance with the adoption of new accounting rules effective at the beginning of the year. In 2009, these fees, which totaled approximately $400,000, were included in other expense. The remaining increase in interest expense is due to higher average interest rates in the 2010 quarter.
In the first quarter, the company had an effective tax rate of 26.1%, compared to a rate of 24.1% in the first quarter of 2009. Both years reflect the benefit of reductions in tax reserve amounts relating primarily to the completion of prior-year audits. From an EPS perspective, the lower tax rate added $0.01 per share in the 2010 quarter and $0.02 per share in the 2009 quarter. Excluding these adjustments, the effective tax rate is approximately 27.5% and we currently expect the same rate in the second quarter of 2010. Net income was $98 million in the quarter, approximately 13% of sales, a very strong performance. Diluted earnings per share as reported was $0.56 in the 2010 quarter and $0.43 in the 2009 quarter. Excluding tax adjustments in both quarters, earnings per share grew 34% to $0.55 in the first quarter of 2010. Orders for the quarter were $829 million, up 8% sequentially and 31% from last year, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.08:1 in the quarter.
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash in all cycles. Cash flow from operations of $114 million in Q1 or 114% of net income in the quarter. Cash flow from operations, along with proceeds and related tax benefits from option exercises of about $4 million, was used primarily for capital expenditures of $19 million, acquisition-related expenditures of $3 million, dividend payments of $3 million, a $33 million reduction in debt and an $8 million increase in short-term investments. In addition, cash and cash investments increased by $47 million in the quarter. In addition to the very strong operating cash flow and $602 million of availability under the company's revolving credit facility, the company had cash and cash investments that exceeded $430 million at the end of the quarter. The company has more than sufficient liquidity to meet its needs. The company also has a $100 million receivable securitization program that the company plans to renew at its expiration in May. 
In accordance with previous accounting rules that this facility was accounted for off-balance sheet as the sale of receivables, effective January 1, 2010, those rules have been changed, bringing the facility on balance sheet. And at the end of March, borrowings under the facility were $49 million and are reflected as short-term debt. At the end of December, approximately $82 million of receivables were sold under the facility and, under the previous accounting rules, were excluded from the balance sheet. The company's credit ratios and ratings have always treated the facility as debt and are therefore not affected by this accounting change.
The company continued its strong focus on working capital management in the quarter. Day sales outstanding were 66 days, compared to 64 days at the end of December, up two days and within the normal range for the company. The increase of two days at the end of March reflects the heavy weighting of March sales in the quarter. In addition, inventory in the quarter increased two days to 82 days at the end of March from 80 days at the end of December. The increase in days relates primarily to inventory preparation for a sequentially stronger Q2. 
Debt was $802 million at the end of March, compared to $753 million at the end of December as reported, and $835 million if adjusted for the classification change from our receivable securitization program. Debt was therefore down $33 million in the quarter. Net debt was $370 million at the end of the quarter, compared to $450 million at the end of December on a restated basis. 
The company's leveraged and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1.23x and 14.7x respectively, and EBITDA for the quarter was approximately $176 million. From a financial perspective, we're certainly very pleased with the strength of the company's performance in the quarter. Adam will now provide an overview of the business."

I plan to spend a few moments to highlight for you our first quarter achievements, discuss several of the trends and progress in our served markets, and then comment on our outlook for the second quarter of 2010. We'll then have time at the end for some questions and answers.
The third quarter was a very strong start to 2010 for Amphenol as we returned to our first quarter 2008 revenue level by capitalizing on an improving demand environment to further expand our position in our end markets. Revenues in the quarter increased 17% from prior year and 2% sequentially in what is typically a seasonally lower quarter, representing our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential growth. 
We are particularly encouraged by the strong order levels that Diana discussed with book-to-bill of 1.08:1. We were also especially pleased to achieve strong operating leverage on our incremental sales in the quarter, leading to further expansion of our already strong operating margins to 18.8%. And as Diana mentioned, we continue to generate excellent cash flow of $114 million in the quarter. These results are all a direct reflection of the strength and discipline of our agile organization and our entrepreneurial management team.
That cash flow that we spoke about also allowed us in early April to complete the acquisition of a Taiwan- and China-based manufacturer of specialized industrial interconnect with annual sales of approximately $25 million. This exciting acquisition expands our already leading position in harsh environment interconnect for a diverse range of industrial application, including, in particular, lighting and alternative energy applications. This acquisition is very consistent with our ongoing strategy to find complementary companies who have strong management, leading technology, all with an excellent market presence in their particular markets. We are very optimistic that our continuing acquisition program will create value for Amphenol in the future.
Now I'd like to turn to discuss some of the trends and progress in our served markets. In general, we are very pleased that our ongoing strategy of diversification enabled us to not only achieve strong year-over-year growth, but as I mentioned, to return back to our first quarter of 2008 levels, which we believe is a significant accomplishment. 
The military and aerospace market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market increased 7% from prior year with continued strength in military avionics, ground vehicle and communications programs. Our ongoing leadership in all interconnect technologies related to these and other expanding segments of the Mil-Aero market has positioned us well for important new programs and upgrades that are planned around the world. 
In addition, our leading position in interconnect for commercial air applications will serve us well as that market begins to recover. We expect demand to further strengthen in the second quarter and look forward to a strong long-term outlook for the military/aerospace market, as electronics continue to proliferate in all categories of military equipment.
The industrial market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased 17% from prior year and increased a strong 17% as well from the fourth quarter. This is the second straight quarter of double-digit sequential improvement in our industrial market. 
We have benefited from a recovery in many segments of the industrial market, including a specialty in medical-, rail- and transportation-related applications, as well as from our strategic focus on new products for alternative energy applications. We are especially encouraged by a strengthening that we have seen in the distribution channel for industrial, where we have not yet significant inventory restocking, but rather have seen full sell-through to in-customers. We expect further improvement in the second quarter for the industrial market and are optimistic that our efforts in the growth segment of this market will continue to build momentum in the future.
The automotive market represented for us 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased a very strong 64% from prior year as vehicle volumes normalized following the significant declines experienced in 2009. No question that the last 18 months have been thrilling in what is our smallest in-market. 
Beyond the widely reported recovery in the worldwide automotive market, we are excited by our participation in the beginning ramp ups of new hybrid vehicle platforms. In addition, our long-term outlook for this market remains very positive, with the general increase of electronics and cars, combined with expanded opportunities in Asia and other less-developed regions.
The broadband communication market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market increased 19% from prior year and strengthened seasonally from the fourth quarter. We expect this market to further strengthen in the second quarter as we move into what is typically a more robust build-out period. And we look forward to new opportunities for growth. They are being created by our ongoing development of new cable and interconnect products for the broadband market, which positions us very well for the future.
The information technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were up a very strong 45% from prior year, with demand improving across essentially all segments of the information-technology market. Our customers have experienced a significant increase in demand due, in part, to pent-up enterprise IT investments, but more importantly, resulting from demand for equipment to support the acceleration of data-rich traffic that is being driven by the recent growth of online video and mobile internet devices. We are very excited about the opportunities that are arising from these important trends. Demand in this market has increased especially for our high-speed and power products that are used in servers, enterprise storage and networking equipment. We expect further strengthening in the IT market of demand in the second quarter, driven by market expansion and our program wins with our new advanced technologies, all of which position us for continued expansion in this market.
The mobile networks market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter. While sales in this market decreased 3% from prior year, the mobile networks market strengthened sequentially for the second straight quarter, growing 9% from the fourth quarter. While there was no one-time build out comparable to the first quarter 2009 China 3G launch, we were pleased to see a sequential improvement in this market, especially related to next-generation network upgrades in developed geographies, related in part to the expansion and proliferation of new mobile internet devices. We expect demand in the mobile networks market to strengthen further in the first quarter as we benefit from our leading position on new base station platforms, as well as our broad portfolio of cell site installation products. In addition, we are very excited that our expanding geographic presence continues to create new pockets of growth in a very diverse range of emerging markets.
The mobile devices market represented for us 14% of sales in the quarter. Sales increased 3% from prior year and were down sequentially on expected seasonality. We anticipate an improvement of demand in the second quarter as device volumes improve and as we capitalize on our strong position on newly-released smart mobile devices. Our comprehensive portfolio of products for mobile devices, as well as our preferred supplier relationships with all major device makers, continues to position us strongly for the future.
In summary, with respect to the first quarter, I am tremendously proud of our organization, as we have executed extremely well in what has been a very dynamic demand environment. Our continued focus throughout all cycles of the economy, on reacting quickly to changing customer needs, while ensuring relentless focus on profitability, has resulted in the strengthening of our market position and a further expansion of our industry-leading margins. It should be clear to all that the Amphenol recipe does not change with economic cycles. Our success is a direct result of our distinct competitive advantages: Our leading technology, the increasing position with customers in diverse markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, as well as an agile entrepreneurial management team.
As we look forward, and based on the continuation of current economic trends as well as constant exchange rates, we now expect in the second quarter of 2010 the following results: We expect sales in the range of $820 million to $835 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.60 to $0.62. In this continuing economic recovery, I'm very confident in the ability of our outstanding organization to capitalize on the many opportunities to further expand both our market position and our profitability. At this time, operator, we would welcome any questions that there may be."

I think that, as you know, the cable business in particular has a very large percentage of the cost that really is raw commodity based, and copper certainly is one of the three top materials, but aluminum and actually plastics are used even a little bit more in the product. And we did, and have seen, some pressure on margins as a result of that. I think that we're still achieving pretty good margins in that business and so we are able to deal with a portion of those cost pressures. But in the interconnect side of the business, as you know, it's a very diverse product footprint and we use many materials. We actually don't procure them or even really talk about them on a consolidated business because it really isn't the way that we run or manage that part of the business. We view the material pressures as just another element that needs to be managed in the context of overall profitability goals. And I think, as you see in the first quarter, the management team did just an excellent job to create operating leverage in the business, even considering the fact that, clearly, there was some pressure from commodities or some pressure from a wage perspective in China. I mean, these things -- there's always some sort of pressure on some part of cost in any given time frame.  And I think that, as Adam had mentioned in his comments, the management team around the world is just really committed to controlling all of the rest of the cost, and I think taking a hard look also from a pricing perspective.  And I think the aggregate of all of that is the good conversion margin that you've seen. So I think as we look into Q2, we don't have a concern relative to margins where commodity prices would cost us to lower our internal expectations as far as creating good operating leverage next quarter."

And I think, certainly, pricing is not a science, it's more of an art and so it's not that the second raw material price goes up, you can just walk in with a price increase. That being said, our teams are very focused on this and we have seen from some competitors around the world not necessarily always the best performance. And so when you have that, coupled with the demands that our customers have, you certainly have a more hospitable pricing environment than, for example, we would have had a year ago. So I think that there is certainly a focus on pricing, as Diana mentioned, and we will continue to drive that. 
Relative to pricing in cable, we have also been very sensitive there. And I think we mentioned a quarter ago that competition has, in certain cases, been leading prices down in that cable segment. We are, again, being very disciplined in that market while preserving our position. And I think the fact that we are able to achieve the margins that we did in the cable segment, in particular in the quarter, it is very impressive when you factor in the raw materials in that pricing environment."

But, certainly, the bookings that we have here in the first quarter, what we hear from our customers, is all very, very positive coming into the second quarter, and that gives us a good basis on which to have the guidance that we have.

There are instances where our customers are ramping up very quickly and they want to get coverage for the quick ramp ups. But I'd say, in fact, we have seen also a lot of very short order coverages, you know, customers coming to us on a very expedited fashion asking for Amphenol's help to assist them with the ramp up, whether that be to help a wireless infrastructure or to get IT equipment out. Whatever that is, we have seen actually quite an increase in the short lead-time orders, where I can tell you our company has performed just extremely well. And this is a very, very critical time period where, if you can as a corporation satisfy customers when they come and ask you for what normally would be considered an unreasonable request -- you know, ship us the parts in three weeks -- If you can do that, it can really cement that relationship and allow you to grow your position with those customers in the long term. 
So our organization is extremely focused regardless of the lead time that is given to us by the customer to try to go give that, get the product to the customer in the time allotted. And that means really exercising our flexibility as an organization. I think we are able to do this. If you look back over 2009 and the adjustments that we made coming into the downturn, we did not go through big restructuring. We didn't go decommission factory. We flexed each of our operations. It scaled to the size of the business that those operations saw in 2009. Well, sort of like an accordion, it allows you to flex back, rather than having to go recommission tools, or reopen factories, or do all of these things that can happen to companies. Our organization managed that downturn on an individual basis at an operating unit basis, which thereupon allows us now to exercise that same flexibility on the upside. And so I think regardless of the lead times that we get from our customers, we are very pleased with the performance that we are providing to those customers and we'll continue to do so in the second quarter."

I think the question on overheating is certainly one of, is there a kind of bubble of demand? And if you just look at, for example, the IT market, which grew 45% on a year-over-year basis, certainly there is some element of pent-up demand. And if it were nothing else, it may cause one to think that that is kind of a bubble. 
However, what we have certainly seen is the data traffic that has expanded over the last 12 months has added on to the investment plans of enterprises and carriers from an IT standpoint, making us more confident that this is not actually a bubble that we see in the internet; that there is really an increase in investment requirements for companies who are managing their data centers; for carriers who are carrying their traffic, all of it really driven by this explosion of more data-rich content, whether that be through mobile devices or otherwise. And so the IT market, in particular, is one where we certainly have seen great strength and we anticipate more strength during the second quarter.  And there seemed to be real structural reasons why that strength should continue and not necessarily be just a bubble."

So maybe Adam can prepare his answers as Diana has the quick clarification question. The question for Adam, I just want to make sure, does your guidance include kind of a -- and I know you don't want to talk customers specifically because that would be inappropriate -- but there's been a lot of talk about China slowing its 3G build-out, specifically with China Telecom cutting its wireless by about 50% and China Unicom by about 55%. So maybe not talking about customer specifics, but more on a geographic region: Does your guidance include kind of the slowing or cooling off of the China there? And then secondarily, as a follow-up to that, can you help investors feel more comfortable about not signs of double ordering, especially since your book to bill is the highest point in 10 years? 
And the clarification question for Diana is, Diana, for your tax-rate guidance, you said you expect the same rate. I just wanted to make sure, was that the same rate, meaning like a 27.5%, or the same rate closer to 26% that you had given the adjustment in your taxes?"

I mean, we certainly do consider all the information that is available to us at the time we give such guidance. And we are very close to what's happening in China with all of our operations on the ground there, and we are very mindful of what's happening. I think these CAPEX numbers that come out in China have to be read a little bit carefully because CAPEX, as you know, Jim, when it starts for a network build-out, there is a higher proportion of that capital that goes into tower construction, land preparation, and what I would call sort of non-electronics. And then in the follow-on of a network, sort of an optimization stage, the electronics component of CAPEX becomes a little bit bigger. So I think I would be careful to necessarily read those sort of 50%, 35% numbers that you referred to, you know, as kind of dollar-per-dollar references to the electronics industry. But as I mentioned, I think the prior question, we have seen strength in the wireless infrastructure market, especially in developed economies. I mean, wherever there are new smart mobile devices that are creating new burdens upon the networks, there seems to follow quite quickly capital spending that drives equipment spending to our customers. And because of our unique position, participating both with OEMs as well as directly with the carriers in the mobile infrastructure market, we have a very good sense of where that is coming. And one area that I emphasized in my earlier remarks is these new geographies. In these new geographies, you know, China is no longer what I would call necessarily a new geography. Places like Africa, the Middle East, where we see real expansions in wireless, and not to mention India, which has been slower market this year, but where -- You're probably familiar over the last two weeks, they have been having what has seemed to be quite successful auctions of their 3G spectrum, and that gives optimism that, at some point, you will have in India, also with the numerous operators that are there and nearly twice the operators as you have in China, a 3G build out. 
Now relative to your question on double ordering, I think are sensitive to that. At the same time, we don't have a perfect insight into our customers' warehouses. Where we do have insight is with our distributors and distribution which represent about 15% of our total sales. We have not seen any material inventory build in the distribution channel, which you may expect to see in such a time. And that has told us, and what we have heard from our distributors, is that they really are buying product to satisfy in demand. And when we talk to customers, when I personally go out to customers, what we have heard consistently is that the customers are buying our products to satisfy real in-demand that is coming from the enterprises to consumers and the carriers of the world."

And I don't know whether we would see that this year. I think it is a little too early to tell, but there are signs maybe that you wouldn't see that. And so the normal seasonality that we would normally have in the third quarter, I think it is too early to tell, but the signs so far would tell you that there is sequential strength in those markets that would typically drive that seasonality. So maybe one could conclude that you wouldn't necessarily have that."

Certainly, there's a big portion of our sales which are what we call value add. And that has been a strategy that we have had for more than a decade, to expand our total solution offering to customers in terms of not just selling a discrete interconnect product, but rather selling an interconnect solutions. That interconnect solution ranges from anything from a cable assembly onto more sophisticated products and into antennas, as you mentioned, and J-Beam as an example selling base station antennas, which is just another extension really of an antenna being a wireless connector from our perspective. 
And so I would not certainly say that we have an intention to totally change our business model and go after different things there, but our quest to satisfy the larger building of materials and get a broader presence with our customers on their building materials for interconnect, that is an unending quest that we have. It is the core strategy across all of our organization. And when we talk about new products and new markets and new technologies, there is a tremendous opportunity still remaining within interconnect. As we look across all of the new applications that are there, the new smart devices, smart mobile devices, alternative energy, and the new military applications that are there, we see just tremendous opportunity in those markets that we occupy. And bear in mind, even with the strong performance that we have, we do not have 100% of the interconnect market, far from it. And so we see those tremendous opportunities that all come along with this proliferation of electronics. And the proliferation of electronics is something that impacts all of the markets that we have discussed here. You see this just across the board, whether that be in a jet plane, whether that be in a car, whether that be in a data center, whether that be in your hand in the mobile device. All of these have new electronic functionalities, which are driving new applications and demand for new technologies from us, new interconnect technologies.  So there is plenty of room for us to continue to drive that diversification strategy, without having to kind of stretch into something that is neither attractive to us nor known by us at this stage."

I mean, let's just think about what the business has been through in the last 12 months here. I mean, we don't -- it was just a very significant build up in volume through 2008, and then a significant reduction in volume in 2009. And it's clear, as we managed through that -- And I think that the management team did a fantastic job to achieve, in all of those quarters, excellent profitability levels given the challenges that they had to deal with -- I think that we certainly did make the decision not to cut out all of the resources that we had put in place in mid-2008 when we were really on a different trajectory from a sales perspective. So in the interconnect business, we do carry some expenses related to new product development and front-end costs that we felt made sense to keep in place during the recession in 2009. I think we've achieved excellent conversion margins in the first quarter, and the management team worked very hard to achieve that. I think we'll see good conversion margins as we continue to grow. I think the operating leverage in the business will continue to come through. And I think the differences that you mentioned will become much smaller as we grow from a top-line perspective and give the same attention to detail on costs that will allow us to, I think, get back to those types of profitability levels in the future."

I am here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO and we'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter call. Q1 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company had a strong first quarter achieving sequential growth in sales and earnings per share and exceeding the high-end of the company's guidance. Sales were $771 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies over the fourth quarter of 2009. A strong performance in a normally seasonally softer quarter.
Compared to last year, sales for the quarter were up 17% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currencies. From an organic standpoint excluding both acquisitions and currency effects, sales in the first quarter 2010 were up 11% over last year.
Breaking down sales into our two major components, our cable business which comprised 9% of our sales in the quarter was up 16% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currencies over last year and up about 7% from last quarter. Sales grew in all re regions.
The Interconnect business which comprised 91% of our sales was up 17% from last year and 1% sequentially. We continue to see strengthening demand in the majority of our markets. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income for the quarter was $145 million. Operating margin was 18.8% compared to 16.8% last year and 18.3 last quarter. Operating income is net of stock option expense of approximately $5.4 million this year and 4.8 million last quarter.
This is about 0.7% of sales both in Q1 2010 and Q1 2009. From a segment perspective, in the cable segment margins were 14.9%, up from 13.5% last year and down from 15.5% last quarter. The margin decline from last quarter relates to both higher relative material costs and the impact of price reductions.
In the Interconnect business, margins were 21.1%, compared to 19.3% last year and 20.6% last quarter. The improvement in margin reflects the benefits of proactive and aggressive cost control as volumes begin to ramp back up.
Overall, we're extremely pleased with the company's operating margin achievement of 18.8%. This represents a conversion margin on incremental sales over Q1 2009 of 31%. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control will allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner to achieve strong operating leverage and profitability going forward.
Interest expense for the quarter was $10 million compared to $9 million last year. The increase over the prior year relates primarily to the inclusion in interest expense of fees on the company's receivable securitization program in accordance with the adoption of new accounting rules, effective at the beginning of the year.
In 2009, these fees which totaled approximately $400,000 were included in other expense. The remaining increase in interest expense is due to higher average interest rates in the 2010 quarter. In the first quarter, the company had an effective tax rate of 26.1% compared to a rate of 24.1% in the first quarter of 2009. Both years reflect the benefit of reductions in tax reserve amounts relating primarily to the completion of prior year audits.
From an EPS perspective, the lower tax rate added a penny per share in the 2010 quarter and two pennies per share in the 2009 quarter. Excluding these adjustments, the effective tax rate is approximately 27.5% and we currently expect the same rate in the second quarter of 2010.
Net income was $98 million in the quarter, approximately 13% of sales, a very strong performance. Diluted earnings per share as reported was $0.56 in the 2010 quarter and $0.43 in the 2009 quarter. Excluding tax adjustments in both quarters, earnings per share grew 34% to $0.55 in the first quarter of 2010. Orders for the quarter were $829 million, up 8% sequentially and 31% from last year resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.08 to 1 in the quarter.
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash in all cycles. Cash flow from operations was $114 million in Q1 or 114% of net income in the quarter. Cash flow from operations along with proceeds in related tax benefits from option exercises of about $4 million was used primarily for capital expenditures of $19 million, acquisition related expenditures of $3 million, dividend payments of $3 million, $33 million reduction in debt and an $8 million increase in short-term investments.
In addition, cash and cash investments increased by $47 million in the quarter. In addition to the very strong operating cash flow and $602 million of availability under the company's revolving credit facility, the company had cash and cash investments that exceeded $430 million at the end of the quarter.
The company has more than sufficient liquidity to meet its needs. The company also has a $100 million receivable securitization program that the company plans to renew at its expiration in May. In accordance with previous accounting rules, this facility was accounted for off balance sheet as a sale of receivables.
Effective January 1, 2010, those rules have been changed bringing the facility on balance sheet. At the end of March borrowing under the facility were $49 million and are reflected as short-term debt. At the end of the December, approximately $82 million of receivables were sold under the facility and under the previous accounting rules were excluded from the balance sheet. The company's credit ratios and ratings have always treated the facility as debt and therefore not affected by this accounting change.
The company continued its strong focus on working capital management in the quarter. Day sales outstanding were 66 days compared to 64 days at the end of December, up two days and within the normal range for the company. The increase of two days at the end of March reflects the heavyweighting of March sales in the quarter.
In addition, inventory in the quarter increased two days to 82 days at the end of March from 80 days at the end of December. The increase in days relates primarily to inventory preparation for a sequentially stronger Q2.
Debt was $802 million at the end of March compared to $753 million at the end of December as reported and $835 million if adjusted for the classification change from our receivables securitization program.
Debt was therefore down $33 million in the quarter. Net debt was $370 million at the end of the quarter compared to $450 million at the end of December on a restated basis. The company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1.23 times and 14.7 times respectively and EBITDA in the quarter was approximately $176 million.
From a financial perspective, we're certainly very pleased with the strength of the company's performance in the quarter. Adam will now provide an overview of the business.

I plan to spend a few moments to highlight for you our first quarter achievements, discuss several of the trends and progress in our served market and then comment on our outlook for the second quarter of 2010.
We'll then have time at the end for some questions and answers. The first quarter was a very strong start to 2010 for Amphenol. As we returned to our first quarter 2008 revenue levels by capitalizing on an improving demand environment to further expand our position in our end markets.
Revenues in the quarter increased 17% from prior year and 2% sequentially in what is typically, a seasonally lower quarter, representing our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential growth. We're particularly encouraged by the strong order levels that Diana discussed with book-to-bill of 1.08 to 1.
We were also especially pleased to achieve strong operating leverage on our incremental sales in the quarter, leading to further expansion of our already strong operating margins to 18.8%. And as Diana mentioned, we continued to generate excellent cash flow of 114 million in the quarter.
These results are all a direct reflection of the strength in discipline of our agile organization and our entrepreneurial management team. That cash flow that we spoke about also allowed us in early April to complete the acquisition of a Taiwan and China based manufacturer of specialized industrial Interconnect with annual sales of approximately $25 million.
This exciting acquisition expands our already leading positions in harsh environment Interconnect for a diverse range of industrial applications including in particular lighting and alternative energy applications. This acquisition is very consistent with our ongoing strategy to find complementary company who has strong management, leading technology, all with an excellent market presence in their particular markets. We're very optimistic that our continuing acquisition program will create value for Amphenol in the future.
Now, I'd like to turn to discuss some of the trends and progress in our served markets. In general, we're very pleased that had our ongoing strategy of diversification enabled us to not only achieve strong year-over-year growth but as I mentioned to return back to our first quarter of 2008 levels which we believe is a significant accomplishment.
The military and aerospace market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market increased 7% from prior year with continued strength in military avionics, ground vehicle and communications programs. Our ongoing leadership in all Interconnect technologies related to these and other expanding segments of the mil-aero [ph] market has positioned us well for important new programs and upgrades that are planned around the world.
In addition, our leading position in Interconnect for commercial air applications will serve us well as that market begins to recover. We expect demand to further strengthen in the second quarter and look forward to a strong long-term outlook for the military aerospace market as electronics continue to proliferate in all categories of military equipment.
The industrial market represents 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased 17% from prior year and increased a strong 17% as well from the fourth quarter. This was the second straight quarter of double-digit sequential improvement in our industrial market.
We have benefited from a recovery in many segments of the industrial market including a especially medical, rail and transportation related applications as well as from our strategic focus on new products for alternative energy applications. We are especially encouraged by strengthening that we have seen in the distribution channel for industrial where we have not yet seen significant inventory restocking but rather have seen full sell through to end customers.
We expect further improvement in the second quarter for the industrial market and are optimistic that our efforts in the growth segments of this market will continue to build momentum in the future. The automotive market represented for us 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased a very strong 64% from prior year as vehicle volumes normalized following the significant declines experienced in 2009.
No question that the last eighteen months have been thrilling in what is our smallest end market. Beyond the widely recovered - beyond the widely reported recovery in the worldwide automotive market, we are excited about our participation in the beginning ramp ups of new hybrid vehicle platforms.
In addition, our long-term outlook for this market remains very positive with the general increase of electronics in cars combined with expanding opportunities in Asia and other less developed regions. The broadband communication market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market increased 19% from prior year and strengthened seasonally from the fourth quarter.
We expect this market to further strengthen in the second quarter as we move into what is typically a more robust buildout period. And we look forward to new opportunities for growth that are being by created by ongoing development of new cable and interconnect products for the broadband market which positions us very well for the future.
The information, technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter, sales were up a very strong 45% from prior year with demand improving across essentially all segments of the information technology market.
Our customers have experienced a significant increase in demand due in part to pent up enterprise IT investments but more importantly resulting from demand for equipment to support the acceleration of data rich traffic that is being driven by the recent growth of online video and mobile internet devices.
We are very excited about the opportunities that are arising from these important trends. Demand in this market has increased especially for our high speed and power products that are used in servers, enterprise storage and networking equipment. We expect further strengthening in the IT market of demand in the second quarter driven by market expansion and our program wins with our new advanced technologies, all of which position us for continued expansion in this market.
The mobile networks market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter. While sales in this market decreased 3% from prior year, the mobile networks market strengthened sequentially for the second straight quarter, growing 9% from the fourth quarter. While there was no one-time buildout comparable to the first quarter 2009 China 3G launch, we were pleased to see a sequential improvement this market, especially related to Next Generation Network upgrades in developed geographies related in part to the expansion and proliferation of new mobile internet devices.
We expect demand in the mobile networks market to strengthen further in the first quarter as we benefit from our leading position on new bay station platforms as well as our broad portfolio, a cell site installation products. In addition, we're very excited our expanding geographic presence continues to create new pockets of growth in a very diverse range of emerging markets.
The mobile devices market represented for us 14% of sales in the quarter, sales increased 3% from prior year and were down sequentially on expected seasonality. We anticipate an improvement of demand in the second quarter as device volumes improved and as we capitalize on our strong position on newly released smart mobile devices. Our comprehensive portfolio of products for mobile devices as well as our preferred supplier relationships with all major device makers continues to position us strongly for the future.
In summary, with respect to the first quarter, I am tremendously proud of our organization as we have executed extremely well in what has been a very dynamic demand environment. Our continued focus throughout all cycles of the economy on reacting quickly to changing customer needs while ensuring relentless focus on profitability has resulted in the strengthening of our market position and a further expansion of our industry leading margin.
It should be clear to all that the Amphenol recipe does not change with economic cycles. Our success is a direct result of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, the increasing position with customers in diverse markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, as well as an agile, entrepreneurial management team.
As we look forward and based on a continuation of current economic trends as well as constant exchange rates, we now expect in the second quarter of 2010 the following results. We expect sales in the range of $820 million to $835 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.60 to $0.62.
In this continuing economic recovery, I am very confident in the ability of our outstanding organization to capitalize on the many opportunities to further expand both our market position and our profitability. At this time, operator, we would welcome any questions that there may be.

I think that as you know the cable business in particular has a very large percentage of the costs that really is commodity based and copper certainly is one of the three top materials but aluminum and actually plastics are used even a little bit more in the product and we did, it has been some pressure on margins as a result of that. I think that we're still achieving pretty good margins in that business and so we are able to deal with a portion of those cost pressures but in the Interconnect side of the business as you know, it is a very diverse product footprint and we use many materials. We actually don't procure them or even really talk about them on a consolidated business because it really isn't the way that we - that we run or manage that part of the business. We view the material pressures as just another element that needs to be managed in the context of overall profitability goals and I think as you see in the first quarter the management team did just an excellent job to create operating leverage in the business even considering the fact that clearly there was some pressure from commodities or some pressure from a wage perspective in China. I mean, these things, there is always some sort of pressure on some part of cost in any given timeframe and I think that as Adam mentioned in his comments, the management team around the world is just really committed to controlling all of the rest of the costs and I think taking a hard look also from a pricing perspective and I think the aggregate of all of that is the good conversion margin that you have seen. So I think as we look into Q2, we don't have a concern relative to margins that would where commodity prices would cause us to lower our internal expectations as far as creating good operating leverage next quarter.

So I think that there is certainly a focus on pricing as Diana mentioned and we will continue to drive that. Relative to pricing in cable, we have also been very sensitive there and I think we mentioned a quarter ago that competition has in certain cases being leading prices down in that cable segment. We are again being very disciplined in that market while preserving our position and I think the fact that we're able to achieve the margins that we did in the cable segment in particular in the quarter is very impressive when you factor in the raw materials in that pricing environment.

So our organization is extremely focused regardless of the lead time that is given to us by the customer to try to go, give that, get the product to the customer in the time allotted and that means really exercising our flexibility as an organization. I think we're able to do this. If you look back over 2009 and the adjustment that is we made coming into the downturn, we did not go through big restructuring. We didn't go decommission factories, reflects each of our operations. It is scaled to the size of the business those operations saw in 2009. Well, sort of like an accordion, it allows you to flex back. Rather than having to go recommission tools or reopen factories or do all of these things that can happen to companies, our organization managed that downturn on an individual basis and an operating unit basis which there upon allows us now to exercise that same flexibility on the upside. I think regardless of the lead times we get from our customers, we're very pleased with the performance that we're providing to those customers and we'll continue to do so in the second quarter.

But relative to the second quarter, we feel very good about all the markets with the exception that we don't foresee that the automotive market would grow sequentially in that quarter. I think the question on over heating is certainly one of is there kind of a bubble of demand? And if you just look at, for example, the IT market which grew 45% on a year-over-year basis, certainly there is some element of pent up demand and if it were nothing else, it may cause one to think that that's kind of a bubble. However, what we have certainly seen is the data traffic that has expanded over the last 12 months has made, has added on to the investment plans of enterprises and carriers from an IT standpoint, making us more confident that this is not actually a bubble that we see in the internet, that there is really an increase in investment requirements for companies who are managing their data centers, for carriers who are carrying the traffic, all of it really driven by this explosion of more data rich content, whether that be through mobile devices or otherwise. And so the IT market in particular is one where we certainly have seen great strength and we anticipate more strength here in the second quarter and there seemed to be real structural reasons why that strength should continue and not necessarily be just a bubble.

I think your first question was relative to does our guidance envision kind of what has been already announced about China 3G and I think the simple answer to that is yes, it does",545,"Diana gets off easy but I will, Jim, address for you my two questions here. I think your first question was relative to does our guidance envision kind of what has been already announced about China 3G and I think the simple answer to that is yes, it does. We certainly do consider all the information that is available to us at the time we give such guidance and we are very close to what's happening in China with all of our operations on the ground there and we are very mindful of what's happening. I think these CapEx numbers that come out in China have to be read a little bit carefully because CapEx, as you know, Jim, when it starts for a network buildout, there is a higher proportion of that capital that goes into tower construction, land preparation and what I would call sort of non-electronics and then in the follow-on of a network, sort of, an optimization stage the electronics component of CapEx becomes a little bit bigger. So I think I would be careful to necessarily read those sort of 50%, 35% numbers that you referred to as kind of dollar for dollar references to the electronics industry.
But as I mentioned on, I think, a prior question, we have seen strength in the wireless infrastructure market, especially in developed economies. I mean, wherever there are new smart mobile devices that are creating new burdens upon the networks, there seems to follow quite quickly capital spending that drives equipment spending from to our customers. And because of our unique position participating both with OEMs as well as directly with the carriers in the mobile infrastructure market, we have a very good sense of where that is coming and one area that I emphasized in my early remarks is these new geographies. And these new geographies, China is no longer what I would call necessarily a new geography. Places like Africa, the Middle East, where we see real expansions in wireless and not to mention India, which has been slower market this year, but where you're probably familiar over the last two weeks they have been having what have seemed to be quite successful auctions of their 3G spectrum and that gives optimism that at some point you will have an India also with the numerous operators that are there, nearly twice the operators as you have in China, a 3G buildout. Now relative to your question on double ordering, I think we are sensitive to that. At the same time, we don't have a perfect insight into our customer's warehouses. Where we do have insight is with our distributors and distribution, which represents about 15% of our total sales. We have not seen any material inventory builds in the distribution channel, which you may expect to see in such a time. And that has told us and what we have heard from our distributors is that they really are buying products to satisfy end demand.
And when we talk to customers, when I personally go out to customers, what we have heard consistently is that the customers are buying our products to satisfy real end demand that is coming from the enterprises to consumers and the carriers of the world.

But what I can tell you is so far we have seen nothing of any significance from our customers. What we do understand is that we have new logistics tracks, which are being explored. Companies who are shipping through southern and southeastern Europe, places all the way as far as Istanbul and so maybe some of the trucks have to travel a little bit farther than they used to from Frankfurt and Paris. But we haven't seen any significant either warning signs or any real disruptions to production from our customers. We certainly have in place and are putting in place contingency plans that this thought of ash sort of hangs over Europe for an extended time period. But at this time, we don't see any real meaningful impact on any of our customers and that's what we're most sensitive to. From our own perspective, we have good contingency plans if need be.

And then another question if I can. In the press release you noted, you're expanding the company's growth opportunities through accelerated efforts to penetrate new markets, customers and applications and in the past we have seen some of this and I'll cite moving from connectors into things like antennas in OEM products. Then also the Jaybeam acquisition where you're selling what I think of really as capital equipment to the carriers. So I am wondering if we should read this as a thought that over time we should see Amphenol expand into yet additional product categories that maybe are somewhat far afield from connectors?

Certainly there is a big portion of our sales which are what we call value add and that has been a strategy that we've had for more than a decade to expand our total solution offering to customers in terms of not just selling a discrete Interconnect product, but rather selling an Interconnect solution. That Interconnect solution ranges from anything from a cable assembly on to more sophisticated products and into antennas, as you mentioned and Jaybeam as an example selling bay station antennas, which is just another extension really of an antenna being a wireless corrector, from our prospective. And so I would not certainly say that we have an intention to totally change our business model and go after different things here, but our quest to satisfy the larger bill of materials and get a broader presence with our customers on their bill of materials for Interconnect, that is an unending quest that we have. It is a core strategy across all of our organization and when we talk about new products and new markets and new technologies, there is just tremendous opportunities still remaining within Interconnect as we look across all of the new applications that are there, the new smart devices, smart mobile devices, alternative energy, the new military applications that are there.
We see just tremendous opportunity in those markets that we occupy. And bear in mind, even with the strong performance that we have, we do not have 100% of the Interconnect market, far from it. And so we see just tremendous opportunities that all come along with this proliferation of electronics and the proliferation of electronics is something that impacts all of the markets that we have discussed here. You see this just across the board, whether that be in a jet plane, whether that be in a car, whether that be in a data center, whether that be in your hand in a mobile device. All of these have new electronic functionalities which are driving new applications and demands for new technologies from us, new Interconnect technologies. And so there is plenty of room for us to continue to drive that diversification strategy without having to kind of stretch and do something that is neither attractive to us nor known by us at this stage.

So that is certainly something that we're very proud of and that goes back to, as Diana said, a lot of prudent on the part of our management team in terms of only adding the headcount to where it is necessary to increase production.

But I would just start out by saying that I think we feel really great about being able to achieve the margins that we have achieved overall, but also in the Interconnect segment specifically in the first quarter. I mean, let's just think about what the business has been through in the last 12 months here. We have dealt with just a very significant buildup in volume through 2008 and then a significant reduction in volume in 2009 and it is clear as we manage through that and I think that the management team did a fantastic job to achieve in all of those quarters excellent profitability levels given the challenges that they had to deal with.
I think that we certainly did make the decision not to cut out all of the resources that we had put in place in mid-2008 when we were really on a different trajectory from a sales perspective. In the Interconnect business, we do carry some expenses related to new product development and front-end type costs that we felt made sense to keep in place during the recession in 2009. I think we have achieved excellent conversion margins in the first quarter and the management team worked very hard to achieve that. I think we will see good conversion margins as we continue to grow. I think the operating leverage in the business will continue to come through and I think the differences that you mention will become much smaller as we grow from a top-line perspective and then give the same attention to detail on costs that will allow us to, I think, get back to those types of profitability levels in the future.

I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter call. Q1 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company had a strong first quarter, achieving sequential growth in sales and earnings per share and exceeding the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were $771 million, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currencies over the fourth quarter of 2009, a strong performance in a normally seasonally softer quarter. Compared to last year, sales for the quarter were up 17% in U.S. dollars and 14% in local currencies. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency effects, sales in the first quarter 2010 were up 11% over last year.
Breaking down sales into our two major components: Our cable business, which comprised 9% of our sales in the quarter, was up 16% in U.S. dollars and 10% in local currencies over last year and up about 7% from last quarter. Sales grew in all regions.
The interconnect business, which comprised 91% of our sales, was up 17% from last year and 1% sequentially. We continue to see strengthening demand in the majority of our markets. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income for the quarter was $145 million. Operating margin was 18.8%, compared to 16.8% last year and 18.3% last quarter. Operating income is net of stock option expense of approximately $5.4 million this year and $4.8 million last quarter. This is about 0.7% percent of sales both in Q1 2010 and Q1 2009. 
From a segment perspective, in the cable segment, margins were 14.9%, up from 13.5% last year and down from 15.5% last quarter. The margin decline from last quarter relates to both higher relative material costs and the impact of price reductions.
In the interconnect business, margins were 21.1%, compared to 19.3% last year and 20.6% last quarter. The improvement in margin reflects the benefits of proactive and aggressive cost control as volumes begin to ramp back up. Overall, we are extremely pleased with the company's operating margin achievement of 18.8%. This represents the conversion margin on incremental sales over Q1 2009 of 31%. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and cultured cost control will allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner to achieve strong operating leverage and profitability going forward.
Interest expense for the quarter was $10 million, compared to $9 million last year. The increase over the prior year relates primarily to the inclusion in interest expense of fees on the company's receivable securitization program in accordance with the adoption of new accounting rules effective at the beginning of the year. In 2009, these fees, which totaled approximately $400,000, were included in other expense. The remaining increase in interest expense is due to higher average interest rates in the 2010 quarter.
In the first quarter, the company had an effective tax rate of 26.1%, compared to a rate of 24.1% in the first quarter of 2009. Both years reflect the benefit of reductions in tax reserve amounts relating primarily to the completion of prior-year audits. From an EPS perspective, the lower tax rate added $0.01 per share in the 2010 quarter and $0.02 per share in the 2009 quarter. Excluding these adjustments, the effective tax rate is approximately 27.5% and we currently expect the same rate in the second quarter of 2010. Net income was $98 million in the quarter, approximately 13% of sales, a very strong performance. Diluted earnings per share as reported was $0.56 in the 2010 quarter and $0.43 in the 2009 quarter. Excluding tax adjustments in both quarters, earnings per share grew 34% to $0.55 in the first quarter of 2010. Orders for the quarter were $829 million, up 8% sequentially and 31% from last year, resulting in a very strong book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.08:1 in the quarter.
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash in all cycles. Cash flow from operations of $114 million in Q1 or 114% of net income in the quarter. Cash flow from operations, along with proceeds and related tax benefits from option exercises of about $4 million, was used primarily for capital expenditures of $19 million, acquisition-related expenditures of $3 million, dividend payments of $3 million, a $33 million reduction in debt and an $8 million increase in short-term investments. In addition, cash and cash investments increased by $47 million in the quarter. In addition to the very strong operating cash flow and $602 million of availability under the company's revolving credit facility, the company had cash and cash investments that exceeded $430 million at the end of the quarter. The company has more than sufficient liquidity to meet its needs. The company also has a $100 million receivable securitization program that the company plans to renew at its expiration in May. 
In accordance with previous accounting rules, this facility was accounted for off-balance sheet as a sale of receivables. Effective January 1, 2010, those rules have been changed, bringing the facility on balance sheet. And at the end of March, borrowings under the facility were $49 million and are reflected as short-term debt. At the end of December, approximately $82 million of receivables were sold under the facility, and under the previous accounting rules, were excluded from the balance sheet. The company's credit ratios and ratings have always treated the facility as debt and are therefore not affected by this accounting change.
The company continued its strong focus on working capital management in the quarter. Day sales outstanding were 66 days, compared to 64 days at the end of December, up two days and within the normal range for the company. The increase of two days at the end of March reflects the heavy weighting of March sales in the quarter. In addition, inventory in the quarter increased two days to 82 days at the end of March from 80 days at the end of December. The increase in days relates primarily to inventory preparation for a sequentially stronger Q2. 
Debt was $802 million at the end of March, compared to $753 million at the end of December as reported, and $835 million if adjusted for the classification change from our receivable securitization program. Debt was therefore down $33 million in the quarter. Net debt was $370 million at the end of the quarter, compared to $450 million at the end of December on a restated basis. 
The company's leveraged and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1.23x and 14.7x, respectively, and EBITDA in the quarter was approximately $176 million. From a financial perspective, we're certainly very pleased with the strength of the company's performance in the quarter. Adam will now provide an overview of the business."

I plan to spend a few moments to highlight for you our first quarter achievements, discuss several of the trends and progress in our served markets and then comment on our outlook for the second quarter of 2010. We'll then have time at the end for some questions and answers.
The first quarter was a very strong start to 2010 for Amphenol as we returned to our first quarter 2008 revenue level by capitalizing on an improving demand environment to further expand our position in our end markets. Revenues in the quarter increased 17% from prior year and 2% sequentially in what is typically a seasonally lower quarter, representing our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential growth. 
We are particularly encouraged by the strong order levels that Diana discussed with book-to-bill of 1.08:1. We were also especially pleased to achieve strong operating leverage on our incremental sales in the quarter, leading to further expansion of our already strong operating margins to 18.8%. And as Diana mentioned, we continue to generate excellent cash flow of $114 million in the quarter. These results are all a direct reflection of the strength and discipline of our agile organization and our entrepreneurial management team.
That cash flow that we spoke about also allowed us in early April to complete the acquisition of a Taiwan- and China-based manufacturer of specialized industrial interconnect with annual sales of approximately $25 million. This exciting acquisition expands our already leading position in harsh environment interconnect for a diverse range of industrial application, including, in particular, lighting and alternative energy applications. This acquisition is very consistent with our ongoing strategy to find complementary companies who have strong management, leading technology, all with an excellent market presence in their particular markets. We are very optimistic that our continuing acquisition program will create value for Amphenol in the future.
Now I'd like to turn to discuss some of the trends and progress in our served markets. In general, we are very pleased that our ongoing strategy of diversification enabled us to not only achieve strong year-over-year growth, but as I mentioned, to return back to our first quarter of 2008 levels, which we believe is a significant accomplishment.
The military and aerospace market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market increased 7% from prior year with continued strength in military avionics, ground vehicle and communications programs. Our ongoing leadership in all interconnect technologies related to these and other expanding segments of the Mil-Aero market has positioned us well for important new programs and upgrades that are planned around the world. 
In addition, our leading position in interconnect for commercial air applications will serve us well as that market begins to recover. We expect demand to further strengthen in the second quarter and look forward to a strong long-term outlook for the military/aerospace market, as electronics continue to proliferate in all categories of military equipment.
The industrial market represented 11% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased 17% from prior year and increased a strong 17% as well from the fourth quarter. This is the second straight quarter of double-digit sequential improvement in our industrial market. 
We have benefited from a recovery in many segments of the industrial market, including a specialty in medical-, rail- and transportation-related applications, as well as from our strategic focus on new products for alternative energy applications. We are especially encouraged by a strengthening that we have seen in the distribution channel for industrial, where we have not yet significant inventory restocking, but rather have seen full sell-through to in-customers. We expect further improvement in the second quarter for the industrial market and are optimistic that our efforts in the growth segment of this market will continue to build momentum in the future.
The automotive market represented for us 7% of our sales in the quarter. Sales increased a very strong 64% from prior year as vehicle volumes normalized following the significant declines experienced in 2009. No question that the last 18 months have been thrilling in what is our smallest in-market. 
Beyond the widely reported recovery in the worldwide automotive market, we are excited by our participation in the beginning ramp ups of new hybrid vehicle platforms. In addition, our long-term outlook for this market remains very positive, with the general increase of electronics and cars, combined with expanded opportunities in Asia and other less-developed regions.
The broadband communication market represented 10% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in that market increased 19% from prior year and strengthened seasonally from the fourth quarter. We expect this market to further strengthen in the second quarter as we move into what is typically a more robust build-out period. And we look forward to new opportunities for growth. They are being created by our ongoing development of new cable and interconnect products for the broadband market, which positions us very well for the future.
The information technology and data communications market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were up a very strong 45% from prior year, with demand improving across essentially all segments of the information-technology market. Our customers have experienced a significant increase in demand due, in part, to pent-up enterprise IT investments, but more importantly, resulting from demand for equipment to support the acceleration of data-rich traffic that is being driven by the recent growth of online video and mobile internet devices. We are very excited about the opportunities that are arising from these important trends. Demand in this market has increased especially for our high-speed and power products that are used in servers, enterprise storage and networking equipment. We expect further strengthening in the IT market of demand in the second quarter, driven by market expansion and our program wins with our new advanced technologies, all of which position us for continued expansion in this market.
The mobile networks market represented 15% of our sales in the quarter. While sales in this market decreased 3% from prior year, the mobile networks market strengthened sequentially for the second straight quarter, growing 9% from the fourth quarter. While there was no one-time build out comparable to the first quarter 2009 China 3G launch, we were pleased to see a sequential improvement in this market, especially related to next-generation network upgrades in developed geographies, related in part to the expansion and proliferation of new mobile internet devices. We expect demand in the mobile networks market to strengthen further in the first quarter as we benefit from our leading position on new base station platforms, as well as our broad portfolio of cell site installation products. In addition, we are very excited that our expanding geographic presence continues to create new pockets of growth in a very diverse range of emerging markets.
The mobile devices market represented for us 14% of sales in the quarter. Sales increased 3% from prior year and were down sequentially on expected seasonality. We anticipate an improvement of demand in the second quarter as device volumes improve and as we capitalize on our strong position on newly-released smart mobile devices. Our comprehensive portfolio of products for mobile devices, as well as our preferred supplier relationships with all major device makers, continues to position us strongly for the future.
In summary, with respect to the first quarter, I am tremendously proud of our organization, as we have executed extremely well in what has been a very dynamic demand environment. Our continued focus throughout all cycles of the economy, on reacting quickly to changing customer needs, while ensuring relentless focus on profitability, has resulted in the strengthening of our market position and a further expansion of our industry-leading margins. It should be clear to all that the Amphenol recipe does not change with economic cycles. Our success is a direct result of our distinct competitive advantages: Our leading technology, the increasing position with customers in diverse markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, as well as an agile entrepreneurial management team.
As we look forward, and based on the continuation of current economic trends as well as constant exchange rates, we now expect in the second quarter of 2010 the following results: We expect sales in the range of $820 million to $835 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.60 to $0.62.

I think that, as you know, the cable business in particular has a very large percentage of the cost that really is raw commodity based, and copper certainly is one of the three top materials, but aluminum and actually plastics are used even a little bit more in the product. And we did, and have seen, some pressure on margins as a result of that. I think that we're still achieving pretty good margins in that business and so we are able to deal with a portion of those cost pressures. But in the interconnect side of the business, as you know, it's a very diverse product footprint and we use many materials. We actually don't procure them or even really talk about them on a consolidated business because it really isn't the way that we run or manage that part of the business. We view the material pressures as just another element that needs to be managed in the context of overall profitability goals. And I think, as you see in the first quarter, the management team did just an excellent job to create operating leverage in the business, even considering the fact that, clearly, there was some pressure from commodities or some pressure from a wage perspective in China. I mean, these things -- there's always some sort of pressure on some part of cost in any given time frame. And I think that, as Adam mentioned in his comments, the management team around the world is just really committed to controlling all of the rest of the cost, and I think taking a hard look also from a pricing perspective. And I think the aggregate of all of that is the good conversion margin that you've seen. So I think as we look into Q2, we don't have a concern relative to margins where commodity prices would cause us to lower our internal expectations as far as creating good operating leverage next quarter."

Whatever that is, we have seen actually quite an increase in the short lead-time orders, where I can tell you our company has performed just extremely well. And this is a very, very critical time period where, if you can as a corporation satisfy customers when they come and ask you for what normally would be considered an unreasonable request -- you know, ship us the parts in three weeks -- If you can do that, it can really cement that relationship and allow you to grow your position with those customers in the long term. 
So our organization is extremely focused regardless of the lead time that is given to us by the customer to try to go give that, get the product to the customer in the time allotted. And that means really exercising our flexibility as an organization. I think we are able to do this. If you look back over 2009 and the adjustments that we made coming into the downturn, we did not go through
big restructuring. We didn't go decommission factory. We flexed each of our operations. It scaled to the size of the business that those operations saw in 2009. Well, sort of like an accordion, it allows you to flex back, rather than having to go recommission tools, or reopen factories, or do all of these things that can happen to companies. Our organization managed that downturn on an individual basis at an operating unit basis, which thereupon allows us now to exercise that same flexibility on the upside. And so I think regardless of the lead times that we get from our customers, we are very pleased with the performance that we are providing to those customers and we'll continue to do so in the second quarter."

And if you just look at, for example, the IT market, which grew 45% on a year-over-year basis, certainly there is some element of pent-up demand. And if it were nothing else, it may cause one to think that that is kind of a bubble. 
However, what we have certainly seen is the data traffic that has expanded over the last 12 months has added on to the investment plans of enterprises and carriers from an IT standpoint, making us more confident that this is not actually a bubble that we see in the internet; that there is really an increase in investment requirements for companies who are managing their data centers; for carriers who are carrying their traffic, all of it really driven by this explosion of more data-rich content, whether that be through mobile devices or otherwise. And so the IT market, in particular, is one where we certainly have seen great strength and we anticipate more strength during the second quarter.

I mean, we certainly do consider all the information that is available to us at the time we give such guidance. And we are very close to what's happening in China with all of our operations on the ground there, and we are very mindful of what's happening. I think these CapEx numbers that come out in China have to be read a little bit carefully because CapEx, as you know, Jim, when it starts for a network build-out, there is a higher proportion of that capital that goes into tower construction, land preparation, and what I would call sort of non-electronics. And then in the follow-on of a network, sort of an optimization stage, the electronics component of CapEx becomes a little bit bigger. So I think I would be careful to necessarily read those sort of 50%, 35% numbers that you referred to, you know, as kind of dollar-per-dollar references to the electronics industry. But as I mentioned, I think the prior question, we have seen strength in the wireless infrastructure market, especially in developed economies. I mean, wherever there are new smart mobile devices that are creating new burdens upon the networks, there seems to follow quite quickly capital spending that drives equipment spending to our customers. And because of our unique position, participating both with OEMs as well as directly with the carriers in the mobile infrastructure market, we have a very good sense of where that is coming. And one area that I emphasized in my earlier remarks is these new geographies. In these new geographies, you know, China is no longer what I would call necessarily a new geography. Places like Africa, the Middle East, where we see real expansions in wireless, and not to mention India, which has been slower market this year, but where -- You're probably familiar over the last two weeks, they have been having what has seemed to be quite successful auctions of their 3G spectrum, and that gives optimism that, at some point, you will have in India, also with the numerous operators that are there and nearly twice the operators as you have in China, a 3G build out. 
Now relative to your question on double ordering, I think are sensitive to that. At the same time, we don't have a perfect insight into our customers' warehouses. Where we do have insight is with our distributors and distribution which represent about 15% of our total sales. We have not seen any material inventory build in the distribution channel, which you may expect to see in such a time. And that has told us, and what we have heard from our distributors, is that they really are buying product to satisfy in demand. And when we talk to customers, when I personally go out to customers, what we have heard consistently is that the customers are buying our products to satisfy real in-demand that is coming from the enterprises to consumers and the carriers of the world."

Certainly, there's a big portion of our sales which are what we call value add. And that has been a strategy that we have had for more than a decade, to expand our total solution offering to customers in terms of not just selling a discrete interconnect product, but rather selling an interconnect solutions. That interconnect solution ranges from anything from a cable assembly onto more sophisticated products and into antennas, as you mentioned, and J-Beam as an example selling base station antennas, which is just another extension really of an antenna being a wireless connector from our perspective. And so I would not certainly say that we have an intention to totally change our business model and go after different things here, but our quest to satisfy the larger bill of materials and get a broader presence with our customers on their bill of materials for interconnect, that is an unending quest that we have. It is the core strategy across all of our organization. And when we talk about new products and new markets and new technologies, there’s a tremendous opportunity still remaining within interconnect. As we look across all of the new applications that are there, the new smart devices, smart mobile devices, alternative energy, the new military applications that are there, we see just tremendous opportunity in those markets that we occupy. And bear in mind, even with the strong performance that we have, we do not have 100% of the interconnect market, far from it. And so we see those tremendous opportunities that all come along with this proliferation of electronics. And the proliferation of electronics is something that impacts all of the markets that we have discussed here. You see this just across the board, whether that be in a jet plane, whether that be in a car, whether that be in a data center, whether that be in your hand in the mobile device. All of these have new electronic functionalities, which are driving new applications and demand for new technologies from us, new interconnect technologies. So there is plenty of room for us to continue to drive that diversification strategy, without having to kind of stretch into something that is neither attractive to us nor known by us at this stage."

And it's clear, as we managed through that -- And I think that the management team did a fantastic job to achieve, in all of those quarters, excellent profitability levels given the challenges that they had to deal with -- I think that we certainly
did make the decision not to cut out all of the resources that we had put in place in mid-2008 when we were really on a different trajectory from a sales perspective. So in the interconnect business, we do carry some expenses related to new product development and front-end costs that we felt made sense to keep in place during the recession in 2009. I think we've achieved excellent conversion margins in the first quarter, and the management team worked very hard to achieve that. I think we'll see good conversion margins as we continue to grow. I think the operating leverage in the business will continue to come through.

I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter earnings call. Q2 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company had a record second quarter, achieving strong growth in both sales and earnings per share and exceeding the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were $885 million, up 15% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currencies over Q1 of 2010. Compared to last year, sales for the quarter were up 29% in U.S. dollars and 30% in local. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency impact, sales in Q2 2010 were up 15% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. 
Breaking down sales into our two major components. Our Cable business, which comprise 8% of our sales, was up 6% from last year and flat with last quarter. Sales growth over last year relates primarily to an increase in spending in international broadband market. The Interconnect business, which comprise 92% of our sales, was up 31% from last year and 16% sequentially. We saw strong demand in all of our markets, and Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income for the quarter was $176 million compared to $115 million last year. Operating margin was 19.8% compared to 16.9% last year and 18.8% last quarter. Operating income is net of stock option expense of approximately $6.2 million or 0.7% of sales in the 2010 quarter compared to $5.2 million and 0.8% of sales in the 2009 quarter. From a segment standpoint, in the Cable business, margins were 13.5%, down from 15.8% last year and 14.9% last quarter. The margin decline relates both the higher relative material costs and the impact of price reductions.
In the Interconnect business, margins were 22.3% compared to 19.3% last year and 21.1% in Q1 of 2010. The improvement in margin reflects the benefits of proactive and aggressive management of all elements of cost as volume has ramped back up. Overall, we're extremely pleased with the company's operating margin achievement of 19.8%. This represents the conversion margin on incremental sales over 2009 of approximately 30%. And we continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and cultured cost control will allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner and achieve strong profitability going forward.
Interest expense for the quarter was $10 million compared to $9.1 million last year. The increase over the prior year relates primarily to the inclusion in interest expense of fees on the company's receivable securitization program in accordance with the adoption of the new accounting rules effective January 1, 2010. In 2009, these fees, which totaled approximately $400,000, were included in other expense. The remaining increase in interest expense is due to higher average interest rates in the 2010 quarter.
In Q2 2010, the company had an effective tax rate of 21.3% compared to a rate of 27.5% in the second quarter of 2009. The 2010 quarter includes a $10 million or $0.06 per share net benefit, relating to a reduction in international tax expense, due primarily to the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and the completion of prior-year audits. Excluding these adjustments, the effective tax rate is approximately 27.5%, and we currently expect a similar tax rate in the third quarter of 2010.
Net income, excluding the tax benefit discussed above was $119 million, approximately 13.5% of sales, a very strong performance. Diluted earnings per share in Q2 was $0.74 as reported and $0.68 excluding the one-time tax adjustments. This is a growth of 58% over the prior-year quarter. And EPS growth rate of approximately 2x sales growth, demonstrating the company's significant operating leverage. Orders for the quarter were $910 million, up 10% from Q1 2010 and up 37% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.03:1. 
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $104 million in Q2 or 86% of net income in the quarter, excluding tax items. For the six months, operating cash flow is approximately equal to net income excluding tax items. Cash flow from operations, along with proceeds and related tax benefits from option exercises of $5 million, was used primarily for $25 million of capital expenditures; acquisition-related expenditures, net of cash acquired of $11 million, relating to the previously disclosed acquisition of an Asian manufacturer of specialty industrial interconnect products in April; dividend payments of $3 million; $20 million debt reduction; increases in short-term investments of $36 million; and a $5 million increase in cash. 
In addition to its strong operating cash flow, the company had availability of $602 million under its revolving credit facility, $72 million under its receivable facility and cash and cash investments of approximately $519 million. The company has more than sufficient liquidity to meet its needs.
During the quarter, the company renewed its $100 million receivable securitization program for a three-year term ending in May of 2013. In accordance with previous accounting rules, the facility was accounted for off-balance sheet as a sale of receivables. Effective January 1, those rules were changed, bringing the facility on balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, borrowings under the facility were $28 million and are reflected as long-term debt. At the end of December, approximately $82 million of receivables were sold under the facility and were excluded from the balance sheet.
The company continued its strong focus on balance sheet performance in the quarter. Days sales outstanding were unchanged from March at 66 days and within the company's normal range. Inventory in the quarter decreased 75 days at June from 82 days at the end of Q1 as inventory built in Q1 for higher Q2 demand was flushed out. We are very pleased with the strong operational execution that resulted in this inventory reduction. In addition, accrued liability at the quarter end reflect bigger income tax and interest payments in the quarter in accordance with the related payment requirements.
Debt was $782 million at June 30 compared to $802 million at the end of March, down $20 million. And the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1.09x and 16x, respectively. EBITDA in the quarter was approximately $209 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. 
Adam will now provide an overview of the business."

It's a pleasure to speak with you on the occasion of our second quarter earnings release. And today, I'll highlight some of those achievements in the second quarter, discuss the trends and the progress in our served markets, and then I'll provide some commentary on our outlook for the third quarter.
The second quarter was a record quarter for Amphenol in both revenues and earnings as our organization took advantage of a healthy demand environment to expand our overall position in the many diverse markets that we serve. As Diana mentioned, revenues increased 29% essentially all organic from prior year and a very strong 15% sequentially, representing our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential growth. 
We were especially pleased to continue our track record of generating strong operating leverage, leading to further expansion of our already leading operating margins to 19.8%. I would also like to note especially that we were successful in this quarter in growing our earnings per share at twice the rate of our revenue, achieving 58% growth in EPS. This is a significant achievement, especially given our already high levels of profitability. 
We generated strong cash flow of $104 million, which was used in part to fund our successful and ongoing acquisition program. We're very proud of these results, which are a direct reflection of the strength and discipline of our agile organization and our entrepreneurial management team.
In early July, we did complete the acquisition of Borisch Manufacturing. Borisch is a leading manufacturer of value-add interconnect and electro-mechanical systems for the military/aerospace market, with sales in the last 12 months of approximately $100 million. The acquisition of Borisch builds upon a long-established strategy in Amphenol of offering highly engineered, value-add solutions to customers in the military/aerospace market, creating additional strength for us in this very important segment. Also, consistent with our ongoing strategy, this acquisition is in line with finding complementary companies with strong management, leading technology and an excellent market presence. We're very optimistic that our acquisition program will continue to create value for Amphenol in the future.
Now turning to the trends and progress that we have made in our served markets. The military and aerospace market represented 19% of our sales in the second quarter, and sales increased 8% from prior year and 8% sequentially, with strength especially in communications and other military electronic systems. We were especially pleased in the quarter to experience a return to year-over-year and sequential growth in products for commercial aerospace applications and look forward to continued improvement in this important segment. While we expect overall organic demand in the military/aerospace market to moderate seasonally in the third quarter with the traditional vacation periods in North America and Europe, we continue to have a very positive outlook for this market, as new electronic functionalities continue to proliferate across all categories of military/aerospace equipment.
The industrial market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter and sales in that market increased a very strong 78% from prior year and 36% sequentially, as we experienced the continued improvement across all segments of the industrial market. We're very pleased to see an acceleration of our sales of new products for alternative energy applications across all regions, confirming our long-term strategy of focusing on new product development for those applications. Although we do expect some degree of normal seasonal moderation in the third quarter, we remain optimistic that our efforts in the many growth segments of the industrial market will continue to build momentum into the future.
The automotive market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and there again, sales increased a strong 30% from prior year, as we benefited from the continuing worldwide normalization of vehicle volumes. Importantly, we are beginning to see contribution from products designed into new Hybrid Electric Vehicles and continued to make progress in designing in our innovative products into these new vehicle models as they are released. Our long-term outlook for the automotive market remains very positive, with the general increase of electronics and cars, as well as the expanding opportunities that we see in Asia.
Our sales into the broadband communication market represented 9% of revenues in the quarter, and sales increased 13% from prior year and strengthened as well from the first quarter. We expect this market to strengthen further in the third quarter as we move into a typically more robust buildout period, and we look forward to the new opportunities for growth that continue to be created by our ongoing development of new cable and interconnect products, as well as by our positioning in growth markets overseas. These both position us very well for the future in the broadband market.
The information technology and data communications market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter. And in this market, sales were up a very strong 58% from prior year. We have seen demand continuing to improve across all segments of the IT market. In this market, we are participating in the ongoing acceleration of data-rich application, which is being driven in large part by the proliferation of new mobile Internet devices, as well as by the ongoing expansion of video on the Internet. These exciting technology shifts continue to create tremendous demand on networking and information technology equipment, driving continued momentum in this important market. Demand as well is still healthy for our high-speed and power products, which are used in servers, enterprise storage and networking equipment. We expect further strengthening of demand in the IT market in the third quarter, driven by market expansion, as well as our program wins with new advanced technologies, both of which positions us for continued expansion in this market.
Our sales into the mobile networks market represented 14% of revenues in the quarter. We're very encouraged to experience a return to year-over-year growth in the mobile networks market, with sales increasing 12% from prior year and 10% sequentially. We are enjoying growth related to next-generation network upgrades in developed geographies, much of which is related to expansion and support of new mobile Internet devices. In addition, the prospects of additional investment in next-generation networks in developing countries has the real potential to support additional demand in the second half of 2010. Although we expect some moderation in the third quarter, we remain very confident in the strength of our broad presence in new base station platforms, as well as our growing position in a diverse range of emerging markets.
Mobile devices represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased a very strong 26% from prior year and 34% sequentially. We benefited from Amphenol's leading position on new platforms, including especially those products sold into new smart mobile devices. We anticipate further sequential growth in the third quarter, as our comprehensive portfolio of products for mobile devices, combined with our preferred supplier relationships with all major device manufacturers continues to position us strongly for the future.
In summary, I am very proud of our organization, as we have executed extremely well in a very dynamic demand environment. Our continued focus throughout all economic cycles on reacting quickly to changing customer needs, while ensuring a relentless focus on profitability, has resulted in both the strengthening of our market position, as well as significant expansion of our industry-leading margins. The achievement of these new records in sales and earnings so soon after the economic crisis clearly confirms the strength of our strategies and solid execution. And our success is a direct result of this distinct and competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, as well as an agile entrepreneurial management team.
As we look forward into the third quarter and based on a continuation of current economic trends, as well as normal summer seasonality in North America and Europe and also assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect in the third quarter the following results. We expect sales in the range of $880 million to $885 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.67 to $0.69. I am very confident in the ability of our outstanding organization to build on this new platform of record levels of performance and to capitalize on the many opportunities that we see to further grow our market position and to expand our profitability. 
And at this time, operator, we would be very pleased to entertain any questions that may be there."

We have done this with an acquisition early on in 2001 where we got into the backplane assemblies for the military/aerospace market, and we continue to do that over that decade, including an acquisition very similar to Borisch in Europe that we made over the last 24 months. We're very pleased with Borisch, and we think that, that company is going to continue to allow us to create for our customers in the military/aerospace markets, a total solution of highly engineered products. I'm not going to go into the breakdowns of various products of our company, the $100 million in sales over the last 12 months. But I can tell you that the customers of Borisch and I have already met many of them, they value them not because they can make something to a print that is given. They value them because they create value through engineering and through support of those programs. And there is also a very significant component of products that we make today as well for Amphenol. And we think this would fit very nicely with the company."

I mean, clearly, you have -- as we've discussed in the guidance, there are summer vacations, which common those create some seasonality, especially in the traditional markets of mil/aero and industrial in Europe and North America, and that would not be surprising nor abnormal. We have not seen any significant -- to refer to this macro trend. We have not seen any significant impact from these macro trends into our customer. Rather, what we are seeing around the world is a continued drive for new electronics applications. And whether this is in Europe, in North America and Asia, there is clearly a strong drive towards upgrading of electronics in every one of the segments that we have, whether that be in IT, whether that be in automotive, in aerospace or whatever. And so we think that whatever these macro trends may be, we see in our markets that the customers with whom we participate real sense and real basis for optimism in terms of that proliferation of electronics that is ongoing."

We believe that those efforts that have been ongoing for many years show a very, very strong pipeline for us for the future. Acquisitions remains our top priority in terms of capital allocation, together with new product development and investment on behalf of our growth. But that acquisition pipeline for us remains a very healthy one. And once again, as we look at these acquisitions, the receptiveness of the entrepreneurs and the owners of these companies towards becoming a part of Amphenol, just grows with everyday. They see the success that we have. They also see that we have an organizational culture and an organizational structure that is extremely hospitable to an acquisition, regardless of whatever idiosyncrasies may be in such an acquisition. They know that they fit in Amphenol, and they can find a platform for future growth in our company that they might not find with others.

But I think if you would go back and look at what the typical seasonality has been , I think what you said would be fair. I think that the third quarter does have this lower-level of activity in North America and Europe. Clearly, that is not the case in Q4 as we would expect to see some sequential improvement in a normal environment. From a material cost perspective, whether copper or any other, I think that certainly, we used copper and gold and many other commodities and many other production of our products. I think as we have mentioned in the past that we'd managed the total margins of our products in any given point in time and have to deal with issues on a material price on labor, on inflationary pressures and certain parts of the world. And we really look to manage the margin of each product on an individual basis to maximize that margin. And I think that we've been able to deal very well with commodity prices. I think that typically, when those prices start to go down, there's a strong relationship between the price environment and the cost environment. The customers that we sell through are certainly very aware of the way that cost pressures, whether it's material or label could move up and down. So I would think that anyone would expect to see some sort of a windfall that may result in margins and copper or any other input costs move in any dramatic manner. I think that we've done a great job to manage that balance between price and cost to work towards achieving very strong margins. We did that in Q2. I expect we'll do that in Q3 and Q4 and into next year. But I wouldn't expect to see, again, any specific windfall from any specific movement in material cost in our margins."

We are not a company that goes out and buy his projects and restructuring projects. Certainly, we have acquired companies in the past where there has been a drive to improve the profitability and performance of the company. But we are not a company that goes in and says let's go in and replace all the management and sticky new management and bring in consultants and restructure. That's not in our model at all. In the case of Borisch, clearly, we view Borisch as an opportunity to both expand our offering to our current customers within Borisch may or may not do business in terms of offering a more complete solutions to customers, number one. And number two, offering to these customers at Borisch also additional opportunities to expand their bill of material participation. What I can really tell you about the Military/Aerospace market and why this acquisition makes so much sense is customers in that market have consolidated and have professionalized. And professionalized, meaning they have gone, in many cases, from somewhat of a dais bore of independent units to now companies who say we need to reduce our supply base. We need to go to a supplier who can offer us kind of a one-stop shop in terms of all of our Interconnect and electro-mechanical needs. Borisch creates for us, here in North America, a new level of activity to go to these new customers, who are becoming more global, who are becoming more integrated and who are becoming more professional in terms of their sourcing management. And that just creates tremendous opportunity for us, all with the backdrop of the proliferation of electronics with these customers, many of whom have never had to deal with complex electronic systems in the past. They were making a vehicle, for example, which had just mechanical features to it. And now, such a vehicle and has a full suite of electronics that are integrated into that system, and they don't know how to deal with that. So the addition of Borisch, together with Amphenol, makes for us now in the eyes of those customers a true partnership. And it's a partnership that is embedded with technology more than anything else. It creates a platform of technology to support those customers."

And if you read the releases coming out of fun more this week, which is quite an indication of what's happening in that market, there seems to be a tremendous amount of positivism coming out of that row and Commercial Aero market today in terms of quarters, which are 4 times higher than they were a year before in terms of the new jetliners that are flying.

I think that it is true that in some prior quarters where we've gotten in an enormous sequential sort of boom in places like the Wireless Devices market. If you go back historically, the Wireless Infrastructure market could also be quite lumpy. There are years where we had a big pop in Q3 in that market, and the same is true of the IT and Datacom equipment market, where we can have circumstances and to your point where you have just this real big, big, big pop, particularly in the September timeframe in those markets. And I think that is the circumstance where you then would see this other sort of this higher sequential performance in aggregate for the company in the third quarter. And it's certainly true that we are not guiding to expect a big sequential pop in any of those markets. I think that when Adam went through the individual markets, he did say that we do expect to see a sequential increase in Mobile Devices. We do expect in IT data. What I would say that they're more modest.

But I think you for the year, we'll probably be in that 3% to 3.5% range."

Whether those wages are going to double, that is",559,"I think we have lived, as you mentioned, through kind of the perfect storm of cost increases in China back in 2007 with currency revaluations, with wage increases, and this year is potentially no different. Whether those wages are going to double, that is really a question mark, I think. When you're over there and I was in China the week that some of these announcements came out with respect to Fox gone in some of these other notes in the media. And there is always a different side to the story in terms of what's really happening. Clearly, there's a minimum wage increase, and that is something that is in the same sort of ballpark as what we've experienced in 2007. Beyond that minimum wage increase, what happens in terms of the market and the ability to hire people, we have not yet seen any significant changes in that respect vis-a-vis direct labor. And remember that these numbers that were thrown around, we're talking in general. And there are plenty of people your, for example, who we employ to make $2,000 million in revenue a month. we have engineers, we have supervisors, we have a lot of staff in China. we are not just running a factory with only workers and benches. These numbers need to be taken in the context, which is there is a full organization in China. And what do these blanket numbers really mean? At the same time, clearly in Amphenol, our organization is oriented in such a way that our general managers who run these 24 facilities that we today have in China, are not just held to one metric and say, well if that metric goes up, then now you have absolution for performance. As we have discussed many times, our general managers in China run businesses. And when you run a business, sometimes one or another input can change in its price. A commodity price can go up or down. Which could go up or down. A pricing dynamic can go up or down. And so you've got to deal with that in the context that it is. Every city is somewhat different. Every operation is a different in terms of its labor intensity, and our philosophy is that we are going to trust and empower those general managers to deal underground with what they have. That has proven itself for decades in Amphenol to be the best way to do battle with these cost increases. And whatever they will come this year, we're very confident in our ability to offset them. And pricing is another element, where we are not going to be the last to raise the price. Pricing is something that needs to take leadership, and we clearly view ourselves as a leader in this industry. And so we will act accordingly in those instances where it is feasible and where there is really the opportunity for pricing with our customers. I think that in 2007, we were able to expand margin, give that kind of perfect storm that happened, copper doubling, wages going up, currency going up 13%. I'm confident this year, even with the cost pressures that we've already seen, we've been able to extend our margin much more than maybe some even would have expected and we'll continue to have that opportunity in the future."

I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome everyone to our second quarter earnings call. Q2 results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company had a record second quarter, achieving strong growth in both sales and earnings per share and exceeding the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were $885 million, up 15% in U.S. dollars and 16% in local currencies over Q1 of 2010. Compared to last year, sales for the quarter were up 29% in U.S. dollars and 30% in local. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency impact, sales in Q2 2010 were up 15% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. 
Breaking down sales into our two major components. Our Cable business, which comprise 8% of our sales, was up 6% from last year and flat with last quarter. Sales growth over last year relates primarily to an increase in spending in international broadband market. The Interconnect business, which comprise 92% of our sales, was up 31% from last year and 16% sequentially. We saw strong demand in all of our markets, and Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income for the quarter was $176 million compared to $115 million last year. Operating margin was 19.8% compared to 16.9% last year and 18.8% last quarter. Operating income is net of stock option expense of approximately $6.2 million or 0.7% of sales in the 2010 quarter compared to $5.2 million and 0.8% of sales in the 2009 quarter. From a segment standpoint, in the Cable business, margins were 13.5%, down from 15.8% last year and 14.9% last quarter. The margin decline relates both the higher relative material costs and the impact of price reductions.
In the Interconnect business, margins were 22.3% compared to 19.3% last year and 21.1% in Q1 of 2010. The improvement in margin reflects the benefits of proactive and aggressive management of all elements of cost as volume has ramped back up. Overall, we're extremely pleased with the company's operating margin achievement of 19.8%. This represents the conversion margin on incremental sales over 2009 of approximately 30%. And we continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and cultured cost control will allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner and achieve strong profitability going forward.
Interest expense for the quarter was $10 million compared to $9.1 million last year. The increase over the prior year relates primarily to the inclusion in interest expense of fees on the company's receivable securitization program in accordance with the adoption of the new accounting rules effective January 1, 2010. In 2009, these fees, which totaled approximately $400,000, were included in other expense. The remaining increase in interest expense is due to higher average interest rates in the 2010 quarter.
In Q2 2010, the company had an effective tax rate of 21.3% compared to a rate of 27.5% in the second quarter of 2009. The 2010 quarter includes a $10 million or $0.06 per share net benefit, relating to a reduction in international tax expense, due primarily to the favorable settlement of certain tax positions and the completion of prior-year audits. Excluding these adjustments, the effective tax rate is approximately 27.5%, and we currently expect a similar tax rate in the third quarter of 2010.
Net income, excluding the tax benefit discussed above was $119 million, approximately 13.5% of sales, a very strong performance. Diluted earnings per share in Q2 was $0.74 as reported and $0.68 excluding the one-time tax adjustments. This is a growth of 58% over the prior-year quarter. And EPS growth rate of approximately 2x sales growth, demonstrating the company's significant operating leverage. Orders for the quarter were $910 million, up 10% from Q1 2010 and up 37% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.03:1. 
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $104 million in Q2 or 86% of net income in the quarter, excluding tax items. For the six months, operating cash flow is approximately equal to net income excluding tax items. Cash flow from operations, along with proceeds and related tax benefits from option exercises of $5 million, was used primarily for $25 million of capital expenditures; acquisition-related expenditures, net of cash acquired of $11 million, relating to the previously disclosed acquisition of an Asian manufacturer of specialty industrial interconnect products in April; dividend payments of $3 million; $20 million debt reduction; increases in short-term investments of $36 million; and a $5 million increase in cash. 
In addition to its strong operating cash flow, the company had availability of $602 million under its revolving credit facility, $72 million under its receivable facility and cash and cash investments of approximately $519 million. The company has more than sufficient liquidity to meet its needs.
During the quarter, the company renewed its $100 million receivable securitization program for a three-year term ending in May of 2013. In accordance with previous accounting rules, the facility was accounted for off-balance sheet as a sale of receivables. Effective January 1, those rules were changed, bringing the facility on balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, borrowings under the facility were $28 million and are reflected as long-term debt. At the end of December, approximately $82 million of receivables were sold under the facility and were excluded from the balance sheet.
The company continued its strong focus on balance sheet performance in the quarter. Days sales outstanding were unchanged from March at 66 days and within the company's normal range. Inventory in the quarter decreased 75 days at June from 82 days at the end of Q1 as inventory built in Q1 for higher Q2 demand was flushed out. We are very pleased with the strong operational execution that resulted in this inventory reduction. In addition, accrued liability at the quarter end reflect bigger income tax and interest payments in the quarter in accordance with the related payment requirements.
Debt was $782 million at June 30 compared to $802 million at the end of March, down $20 million. And the company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1.09x and 16x, respectively. EBITDA in the quarter was approximately $209 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. 
Adam will now provide an overview of the business."

It's a pleasure to speak with you on the occasion of our second quarter earnings release.

It's a pleasure to speak with you on the occasion of our second quarter earnings release. And today, I'll highlight some of those achievements in the second quarter, discuss the trends and the progress in our served markets, and then I'll provide some commentary on our outlook for the third quarter.
The second quarter was a record quarter for Amphenol in both revenues and earnings as our organization took advantage of a healthy demand environment to expand our overall position in the many diverse markets that we serve. As Diana mentioned, revenues increased 29% essentially all organic from prior year and a very strong 15% sequentially, representing our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential growth. 
We were especially pleased to continue our track record of generating strong operating leverage, leading to further expansion of our already leading operating margins to 19.8%. I would also like to note especially that we were successful in this quarter in growing our earnings per share at twice the rate of our revenue, achieving 58% growth in EPS. This is a significant achievement, especially given our already high levels of profitability. 
We generated strong cash flow of $104 million, which was used in part to fund our successful and ongoing acquisition program. We're very proud of these results, which are a direct reflection of the strength and discipline of our agile organization and our entrepreneurial management team.
In early July, we did complete the acquisition of Borisch Manufacturing. Borisch is a leading manufacturer of value-add interconnect and electro-mechanical systems for the military/aerospace market, with sales in the last 12 months of approximately $100 million. The acquisition of Borisch builds upon a long-established strategy in Amphenol of offering highly engineered, value-add solutions to customers in the military/aerospace market, creating additional strength for us in this very important segment. Also, consistent with our ongoing strategy, this acquisition is in line with finding complementary companies with strong management, leading technology and an excellent market presence. We're very optimistic that our acquisition program will continue to create value for Amphenol in the future.
Now turning to the trends and progress that we have made in our served markets. The military and aerospace market represented 19% of our sales in the second quarter, and sales increased 8% from prior year and 8% sequentially, with strength especially in communications and other military electronic systems. We were especially pleased in the quarter to experience a return to year-over-year and sequential growth in products for commercial aerospace applications and look forward to continued improvement in this important segment. While we expect overall organic demand in the military/aerospace market to moderate seasonally in the third quarter with the traditional vacation periods in North America and Europe, we continue to have a very positive outlook for this market, as new electronic functionalities continue to proliferate across all categories of military/aerospace equipment.
The industrial market represented 13% of our sales in the quarter and sales in that market increased a very strong 78% from prior year and 36% sequentially, as we experienced the continued improvement across all segments of the industrial market. We're very pleased to see an acceleration of our sales of new products for alternative energy applications across all regions, confirming our long-term strategy of focusing on new product development for those applications. Although we do expect some degree of normal seasonal moderation in the third quarter, we remain optimistic that our efforts in the many growth segments of the industrial market will continue to build momentum into the future.
The automotive market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter, and there again, sales increased a strong 30% from prior year, as we benefited from the continuing worldwide normalization of vehicle volumes. Importantly, we are beginning to see contribution from products designed into new Hybrid Electric Vehicles and continued to make progress in designing in our innovative products into these new vehicle models as they are released. Our long-term outlook for the automotive market remains very positive, with the general increase of electronics and cars, as well as the expanding opportunities that we see in Asia.
Our sales into the broadband communication market represented 9% of revenues in the quarter, and sales increased 13% from prior year and strengthened as well from the first quarter. We expect this market to strengthen further in the third quarter as we move into a typically more robust buildout period, and we look forward to the new opportunities for growth that continue to be created by our ongoing development of new cable and interconnect products, as well as by our positioning in growth markets overseas. These both position us very well for the future in the broadband market.
The information technology and data communications market represented 23% of our sales in the quarter. And in this market, sales were up a very strong 58% from prior year. We have seen demand continuing to improve across all segments of the IT market. In this market, we are participating in the ongoing acceleration of data-rich application, which is being driven in large part by the proliferation of new mobile Internet devices, as well as by the ongoing expansion of video on the Internet. These exciting technology shifts continue to create tremendous demand on networking and information technology equipment, driving continued momentum in this important market. Demand as well is still healthy for our high-speed and power products, which are used in servers, enterprise storage and networking equipment. We expect further strengthening of demand in the IT market in the third quarter, driven by market expansion, as well as our program wins with new advanced technologies, both of which positions us for continued expansion in this market.
Our sales into the mobile networks market represented 14% of revenues in the quarter. We're very encouraged to experience a return to year-over-year growth in the mobile networks market, with sales increasing 12% from prior year and 10% sequentially. We are enjoying growth related to next-generation network upgrades in developed geographies, much of which is related to expansion and support of new mobile Internet devices. In addition, the prospects of additional investment in next-generation networks in developing countries has the real potential to support additional demand in the second half of 2010. Although we expect some moderation in the third quarter, we remain very confident in the strength of our broad presence in new base station platforms, as well as our growing position in a diverse range of emerging markets.
Mobile devices represented 16% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased a very strong 26% from prior year and 34% sequentially. We benefited from Amphenol's leading position on new platforms, including especially those products sold into new smart mobile devices. We anticipate further sequential growth in the third quarter, as our comprehensive portfolio of products for mobile devices, combined with our preferred supplier relationships with all major device manufacturers continues to position us strongly for the future.
In summary, I am very proud of our organization, as we have executed extremely well in a very dynamic demand environment. Our continued focus throughout all economic cycles on reacting quickly to changing customer needs, while ensuring a relentless focus on profitability, has resulted in both the strengthening of our market position, as well as significant expansion of our industry-leading margins. The achievement of these new records in sales and earnings so soon after the economic crisis clearly confirms the strength of our strategies and solid execution. And our success is a direct result of this distinct and competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure, as well as an agile entrepreneurial management team.
As we look forward into the third quarter and based on a continuation of current economic trends, as well as normal summer seasonality in North America and Europe and also assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect in the third quarter the following results. We expect sales in the range of $880 million to $885 million and earnings per share in the range of $0.67 to $0.69. I am very confident in the ability of our outstanding organization to build on this new platform of record levels of performance and to capitalize on the many opportunities that we see to further grow our market position and to expand our profitability. 
And at this time, operator, we would be very pleased to entertain any questions that may be there."

And I hear -- when I visit customers with the executive, the sourcing executives of our customers, they appear to be spending the majority of their time flying around the world trying to find somehow sources of semiconductors. But relative to our products and those which we sell, our organization has reacted so fabulously to this incredible uptick. I mean, 15% sequential growth in the quarter, five straight quarters of sequential growth, coming out of what was not a fun situation in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 whereby, as you all know, we really flexed our organization downwards, reducing headcount by 21% from peak to trough and now have really flexed it back up to satisfy those customers.

At the end of the day, the way that we develop acquisitions is by developing long-term relationships with companies, by meeting with those companies, becoming acquainted and getting close to the management team. We believe that those efforts that have been ongoing for many years show a very, very strong pipeline for us for the future. Acquisitions remains our top priority in terms of capital allocation, together with new product development and investment on behalf of our growth. But that acquisition pipeline for us remains a very healthy one. And once again, as we look at these acquisitions, the receptiveness of the entrepreneurs and the owners of these companies towards becoming a part of Amphenol, just grows with everyday. They see the success that we have. They also see that we have an organizational culture and an organizational structure that is extremely hospitable to an acquisition, regardless of whatever idiosyncrasies may be in such an acquisition. They know that they fit in Amphenol, and they can find a platform for future growth in our company that they might not find with others. And so I think that allows us to really excel in acquisitions and allows us to build the business over time, that as we have done for a decade has this element of acquisitions, coupled with strong organic focus."

But I think if you would go back and look at what the typical seasonality has been, I think what you said would be fair. I think that the third quarter does have this little lower level of activity in North America and Europe. Clearly, that is not the case in Q4 as we would expect to see some sequential improvement in a normal environment. From a material cost perspective, whether copper or any other, I think that certainly, we used copper and gold and many other commodities in the production of our products. I think, as we have mentioned in the past, that we manage the total margins of our product, and that any given point in time have to deal with issues on material price on labor, on inflationary pressures in certain parts of the world. And we really look to manage the margin of each product on an individual basis to maximize that margin. And I think that we've been able to deal very well with commodity prices. I think that, typically, when those prices start to go down, there's a strong relationship between the price environment and the cost environment. The customers that we sell to are also certainly very aware of the way that cost pressures, whether it's material or labor, move up and down. And so, I wouldn't think that anyone should expect to see some sort of a windfall that may result in margins if copper or any of the other input costs move in any dramatic manner. I think that we've done a great job to manage that balance between price and cost to work towards achieving very strong margins. We did that in Q2. I expect we'll do that in Q3 and Q4 and into next year. But I wouldn't expect to see, again, any specific windfall from any specific movement in material cost in our margins."

Not just, Jim, relative to your question on which of these kind of categories does Borisch fall into. Let me just preface it by saying we are not a company that goes out and buys projects and restructuring projects. I mean, certainly, we have acquired companies in the past, where there has been a drive to improve the profitability and performance of the company. But we are not a company that goes in and says, let's go replace all the management and stick in new management and bring in consultants and restructure. That's not in our model at all. In the case of Borisch, clearly, we view Borisch as an opportunity to both expand our offering to our current customers within Borisch may or may not do business, in terms of offering a more complete solution  to those customers, number one. And number two, offering to these customers at Borisch also additional opportunities to expand their bill of material participation. What I can really tell you about the Military/Aerospace market and why this acquisition makes so much sense is customers in that market have consolidated and have professionalized. And professionalized, meaning they have gone, in many cases, from somewhat of a diaspora of independent units to now companies who say, we need to reduce our supply base. We need to go to a supplier who can offer us kind of a one-stop shop in terms of all of our interconnect and electromechanical needs. Borisch creates for us, here in North America, a new level of ability to go to these new customers, who are becoming more global, who are becoming more integrated and who are becoming more professional in terms of their sourcing management. And that just creates tremendous opportunities for us, all with the backdrop of the proliferation of electronics with these customers, many of whom, have never had to deal with complex electronic systems in the past. They were making a vehicle, for example, which had just mechanical features to it. And now, such a vehicle has a full suite of electronics that are integrated into that system, and they don't know how to deal with that. So the addition of Borisch, together with Amphenol, makes for us now, in the eyes of those customers, a true partnership. And it's a partnership that is embedded with technology, more than anything else. It creates a platform of technology to support for those customers."

So again, Greece, I'm sure is a problem for those who have invested in Greece. I'm sure Spain and Ireland are the same. But the customers with whom we deal continue to see strong momentum and opportunities, regardless of geography."

I think that it is true at some prior quarters, where we've gotten an enormous sequential sort of boom in places like the Wireless Device market. There've been, if you go back historically, the Wireless Infrastructure market can also be quite lumpy. There are years where we've had a big pop in Q3 in that market. And the same is true of the IT and Datacom equipment market, where you can have circumstances, to your point, where you have just this real big, big, big pop, particularly in the September time frame in those markets. And I think that is the circumstance where you then would see this other sort of this higher sequential performance in aggregate for the company in the third quarter. And it's certainly true that we are not guiding to expect a big sequential pop in any of those markets. I think that when Adam went through the individual markets, he did say that we do expect to see a sequential increase in Mobile Devices. We do expect to see a sequential increase in IT data. But I would say that they're more modest. And I think, given the very strong sequential performance that we've had in some of these markets over the last, quite frankly, what, four or five quarters, this seems to be the prudent way to think about the third quarter. And I think those are the thoughts that have gone in to establishing the guidance."

If you were to look at market surveys and reports, we'd be growing at 78%. We believe that we are expanding our position in that market. We have new technologies, new product developments. We have significant new investments in China, for example, where we have strong vertical integration, which creates for us also a platform to capitalize on that market, which clearly has strong growth prospects in the Industrial area, whether that be in rail mass transit, whether that be in factory automation and infrastructure related. So across the board, I think our strategy, which has been a long-serving strategy, to really break off that Industrial market into individual segments: oil and gas, geophysical, alternative energy, rail mass transit, and so on, has really paid some dividends here in terms of our position with the customers at the time of expansion. Clearly, when everything in the Industrial market is dropping significantly, which it did a year and a half ago, to expand your share at a time when everything is going down is not so easy. But those efforts pay real dividends at the time of growth. And I think that is what we are seeing here today, the new products, the new technologies and those ongoing efforts that we have around the world with customers."

And i think we have lived, as you mentioned, through kind of the perfect storm of cost increases in China back in 2007 with currency revaluations, with wage increases, and this year is potentially no different. Whether those wages are going to double, that is really a question mark, I think. When you're over there -- and I was in China the week that some of these announcements came out with respect to Foxconn and some of these other notes in the media. And there is always a different side to the story in terms of what's really happening. Clearly, there's a minimum wage increase, and that is something that is in the same sort of ballpark as what we've experienced in 2007. Beyond that minimum wage increase, what happens in terms of the market and the ability to hire people, we have not yet seen any significant changes in that respect vis-a-vis direct labor. And remember, that these numbers that were thrown around, we're talking in general. And there are plenty of people. For example, who we employ to make more than 2,000 renminbi a month. I mean, we have engineers, we have supervisors, we have a lot of staff in China. We are not just running a factory with only workers at benches. And so, these numbers need to be taken in the context, which is, there is a full organization in China. And what do these blanket numbers really mean? At the same time, clearly in Amphenol, our organization is oriented in such a way that our general managers who run these 24 facilities that we today have in China, are not just held to one metric and say, well, if that metric goes up, then now you have absolution for performance. As we have discussed many times, our general managers in China run businesses. And when you run a business, sometimes, one or another input can change in its price. A commodity price can go up or down. A wage  can go up or down. A pricing dynamic can go up or down. And so, you've got to deal with that in the context that it is. Every city is somewhat different. Every operation is different in terms of its labor intensity. And our philosophy is that we are going to trust and empower those general managers to deal on the ground with what they have. That has proven itself for decades in Amphenol to be the best way to do battle with these cost increases. And whatever they will come this year, we're very confident in our ability to offset them. And pricing is another element, where we are not going to be the last to raise the price. Pricing is something that needs to take leadership, and we clearly view ourselves as a leader in this industry. And so, we will act accordingly in those instances, where it is feasible and where there is really the opportunity for pricing with our customers. I think that in 2007, we were able to expand margins, given that kind of perfect storm that happened: copper doubling, wages going up, currency going up 15%. And I'm confident that this year, even with the cost pressures that we've already seen, we've been able to extend our margin much more than maybe some even would have expected, and we'll continue to have that opportunity in the future."

I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter call. The results were released this morning. I will provide some financial comments on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company had a record third quarter achieving strong growth in both sales and earnings per share and exceeding the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were $948 million, up 7% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies over the second quarter of 2010. Compared to last year, sales were up 32% in U.S. dollars and 33% in local currencies. 
From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency impact, sales in the third quarter were up 3% sequentially and 28% year-over-year, a very strong performance.
Breaking down sales into our two major components, our Cable business, which comprise 7% of our sales, was down 2% from last year and 1% from last quarter. The sales decline relates primarily to lower spending in North American broadband markets. The Interconnect business, which comprise 93% of our sales, was up 36% from last year and 8% sequentially, with growth in all markets. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income for the quarter was $189 million compared to $124 million last year. Operating margin was 19.9% compared to 17.3% last year. Operating income is net of stock option expense of approximately $7 million or 0.7% of sales in Q3 2010 compared to $5.2 million and 0.7% of sales in Q3 2009. From a segment standpoint in the Cable business, margins were 13.5%, down from 16.1% last year. The margin's decline relates both to higher relative material costs and the impact of market price reductions.
In the Interconnect business, margins were 22.3% compared to 19.6% last year. The improvement in margin reflects the benefits of proactive and aggressive management of all elements of costs as volume has ramped back up. Overall, we are very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement of 19.9%. This represents a conversion margin on incremental sales over last year of 28%. This is excellent performance in any environment, but particularly, in the space of increasing global inflationary pressure. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control will allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner and achieve strong profitability going forward.
Interest expense for the quarter was $10.6 million compared to $9 million last year. The increase over the prior year relates primarily to the inclusion in interest expense of fees on the company's receivable securitization program in accordance with the adoption of the new accounting rules effective beginning this year. In 2009, these fees, which totaled approximately $400,000, were included in other expense. In addition, interest expense includes one-time cost of $500,000 for the early extinguishment of debt relating to the write-off of unamortized referred debt issuance cost associated with the refinancing in August of the company's revolving credit facility.
In the third quarter, the company had an effective tax rate of 22.8% compared to a rate of 27.5% in the third quarter of 2009. The 2010 quarter includes an $8.4 million or $0.05 per share net benefit relating to a reduction in tax expense due primarily to the favorable outcome of certain international tax positions and the completion of prior-year audits. Excluding these adjustments, the effective tax rate is approximately 27.5%, and we currently expect the same type of rate in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Net income was approximately 14% of sales, a very, very strong performance. Diluted earnings per share in the third quarter was $0.78 as reported. Excluding the one-time tax adjustment, EPS was $0.73 and grew 55% over the prior year and EPS growth rate of approximately 1.7x sales growth, demonstrating the company's significant operating leverage. Orders for the quarter were $943 million, up 4% from Q2 2010 and up 27% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 0.99:1.
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $128 million or 98% of net income in the quarter excluding tax items. The cash flow from operations, along with proceeds and related tax benefits from option exercises of $16 million and borrowings under the company's credit and receivables facilities of $121 million was used primarily for capital expenditures of $29 million, acquisition-related expenditures of $151 million relating primarily to the previously disclosed acquisition of Borisch in July. Dividend payments of $2.6 million, $20 million relating to the purchase of a minority interest in the quarter, payment of $7 million in fees relating to the new revolving credit facility, and increases in short-term investments and cash and cash investments of $69 million.
In August, as previously reported, the company refinanced its senior credit facility. The new $1 billion facility matures in August of 2014. And at the end of the quarter, the company had availability under the facility of $785 million. The company also has a $100 million receivable securitization facility that expires in 2013. In accordance with previous accounting rules, this facility was accounted for off- balance sheet as a sale of receivables.
Effective at the beginning of this year, those rules were changed, bringing the facility on-balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, borrowings under the facility were $84 million and were reflected as long-term debt. At the end of last year, approximately $82 million of receivables were sold under the facility and were excluded from the balance sheet. In addition to its strong operating cash flow and availability under its revolving credit facility, the company had cash and cash investments of approximately $588 million at the end of the quarter.
The company continued a strong balance sheet focus during the quarter. Day sales outstanding were within the company's normal range at 67 days at the end of September, up one day from the end of June. Inventory in the quarter increased one day to 76 days at the end of September from 75 days at the end of June, and down from 80 days at the end of December. We are very pleased with the effect of the continued operational focus on inventory performance in 2010. In addition, the increase in both accrued acquisition liabilities and other long-term liabilities at quarter end relates primarily to the accrual of additional performance-based payments relating to the acquisition of Borisch July.
Debt was $904 million at the end of September compared to $782 million at the end of June, reflecting borrowings for the acquisition in July. The company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1.12x and 17.8x, respectively. And EBITDA in the quarter was approximately $225 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. 
Adam will now provide an overview of the business."

I'd like to spend a few minutes to highlight for you our third quarter achievements. I'll discuss some of the trends, as well as our progress in our served markets, and then I'll present some comments relative to our outlook for the fourth quarter.
As Diana has just discussed, we are very pleased that the third quarter for Amphenol was another record quarter in both revenues and earnings. In this quarter, we capitalized on our leading technology positions across the broad array of diversed markets to further expand our overall market position. Revenues increased 32% from prior year and 7% sequentially, representing our sixth consecutive quarter of sequential growth, clearly, a strong achievement. And despite significant inflationary pressures, we continue to expand profitability of the company, delivering strong 19.9% operating margin and an EPS growth of 55%. We should not forget, as Diana mentioned, net income achieving more than 14% of sales, an excellent achievement in any environment.
In addition, our close management of working capital resulted in strong cash flows that was used in part to fund our ongoing acquisition program. This excellent performance is a direct result of the efforts of our agile entrepreneurial management team around the world.
Now turning to our served markets. The Military and Aerospace market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased a very strong 38% from prior year and 23% sequentially, with stronger than seasonal strength, especially in military vehicles and aviation applications. We were especially pleased in the quarter to see some acceleration of growth and products for commercial aerospace applications and look forward to further momentum in this important growth segment.
We expect in the fourth quarter modest sequential growth from this already very strong third quarter performance and continue to be optimistic about the long-term prospects for this market, as new electronics products proliferate across all categories of military aerospace equipment. 
Our sales into the industrial market represented 12% of Amphenol this quarter, an increase of very strong 87% from prior year and 5% sequentially from the second quarter. This growth was driven by a continued broad recovery in the industrial market, together with an acceleration of the adoption of our new technologies, more than offsetting any seasonal summer softness in demand in this market. In particular, we are enjoying renewed growth from our efforts of targeting high-growth applications in emerging geographies, including especially rail-mass transit and energy-related application. We expect this market to sustain strength in the fourth quarter and are optimistic that our efforts in the many gross segments of the industrial market will continue to build momentum into the future.
The automotive market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased 5% from prior year and declined 4% sequentially, as we return to more normal demand patterns in the worldwide automotive market. We have continued to see more growth in new hybrid electric vehicles and are encouraged by our ongoing progress in designing our innovative products into these new vehicle models. 
During the quarter, we acquired a small automotive RF interconnect manufacturer. While not material from a financial perspective, we're very excited about the excellent strategic fit and potential this new addition brings to our efforts to expand in telematics application.
We expect demand in the automotive market to strengthen in the fourth quarter, and retain a very positive long-term outlook for this market, with the general increase of electronics and cars, as well as with the expanding opportunities in Asia and other emerging markets.
Our sales into the broadband communication market represented 8% of total this quarter and increased 3% from prior year and were essentially flat with the second quarter. Moderate demand for broadband network infrastructure was more than offset in the quarter by our sales of new value-added interconnect products. We expect demand in the broadband market to moderate seasonally in the fourth quarter, but look forward to long-term opportunities for growth that are being created by our ongoing development of new cable and interconnect products, as well as by our position in the growth markets overseas.
The information technology and Datacom communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were up a very significant 39% from prior year, with demand particularly strong in server and networking-related applications and were flat sequentially, sustaining the already strong levels achieved in the second quarter. We remain very excited about our participation in the ongoing acceleration of data-rich applications. This is driven in large part by the proliferation of new mobile Internet devices, as well as by the expansion of video on the Internet. In particular, we look especially forward to accelerating releases of new customer equipment, which incorporate our leading new high-speed products as end-customer demand continue to outstrip their current equipment capacity.
We expect some moderation of demand levels in the fourth quarter from recent highs and are very confident that our broad customer position, together with new advanced technologies, positions us for further long-term expansion in the IT and datacom markets.
The mobile networks market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. We were encouraged to experience another strong year-over-year quarter in the mobile networks market, with sales increasing 17% from prior year, albeit with a decline of 7% from the second quarter on expected seasonality. We continue to enjoy growth related to next-generation network upgrades in developed geographies, which is related in part to expansion in support of these new mobile Internet devices. Although we expect demand to moderate slightly in the fourth quarter on normal seasonality, we remain very confident in the strength of our broad presence in new base station platforms, as well as our excellent position in a diverse range of emerging markets.
The mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter, sales in this market increased a very strong 32% from prior year and 20% sequentially, as we capitalize on our strong technology position in a wide range of new mobile devices. Our leading innovation in interconnect products and antennas has positioned us now as the partner of choice with high-growth customers in the mobile market. We anticipate stable demand at these high levels in the fourth quarter and look forward to further long-term strength, as we partner with our diverse range of customers around the world to develop new products for these increasingly complex mobile devices.
In summary, with respect to the third quarter, I am extremely proud of our global organization, as we have continued to execute well in a very dynamic demand environment. Our continued focus throughout all phases of the economic cycle on reacting quickly to changing customer needs, while at the same time ensuring a relentless focus on profitability, has resulted in the strengthening of our market position and further expansion of our already industry-leading margin. Amphenol's success as reflected in these new record results is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse market, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure and an agile entrepreneurial management team.
Looking forward, in the third quarter, our performance was stronger than originally anticipated, and we are very encouraged to have an outlook for the fourth quarter that's at or near these levels. Based on a continuation of the current economic trends and assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect in the fourth quarter of 2010 the following: We expect sales in a range of $933 million to $948 million, or 23% to 25% growth over prior-year. And we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.71 to $0.73, again 36% to 40% year-over-year growth. 
I am very confident in the ability of our organization around the world to build on this new platform of record levels of performance and to capitalize on the many opportunities that we see to further grow our market position and to expand profitability.
And with that, operator, we would be very happy to entertain any questions, if there may be."

ROS of 19.9% and net income of sales of 14%, we just think are really excellent accomplishments in any environment, but particularly in an environment where we do see increasing global inflationary pressures. And we achieved the year-over-year conversion margin on incremental sales of about 28% against the backdrop of these costs. And we really think this is a tribute to the commitment of the operating management team to deliver planned profitability levels irrespective of metal price increases, gold price increases, wage increases in China and whatever other obstacles that may present itself in the next quarter. I think that we have, even though we've already achieved what we consider to be pretty high levels of profitability, as you point out, we do have a goal from a margin conversion margin standpoint to achieve $0.25 on the dollar for incremental sales, and we still have that goal as a team. And I think as a team, we do believe that there is still incremental margin expansion possible in the business. This margin expansion will come, I think, from the same places that it'd come from in the past. The first place that it comes from is by us continuing to create value for our customers with sales growth that's geared towards the highly engineered products that they need and focused technology areas of RF and power and harsh environment and high-speed, the types of things that Adam has talked about in the past. These create value for our customers, and they create value for us also. And then certainly, the ability of the local operating management to maximize the profitability of those products. And while that does get harder when you have some of these inflationary pressures, we believe that the focus that we do have on keeping all elements of cost flow is going to allow us to continue to expand margins. These strategies have allowed us to expand margin in the past, and we believe they'll allow us to continue to expand margin in the future."

And so whether that comes in a tiny mobile phone or whether it comes into a larger smart mobile device, it doesn't matter. They still have a thirst for technology that our organizations around world have been extremely successful at creating for them."

And I think that was really the big change that came from the prior guidance that's really helped to push us forward. Obviously, we had foreseen maybe in some other markets to see it grow where it was more flat. But on balance, we certainly saw across the company more strength there throughout the quarter, in particular in that military market and the industrial market.

But I would also guess that the overall industrial market certainly did not grow 87% on a year-over-year basis. And that difference is really where we see those new technologies taking hold. And these are broader than just a single application, a single product. We have talked before about those efforts that we've made into alternative energy, which clearly starts to bear fruit. New technologies that go into to rail mass transit, especially a concerted effort that we have made in emerging markets, whether that be in China, in India, where we have just tremendous ongoing efforts to work with new customers in those markets, again, to help them enable their technology. And if you just look at some of the ongoing developments in these markets, whether it be the new subway systems, new high-speed rail, new demands on alternative energy. A lot of the innovation in the world in the industrial market actually now starts to happen in these emerging markets, as opposed to the more traditional markets. And I think that's also partially explaining why the performance from a sequential standpoint, where we would normally expect it in the third quarter to be down sequentially was up. 5% on a sequential basis is an extremely strong performance for Industrial, which I think is really somewhat of a reflection of that same dynamic."

And I think that we certainly put a lot of effort into making sure that we are pricing the products for the value that we believe customers are receiving. And I think in an environment where you do have these inflationary pressures, pricing is one of the important pieces of the puzzle in terms of how we're able to achieve the margin levels that we look for. There certainly are other the actions, as well, I think, that we talked about in the past.  I mean we have a lot of effort that's expended in order to make sure that we use as little of certain materials as we can based on the assessment in the last year or so that there are certain metals that just seem only to be headed in one direction. And so we're certainly working hard on the cost side. But you're correct to point out that pricing will certainly be an important aspect for us.

And there, it may be that next quarter, as an example, if the pressure on material continues to happen that we may see some impact on the margin. But in aggregate, for the company, we would look to still be able to achieve our goals. It's just is in a more difficult environment."

I think as we've said in the past, from a prioritization standpoint, we look to use the company's financial capacity to fund the acquisition program. And it is difficult for us to forecast exactly which quarter a particular deal may become available to us. But we do believe that there's a good pipeline of potential opportunities out there. We still believe that this is the best vehicle for the company in terms of its long-term strategic growth, both on the top and bottom line.

So there's no step function, if you want, with those types of costs, either SG&A or in cost of sales that would trigger some step function increase in costs. Relative to SG&A levels in general, I think that our SG&A in the third quarter was something like, I don't know, 12.7% of sales or so. I think we do a pretty good job of being able to manage our SG&A levels at a pretty low cost level. That being said, I think in the quarter, we actually did have a few probably small upward pressures on SG&A relating to the acquisition that we did in the quarter. There are some intangibles that get recorded in purchase accounting for these acquisitions that get amortized into SG&A. And we did have some small level of transaction expenses, which also, under the new accounting rules, go into SG&A as opposed to going at into goodwill, as they did under the old rule. So SG&A in the third quarter is probably a little bit higher than it would have otherwise been. And at the high-end of guidance, it just sort of flat fills.[ph](51:18:9) It could be that SG&A as a percentage of sales does come down some as we move into the fourth quarter.

I think we have seen already in this year with 17% year-over-year growth, some benefit from especially the developed markets. And this is the infrastructure spending that has really gone to support all these new mobile devices and the various capacity constraints that have been in that market. What we haven't really seen this year has been a strong push from the emerging markets. I mean, you mentioned in particular India and their third-generation rollout. When that comes, I certainly hope you let me know when you find out because we don't have any better information. My experience, though, in India is that that will come probably at a time when the rest of the world does not have strong demand. Because Indian operators are notoriously shrewd in terms of when they procure a product that the OEMs and the equipment manufacturers are very hungry for business that they get good pricing power. And so when that comes, they have clearly spent the money on the licenses, and they have spent a lot of money. But I think they will time the build out of that to when they get the best power over the OEM's price. Relative to China, again, we had a year ago, year and a half ago now, the sort of launch of 3G in China. And there is a constant upgrade of those 3G networks in China, but none of those have the magnitude of an individual launch at the time which hopefully India will have at one point. Relative to 4G and LTE or one of the others, clearly, there's real momentum towards these that is coming. The schedules of the builds, whether it be in the United States or another market, I don't think these have been fully set forth, but we will have a strong participation. We have a strong participation of both the operator and the OEM level on all these new base station platforms with both our Interconnect products, as well as our antennas. And when that does come, we will be very, very well positioned to perform on that. I think it's the time when China built their 3G network. We proved to all of our customers that Amphenol is agile enough to sort of turn on a dime and support them when they need the support, and that's not forgotten by them as they go into these next several phases of build outs whether in emerging markets or otherwise. And we'll stand to enjoy very good business from that in the future."

I mean somewhat the nature of the world that manufacturing in. And I think it's a matter of just keeping a very certainly close watch on margins and making sure that were taking appropriate pricing actions, but also continuing aggressive cost reduction actions. With labor specifically, one can have an impact on how much labor content there is any particular product through use of things like semi-automation as an example through modification and product design. I mean, there are a lot of actions that you can take when you get those pressures. And I think our operating management team just does a great job in being very creative and coming up with new ways to deal and offset these types of the pressures. From a pricing standpoint, we are constantly certainly reviewing and adjusting prices where we can in the marketplace that isn't something that sort of done in a top-down price list-type fashion. I mean we have constant negotiation with many accounts throughout any given month. As you know, the business is very diverse. But I think that pricing decisions and actions are in our company, based off margin goals. Obviously, there is a competitive nature to pricing that can't be overlooked, but we continue to certainly try to maximize pricing. And I think that becomes a more important factor as these inflationary pressures get stronger. And so we're certainly spending more time on that in an environment like this.

We certainly will, and we'll certainly have an appetite for companies of any size regardless of what comes. At the same time, we don't shy away from small company as well if they bring with them a proprietary technology that allows us to create a platform of growth in the future. And I think those platforms for us have been strong contributors throughout the history of Amphenol in our acquisition program. We have what is today still a very vibrant acquisition pipeline, and on that pipeline, our companies of have shapes and sizes. And I think the fact is, as Diana alluded to earlier today, we are in a very strong position from a capital structure and on availability of resources to do those acquisitions. We are also in a very strong position in terms of the attractiveness of Amphenol to potential targets. We are seen in this industry really as the acquirer of choice. In large part because not only do we have a strong track record of success with these acquisitions, but we have an organizational structure which makes acquisitions have a good home. We don't seek to bring them into the company and change them and remold them and change all the things that are maybe not necessarily value add. Rather, we seek to create opportunities for those companies to come into Amphenol regardless of their own unique natures, which we applaud. Those unique natures of those companies coming to Amphenol and they prosper and they continue. And for years, we have companies who still have the name that they had 50 years ago even after joining Amphenol for half a century. And I think that that mindset towards acquisitions is one that makes us a very, very attractive candidate and an attractive home when someone is looking to sell a company.

We saw a little bit of inventory build but clearly, the turns were much stronger than they were one or even two years ago. And I think we have not seen in distribution necessarily a worrisome inventory trend that you may look out for at this time.

I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO and we’d like to welcome everyone to our third quarter call.
The results were released this morning. I will provide some financial commentary on the quarter and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We’ll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company had a record third quarter, achieving strong growth in both sales and earnings per share and exceeding the high end of the company’s guidance. Sales were $948 million, up 7% in both US dollars and local currencies over the second quarter of 2010.
Compared to last year, sales were up 32% in US dollars and 33% in local currencies. From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency impact, sales in the third quarter were up 3% sequentially and 28% year-over-year, a very strong performance.
Breaking down sales into our two major components, our cable business, which comprised 7% of our sales, was down 6% from last year and 1% from last quarter.
The sales decline relates primarily to lower spending in North American broadband markets. The interconnect business, which comprised 93% of our sales, was up 36% from last year and 8% sequentially, with growth in all markets. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income for the quarter was $189 million, compared to $124 million last year. Operating margin was 19.9%, compared to 17.3% last year. Operating income as net of stock option expense was approximately $7 million or 0.7% of sales in the Q3 2010 quarter compared to $5.2 million and 07% of sales in the Q3 2009.
From a segment standpoint, in the cable business, margins were 13.5%, down from 16.1% last year. The margin decline relates both to higher relative material costs and the impact of market price reductions. In the interconnect business, margins were 22.3%, compared to 19.6% last year. The improvement in margin reflects the benefits of proactive and aggressive management of all elements of cost as volume has ramped back up.
Overall, we are extremely pleased with the company’s operating margin achievement of 19.9%. This represents a conversion margin on incremental sales over year of 28%. This is excellent performance in any environment, but particularly in the phase of increasing global inflationary pressures.
We continue to believe that the company’s entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control will allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner and achieve strong profitability going forward.
Interest expense for the quarter was $10.6 million, compared to $9 last year. The increase over the prior year relates primarily to the inclusion in interest expense of fees on the company’s receivable securitization program in accordance with the adoption of the new accounting rules effective beginning this year.
In 2009, these fees which totaled approximately $400,000 were included in other expense. In addition interest expense include one-time costs of $0.5 million for the early extinguishing of debt relating to the write-off of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs associated with the refinancing in August of the company’s revolving credit facility.
In the third quarter, the company had an effective tax rate of 22.8%, compared to a rate of 27.5% in the third quarter of 2009. The 2010 quarter includes an $8.4 million or $0.05 per share net benefit relating to a reduction in tax expense due primarily to the favorable outcome of certain international tax positions and the completion of prior year audits.
Excluding, these adjustments the effective tax rate is approximately 27.5% and we currently expect a same type of rate in the fourth quarter of 2010. Net income was approximately 14% of sales, a very, very strong performance.
Diluted earnings per share in the third quarter was $0.78 as reported. Excluding the one-time tax adjustment, EPS was $0.73 and grew 55% over the prior year; an EPS growth rate of approximately 1.7 times sales growth, demonstrating the company’s significant operating leverage.
Orders for the quarter were $943 million, up 4% from Q2, 2010 and up 27% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 0.99 to 1.
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $128 million or 98% of net income in the quarter, excluding tax items.
The cash flow from operations along with proceeds and related tax benefits from option exercise of $16 million and borrowings under the company’s credit and receivables facilities of $121 million was used primarily for capital expenditures of $29 million; acquisition related expenditures of a $151 million relating primarily to the previously disclosed acquisition of an Borisch in July; dividend payments of $2.6 million; $20 million relating to the purchase of a minority interest in the quarter; payment of $7 million in fees relating to the new revolving credit facility and increases short-term investments and cash and cash investments of $69 million.
In August, as previously reported, the company refinanced its senior credit facility. The new $1 billion facility matures in August to 2014 and at the end of the quarter the company had availability under the facility of $785 million.
The company also has $100 million receivables securitizations facility that expires in 2013. In accordance with previous accounting rules, this facility was accounted for off balance sheet as a sale of receivables. Effective at the beginning of this year, those rules were changed bringing the facility on balance sheet.
At the end of the quarter, borrowings under the facility were $84 million and were reflected as long-term debt. At the end of last year, approximately $82 million of receivables were sold under the facility and were excluded from the balance sheet.
In addition to the strong operating cash flow and availability under which revolving credit facility, the company had cash and cash investments of approximately $588 million at the end of the quarter. The company continued a strong balance sheet focus during the quarter.
Day’s sales outstanding or within the companies normal range at 67 days at the end of September up one day from the end of June, Inventory in the quarter increased one day to 76 days at the end of September and 75 days at the end of June and down from 80 days at the end of December. We are very pleased with the effects of the continued operational focus on inventory performance in 2010.
In addition the increase in both accrued acquisition liabilities and other long-term liabilities at quarter end relates primarily to the accrual of additional performance base payments relating to the acquisition Borisch in July.
Debt was $904 million at the end of September compared to $782 million at the end of June reflecting borrowings for the acquisition in July.
The company’s leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1.12 times and 17.8 times respectively and EBITDA in the quarter was approximately $225 million. From a financial perspective this was an excellent quarter.
Adam will now provide an over view of the business.

I’d like to spend the few minutes to highlight for you our third quarter achievements and discuss some of the trends as well as our progress in our served markets and then I’ll present some comments related to our outlook for the fourth quarter.
As Diana has just discussed we are very pleased that the third quarter for Amphenol was another record quarter in both revenues and earnings. In this quarter we capitalized on our leading technology positions across the broad array of diverse market to further expand our overall market position. Revenues increased 32% from prior year and 7% sequentially representing our sixth consecutive quarter of sequential growth clearly a strong achievement.
Despite significant inflationary pressures, we continued to expand profitability of the company delivering strong 19.9% operating margins and an EPS growth of 55%. We should not forget as Diana mentioned, net income achieving more than 14% of sales an excellent achievement in any environment.
In addition, our close management of working capital resulted in strong cash flow that was used in part to fund our ongoing acquisition program. This excellent performance is a direct result of the efforts of our agile entrepreneurial management team around the world.
Now, turning to our served markets; the military and aerospace market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased a very strong 38% from prior year and 23% sequentially with stronger than seasonal strength especially in military, vehicles and aviation applications.
We were especially pleased in the quarter to see some acceleration and growth in products for commercial aerospace applications and look forward to further momentum in this important growth segment.
We expect in the fourth quarter modest sequential growth from this already very strong third quarter performance and continue to be optimistic about the long-term prospect for these markets, as new electronic proliferate across all categories of military aerospace equipment.
Our sales into the industrial market represented 12% of Amphenol this quarter and increased a very strong 87% from prior year and 5% sequentially from the second quarter. This growth was driven by a continued broad recovery in the industrial market, together with in acceleration of the adoption of our new technologies, more than offsetting any seasonal summer softness demand in this market.
In particular we are enjoying renewed growth from our efforts of targeting high growth applications in emerging geographies including especially rail mass transit and energy related applications.
We expect this market to sustain strength in the fourth quarter and are optimistic that our efforts in many growth segments of the industrial market will continue to bolt momentum into the future.
The automotive market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased 5% from prior year and declined 4% sequentially as we return to normal demand patterns in the worldwide automotive market. We have continued to see more growth in new hybrid electric vehicles and are encouraged by our ongoing progress in designing our innovative products into this new vehicle models.
During the quarter we acquired a small automotive RF interconnect s manufacturer. While not material from a financial perspective, we are very excited about the excellent, strategic fit and potential this new addition brings to our efforts to expand in Telematic applications.
We expect demand in the automotive markets to strengthen in the fourth quarter and retain very positive long-term outlook for this market with a general increase of electronics in cars, as well as with expending opportunities in Asia and other emerging markets.
Our sales into the broadband communication market represented 8% of total this quarter and increased 3% from prior year and was were essentially flat with the second quarter.
Moderate demand for broadband networking infrastructure was more than offset in the quarter by our sales of new value add interconnect products. We expect demand in the broadband market to moderate seasonally in the fourth quarter but look forward to long-term opportunities for growth that are being created by our ongoing development of new cable and interconnect products, as well as by our position in the growth markets overseas.
The information technology and data communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were up a very significant 39% from prior year with demand particularly strong in server and networking-related applications and were flat sequentially sustaining the already strong levels achieved in the second quarter.
We remain very excited about our participation in the ongoing acceleration of data rich applications. This is driven in large part by the proliferation of new mobile internet devices as well as by the expansion of video on the internet. In particular we look especially forward to accelerating releases of new customer equipment, which incorporate our leading new high-speed products, as end customer demands continue to outstrip their current equipment capacity.
We expect some moderation of demand levels in the fourth quarter from recent highs and a very confident that our broad customer position together with new advanced technologies positions us for further long-term expansion in the IT and datacom markets.
The mobile networks market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. We are encouraged to experience another strong year-over-year quarter in the mobile networks market, with sales increasing 17% from prior year, albeit with a decline of 7% from the second quarter on expected seasonality.
We continue to enjoy growth-related to next generation network upgrades in developed geographies. Which is related in part’s to expansion in support of these new mobile internet devices.
Although, we expect demand to moderate slightly in the fourth quarter on normal seasonality, we remain very confident in the strength our broad presence in new base station platforms, as-well-as our excellent position in a diverse range of emerging markets.
The mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased a very strong 32% from prior year and 20% sequentially, as we capitalize on our strong technology position in a wide range of new mobile devices.
Our leading innovation in interconnect products and antennas has positioned us now as the partner of choice with high-growth customers in the mobile market.
We anticipate stable demand at these high levels in the fourth quarter and look forward to further long-term strength as we partner with our diverse range of customers around the world to develop new products for these increasingly complex mobile devices.
In summary with respect to the third quarter I am extremely proud of our global organization as we have continued to execute well in a very dynamic demand environment.
Our continued focus towards all phases of the economic cycle and reacting quickly to changing customer needs, while at the same time ensuring a relentless focus on profitability has resulted in the strengthening of our market position and further expansion of our already industry leading margins.
Amphenol’s success as reflected in these new record results is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse market, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure and an agile entrepreneurial management team.
Looking forward, in the third quarter our performance is stronger than originally anticipated and we’re very encouraged to have an outlook for the fourth quarter that’s at or near these levels.
Based on a continuation of the current economic trends and assuming constant exchange rates. We now expect in the fourth quarter of 2010 the following: we expect sales in the range of $933 million to $948 million or 23% to 25% growth over the prior year and we expect earning per share in the range of $0.71 to $0.73 again 36% to 40% year-over-year growth.
I am very confident in the ability of our organization around the world to build on this new platform of record levels of performance and capitalize on the many opportunities that we see to further grow our market position and to expand profitability.
With that operator, we’ll be very happy to entertain any question if there may be.

Then we achieved the year-over-year conversion margin on incremental sales of about 28% against the backdrop of these costs and we really think that this a tribute to the commitment of the operating management teams that has delivered planned profitability levels irrespective of a metal price increases, gold price increases, wages increases in China and whatever other obstacles that may present itself in the next quarter.
I think that, even though, we’ve already achieved what we consider to be pretty high levels of profitability as you pointed out, we do have a goal from a conversion margins standpoint to achieve $0.25 on the $1 for incremental sales and we still have that goal as a team and I think as a team, we do believe that there is still incremental margin expansion possible in the business.
This margin expansion will come I think from the same places that it came from in the past and the first place that it comes from is by us continuing to create value for our customers with sales growth that’s geared towards the highly engineered products that they need and focus technology areas of RF and in power and harsh environment and high speed, the types of things that Adam had talked about in the past.
These create value for our customers and they create value for us also. Then certainly the ability of the local operating management to maximize the profitability of those products and while that does get harder when you have some of these inflationary pressures, we believe that the focus that we do have on keeping all elements of costs is always going to allow us to continue to expand margins.
Now, these strategies have allowed us to expand margin in the past and we believe they will allow us to continue to expand margin in the future.

Then I think when customers come to us for these products they are coming exactly for that reason Diana just alluded to, which is we are creating technology, which allows them to create a better experience for their customer at the end of the day.
So whether that comes in a tiny mobile phone, whether it comes in to a large or smart mobile device, it doesn’t matter, they still have a thirst for technology that our organizations around the world have been extremely successful at creating for them.

I would say we had foreseen maybe in some other market to see it grow where it was much flat, but on balance we certainly saw across the company more strength throughout the quarter, in particular in that military market and the industrial markets. I would say mobile phones or mobile devices was also stronger than we had originally anticipated.

I mean look I am not going to tell you that we would continue to have 87% year-over-year growth, but I would also guess that the overall industrial market segment certainly did not grow 87% on a year-over-year basis.
So that difference is really where we see the new technologies taking hold and these are broader than just a single application, a single product and we have talked before about the efforts that we made in to alternative energy, which clearly starts to bear fruit; new technologies that go into rail mass transits, especially concerted efforts that we have made in emerging markets whether it be in China, in India where we have just tremendous ongoing efforts to work with new customers in those markets, again to help them to enable their technology.
So if you just look at some of the ongoing developments in these markets whether it be with the new subway, system, new high speed rail, new demand on alternative energy; a lot of the innovation in the world in the industrial market is actually now starts to happen in these merging markets as opposed to the more traditional market.
Then I think that’s also partially explaining why that performance from a sequential standpoint where we would normally expect that in the third quarter to be down sequentially was up 5% on sequential basis is a extremely strong performance for industrial, which I think is really somewhat a reflection of that same dynamics.

Then we certainly look to in to the fourth quarter from certainly pricing is one action that’s important for us and I think pricing is a real art and I think that we certainly put a lot of effort in to making sure that we are pricing the products for the value that we believe customers are receiving and I think in an environment where you do have these inflationary pressure, pricing is one of the important pieces of the puzzle in terms of how we’re able to achieve the margins levels that we look for.
There are certainly our other actions as well. I think that we’ve talked in the past. We have a lot of efforts that is expended in order to make sure that we use as little of certain materials as we can, based on the assessment in the last year or so. There are certain metals that just seem only to be headed in one direction and so we are certainly working hard on the cost side but, you’re correct to point out that pricing will certainly be an important aspect for us.
I think, one part of the business where it’s a little bit more difficult as you know is on the cable side and there it may be that next quarter as an examples if this pressure on material continues to happen than we may see some impact on the margin, but in aggregate for the company we would look to still be able to achieve our goal just as in a more difficult environment.

As we said in the past from a prioritization standpoint, we look to use the company’s financial capacity to fund the acquisition program and it is difficult for us to forecast exactly which quarter a particular deal may become available to us.
So we do believe that there is a good pipeline of potential opportunities out there. We still believed that this is the best vehicle for the company in terms of its long-term strategic growth both on the top and bottom line.
So clearly if for some reason there was absolutely no acquisition opportunity for us over some longer period of time then certainly there are other options for the company, such as stock buyback or debt service. So I think at this point in time, we still feel very good about the acquisition program and the pipeline of opportunities that are out there.

We don’t have merit increases as you call them for the company as a whole with all the employees and sort of trigger that at one day. I mean we have employees all around the world and there are increases that are appropriate for the particular part of the world that happen in different times during the year. So there is no debt function if you want with those types of costs either in SG&A or in costs of sales that would trigger some sort of debt function increase in costs.
Relative to SG&A levels in general, I think that our SG&A in the third quarter was something like I don’t know 12.7% of sales or so and I think we did a pretty good job of being able to manage our SG&A levels at a pretty low cost level.
That being said I think in the quarter, we actually did have a few probably small upward pressures on SG&A relating to the acquisition that we did in the quarter, there are also some intangible that get recorded in purchase accounting for these acquisition that get amortized into SG&A and we did small level of transaction expenses, which also under the new accounting rules go in to SG&A as opposed to going into goodwill as they did under the old rule.
So SG&A in the third quarter is probably a little bit higher than it would have otherwise been in, at the high end of guidance. Which is sort of flat sales, it could be that SG&A as a percentage of sales does come down some as we move in to fourth quarter. I certainly wouldn’t expect it go up.

I think we have seen already in this year with 17% year-over-year growth, some benefits from especially the developed market and in this the infrastructure spending that has really gone to support all these new mobile devices and the various capacity constraints that have been in that market. What we haven’t really seen this year has been a strong push from the emerging markets.
I mean you mention in particular India, and that third generation rollout. When that comes, I certainly hope you’ll let me know when you find out, because we don’t have any better information. My experience though in India is that, that will come probably at a time when the rest of the world does not have strong demand. Because Indian operators are notoriously shrewd in terms of when they procure products that the OEM’s and the equipment manufacturers are very hungry for business such that they get good pricing power.
So when that comes, they have to clearly spend some money on the licenses and they’ll spend a lot of money, but I think they will time the build out of that to when they get the best power over the OEMs is reasonably priced.
Relative to China, again, we had a year ago, a year and a half ago now, a sort of launch of 3G in China and there is a constant upgrade of those 3G networks in China but none of those have the magnitude of an individual launch at the time which hopefully India will have at one point.
Relative to 4G and LTE or what else or others, clearly there is a real momentum towards that if that is coming, the schedules of the bill. Whether it would be in the United State or in another markets, I don’t think this have been fully set forth. So we will have a strong participation. We have a strong participation at both the operator and the OEM level on all these new base station platforms with both our interconnect products as well as our antennas. So when that does come, we will be very-very well positioned to perform on that.
I think at the time when China had build their 3G network, we proved to all of our customers that Amphenol is agile enough to sort of turn on a dime and support them when they need the support. So that’s not forgotten by them as they go into these next several phases of build that, whether in emerging markets or otherwise and we’ll stand to enjoy very good business from that in the future.

I mean, I think that, we’ve seen in the third quarter, we saw certainly pressures on metals and we certainly have seen increased wages in China and anywhere from sort of 12% type levels to the mid 20 depending on the progress that you are talking about.
So I mean all of those types of pressures certainly are things that we’ve had to deal with this past quarter and we’ll have to deal with in the next quarter and this is some what the nature of the world that we’re manufacturing in and I think it’s a matter of just keeping, certainly a close watch on margin and making sure that we’re taking appropriate pricing actions but also continuing aggressive cost reduction actions with labor specifically, one can have an impact on how much labor content there is any particular product to use of things like semi-automation as an example through modifications and product design
So there are a lot of actions that you can’t take when you get those pressures and I think our operating management team just does a great job and being very creative and coming up with the new ways to deal and offset these types of pressures.
From the pricing standpoint we are constantly, certainly reviewing and adjusting prices where we can in the marketplace. It isn’t something that is sort of done in a top down price list type fashion. I mean we have constant negotiations with many accounts through out any given month.
As you know the business is very diverse, but I think that pricing decision actions are in our company based on margins goals. Obviously there is a competitive nature to pricing that can be overlooked but we continue to certainly try to maximize pricing and I think that becomes the more important factor as these inflationary pressures get stronger and so we’re certainly obviously spending more time on that and in an environment like this, but I think those are all the types of things that we just need to do to continue to meet the margin goal that we have.

It becomes a very significant market for us 18% of our total sales in the quarter and we have achieved that through really a multipronged approach. We try to be the broadest supplier to the broadest level of customers in the broadest geographies. So that’s a very simple approach. At the end of the day, the underlying driver of that is our technology.
So as the products become more complex, certainly we see opportunity to get more content in those products whether that is that you are growing at a certain multiple of the market rate or not. I mean that I’m not going to tell you, because who knows what products are going to come, what the mix of those products would be.
So clearly, consumers are demanding products that have more functionality that come in smaller packages that have a real sort of seamless interaction with the internet and with the mobile network. I think in that area, clearly our products whether that be interconnect products or antennas or otherwise find just a real strong receptive mindset from our customers because of the technology that underlines those products.

I think we adopt a mindset in our company, really more like an accordion and where we seek to have flexibility around the world in both our people and our facilities and that’s why we generally don’t own our facilities.
We generally don’t build big campuses. We lease them; we create options for where if we need to expand facilities or equipment we have the capabilities to do that. If we need to strengthen, we also have the capabilities as we showed eighteen months ago. So to say what is some statistics on facilities utilization, I am sure today it is higher than it was at the depth of the downturn. That much I can tell you.
Is that a problem for us? Absolutely not. I think our organization on a worldwide basis has always followed a principle of preserving flexibility in terms of our infrastructure of the organization. That has been one of the drivers that allows us to have strong profitability in good times and in bad, because we are not writing things off when the bad times come and we are not overspending on them in the good times with inevitable write off to comes after that.
So, with that, as we look forward, I think your question is, is there some sort of additional incremental spending that has to come. Our CapEx varies, I think between 2.5% to 3.5% of sales over time and we don’t see any reason why that would be any different in the future.

I think our strategy with M&A has been - and is inconsistent on one front, which is we look for good complementary companies with excellent management teams and excellent technology. That doesn’t change regardless of size but I think if you look over the last two years, two of the three largest acquisition we have done have been really in the last 18 months with Times Microwave in Q1 of last year as well as Borisch just recently. So I think that those very significant acquisitions second in size only to the TCS acquisition in 2005.
Will we find more companies of that size? We certainly will and we’ll certainly have an appetite for companies of any size regardless of outcome. At the same time we don’t shy a way from small companies as well if they bring with them a proprietary technology that allows us to create a platform of growth in the future. I think that those platforms for us have been strong contributors throughout the history of Amphenol in our acquisition program.
We have what is today still a very vibrant acquisition pipeline and on that pipeline are companies of all shapes and sizes. I think the fact is as Diana alluded to earlier today, we are in a very strong position from a capital structure and an availability of resources to do those acquisitions.
We are also in very strong position in terms of the attractiveness of Amphenol to potential targets. We understand in this industry really has been a acquirer of choice, in large part because not only as do we have strong track record of success with these acquisitions but we have an organizational structure, which makes acquisitions have a good home.
We don’t seek to bring them in to the company and change them and remold them and change all the things that are maybe not necessarily value-add, rather we stick to create opportunities for those companies to come in to Amphenol regardless of their own unique natures, which we apply.
Those unique natures of those companies coming to Amphenol and they prosper and they continue in for years. We have companies who still have the name that they had 50 years ago even after joining Amphenol for half century. So I think that mindset towards acquisitions is one that makes us a very-very attractive candidate and an attractive home when some one is looking to sell a company and I believe that will allow us going forward to continue to have the strong acquisition program.

I think, its very encouraging to see that the new aeroplane platform, whether that would be 787, whether that be 8350 which combined between the two of them have nearly 1400 orders on the book. So, it’s just a fabulous prospect for that industry which have to adopt these new platforms.
I mean, regardless of what is happening in the economic cycle, the price of fuel is not dropping in any significant way, which means that this new aeroplane platform on which there is a much higher opportunity for electronic content by Amphenol, those were going to fly in the sky.

Certainly, not going to be the one to bet on when that will actually be flying in the sky in a big way, but there is no doubt that it will be and that time that’s going to be a significant contributor for the company.

I'm here together with Adam Norwitt, our CEO, and we'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter call. The results were released this morning. I will provide some financial comments on the quarter, and Adam will give an overview of the business and current trends. We'll then have a question-and-answer session.
The company had a record third quarter achieving strong growth in both sales and earnings per share and exceeding the high end of the company's guidance. Sales were $948 million, up 7% in both U.S. dollars and local currencies over the second quarter of 2010. Compared to last year, sales were up 32% in U.S. dollars and 33% in local currencies. 
From an organic standpoint, excluding both acquisitions and currency impact, sales in the third quarter were up 3% sequentially and 28% year-over-year, a very strong performance.
Breaking down sales into our two major components, our Cable business, which comprised 7% of our sales, was down 2% from last year and 1% from last quarter. The sales decline relates primarily to lower spending in North American broadband markets. The Interconnect business, which comprised 93% of our sales, was up 36% from last year and 8% sequentially, with growth in all markets. Adam will comment further on trends by market in a few minutes.
Operating income for the quarter was $189 million compared to $124 million last year. Operating margin was 19.9% compared to 17.3% last year. Operating income is net of stock option expense of approximately $7 million or 0.7% of sales in Q3 2010 compared to $5.2 million and 0.7% of sales in Q3 2009. From a segment standpoint in the Cable business, margins were 13.5%, down from 16.1% last year. The margin's decline relates both to higher relative material costs and the impact of market price reductions.
In the Interconnect business, margins were 22.3% compared to 19.6% last year. The improvement in margin reflects the benefits of proactive and aggressive management of all elements of costs as volume has ramped back up. Overall, we are very pleased with the company's operating margin achievement of 19.9%. This represents a conversion margin on incremental sales over last year of 28%. This is excellent performance in any environment, but particularly, in the space of increasing global inflationary pressures. We continue to believe that the company's entrepreneurial operating structure and culture of cost control will allow us to react in a fast and flexible manner and achieve strong profitability going forward.
Interest expense for the quarter was $10.6 million compared to $9 million last year. The increase over the prior year relates primarily to the inclusion in interest expense of fees on the company's receivable securitization program in accordance with the adoption of the new accounting rules effective beginning this year. In 2009, these fees, which totaled approximately $400,000, were included in other expense. In addition, interest expense includes one-time costs of $500,000 for the early extinguishment of debt relating to the write-off of unamortized referred debt issuance cost associated with the refinancing in August of the company's revolving credit facility.
In the third quarter, the company had an effective tax rate of 22.8% compared to a rate of 27.5% in the third quarter of 2009. The 2010 quarter includes an $8.4 million or $0.05 per share net benefit relating to a reduction in tax expense due primarily to the favorable outcome of certain international tax positions and the completion of prior-year audits. Excluding these adjustments, the effective tax rate is approximately 27.5%, and we currently expect the same type of rate in the fourth quarter of 2010.
Net income was approximately 14% of sales, a very, very strong performance. Diluted earnings per share in the third quarter was $0.78 as reported. Excluding the one-time tax adjustments, EPS was $0.73 and grew 55% over the prior year and EPS growth rate of approximately 1.7x sales growth, demonstrating the company's significant operating leverage. Orders for the quarter were $943 million, up 4% from Q2 2010 and up 27% from last year, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 0.99:1.
The company continues to be an excellent generator of cash. Cash flow from operations was $128 million or 98% of net income in the quarter excluding tax items. The cash flow from operations, along with proceeds and related tax benefits from option exercises of $16 million and borrowings under the company's credit and receivables facilities of $121 million was used primarily for capital expenditures of $29 million, acquisition-related expenditures of $151 million relating primarily to the previously disclosed acquisition of Borisch in July. Dividend payments of $2.6 million, $20 million relating to the purchase of a minority interest in the quarter, payment of $7 million in fees relating to the new revolving credit facility, and increases in short-term investments and cash and cash investments of $69 million.
In August, as previously reported, the company refinanced its senior credit facility. The new $1 billion facility matures in August of 2014. And at the end of the quarter, the company had availability under the facility of $785 million. The company also has a $100 million receivable securitization facility that expires in 2013. In accordance with previous accounting rules, this facility was accounted for off- balance sheet as a sale of receivables.
Effective at the beginning of this year, those rules were changed, bringing the facility on-balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, borrowings under the facility were $84 million and were reflected as long-term debt. At the end of last year, approximately $82 million of receivables were sold under the facility and were excluded from the balance sheet. In addition to its strong operating cash flow and availability under its revolving credit facility, the company had cash and cash investments of approximately $588 million at the end of the quarter.
The company continued a strong balance sheet focus during the quarter. Day sales outstanding were within the company's normal range at 67 days at the end of September, up one day from the end of June. Inventory in the quarter increased one day to 76 days at the end of September from 75 days at the end of June, and down from 80 days at the end of December. We are very pleased with the effect of the continued operational focus on inventory performance in 2010. In addition, the increase in both accrued acquisition liabilities and other long-term liabilities at quarter end relates primarily to the accrual of additional performance-based payments relating to the acquisition of Borisch in July.
Debt was $904 million at the end of September compared to $782 million at the end of June, reflecting borrowings for the acquisition in July. The company's leverage and interest coverage ratios remain very strong at 1.12x and 17.8x, respectively. And EBITDA in the quarter was approximately $225 million. From a financial perspective, this was an excellent quarter. 
Adam will now provide an overview of the business."

I'd like to spend a few minutes to highlight for you our third quarter achievements. I'll discuss some of the trends, as well as our progress in our served markets, and then I'll present some comments relative to our outlook for the fourth quarter.
As Diana has just discussed, we are very pleased that the third quarter for Amphenol was another record quarter in both revenues and earnings. In this quarter, we capitalized on our leading technology positions across a broad array of diverse markets to further expand our overall market position. Revenues increased 32% from prior year and 7% sequentially, representing our sixth consecutive quarter of sequential growth, clearly, a strong achievement. And despite significant inflationary pressures, we continue to expand profitability of the company, delivering strong 19.9% operating margin and an EPS growth of 55%. We should not forget, as Diana mentioned, net income achieving more than 14% of sales, an excellent achievement in any environment.
In addition, our close management of working capital resulted in strong cash flows that was used in part to fund our ongoing acquisition program. This excellent performance is a direct result of the efforts of our agile entrepreneurial management team around the world.
Now turning to our served markets. The Military and Aerospace market represented 22% of our sales in the quarter. Sales in this market increased a very strong 38% from prior year and 23% sequentially, with stronger than seasonal strength, especially in military vehicles and aviation applications. We were especially pleased in the quarter to see some acceleration of growth and products for commercial aerospace applications and look forward to further momentum in this important growth segment.
We expect in the fourth quarter modest sequential growth from this already very strong third quarter performance and continue to be optimistic about the long-term prospects for this market, as new electronics products proliferate across all categories of military aerospace equipment. 
Our sales into the industrial market represented 12% of Amphenol this quarter, an increase of very strong 87% from prior year and 5% sequentially from the second quarter. This growth was driven by a continued broad recovery in the industrial market, together with an acceleration of the adoption of our new technologies, more than offsetting any seasonal summer softness in demand in this market. In particular, we are enjoying renewed growth from our efforts of targeting high-growth applications in emerging geographies, including especially rail-mass transit and energy-related application. We expect this market to sustain strength in the fourth quarter and are optimistic that our efforts in the many growth segments of the industrial market will continue to build momentum into the future.
The automotive market represented 6% of our sales in the quarter and sales increased 5% from prior year and declined 4% sequentially, as we return to more normal demand patterns in the worldwide automotive market. We have continued to see more growth in new hybrid electric vehicles and are encouraged by our ongoing progress in designing our innovative products into these new vehicle models. 
During the quarter, we acquired a small automotive RF interconnect manufacturer. While not material from a financial perspective, we're very excited about the excellent strategic fit and potential this new addition brings to our efforts to expand in telematics application.
We expect demand in the automotive market to strengthen in the fourth quarter, and retain a very positive long-term outlook for this market, with the general increase of electronics and cars, as well as with the expanding opportunities in Asia and other emerging markets.
Our sales into the broadband communication market represented 8% of total this quarter and increased 3% from prior year and were essentially flat with the second quarter. Moderate demand for broadband network infrastructure was more than offset in the quarter by our sales of new value-added interconnect products. We expect demand in the broadband market to moderate seasonally in the fourth quarter, but look forward to long-term opportunities for growth that are being created by our ongoing development of new cable and interconnect products, as well as by our position in the growth markets overseas.
The information technology and Datacom communications market represented 21% of our sales in the quarter. Sales were up a very significant 39% from prior year, with demand particularly strong in server and networking-related applications and were flat sequentially, sustaining the already strong levels achieved in the second quarter. We remain very excited about our participation in the ongoing acceleration of data-rich applications. This is driven in large part by the proliferation of new mobile Internet devices, as well as by the expansion of video on the Internet. In particular, we look especially forward to accelerating releases of new customer equipment, which incorporate our leading new high-speed products as end-customer demands continue to outstrip their current equipment capacity.
We expect some moderation of demand levels in the fourth quarter from recent highs and are very confident that our broad customer position, together with new advanced technologies, positions us for further long-term expansion in the IT and datacom markets.
The mobile networks market represented 12% of our sales in the quarter. We were encouraged to experience another strong year-over-year quarter in the mobile networks market, with sales increasing 17% from prior year, albeit with a decline of 7% from the second quarter on expected seasonality. We continue to enjoy growth related to next-generation network upgrades in developed geographies, which is related in part to expansion and support of these new mobile Internet devices. Although we expect demand to moderate slightly in the fourth quarter on normal seasonality, we remain very confident in the strength of our broad presence in new base station platforms, as well as our excellent position in a diverse range of emerging markets.
The mobile devices market represented 18% of our sales in the quarter, sales in this market increased a very strong 32% from prior year and 20% sequentially, as we capitalize on our strong technology position in a wide range of new mobile devices. Our leading innovation in interconnect products and antennas has positioned us now as the partner of choice with high-growth customers in the mobile market. We anticipate stable demand at these high levels in the fourth quarter and look forward to further long-term strength, as we partner with our diverse range of customers around the world to develop new products for these increasingly complex mobile devices.
In summary, with respect to the third quarter, I am extremely proud of our global organization, as we have continued to execute well in a very dynamic demand environment. Our continued focus throughout all phases of the economic cycle, on reacting quickly to changing customer needs while at the same time ensuring a relentless focus on profitability, has resulted in the strengthening of our market position and further expansion of our already industry-leading margin. Amphenol's success as reflected in these new record results is a direct reflection of our distinct competitive advantages, our leading technology, our increasing position with customers in diverse markets, our worldwide presence, a lean and flexible cost structure and an agile entrepreneurial management team.
Looking forward, in the third quarter, our performance was stronger than originally anticipated, and we are very encouraged to have an outlook for the fourth quarter that's at or near these levels. Based on a continuation of the current economic trends and assuming constant exchange rates, we now expect in the fourth quarter of 2010 the following: We expect sales in a range of $933 million to $948 million, or 23% to 25% growth over prior-year. And we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.71 to $0.73, again 36% to 40% year-over-year growth. 
I am very confident in the ability of our organization around the world to build on this new platform of record levels of performance and to capitalize on the many opportunities that we see to further grow our market position and to expand profitability.
And with that, operator, we would be very happy to entertain any questions, if there may be."

ROS of 19.9% and net income of sales of 14%, we just think are really excellent accomplishments in any environment, but particularly in an environment where we do see increasing global inflationary pressures. And we achieved the year-over-year conversion margin on incremental sales of about 28% against the backdrop of these costs. And we really think this is a tribute to the commitment of the operating management team to deliver planned profitability levels irrespective of metal price increases, gold price increases, wage increases in China and whatever other obstacles that may present itself in the next quarter. I think that we have, even though we've already achieved what we consider to be pretty high levels of profitability, as you point out, we do have a goal from a conversion margin standpoint to achieve $0.25 on the dollar for incremental sales, and we still have that goal as a team. And I think as a team, we do believe that there is still incremental margin expansion possible in the business. This margin expansion will come, I think, from the same places that it's come from in the past. The first place that it comes from is by us continuing to create value for our customers with sales growth that's geared towards the highly engineered products that they need and focused technology areas of RF and power and harsh environment and high-speed, the types of things that Adam has talked about in the past. These create value for our customers, and they create value for us also. And then certainly, the ability of the local operating management to maximize the profitability of those products. And while that does get harder when you have some of these inflationary pressures, we believe that the focus that we do have on keeping all elements of cost low is going to allow us to continue to expand margins. These strategies have allowed us to expand margin in the past, and we believe they'll allow us to continue to expand margin in the future."

And I think that was really the big change that came from the prior guidance which really helped to push us forward. Obviously, we had foreseen maybe in some other markets to see it grow where it was more flat. But on balance, we certainly saw across the company more strength there throughout the quarter, in particular in that military market and the industrial market. Obviously, mobile phones or Mobile Devices was also stronger than we had originally anticipated."

But I would also guess that the overall industrial market certainly did not grow 87% on a year-over-year basis. And that difference is really where we see those new technologies taking hold. And these are broader than just a single application, a single product. We have talked before about those efforts that we've made into alternative energy, which clearly starts to bear fruit. New technologies that go into to rail mass transit, especially a concerted effort that we have made in emerging markets, whether that be in China, in India, where we have just tremendous ongoing efforts to work with new customers in those markets, again, to help them enable their technology. And if you just look at some of the ongoing developments in these markets, whether it be with the new subway systems, new high-speed rail, new demands on alternative energy, a lot of the innovation in the world in the industrial market actually now starts to happen in these emerging markets, as opposed to the more traditional markets. And I think that's also partially explaining why the performance from a sequential standpoint, where we would normally expect it in the third quarter to be down sequentially was up. 5% on a sequential basis is an extremely strong performance for Industrial, which I think is really somewhat of a reflection of that same dynamic."

Certainly pricing is one action that's important for us, and I think pricing is a real art. And I think that we certainly put a lot of effort into making sure that we are pricing the products for the value that we believe customers are receiving. And I think in an environment where you do have these inflationary pressures, pricing is one of the important pieces of the puzzle in terms of how we're able to achieve the margin levels that we look for. There certainly are other the actions, as well, I think, that we talked about in the past.  I mean we have a lot of effort that's expended in order to make sure that we use as little of certain materials as we can based on the assessment in the last year or so that there are certain metals that just seem only to be headed in one direction. And so we're certainly working hard on the cost side. But you're correct to point out that pricing will certainly be an important aspect for us. I think the one part of the business where it's a little bit more difficult, as you know, is on the cable side. And there, it may be that next quarter, as an example, if the pressure on material continues to happen that we may see some impact on the margin.

I think as we've said in the past, from a prioritization standpoint, we look to use the company's financial capacity to fund the acquisition program. And it is difficult for us to forecast exactly which quarter a particular deal may become available to us. But we do believe that there's a good pipeline of potential opportunities out there. We still believe that this is the best vehicle for the company in terms of its long-term strategic growth, both on the top and bottom line.

I think that we've gone through a year and a half, almost two years here of sort of a down and up cycles. And I think that when you're still sort of at the tail end of that, I think normal seasonality is not so easy to define. I think we sit here at Q3 coming off a record quarter for the company that is at a significantly high level from a sales perspective.

This guidance is put together in the same fashion that we've put together guidance every quarter in a very bottoms-up fashion. And we believe that this is strong guidance for the quarter."

I mean we have employees all around the world, and there are increases that are appropriate for the particularly part of the world that happen at different times during the year. So there's no step function, if you want, with those types of costs, either in SG&A or in cost of sales that would trigger some step function increase in costs. Relative to SG&A levels in general, I think that our SG&A in the third quarter was something like, I don't know, 12.7% of sales or so. I think we do a pretty good job of being able to manage our SG&A levels at a pretty low cost level. That being said, I think in the quarter, we actually did have a few probably small upward pressures on SG&A relating to the acquisition that we did in the quarter. There are some intangibles that get recorded in purchase accounting for these acquisitions that get amortized into SG&A. And we did have some small level of transaction expenses, which also, under the new accounting rules, go into SG&A as opposed to going at into goodwill, as they did under the old rule. So SG&A in the third quarter is probably a little bit higher than it would have otherwise been. And at the high-end of guidance, which is sort of flat sales[ph](51:18:9), it could be that SG&A as a percentage of sales does come down some as we move into the fourth quarter.

I think we have seen already in this year with 17% year-over-year growth, some benefit from especially the developed markets. And this is the infrastructure spending that has really gone to support all these new mobile devices and the various capacity constraints that have been in that market. What we haven't really seen this year has been a strong push from the emerging markets. I mean, you mentioned in particular India and their third-generation rollout. When that comes, I certainly hope you let me know when you find out because we don't have any better information. My experience, though, in India is that that will come probably at a time when the rest of the world does not have strong demand because the Indian operators are notoriously shrewd in terms of when they procure a product that the OEMs and the equipment manufacturers are very hungry for business that they get good pricing power. And so when that comes, they have clearly spent the money on the licenses, and they have spent a lot of money. But I think they will time the build out of that to when they get the best power over the OEM's price. Relative to China, again, we had a year ago, year and a half ago now, the sort of launch of 3G in China. And there is a constant upgrade of those 3G networks in China, but none of those have the magnitude of an individual launch at the time which hopefully India will have at one point. Relative to 4G and LTE or whatever others, clearly, there's real momentum towards these that is coming. The schedules of the builds, whether theyÕll be in the United States or another market, I don't think these have been fully set forth, but we will have a strong participation. We have a strong participation of both the operator and the OEM level on all these new base station platforms with both our Interconnect products as well as our antennas. And when that does come, we will be very, very well positioned to perform on that. I think it's the time when China built their 3G network, we proved to all of our customers that Amphenol is agile enough to sort of turn on a dime and support them when they need the support, and that's not forgotten by them as they go into these next several phases of build outs whether in emerging markets or otherwise. And we'll stand to enjoy very good business from that in the future."

And we certainly have seen increased wages in China and anywhere from sort of 12% type levels to mid-20s, depending on the products that you are talking about. So I mean all of those types of pressure certainly are things that we've had to deal with this past quarter and we'll have to deal with next quarter. I mean somewhat the nature of the world that we are manufacturing in. And I think it's a matter of just keeping a very certainly close watch on margin and making sure that were taking appropriate pricing actions, but also continuing aggressive cost reduction actions. With labor specifically, one can have an impact on how much labor content there is any particular product through use of things like semi-automation as an example through modifications and product design. I mean, there are a lot of actions that you can take when you get those pressures. And I think our operating management team just does a great job in being very creative and coming up with new ways to deal and offset these types of the pressures. From a pricing standpoint, we are constantly certainly reviewing and adjusting prices where we can in the marketplace that isn't something thatÕs sort of done in a top-down price list-type fashion. I mean we have constant negotiations with many accounts throughout any given month. As you know, the business is very diverse. But I think that pricing decisions and actions are in our company, based off margin goals. Obviously, there is a competitive nature to pricing that can't be overlooked, but we continue to certainly try to maximize pricing. And I think that becomes a more important factor as these inflationary pressures get stronger. And so we're certainly spending more time on that in an environment like this. I think those are all the types of things that we just need to do to continue to meet the margin growth that we have."

You know our CapEx varies I think between 2.5% and 3.5% of sales over time, and we don't see any reason why that would be any different in the future."

And that doesn't change regardless of size. But I think if you look over the last two years, two of the three largest acquisitions we have done has been really in the last 18 months, with Times Microwave in Q1 of last year, as well as Borisch just recently. And I think that those are very significant acquisitions second in size only to the TCS acquisition in 2005. And will we find more companies of that size? We certainly will, and we'll certainly have an appetite for companies of any size regardless of what comes. At the same time, we don't shy away from small companies as well if they bring with them a proprietary technology that allows us to create a platform of growth in the future. And I think those platforms for us have been strong contributors throughout the history of Amphenol in our acquisition program. We have what is today still a very vibrant acquisition pipeline, and on that pipeline, our companies have shapes and sizes. And I think the fact is, as Diana alluded to earlier today, we are in a very strong position from a capital structure and on availability of resources to do those acquisitions. We are also in a very strong position in terms of the attractiveness of Amphenol to potential targets. We are seen in this industry really as the acquirer of choice. In large part because not only do we have a strong track record of success with these acquisitions, but we have an organizational structure which makes acquisitions have a good home. We don't seek to bring them into the company and change them and remold them and change all the things that are maybe not necessarily value add. Rather, we seek to create opportunities for those companies to come into Amphenol regardless of their own unique natures, which we applaud. Those unique natures of those companies coming to Amphenol and they prosper and they continue. And for years, we have companies who still have the name that they had 50 years ago even after joining Amphenol for half a century. And I think that that mindset towards acquisitions is one that makes us a very, very attractive candidate and an attractive home when someone is looking to sell a company. And I believe that that will allow us going forward to continue to have a strong acquisition program."

We did not see significant inventory builds in our distribution channel. That is one area where we get to see a little bit more visibility than in the others. We saw a little bit of inventory build but clearly, the turns were much stronger than they were one or even two years ago. And I think we have not seen in distribution necessarily a worrisome inventory trend that you may look out for at this time. Relative to distributors going into the fourth quarter and towards the end of the third quarter, I wouldn't say that it was as frothy maybe in terms of the growth as it had been in the past, but there's not these kind of warning signs of inventory levels that we certainly look out for."

Commercial Aerospace was certainly a sector that was hit very, very hard in the downturn, as you know and as everyone is very clear on. I think whether with the Boeing results today or the results that we see and the words that we hear from the customers, clearly, the trend in Commercial Air is one that is more positive today than it was six months ago. I think it's very encouraging to see that the new airplane platforms, whether that be 787, whether that be A350, which combine between the two of them have nearly 1,400 orders on the books. I mean it's just a fabulous prospect for that industry, which has to adopt these new platforms. I mean, regardless of what is happening in the economic cycle, the price of fuel is not dropping in any significant way, which means that these new airplane platforms on which there is a much higher opportunity for electronic content by Amphenol, those are going to fly in the sky. Whether they get delayed one or two or three or in some cases five quarters out, those planes are going to fly. And at the time they fly, we'll be very happy to enjoy the business. I can't tell you when they will release these planes. Certainly not going to be the one to bet on when that will actually be flying in the sky in a big way but there's no doubt that it will be. And at that time, that's going to be a significant contributor for the company."
