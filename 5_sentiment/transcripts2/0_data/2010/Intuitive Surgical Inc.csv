Against the backdrop of significant uncertainty in 2009, our team adapted well to the changing environment and our procedure in capital businesses, and our operations organization remains focused on delivering quality products in the midst of financial constraints. Our operating highlights for the fourth quarter are as follows: Procedures grew 44% over the fourth quarter of 2008. We sold 110 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 85 soldiering the fourth quarter of last year. Our international team contributed 30 of the 110 systems sold. We ended the fourth quarter with 1,395 da Vinci Systems installed worldwide. Total revenue for the quarter was $323 million, up 40% over fourth quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $113 million, up 39%. Total recurring revenue, including service, grew to $161 million, up 37% from the prior year and comprising 50% of total revenues.We generated an operating profit of $153 million before non-cash stock compensation expenses, up 47% from the fourth quarter of last year, and GAAP net income grew to $78 million, up 53% from fourth quarter of last year. For the full-year 2009, worldwide procedures grew by 51% over 2008. Our international procedures grew by 60% over 2008. We sold 338 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the year. Total revenue grew to $1,052,000,000, up 20% over 2008. Recurring revenue grew to $562 million, up 34% and comprising 53% of total revenue. We generated $474 million in operating profit before non-cash stock compensation expense, up 22% from last year, and GAAP net income grew to $233 million, up 14% year-over-year.We ended the year with $1,172,000,000 in cash and investments, up $148 million from last quarter and up $270 million from last year, which excluding $59 million in cash received during the year from the exercise of stock options and adding back $15 million invested in intellectual property working capital, property plant and equipment and $150 million stock buyback during the year, amounts to a gross cash generated from operations of $377 million or $9.61 per fully diluted share and 162% of our reported GAAP net income for the year. This is a reflection of the significant non-cash stock compensation and statutory tax expenses reflected in our GAAP net income and is the reason that we continue to believe that gross cash generated by operations remains the best measure of our actual financial performance.Adoption of surgical robotics is procedure-specific and patient-driven. And as a consequence, we continue to drive the adoption of robotically-assisted surgery procedure by procedure. Some of our highest growth procedures, those with 100% year-over-year growth or higher for 2009 include hysterectomy, partial nephrectomy, sacrocolpopexy, colon and rectal resections and thyroidectomy, the latter concentrated in Asia. Some of these procedure growth metrics were measured off a relatively small base in 2008, but we have learned from past experience that the seeds of new adoptions begin with rapid growth and particular procedures. Through 2009, we continued to invest and progress across our business. Some highlights for the year are as follows: We launched our Si System in Q2 of 2009 and by Q4, 79% of the new system sales were our Si product. The Si System has catalyzed trade-in sales for our first platform, the da Vinci Standard, and upgrades of da Vinci S Systems, with 23 trade-in transactions and 10 S to Si upgrades in the fourth quarter. Si Dual Consoles were sold in 16% of Si System sales through the year, representing an opportunity for an increased training efficacy at those sites. We obtained FDA approval for a new indication of da Vinci Systems for transoral da Vinci surgery, procedures for which patient value is very high. We added 214 new employees over the year, ending 2009 with 1,263 on our team, and we've resumed construction of our new manufacturing facility at our Sunnyvale headquarters, which will bring online 155,000 square feet of space in 2011.I'll now pass the time over to Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer, to take us through our financial performance in greater detail."
30239,83558008,46505,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2010",2010-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. Prior to providing you with the details of our fourth quarter results, I would like to provide you with a quick review of the deferral accounting that took place during 2009 which sets into context the proper comparables. As previously re",1354,"Thank you, Gary. Prior to providing you with the details of our fourth quarter results, I would like to provide you with a quick review of the deferral accounting that took place during 2009 which sets into context the proper comparables. As previously reported, we offered certain first quarter customers the opportunity to upgrade their da Vinci S Systems to da Vinci Si Systems at a discount to the otherwise list price for such an upgrade. We also offered those customers the opportunity to return da Vinci S accessories in exchange for da Vinci Si accessories. As a result, we deferred a total of $20.1 million of revenue in the first quarter. In our second quarter, we recognized $13.8 million of the total, $20.1 million, originally deferred. In our third quarter, we recognized the remaining first quarter deferred revenue of $6.3 million as we completed the 13 remaining upgrades in the third quarter. To provide listeners with comparable information, I will now walk you through our revenue results excluding the third quarter recognition of $6.3 million. Our fourth quarter revenue was $323 million, up 40% compared with $232 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, and up 18% compared with $274 million for the third quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter revenues by product category are as follows. Fourth quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $113 million, up 39% compared with $82 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 13% compared with $100 million in the third quarter of 2009. The increase, as compared with prior quarters, are driven by procedure growth. Specifically, procedures increased 44% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Also impacting instrument and accessory growth is revenue associated with initial stocking orders which was higher than the prior year.The amount of instrument and accessory revenue we realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,960 per procedure, down approximately $70 per procedure compared to last year and up approximately $40 per procedure compared to the third quarter. The decline in revenue per procedure, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, reflects the lower impact the initial stocking orders have on a larger install base, as well as customer efficiency.The growth in revenue per procedure compared to the third quarter is primarily associated with customer buying patterns. Fourth quarter 2009 systems revenue of $162 million increased 42% compared with $114 million of systems revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008 and increased 25% compared with $130 million of systems revenue for the third quarter. We sold 110 systems in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 85 systems last year and 86 systems last quarter. 80 systems were sold in the U.S. during the quarter compared with 55 systems last year and 72 systems last quarter. 30 systems were sold outside the U.S. compared with 30 last year and 14 last quarter. 87 of the 110, or 79% of the units sold in the quarter, were da Vinci Si systems. 23 of the systems sold in the quarter involve trade-ins of da Vinci Standard Systems compared to six in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 20 last quarter. We continue to provide customers with trading credits as we believe that the Si System provides clinical and user benefits over da Vinci Standards, which we believe will lead to increases to usage.Fourth quarter system revenue also included $7 million of upgrade revenue compared to $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $10 million in the third quarter of 2009. Our fourth quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models but excluding upgrades and the revenue deferral, was $1.41 million, an increase from the $1.39 million realized in the third quarter and an increase from the $1.32 million realized in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase compared to the prior year reflects the introduction of the Si product, which has a higher price point than the S. The increase from the prior quarter reflects a higher mix of European direct sales.Service revenue increased to $48 million, up 32% compared with $36 million last year and up 9% compared with $44 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger system install base. Total fourth quarter recurring revenue, comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $161 million, up 37% compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 12% compared with the third quarter of 2009. Recurring revenue represented 50% of total fourth quarter revenue compared with 51% in the fourth quarter last year and 53% last quarter.Moving onto the remainder of the P&L. Let me remind you that there were no costs deferred in conjunction with the first quarter $20.1 million revenue deferral. And therefore, the $6.3 million third quarter recognition had an equal impact on revenue, gross profit, operating income and pretax income. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 72.2% compared with fourth quarter 2008 gross margin of 71.4%, and excluding the impact of the deferral, third quarter 2009 gross margin of 70.4%. The increase in gross margin reflects increased system ASPs and absorption of fixed costs over a larger revenue base.Fourth quarter 2009 operating expenses of $105 million were up 27% compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 11% compared with the third quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects commissions associated with higher revenue, costs associated with 75 employees added during the quarter, and increased research and development costs. In addition, patent amortization expenses increased to $3.6 million for the quarter compared with $3.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 and $3.6 million last quarter.Fourth quarter 2009 operating income is $128 million or 40% of sales compared with $83 million or 36% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2008, and excluding the impact of deferral, $98 million or 36% of sales for the third quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter 2009 operating income reflected $25 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $21 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and $25 million last quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 41.5% was slightly higher than our anticipated rate of 41% due to a higher mix of U.S. income. Our net income was $78 million or $1.95 per share compared with $51 million or $1.27 per share for the fourth quarter of 2008, and excluding the impact of the deferrals, $61 million or $1.55 per share for the third quarter of 2009.Let me summarize our results for 2009. Total procedures grew by 51% compared to 2008 to approximately 205,000 procedures. Total 2009 revenue was $1,052,000,000, up 20% compared with $875 million last year. Recurring revenue was driven by procedure growth and increased 34% compared to 2008. Systems revenue increased 8%, reflecting the impact of curtailed hospital spending for capital equipment. Operating income for 2009 was $377 million, up 21% compared with $311 million last year. Operating income included $97 million of stock-based compensation charges in 2009 compared with $77 million in 2008. Net income for 2009 was $233 million or $5.93 per share compared with $204 million or $5.12 per share last year.Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter of 2009 with cash and investments of $1,172,000,000, up $148 million compared with September 30, 2009 and up $270 million compared with December 31, 2008. The increase during the quarter reflects cash flow from operations and $25 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $8 million of capital expenditures. For the year, cash flow from operations of $385 million and stock option exercises of $59 million was partially offset by IP purchases and capital expenditures of $53 million and the $150 million used to buy back and retire 1.4 million shares of common stock. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $205 million at December 31 from $187 million at September 30. The increase in receivables reflects increased revenue. Our net inventory increased to $58 million at December 31 from $57 million at September 30. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks who'll go over our marketing and clinical highlights."

During the fourth quarter, we sold 110 da Vinci Systems: 80 in the United States, 21 in Europe and nine into rest of world markets. As part of the 110 systems sales, 23 standard da Vinci Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si systems. We had a net 87 system additions to the install base during the quarter which brings to 1,395 accumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide: 1,028 in the U.S., 248 in Europe, and 119 in rest of world markets. 52 of the 110 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers, which included a five-system sale to the Cleveland Clinic. Internationally, we placed four more da Vinci Systems into France and three more into the countries of Germany, Italy and Korea. Also during the quarter, 10 customers purchased upgrades to convert their da Vinci S Systems into da Vinci Si Systems. Clinically, we had another excellent quarter, once again experiencing double-digit sequential procedure growth. Demand for our targeted da Vinci procedures continues to be robust. Hysterectomy growth, both for benign and malignant conditions, continues to lead the way. In 2009, our customers performed approximately 69,000 dVHs worldwide, which is an estimated doubling of the 2008 total. dVP, which is still our largest individual procedure, showed solid growth for the year, registering an estimated 90,000 procedures worldwide. Overall, we finished 2009 having completed an estimated 205,000 procedures representing several different procedure categories. In addition, nearly 300 da Vinci related clinical publications and abstracts appeared within various peer review journals during the quarter. Also during the quarter, we were notified by the Japanese Ministry of Health that da Vinci S, along with several da Vinci instruments received Shonin clearance in Japan. We've worked hard with the Japanese authorities to obtain this clearance, so we are certainly pleased to have received it. However, we would like to remind everyone that our work pertaining to the appropriate reimbursement is ongoing and reimbursement activities will likely be ongoing for some time to come. Shonin clearance was a necessary first step in a process that is still being sequenced. Long-term success in Japan is likely to occur step-by-step. And at this time, we cannot provide an accurate estimate as to when we might obtain the appropriate reimbursement for da Vinci surgical procedures. At current growth trajectories, dVH will become our largest procedure at some point in 2010. And the reasons for this are simple. The market opportunity is large, hospitals and physicians are adopting it, and patients are seeking it. In the October edition of the Journal of Robotic Surgery, Dr. Gerald Feuer and colleagues from the Southeastern Gynecologic Oncology group in Atlanta published results of their 52-patient comparison for radical dVH versus open hysterectomy. While still in their da Vinci learning curve, they compared complication rates, operating time, lymph node yields, estimated blood loss and hospitalization. They reported that operating times were initially longer when using da Vinci but had come down significantly with experience. They also showed that complication rates were reduced by 37% using da Vinci. Lymph node yields were similar while estimated blood loss for da Vinci patients was reduced by 64% compared to their open cases. But perhaps most striking, was the difference in hospitalization which was reduced from 5.2 days for open to 1.7 days with da Vinci. The authors concluded by saying, ""Implementing a unilateral approach to maximizing surgical efficiency greatly reduced surgical times without compromising patient morbidity, bringing down robotic times while still in a learning curve to close to those for radical hysterectomy. Thus, robotic radical hysterectomy may soon be considered the preferred standard front-line therapy for cervical cancer.""dVH for malignant conditions is growing rapidly, but dVH for benign conditions is growing even faster. In a study published in the last quarters, Journal of Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons, Dr. Abraham Shashoua and colleagues from the University of Illinois, Chicago, compared patient characteristics, operating variables and outcomes in 68 patients that had undergone a dVH or a total laparoscopic hysterectomy. They reported that when you factored out morcellation times, operating times were similar. Interestingly, length of stay was reduced approximately 30% from 1.4 days to one day for dVH. In parallel with the reduction in hospitalization was the significant decrease and requisite pain-reducing narcotics, 5.0 units for the total laparoscopic patients versus 1.2 units for the dVH patients. In his summary, Dr. Shashoua stated, ""Robotic hysterectomy can be performed safely with comparable operative times to those for conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy. Post-operative measures were improved over measures for conventional laparoscopy.""As you can assess from the procedure totals I reported earlier, we showed solid 23% dVP growth in 2009. The overall procedure growth on a raw unit basis was split fairly evenly between the U.S. and international customer base. However, our international dVP business is expanding at a much faster rate compared to the U.S. We would expect this to continue going forward. There is growing international awareness for dVP, the evidence of which can be found in a recent edition of the British Journal of Urology International. The British Journal featured a large meta analysis of 15 dVP publications published between 2006 and 2009, representing 9,277 dVP patients. The authors were comprised of a cohort of international investigators representing Florida Hospital on Celebration, Florida; the Division of Urology from the University of São Paulo, Brazil; the Division of Oncology from the Institute of Oncology in Milan, Italy. The large body of patients studied provided ample evidence for the authors to make the following summary comments, ""Many series are now mature enough to show the safety, efficacy and reproducibility of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy. Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy is associated with decreased operative blood loss and decreased risk of transfusions and comparative studies with open radical prostatectomy. Excellent functional and oncologic outcomes were reported in large series, with results at least comparable to those reported in open radical prostatectomy series. Limited preliminary studies appear to show advantages of robotic procedures in terms of length of stay, positive surgical margin rates and early potency and confidence.""We are exiting 2009 with strong international dVP momentum, which will be helpful in addressing this large opportunity. On December 16, the U.S. FDA granted us five 10-K clearance for transoral otolaryngologic surgical procedures (sic) [transoral otolaryngology surgical procedures] for benign, as well as malignant T1 and T2 tumors. Prior to this clearance, physicians seeking to perform ENT procedures were required to contain obtain an IRB. Despite the additional steps this process mandated, several of our nations leading ahead in net cancer centers applied for and received IRB clearances. Participating institutions included the University of Pennsylvania; Mayo Clinic, Rochester; M.D. Anderson; Mt. Sinai, New York; and the University of Alabama, Birmingham to name a few. Several hundred cases were performed during the year with excellent early results. At least three significant publications appeared in major head and neck journals, several abstracts presented at various meetings and a number of training sessions took place during 2009. The long-term ENT opportunity is difficult to size but with current approvals, we'd estimate the immediate U.S. target market to represent approximately 10,000 procedures compared to an international market opportunity in excess of 70,000 procedures. The potential patient value being described by leading physicians is very encouraging and perhaps as great as any we've seen thus far. We're excited by the opportunity of working with the ENT surgical community in the pursuit of improving head and neck patient care. That concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn the time over to Ben."

I will be providing our financial forecast for 2010, including procedures, revenues and the other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates on significant non-cash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows. Starting with procedures, we continue to see strong growth across a wide range of procedures, particularly da Vinci Hysterectomies. And as a result, we expect our total procedures to grow approximately 35% for the year from the 205,000 procedures performed in 2009.Moving onto revenues. We expect to achieve annual revenue growth of approximately 25%. As a reminder, our revenues can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as system placements may vary. With regard to gross margin, we have averaged between 71% and 71.5% over the past two years. While gross margin can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to product and geography mix, we expect the average for 2010 to be about the same. Moving to operating expense. We expect our GAAP operating expense to grow by approximately 25% in 2010, which is in line with our expected top-line growth. Excluding non-cash stock compensation charges, we expect operating expense to grow approximately 23% to 24%. We are continuing to hire significant resources in the field to support newly and sold systems and to drive procedure growth, and we are continuing to invest in R&D projects to drive growth in our long-term business. We expect our non-cash stock compensation charges to increase from $97 million recorded in 2009 to approximately $127 million in 2010. In addition, we will continue to amortize previous purchases of intellectual property in our R&D expense line, which is scheduled to amortize at $14.5 million for the year. These items totaled over $140 million in estimated non-cash expense for the year.Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, has been decreasing due to lower interest rates on our cash investments. We expect other income to come in between $14 million and $15 million for the year, which is down from approximately $19 million last year.With regard to income tax, we have implemented an international tax structure that will allow us to begin reporting a lower tax rate going forward. We expect our tax rate for 2010 to come in at approximately 37%, which is four points lower than the 41% tax rate we reported for 2009.For calculating earnings per share, we ended 2009 with 38.5 million common shares outstanding and approximately 4.6 million option shares outstanding. Depending on our average stock price this year, a portion of the 4.6 million option shares will be added to the fully-diluted shares calculation. Assuming our stock price remains where it is today, we estimate that our share count for calculating EPS in Q1 will be approximately 40.1 million shares. And for calculating EPS for the year, we estimate it will be approximately 40.7 million shares.Finally, regarding our cash flows. As Gary mentioned, we generated $377 million in gross cash flow from operations in 2009 compared with our reported net income of $233 million. Since we are forecasting to report over $140 million in non-cash expense this year, our cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operations is a better measure of our actual performance than net income.Please note that the forecast I have just provided does not include any potential impact of a federal healthcare excise tax. Since we cannot predict if or when such a tax will take effect, we are not making any estimates. And with that, I would like to turn it back over to Gary."

And again, the target was really based on where we knew we added the most value. And that came out of the cohort of open procedures, open hysterectomies being converted. What you're seeing more and more is that a number of programs and practices have converted several of their laparoscopic procedures to da Vinci procedures. And I think that's a trend that will continue. As far as again taking a number and saying that market opportunity is this size or that size, I think it's important to remind you that there's somewhere between 300 and perhaps 25,000 open hysterectomies. And there are somewhere on the order of 250,000 either laparoscopic or vaginal hysterectomies. I think it's safe to say that our market opportunity is going to be larger than the 250,000, but I don't think we're in a position to tell you how large it could be."

And the biggest thing is that stocking orders are becoming a less percentage of the total. And as that happens, that will gradually bring down our revenue per procedure metric. And another thing that does happen on a gradual basis, although there is noise in the system, is that customers, in general, become more efficient over time as the procedure numbers grow. So I think Marshall mentioned that if you compare fourth quarter of last year to fourth quarter of this year, I think it was down by about 4%. And that might be sort of a -- I know it's only a one-point measurement, but it's more of a better comparison than comparing two sequential quarters when you can have some more variations in a sequential rate."

And so I think it's perhaps going to be that way for a while. But we are still resourcing it and we still think there's a lot of patient value there.  The mitral valve story is probably of the two stories between revascular and mitral valve.

But in terms of generally speaking, the answer to that really depends on the procedures. In other words, if all we were talking about, theoretically, was cardiac surgery, it would have one answer. If you add cardiac plus urology or prostatectomy, specifically, the number expands. You add more procedures in the vertical of urology, it expands even further. You turn on gynecology, it expands further and so on and so forth. So in terms of how far that number could go really will depend on how far the penetration is and how much value we add in the various procedures. So it isn't one that we necessarily point to and say, we want to be at five or at six cases per week by the end of the year or anything like that. But then, in terms of scheduling, you can imagine that the more specialties that one is addressing, the potential for log jams, if you will, on capacity and getting on their systems goes up.

I",563,"As we've discussed with you over the years, while we spend our time on these calls reviewing our financial performance, our team remains sharply focused on the creation of patient value, improving the efficacy of surgery while reducing its invasiveness. I would like to share with you two of the many examples we receive daily of what this means in the lives of our patients.Our first patient is Mr. Dale Gan [ph], a patient of Dr. Brian Golden of Summerlin Hospital Medical Center in Nevada. ""This is my thanks to Dr. Golden for saving most of my left kidney. My story is a little unusual since I had already lost my right kidney to cancer in 2002. That whole kidney was removed in a traditional operation through a long shark bite that was awfully painful and took several months to recover from. Recently, my doctor found a new tumor in my left kidney, the only one I have left. I was scared I would need this kidney removed and be hooked up to dialysis for the rest of my life. The urologist who took out my right kidney years ago recommended Dr. Brian Golden. My primary doctor rated Dr. Goldman as excellent, which of course influenced my decision. But the deciding moments were when I actually met and discussed my case with Doctor G. He showed me my CAT scan and the tumor. He described the operation using the da Vinci robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy and showed me how much of my kidney could be saved. He had a very reassuring bedside manner, was confident but not arrogant and answered all of my questions. He made me feel comfortable that I had found the right surgeon for my terrifying situation. The surgery went great. My kidney was working just as well after surgery as beforehand. The few little incisions weren't very painful and I was out of the hospital in just a day and a half. When I saw Dr. Golden after surgery, he said the pathology report said all the cancer was removed. My primary care doctor was absolutely amazed at my speedy recovery and the difference in my incisions for the right and left kidney operations.""Another patient suffered from oral cancer and is a patient of Dr. Bert O'Malley from the University of Pennsylvania who with his partner, Dr. Greg Weinstein, is a leader in the creation of TransOral Vinci surgery. This patient writes, ""Dr. O'Malley, you have brought a miraculous change in my life. I now can swallow normally, do not have to force-feed my medications, do not need oxygen at night and feel like a new way of life has opened for me. How can I ever repay your kindness and skill for making this possible? I never can, so I'll simply say, 'God bless you for your kindness and help in changing my entire outlook.'""Patients like these are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking to you again in three months."

Against the backdrop of significant uncertainty in 2009, our team adapted well to the changing environment and our procedure in capital businesses, and our operations organization remains focused on delivering quality products in the midst of financial constraints. Our operating highlights for the fourth quarter are as follows: Procedures grew 44% over the fourth quarter of 2008. We sold 110 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 85 soldiering the fourth quarter of last year. Our international team contributed 30 of the 110 systems sold. We ended the fourth quarter with 1,395 da Vinci Systems installed worldwide. Total revenue for the quarter was $323 million, up 40% over fourth quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $113 million, up 39%. Total recurring revenue, including service, grew to $161 million, up 37% from the prior year and comprising 50% of total revenues.We generated an operating profit of $153 million before non-cash stock compensation expenses, up 47% from the fourth quarter of last year, and GAAP net income grew to $78 million, up 53% from fourth quarter of last year. For the full-year 2009, worldwide procedures grew by 51% over 2008. Our international procedures grew by 60% over 2008. We sold 338 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the year. Total revenue grew to $1,052,000,000, up 20% over 2008. Recurring revenue grew to $562 million, up 34% and comprising 53% of total revenue. We generated $474 million in operating profit before non-cash stock compensation expense, up 22% from last year, and GAAP net income grew to $233 million, up 14% year-over-year.We ended the year with $1,172,000,000 in cash and investments, up $148 million from last quarter and up $270 million from last year, which excluding $59 million in cash received during the year from the exercise of stock options and adding back $15 million invested in intellectual property working capital, property plant and equipment and $150 million stock buyback during the year, amounts to a gross cash generated from operations of $377 million or $9.61 per fully diluted share and 162% of our reported GAAP net income for the year. This is a reflection of the significant non-cash stock compensation and statutory tax expenses reflected in our GAAP net income and is the reason that we continue to believe that gross cash generated by operations remains the best measure of our actual financial performance.Adoption of surgical robotics is procedure-specific and patient-driven. And as a consequence, we continue to drive the adoption of robotically-assisted surgery procedure by procedure. Some of our highest growth procedures, those with 100% year-over-year growth or higher for 2009 include hysterectomy, partial nephrectomy, sacrocolpopexy, colon and rectal resections and thyroidectomy, the latter concentrated in Asia. Some of these procedure growth metrics were measured off a relatively small base in 2008, but we have learned from past experience that the seeds of new adoptions begin with rapid growth and particular procedures. Through 2009, we continued to invest and progress across our business. Some highlights for the year are as follows: We launched our Si System in Q2 of 2009 and by Q4, 79% of the new system sales were our Si product. The Si System has catalyzed trade-in sales for our first platform, the da Vinci Standard, and upgrades of da Vinci S Systems, with 23 trade-in transactions and 10 S to Si upgrades in the fourth quarter. Si Dual Consoles were sold in 16% of Si System sales through the year, representing an opportunity for an increased training efficacy at those sites. We obtained FDA approval for a new indication of da Vinci Systems for transoral da Vinci surgery, procedures for which patient value is very high. We added 214 new employees over the year, ending 2009 with 1,263 on our team, and we've resumed construction of our new manufacturing facility at our Sunnyvale headquarters, which will bring online 155,000 square feet of space in 2011.I'll now pass the time over to Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer, to take us through our financial performance in greater detail."

As previously re",1354,"Thank you, Gary. Prior to providing you with the details of our fourth quarter results, I would like to provide you with a quick review of the deferral accounting that took place during 2009 which sets into context the proper comparables. As previously reported, we offered certain first quarter customers the opportunity to upgrade their da Vinci S Systems to da Vinci Si Systems at a discount to the otherwise list price for such an upgrade. We also offered those customers the opportunity to return da Vinci S accessories in exchange for da Vinci Si accessories. As a result, we deferred a total of $20.1 million of revenue in the first quarter. In our second quarter, we recognized $13.8 million of the total, $20.1 million, originally deferred. In our third quarter, we recognized the remaining first quarter deferred revenue of $6.3 million as we completed the 13 remaining upgrades in the third quarter. To provide listeners with comparable information, I will now walk you through our revenue results excluding the third quarter recognition of $6.3 million. Our fourth quarter revenue was $323 million, up 40% compared with $232 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, and up 18% compared with $274 million for the third quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter revenues by product category are as follows. Fourth quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $113 million, up 39% compared with $82 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 13% compared with $100 million in the third quarter of 2009. The increase, as compared with prior quarters, are driven by procedure growth. Specifically, procedures increased 44% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Also impacting instrument and accessory growth is revenue associated with initial stocking orders which was higher than the prior year.The amount of instrument and accessory revenue we realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,960 per procedure, down approximately $70 per procedure compared to last year and up approximately $40 per procedure compared to the third quarter. The decline in revenue per procedure, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, reflects the lower impact the initial stocking orders have on a larger install base, as well as customer efficiency.The growth in revenue per procedure compared to the third quarter is primarily associated with customer buying patterns. Fourth quarter 2009 systems revenue of $162 million increased 42% compared with $114 million of systems revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008 and increased 25% compared with $130 million of systems revenue for the third quarter. We sold 110 systems in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 85 systems last year and 86 systems last quarter. 80 systems were sold in the U.S. during the quarter compared with 55 systems last year and 72 systems last quarter. 30 systems were sold outside the U.S. compared with 30 last year and 14 last quarter. 87 of the 110, or 79% of the units sold in the quarter, were da Vinci Si systems. 23 of the systems sold in the quarter involve trade-ins of da Vinci Standard Systems compared to six in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 20 last quarter. We continue to provide customers with trade-in credits as we believe that the Si System provides clinical and user benefits over da Vinci Standards, which we believe will lead to increases to usage.Fourth quarter system revenue also included $7 million of upgrade revenue compared to $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $10 million in the third quarter of 2009. Our fourth quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models but excluding upgrades and the revenue deferral, was $1.41 million, an increase from the $1.39 million realized in the third quarter and an increase from the $1.32 million realized in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase compared to the prior year reflects the introduction of the Si product, which has a higher price point than the S. The increase from the prior quarter reflects a higher mix of European direct sales.Service revenue increased to $48 million, up 32% compared with $36 million last year and up 9% compared with $44 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger system install base. Total fourth quarter recurring revenue, comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $161 million, up 37% compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 12% compared with the third quarter of 2009. Recurring revenue represented 50% of total fourth quarter revenue compared with 51% in the fourth quarter last year and 53% last quarter.Moving onto the remainder of the P&L. Let me remind you that there were no costs deferred in conjunction with the first quarter $20.1 million revenue deferral. And therefore, the $6.3 million third quarter recognition had an equal impact on revenue, gross profit, operating income and pretax income. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 72.2% compared with fourth quarter 2008 gross margin of 71.4%, and excluding the impact of the deferral, third quarter 2009 gross margin of 70.4%. The increase in gross margin reflects increased system ASPs and absorption of fixed costs over a larger revenue base.Fourth quarter 2009 operating expenses of $105 million were up 27% compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 11% compared with the third quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects commissions associated with higher revenue, costs associated with 75 employees added during the quarter, and increased research and development costs. In addition, patent amortization expenses increased to $3.6 million for the quarter compared with $3.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 and $3.6 million last quarter.Fourth quarter 2009 operating income is $128 million or 40% of sales compared with $83 million or 36% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2008, and excluding the impact of deferral, $98 million or 36% of sales for the third quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter 2009 operating income reflected $25 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $21 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and $25 million last quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 41.5% was slightly higher than our anticipated rate of 41% due to a higher mix of U.S. income. Our net income was $78 million or $1.95 per share compared with $51 million or $1.27 per share for the fourth quarter of 2008, and excluding the impact of the deferrals, $61 million or $1.55 per share for the third quarter of 2009.Let me summarize our results for 2009. Total procedures grew by 51% compared to 2008 to approximately 205,000 procedures. Total 2009 revenue was $1,052,000,000, up 20% compared with $875 million last year. Recurring revenue was driven by procedure growth and increased 34% compared to 2008. Systems revenue increased 8%, reflecting the impact of curtailed hospital spending for capital equipment. Operating income for 2009 was $377 million, up 21% compared with $311 million last year. Operating income included $97 million of stock-based compensation charges in 2009 compared with $77 million in 2008. Net income for 2009 was $233 million or $5.93 per share compared with $204 million or $5.12 per share last year.Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter of 2009 with cash and investments of $1,172,000,000, up $148 million compared with September 30, 2009 and up $270 million compared with December 31, 2008. The increase during the quarter reflects cash flow from operations and $25 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $8 million of capital expenditures. For the year, cash flow from operations of $385 million and stock option exercises of $59 million was partially offset by IP purchases and capital expenditures of $53 million and the $150 million used to buy back and retire 1.4 million shares of common stock. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $205 million at December 31 from $187 million at September 30. The increase in receivables reflects increased revenue. Our net inventory increased to $58 million at December 31 from $57 million at September 30. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks who'll go over our marketing and clinical highlights."

During the fourth quarter, we sold 110 da Vinci Systems: 80 in the United States, 21 in Europe and nine into rest of world markets. As part of the 110 systems sales, 23 standard da Vinci Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si systems. We had a net 87 system additions to the install base during the quarter which brings to 1,395 accumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide: 1,028 in the U.S., 248 in Europe, and 119 in rest of world markets. 52 of the 110 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers, which included a five-system sale to the Cleveland Clinic. Internationally, we placed four more da Vinci Systems into France and three more into the countries of Germany, Italy and Korea. Also during the quarter, 10 customers purchased upgrades to convert their da Vinci S Systems into da Vinci Si Systems. Clinically, we had another excellent quarter, once again experiencing double-digit sequential procedure growth. Demand for our targeted da Vinci procedures continues to be robust. Hysterectomy growth, both for benign and malignant conditions, continues to lead the way. In 2009, our customers performed approximately 69,000 dVHs worldwide, which is an estimated doubling of the 2008 total. dVP, which is still our largest individual procedure, showed solid growth for the year, registering an estimated 90,000 procedures worldwide. Overall, we finished 2009 having completed an estimated 205,000 procedures representing several different procedure categories. In addition, nearly 300 da Vinci related clinical publications and abstracts appeared within various peer review journals during the quarter. Also during the quarter, we were notified by the Japanese Ministry of Health that da Vinci S, along with several da Vinci instruments received Shonin clearance in Japan. We've worked hard with the Japanese authorities to obtain this clearance, so we are certainly pleased to have received it. However, we would like to remind everyone that our work pertaining to the appropriate reimbursement is ongoing and reimbursement activities will likely be ongoing for some time to come. Shonin clearance was a necessary first step in a process that is still being sequenced. Long-term success in Japan is likely to occur step-by-step. And at this time, we cannot provide an accurate estimate as to when we might obtain the appropriate reimbursement for da Vinci surgical procedures. At current growth trajectories, dVH will become our largest procedure at some point in 2010. And the reasons for this are simple. The market opportunity is large, hospitals and physicians are adopting it, and patients are seeking it. In the October edition of the Journal of Robotic Surgery, Dr. Gerald Feuer and colleagues from the Southeastern Gynecologic Oncology group in Atlanta published results of their 52-patient comparison for radical dVH versus open hysterectomy. While still in their da Vinci learning curve, they compared complication rates, operating time, lymph node yields, estimated blood loss and hospitalization. They reported that operating times were initially longer when using da Vinci but had come down significantly with experience. They also showed that complication rates were reduced by 37% using da Vinci. Lymph node yields were similar while estimated blood loss for da Vinci patients was reduced by 64% compared to their open cases. But perhaps most striking, was the difference in hospitalization which was reduced from 5.2 days for open to 1.7 days with da Vinci. The authors concluded by saying, ""Implementing a unilateral approach to maximizing surgical efficiency greatly reduced surgical times without compromising patient morbidity, bringing down robotic times while still in a learning curve to close to those for radical hysterectomy. Thus, robotic radical hysterectomy may soon be considered the preferred standard front-line therapy for cervical cancer.""dVH for malignant conditions is growing rapidly, but dVH for benign conditions is growing even faster. In a study published in the last quarters, Journal of Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons, Dr. Abraham Shashoua and colleagues from the University of Illinois, Chicago, compared patient characteristics, operating variables and outcomes in 68 patients that had undergone a dVH or a total laparoscopic hysterectomy. They reported that when you factored out morcellation times, operating times were similar. Interestingly, length of stay was reduced approximately 30% from 1.4 days to one day for dVH. In parallel with the reduction in hospitalization was the significant decrease and requisite pain-reducing narcotics, 5.0 units for the total laparoscopic patients versus 1.2 units for the dVH patients. In his summary, Dr. Shashoua stated, ""Robotic hysterectomy can be performed safely with comparable operative times to those for conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy. Post-operative measures were improved over measures for conventional laparoscopy.""As you can assess from the procedure totals I reported earlier, we showed solid 23% dVP growth in 2009. The overall procedure growth on a raw unit basis was split fairly evenly between the U.S. and international customer base. However, our international dVP business is expanding at a much faster rate compared to the U.S. We would expect this to continue going forward. There is growing international awareness for dVP, the evidence of which can be found in a recent edition of the British Journal of Urology International. The British Journal featured a large meta analysis of 15 dVP publications published between 2006 and 2009, representing 9,277 dVP patients. The authors were comprised of a cohort of international investigators representing Florida Hospital on Celebration, Florida; the Division of Urology from the University of São Paulo, Brazil; the Division of Oncology from the Institute of Oncology in Milan, Italy. The large body of patients studied provided ample evidence for the authors to make the following summary comments, ""Many series are now mature enough to show the safety, efficacy and reproducibility of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy. Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy is associated with decreased operative blood loss and decreased risk of transfusions and comparative studies with open radical prostatectomy. Excellent functional and oncologic outcomes were reported in large series, with results at least comparable to those reported in open radical prostatectomy series. Limited preliminary studies appear to show advantages of robotic procedures in terms of length of stay, positive surgical margin rates and early potency and confidence.""We are exiting 2009 with strong international dVP momentum, which will be helpful in addressing this large opportunity. On December 16, the U.S. FDA granted us five 10-K clearance for transoral otolaryngologic surgical procedures (sic) [transoral otolaryngology surgical procedures] for benign, as well as malignant T1 and T2 tumors. Prior to this clearance, physicians seeking to perform ENT procedures were required to contain obtain an IRB. Despite the additional steps this process mandated, several of our nations leading ahead in net cancer centers applied for and received IRB clearances. Participating institutions included the University of Pennsylvania; Mayo Clinic, Rochester; M.D. Anderson; Mt. Sinai, New York; and the University of Alabama, Birmingham to name a few. Several hundred cases were performed during the year with excellent early results. At least three significant publications appeared in major head and neck journals, several abstracts presented at various meetings and a number of training sessions took place during 2009. The long-term ENT opportunity is difficult to size but with current approvals, we'd estimate the immediate U.S. target market to represent approximately 10,000 procedures compared to an international market opportunity in excess of 70,000 procedures. The potential patient value being described by leading physicians is very encouraging and perhaps as great as any we've seen thus far. We're excited by the opportunity of working with the ENT surgical community in the pursuit of improving head and neck patient care. That concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn the time over to Ben."

I will be providing our financial forecast for 2010, including procedures, revenues and the other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates on significant non-cash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows. Starting with procedures, we continue to see strong growth across a wide range of procedures, particularly da Vinci Hysterectomies. And as a result, we expect our total procedures to grow approximately 35% for the year from the 205,000 procedures performed in 2009.Moving onto revenues. We expect to achieve annual revenue growth of approximately 25%. As a reminder, our revenues can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as system placements may vary. With regard to gross margin, we have averaged between 71% and 71.5% over the past two years. While gross margin can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to product and geography mix, we expect the average for 2010 to be about the same. Moving to operating expense. We expect our GAAP operating expense to grow by approximately 25% in 2010, which is in line with our expected top-line growth. Excluding non-cash stock compensation charges, we expect operating expense to grow approximately 23% to 24%. We are continuing to hire significant resources in the field to support newly and sold systems and to drive procedure growth, and we are continuing to invest in R&D projects to drive growth in our long-term business. We expect our non-cash stock compensation charges to increase from $97 million recorded in 2009 to approximately $127 million in 2010. In addition, we will continue to amortize previous purchases of intellectual property in our R&D expense line, which is scheduled to amortize at $14.5 million for the year. These items totaled over $140 million in estimated non-cash expense for the year.Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, has been decreasing due to lower interest rates on our cash investments. We expect other income to come in between $14 million and $15 million for the year, which is down from approximately $19 million last year.With regard to income tax, we have implemented an international tax structure that will allow us to begin reporting a lower tax rate going forward. We expect our tax rate for 2010 to come in at approximately 37%, which is four points lower than the 41% tax rate we reported for 2009.For calculating earnings per share, we ended 2009 with 38.5 million common shares outstanding and approximately 4.6 million option shares outstanding. Depending on our average stock price this year, a portion of the 4.6 million option shares will be added to the fully-diluted shares calculation. Assuming our stock price remains where it is today, we estimate that our share count for calculating EPS in Q1 will be approximately 40.1 million shares. And for calculating EPS for the year, we estimate it will be approximately 40.7 million shares.Finally, regarding our cash flows. As Gary mentioned, we generated $377 million in gross cash flow from operations in 2009 compared with our reported net income of $233 million. Since we are forecasting to report over $140 million in non-cash expense this year, our cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operations is a better measure of our actual performance than net income.Please note that the forecast I have just provided does not include any potential impact of a federal healthcare excise tax. Since we cannot predict if or when such a tax will take effect, we are not making any estimates. And with that, I would like to turn it back over to Gary."

What you're seeing more and more is that a number of programs and practices have converted several of their laparoscopic procedures to da Vinci procedures. And I think that's a trend that will continue. As far as again taking a number and saying that market opportunity is this size or that size, I think it's important to remind you that there's somewhere between 300 and perhaps 25,000 open hysterectomies. And there are somewhere on the order of 250,000 either laparoscopic or vaginal hysterectomies. I think it's safe to say that our market opportunity is going to be larger than the 250,000, but I don't think we're in a position to tell you how large it could be."

And the biggest thing is that stocking orders are becoming a less percentage of the total. And as that happens, that will gradually bring down our revenue per procedure metric. And another thing that does happen on a gradual basis, although there is noise in the system, is that customers, in general, become more efficient over time as the procedure numbers grow. So I think Marshall mentioned that if you compare fourth quarter of last year to fourth quarter of this year, I think it was down by about 4%. And that might be sort of a -- I know it's only a one-point measurement, but it's more of a better comparison than comparing two sequential quarters when you can have some more variations in a sequential rate."

I think the visibility on our Procedure business and the Service businesses has been pretty reasonable. And we've learned that the utilization of systems will drive a certain amount of capital sales off the Procedure business. So on that side, I think we have some visibility. The capital visibility is clearly better than it was a year ago, but it's still imperfect and highly variable depending, I think, critically, on a couple of factors. One, of course, is the macro environment. And we saw a kind of breath holding early in the year and then an exhale toward the end of the year. And it's unclear to us whether that pattern is going to continue or settle out. At the same time, it's clear that procedure growth through this period has created some demand that requires response over time. So that's kind of how we got to where we are right now."

Part of it is because of the anatomy that you're working on, the fact that it is very serious cardiac operation. And part of it is the fact that it's a pretty conservative group. And there's also a longer training pathway. And the combination of those things has made it, let's say, a bit unique in the sense that you're not seeing hyper growth immediately like you've seen in some of our other categories. Now having said that, the patient value of the centers that are performing it is excellent. The commitment for those centers is excellent. The demand for training is growing. And so I think it's perhaps going to be that way for a while. But we are still resourcing it and we still think there's a lot of patient value there.  The mitral valve story is probably of the two stories between revascular and mitral valve. The mitral valve story is probably the one that is getting more of the headlines, but in the centers that are committed to revasc, they are very, very bullish on it. So there isn't really a lot more in the way of commentary on that. I think it's steady as she goes and it's slow and steady growth."

But in terms of generally speaking, the answer to that really depends on the procedures. In other words, if all we were talking about, theoretically, was cardiac surgery, it would have one answer. If you add cardiac plus urology or prostatectomy, specifically, the number expands. You add more procedures in the vertical of urology, it expands even further. You turn on gynecology, it expands further and so on and so forth. So in terms of how far that number could go really will depend on how far the penetration is and how much value we add in the various procedures. So it isn't one that we necessarily point to and say, we want to be at five or at six cases per week by the end of the year or anything like that. But then, in terms of scheduling, you can imagine that the more specialties that one is addressing, the potential for log jams, if you will, on capacity and getting on their systems goes up. But at the same time, we have more and more hospitals purchasing second and third systems. So those are sort of the facts and I don't know if Ben has anything else to add."

I",563,"As we've discussed with you over the years, while we spend our time on these calls reviewing our financial performance, our team remains sharply focused on the creation of patient value, improving the efficacy of surgery while reducing its invasiveness. I would like to share with you two of the many examples we receive daily of what this means in the lives of our patients.Our first patient is Mr. Dale Gan [ph], a patient of Dr. Brian Golden of Summerlin Hospital Medical Center in Nevada. ""This is my thanks to Dr. Golden for saving most of my left kidney. My story is a little unusual since I had already lost my right kidney to cancer in 2002. That whole kidney was removed in a traditional operation through a long shark bite that was awfully painful and took several months to recover from. Recently, my doctor found a new tumor in my left kidney, the only one I have left. I was scared I would need this kidney removed and be hooked up to dialysis for the rest of my life. The urologist who took out my right kidney years ago recommended Dr. Brian Golden. My primary doctor rated Dr. Goldman as excellent, which of course influenced my decision. But the deciding moments were when I actually met and discussed my case with Doctor G. He showed me my CAT scan and the tumor. He described the operation using the da Vinci robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy and showed me how much of my kidney could be saved. He had a very reassuring bedside manner, was confident but not arrogant and answered all of my questions. He made me feel comfortable that I had found the right surgeon for my terrifying situation. The surgery went great. My kidney was working just as well after surgery as beforehand. The few little incisions weren't very painful and I was out of the hospital in just a day and a half. When I saw Dr. Golden after surgery, he said the pathology report said all the cancer was removed. My primary care doctor was absolutely amazed at my speedy recovery and the difference in my incisions for the right and left kidney operations.""Another patient suffered from oral cancer and is a patient of Dr. Bert O'Malley from the University of Pennsylvania who with his partner, Dr. Greg Weinstein, is a leader in the creation of TransOral Vinci surgery. This patient writes, ""Dr. O'Malley, you have brought a miraculous change in my life. I now can swallow normally, do not have to force-feed my medications, do not need oxygen at night and feel like a new way of life has opened for me. How can I ever repay your kindness and skill for making this possible? I never can, so I'll simply say, 'God bless you for your kindness and help in changing my entire outlook.'""Patients like these are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking to you again in three months."

Against the backdrop of significant uncertainty in 2009, our team adapted well to the changing environment and our procedure in capital businesses, and our operations organization remains focused on delivering quality products in the midst of financial constraints. Our operating highlights for the fourth quarter are as follows: Procedures grew 44% over the fourth quarter of 2008. We sold 110 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 85 soldiering the fourth quarter of last year. Our international team contributed 30 of the 110 systems sold. We ended the fourth quarter with 1,395 da Vinci Systems installed worldwide. Total revenue for the quarter was $323 million, up 40% over fourth quarter of last year. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $113 million, up 39%. Total recurring revenue, including service, grew to $161 million, up 37% from the prior year and comprising 50% of total revenues.We generated an operating profit of $153 million before non-cash stock compensation expenses, up 47% from the fourth quarter of last year, and GAAP net income grew to $78 million, up 53% from fourth quarter of last year. For the full-year 2009, worldwide procedures grew by 51% over 2008. Our international procedures grew by 60% over 2008. We sold 338 da Vinci Surgical Systems in the year. Total revenue grew to $1,052,000,000, up 20% over 2008. Recurring revenue grew to $562 million, up 34% and comprising 53% of total revenue. We generated $474 million in operating profit before non-cash stock compensation expense, up 22% from last year, and GAAP net income grew to $233 million, up 14% year-over-year.We ended the year with $1,172,000,000 in cash and investments, up $148 million from last quarter and up $270 million from last year, which excluding $59 million in cash received during the year from the exercise of stock options and adding back $15 million invested in intellectual property working capital, property plant and equipment and $150 million stock buyback during the year, amounts to a gross cash generated from operations of $377 million or $9.61 per fully diluted share and 162% of our reported GAAP net income for the year. This is a reflection of the significant non-cash stock compensation and statutory tax expenses reflected in our GAAP net income and is the reason that we continue to believe that gross cash generated by operations remains the best measure of our actual financial performance.Adoption of surgical robotics is procedure-specific and patient-driven. And as a consequence, we continue to drive the adoption of robotically-assisted surgery procedure by procedure. Some of our highest growth procedures, those with 100% year-over-year growth or higher for 2009 include hysterectomy, partial nephrectomy, sacrocolpopexy, colon and rectal resections and thyroidectomy, the latter concentrated in Asia. Some of these procedure growth metrics were measured off a relatively small base in 2008, but we have learned from past experience that the seeds of new adoptions begin with rapid growth and particular procedures. Through 2009, we continued to invest and progress across our business. Some highlights for the year are as follows: We launched our Si System in Q2 of 2009 and by Q4, 79% of the new system sales were our Si product. The Si System has catalyzed trade-in sales for our first platform, the da Vinci Standard, and upgrades of da Vinci S Systems, with 23 trade-in transactions and 10 S to Si upgrades in the fourth quarter. Si Dual Consoles were sold in 16% of Si System sales through the year, representing an opportunity for an increased training efficacy at those sites. We obtained FDA approval for a new indication of da Vinci Systems for transoral da Vinci surgery, procedures for which patient value is very high. We added 214 new employees over the year, ending 2009 with 1,263 on our team, and we've resumed construction of our new manufacturing facility at our Sunnyvale headquarters, which will bring online 155,000 square feet of space in 2011.I'll now pass the time over to Marshall Mohr, our Chief Financial Officer, to take us through our financial performance in greater detail."

Prior to providing you with the details of our fourth quarter results, I would like to provide you with a quick review of the deferral accounting that took place during 2009 which sets into context the proper comparables. As previously re",1354,"Thank you, Gary. Prior to providing you with the details of our fourth quarter results, I would like to provide you with a quick review of the deferral accounting that took place during 2009 which sets into context the proper comparables. As previously reported, we offered certain first quarter customers the opportunity to upgrade their da Vinci S Systems to da Vinci Si Systems at a discount to the otherwise list price for such an upgrade. We also offered those customers the opportunity to return da Vinci S accessories in exchange for da Vinci Si accessories. As a result, we deferred a total of $20.1 million of revenue in the first quarter. In our second quarter, we recognized $13.8 million of the total, $20.1 million, originally deferred. In our third quarter, we recognized the remaining first quarter deferred revenue of $6.3 million as we completed the 13 remaining upgrades in the third quarter. To provide listeners with comparable information, I will now walk you through our revenue results excluding the third quarter recognition of $6.3 million. Our fourth quarter revenue was $323 million, up 40% compared with $232 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, and up 18% compared with $274 million for the third quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter revenues by product category are as follows. Fourth quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $113 million, up 39% compared with $82 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 13% compared with $100 million in the third quarter of 2009. The increase, as compared with prior quarters, are driven by procedure growth. Specifically, procedures increased 44% compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Also impacting instrument and accessory growth is revenue associated with initial stocking orders which was higher than the prior year.The amount of instrument and accessory revenue we realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,960 per procedure, down approximately $70 per procedure compared to last year and up approximately $40 per procedure compared to the third quarter. The decline in revenue per procedure, compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, reflects the lower impact the initial stocking orders have on a larger install base, as well as customer efficiency.The growth in revenue per procedure compared to the third quarter is primarily associated with customer buying patterns. Fourth quarter 2009 systems revenue of $162 million increased 42% compared with $114 million of systems revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008 and increased 25% compared with $130 million of systems revenue for the third quarter. We sold 110 systems in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 85 systems last year and 86 systems last quarter. 80 systems were sold in the U.S. during the quarter compared with 55 systems last year and 72 systems last quarter. 30 systems were sold outside the U.S. compared with 30 last year and 14 last quarter. 87 of the 110, or 79% of the units sold in the quarter, were da Vinci Si systems. 23 of the systems sold in the quarter involve trade-ins of da Vinci Standard Systems compared to six in the fourth quarter of 2008 and 20 last quarter. We continue to provide customers with trade-in credits as we believe that the Si System provides clinical and user benefits over da Vinci Standards, which we believe will lead to increases to usage.Fourth quarter system revenue also included $7 million of upgrade revenue compared to $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $10 million in the third quarter of 2009. Our fourth quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models but excluding upgrades and the revenue deferral, was $1.41 million, an increase from the $1.39 million realized in the third quarter and an increase from the $1.32 million realized in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase compared to the prior year reflects the introduction of the Si product, which has a higher price point than the S. The increase from the prior quarter reflects a higher mix of European direct sales.Service revenue increased to $48 million, up 32% compared with $36 million last year and up 9% compared with $44 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue is primarily driven by a larger system install base. Total fourth quarter recurring revenue, comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $161 million, up 37% compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 12% compared with the third quarter of 2009. Recurring revenue represented 50% of total fourth quarter revenue compared with 51% in the fourth quarter last year and 53% last quarter.Moving onto the remainder of the P&L. Let me remind you that there were no costs deferred in conjunction with the first quarter $20.1 million revenue deferral. And therefore, the $6.3 million third quarter recognition had an equal impact on revenue, gross profit, operating income and pretax income. Gross margin in the fourth quarter was 72.2% compared with fourth quarter 2008 gross margin of 71.4%, and excluding the impact of the deferral, third quarter 2009 gross margin of 70.4%. The increase in gross margin reflects increased system ASPs and absorption of fixed costs over a larger revenue base.Fourth quarter 2009 operating expenses of $105 million were up 27% compared with the fourth quarter of 2008 and up 11% compared with the third quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects commissions associated with higher revenue, costs associated with 75 employees added during the quarter, and increased research and development costs. In addition, patent amortization expenses increased to $3.6 million for the quarter compared with $3.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2008 and $3.6 million last quarter.Fourth quarter 2009 operating income is $128 million or 40% of sales compared with $83 million or 36% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2008, and excluding the impact of deferral, $98 million or 36% of sales for the third quarter of 2009. Fourth quarter 2009 operating income reflected $25 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $21 million for the fourth quarter of 2008 and $25 million last quarter. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 41.5% was slightly higher than our anticipated rate of 41% due to a higher mix of U.S. income. Our net income was $78 million or $1.95 per share compared with $51 million or $1.27 per share for the fourth quarter of 2008, and excluding the impact of the deferrals, $61 million or $1.55 per share for the third quarter of 2009.Let me summarize our results for 2009. Total procedures grew by 51% compared to 2008 to approximately 205,000 procedures. Total 2009 revenue was $1,052,000,000, up 20% compared with $875 million last year. Recurring revenue was driven by procedure growth and increased 34% compared to 2008. Systems revenue increased 8%, reflecting the impact of curtailed hospital spending for capital equipment. Operating income for 2009 was $377 million, up 21% compared with $311 million last year. Operating income included $97 million of stock-based compensation charges in 2009 compared with $77 million in 2008. Net income for 2009 was $233 million or $5.93 per share compared with $204 million or $5.12 per share last year.Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter of 2009 with cash and investments of $1,172,000,000, up $148 million compared with September 30, 2009 and up $270 million compared with December 31, 2008. The increase during the quarter reflects cash flow from operations and $25 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $8 million of capital expenditures. For the year, cash flow from operations of $385 million and stock option exercises of $59 million was partially offset by IP purchases and capital expenditures of $53 million and the $150 million used to buy back and retire 1.4 million shares of common stock. Our accounts receivable balance increased to $205 million at December 31 from $187 million at September 30. The increase in receivables reflects increased revenue. Our net inventory increased to $58 million at December 31 from $57 million at September 30. And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks who'll go over our marketing and clinical highlights."

During the fourth quarter, we sold 110 da Vinci Systems: 80 in the United States, 21 in Europe and nine into rest of world markets. As part of the 110 systems sales, 23 standard da Vinci Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si systems. We had a net 87 system additions to the install base during the quarter which brings to 1,395 accumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide: 1,028 in the U.S., 248 in Europe, and 119 in rest of world markets. 52 of the 110 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers, which included a five-system sale to the Cleveland Clinic. Internationally, we placed four more da Vinci Systems into France and three more into the countries of Germany, Italy and Korea. Also during the quarter, 10 customers purchased upgrades to convert their da Vinci S Systems into da Vinci Si Systems. Clinically, we had another excellent quarter, once again experiencing double-digit sequential procedure growth. Demand for our targeted da Vinci procedures continues to be robust. Hysterectomy growth, both for benign and malignant conditions, continues to lead the way. In 2009, our customers performed approximately 69,000 dVHs worldwide, which is an estimated doubling of the 2008 total. dVP, which is still our largest individual procedure, showed solid growth for the year, registering an estimated 90,000 procedures worldwide. Overall, we finished 2009 having completed an estimated 205,000 procedures representing several different procedure categories. In addition, nearly 300 da Vinci related clinical publications and abstracts appeared within various peer review journals during the quarter. Also during the quarter, we were notified by the Japanese Ministry of Health that da Vinci S, along with several da Vinci instruments received Shonin clearance in Japan. We've worked hard with the Japanese authorities to obtain this clearance, so we are certainly pleased to have received it. However, we would like to remind everyone that our work pertaining to the appropriate reimbursement is ongoing and reimbursement activities will likely be ongoing for some time to come. Shonin clearance was a necessary first step in a process that is still being sequenced. Long-term success in Japan is likely to occur step-by-step. And at this time, we cannot provide an accurate estimate as to when we might obtain the appropriate reimbursement for da Vinci surgical procedures. At current growth trajectories, dVH will become our largest procedure at some point in 2010. And the reasons for this are simple. The market opportunity is large, hospitals and physicians are adopting it, and patients are seeking it. In the October edition of the Journal of Robotic Surgery, Dr. Gerald Feuer and colleagues from the Southeastern Gynecologic Oncology group in Atlanta published results of their 52-patient comparison for radical dVH versus open hysterectomy. While still in their da Vinci learning curve, they compared complication rates, operating time, lymph node yields, estimated blood loss and hospitalization. They reported that operating times were initially longer when using da Vinci but had come down significantly with experience. They also showed that complication rates were reduced by 37% using da Vinci. Lymph node yields were similar while estimated blood loss for da Vinci patients was reduced by 64% compared to their open cases. But perhaps most striking, was the difference in hospitalization which was reduced from 5.2 days for open to 1.7 days with da Vinci. The authors concluded by saying, ""Implementing a unilateral approach to maximizing surgical efficiency greatly reduced surgical times without compromising patient morbidity, bringing down robotic times while still in a learning curve to close to those for radical hysterectomy. Thus, robotic radical hysterectomy may soon be considered the preferred standard front-line therapy for cervical cancer.""dVH for malignant conditions is growing rapidly, but dVH for benign conditions is growing even faster. In a study published in the last quarters, Journal of Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons, Dr. Abraham Shashoua and colleagues from the University of Illinois, Chicago, compared patient characteristics, operating variables and outcomes in 68 patients that had undergone a dVH or a total laparoscopic hysterectomy. They reported that when you factored out morcellation times, operating times were similar. Interestingly, length of stay was reduced approximately 30% from 1.4 days to one day for dVH. In parallel with the reduction in hospitalization was the significant decrease and requisite pain-reducing narcotics, 5.0 units for the total laparoscopic patients versus 1.2 units for the dVH patients. In his summary, Dr. Shashoua stated, ""Robotic hysterectomy can be performed safely with comparable operative times to those for conventional laparoscopic hysterectomy. Post-operative measures were improved over measures for conventional laparoscopy.""As you can assess from the procedure totals I reported earlier, we showed solid 23% dVP growth in 2009. The overall procedure growth on a raw unit basis was split fairly evenly between the U.S. and international customer base. However, our international dVP business is expanding at a much faster rate compared to the U.S. We would expect this to continue going forward. There is growing international awareness for dVP, the evidence of which can be found in a recent edition of the British Journal of Urology International. The British Journal featured a large meta analysis of 15 dVP publications published between 2006 and 2009, representing 9,277 dVP patients. The authors were comprised of a cohort of international investigators representing Florida Hospital on Celebration, Florida; the Division of Urology from the University of São Paulo, Brazil; the Division of Oncology from the Institute of Oncology in Milan, Italy. The large body of patients studied provided ample evidence for the authors to make the following summary comments, ""Many series are now mature enough to show the safety, efficacy and reproducibility of robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy. Robotic-assisted radical prostatectomy is associated with decreased operative blood loss and decreased risk of transfusions and comparative studies with open radical prostatectomy. Excellent functional and oncologic outcomes were reported in large series, with results at least comparable to those reported in open radical prostatectomy series. Limited preliminary studies appear to show advantages of robotic procedures in terms of length of stay, positive surgical margin rates and early potency and confidence.""We are exiting 2009 with strong international dVP momentum, which will be helpful in addressing this large opportunity. On December 16, the U.S. FDA granted us five 10-K clearance for transoral otolaryngologic surgical procedures (sic) [transoral otolaryngology surgical procedures] for benign, as well as malignant T1 and T2 tumors. Prior to this clearance, physicians seeking to perform ENT procedures were required to contain obtain an IRB. Despite the additional steps this process mandated, several of our nations leading ahead in net cancer centers applied for and received IRB clearances. Participating institutions included the University of Pennsylvania; Mayo Clinic, Rochester; M.D. Anderson; Mt. Sinai, New York; and the University of Alabama, Birmingham to name a few. Several hundred cases were performed during the year with excellent early results. At least three significant publications appeared in major head and neck journals, several abstracts presented at various meetings and a number of training sessions took place during 2009. The long-term ENT opportunity is difficult to size but with current approvals, we'd estimate the immediate U.S. target market to represent approximately 10,000 procedures compared to an international market opportunity in excess of 70,000 procedures. The potential patient value being described by leading physicians is very encouraging and perhaps as great as any we've seen thus far. We're excited by the opportunity of working with the ENT surgical community in the pursuit of improving head and neck patient care. That concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn the time over to Ben."

I will be providing our financial forecast for 2010, including procedures, revenues and the other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates on significant non-cash expenses to provide you with visibi",602,"Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing our financial forecast for 2010, including procedures, revenues and the other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates on significant non-cash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows. Starting with procedures, we continue to see strong growth across a wide range of procedures, particularly da Vinci Hysterectomies. And as a result, we expect our total procedures to grow approximately 35% for the year from the 205,000 procedures performed in 2009.Moving onto revenues. We expect to achieve annual revenue growth of approximately 25%. As a reminder, our revenues can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as system placements may vary. With regard to gross margin, we have averaged between 71% and 71.5% over the past two years. While gross margin can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to product and geography mix, we expect the average for 2010 to be about the same. Moving to operating expense. We expect our GAAP operating expense to grow by approximately 25% in 2010, which is in line with our expected top-line growth. Excluding non-cash stock compensation charges, we expect operating expense to grow approximately 23% to 24%. We are continuing to hire significant resources in the field to support newly and sold systems and to drive procedure growth, and we are continuing to invest in R&D projects to drive growth in our long-term business. We expect our non-cash stock compensation charges to increase from $97 million recorded in 2009 to approximately $127 million in 2010. In addition, we will continue to amortize previous purchases of intellectual property in our R&D expense line, which is scheduled to amortize at $14.5 million for the year. These items totaled over $140 million in estimated non-cash expense for the year.Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, has been decreasing due to lower interest rates on our cash investments. We expect other income to come in between $14 million and $15 million for the year, which is down from approximately $19 million last year.With regard to income tax, we have implemented an international tax structure that will allow us to begin reporting a lower tax rate going forward. We expect our tax rate for 2010 to come in at approximately 37%, which is four points lower than the 41% tax rate we reported for 2009.For calculating earnings per share, we ended 2009 with 38.5 million common shares outstanding and approximately 4.6 million option shares outstanding. Depending on our average stock price this year, a portion of the 4.6 million option shares will be added to the fully-diluted shares calculation. Assuming our stock price remains where it is today, we estimate that our share count for calculating EPS in Q1 will be approximately 40.1 million shares. And for calculating EPS for the year, we estimate it will be approximately 40.7 million shares.Finally, regarding our cash flows. As Gary mentioned, we generated $377 million in gross cash flow from operations in 2009 compared with our reported net income of $233 million. Since we are forecasting to report over $140 million in non-cash expense this year, our cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operations is a better measure of our actual performance than net income.Please note that the forecast I have just provided does not include any potential impact of a federal healthcare excise tax. Since we cannot predict if or when such a tax will take effect, we are not making any estimates. And with that, I would like to turn it back over to Gary."

What you're seeing more and more is that a number of programs and practices have converted several of their laparoscopic procedures to da Vinci procedures. And I think that's a trend that will continue. As far as again taking a number and saying that market opportunity is this size or that size, I think it's important to remind you that there's somewhere between 300 and perhaps 25,000 open hysterectomies. And there are somewhere on the order of 250,000 either laparoscopic or vaginal hysterectomies. I think it's safe to say that our market opportunity is going to be larger than the 250,000, but I don't think we're in a position to tell you how large it could be."

And the biggest thing is that stocking orders are becoming a less percentage of the total. And as that happens, that will gradually bring down our revenue per procedure metric. And another thing that does happen on a gradual basis, although there is noise in the system, is that customers, in general, become more efficient over time as the procedure numbers grow. So I think Marshall mentioned that if you compare fourth quarter of last year to fourth quarter of this year, I think it was down by about 4%. And that might be sort of a -- I know it's only a one-point measurement, but it's more of a better comparison than comparing two sequential quarters when you can have some more variations in a sequential rate."

But in terms of generally speaking, the answer to that really depends on the procedures. In other words, if all we were talking about, theoretically, was cardiac surgery, it would have one answer. If you add cardiac plus urology or prostatectomy, specifically, the number expands. You add more procedures in the vertical of urology, it expands even further. You turn on gynecology, it expands further and so on and so forth. So in terms of how far that number could go really will depend on how far the penetration is and how much value we add in the various procedures.

But at the same time, we have more and more hospitals purchasing second and third systems. So those are sort of the facts and I don't know if Ben has anything else to add."

I would like to share with you two of the many examples we receive daily of what this means in the lives of our patients.Our first patient is Mr. Dale Gan [ph], a patient of Dr. Brian Golden of Summerlin Hospital Medical Center in Nevada. ""This is my thanks to Dr. Golden for saving most of my left kidney. My story is a little unusual since I had already lost my right kidney to cancer in 2002. That whole kidney was removed in a traditional operation through a long shark bite that was awfully painful and took several months to recover from. Recently, my doctor found a new tumor in my left kidney, the only one I have left. I was scared I would need this kidney removed and be hooked up to dialysis for the rest of my life. The urologist who took out my right kidney years ago recommended Dr. Brian Golden. My primary doctor rated Dr. Goldman as excellent, which of course influenced my decision. But the deciding moments were when I actually met and discussed my case with Doctor G. He showed me my CAT scan and the tumor. He described the operation using the da Vinci robotic-assisted partial nephrectomy and showed me how much of my kidney could be saved. He had a very reassuring bedside manner, was confident but not arrogant and answered all of my questions. He made me feel comfortable that I had found the right surgeon for my terrifying situation. The surgery went great. My kidney was working just as well after surgery as beforehand. The few little incisions weren't very painful and I was out of the hospital in just a day and a half. When I saw Dr. Golden after surgery, he said the pathology report said all the cancer was removed. My primary care doctor was absolutely amazed at my speedy recovery and the difference in my incisions for the right and left kidney operations.""Another patient suffered from oral cancer and is a patient of Dr. Bert O'Malley from the University of Pennsylvania who with his partner, Dr. Greg Weinstein, is a leader in the creation of TransOral Vinci surgery. This patient writes, ""Dr. O'Malley, you have brought a miraculous change in my life. I now can swallow normally, do not have to force-feed my medications, do not need oxygen at night and feel like a new way of life has opened for me. How can I ever repay your kindness and skill for making this possible? I never can, so I'll simply say, 'God bless you for your kindness and help in changing my entire outlook.'""Patients like these are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand, and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking to you again in three months."

The breadth of procedures is commanding increased investments in our sales force and is reflected in our recent hiring.Turning to Systems, U.S. sales were robust. We did, however, see an increase in pressure on hospital capital budgets in Europe, where capital sales conversations mirrored those in the U.S. during the first half of last year. Lastly, we sold our first Systems in Japan this quarter post our shown-in approval. We'll discuss Japan in greater detail later in the call.As we move to highlights for the first quarter, recall that Q1 2009 financials included a revenue deferral associated with the introduction of the da Vinci Si system. In my year-over-year comparisons, I will compare financial performance excluding the deferral to give a more accurate picture of relative performance. With that as background, operating highlights for the first quarter are as follows: Procedures grew 37% over the first quarter of 2009. We sold 104 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up 38 from 66 during the first quarter of last year. Total revenue was $329 million, up 58% over last year.Instrument and Accessory revenue increased to $123 million, up 50% over last year. Total recurring revenue grew to $173 million, up 43% from prior year and comprising 53% of total revenue. Net income was $85 million, up 112% over last year. We generated an operating profit of $157 million before non-cash stock option expense, up 78% from the first quarter of last year and representing 48% of Q1 revenue.With operating profit percentage at this level, we do not expect to pursue further margin expansion. We will continue to share productivity gains with our customers and we will continue to invest in R&D and long-term growth opportunities for the business. We ended the quarter with $1,396,000,000 in cash and investments, up $224 million from last quarter and up $574 million from last year. Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $16 million invested in intellectual property and fixed assets. Excluding the impact of these outlays as well as $93 million from stock proceeds and $6 million used for working capital, we generated $153 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 180% of our reported GAAP net income in the first quarter.  I shared this number with you because we believe that it is the best measure of the economic horsepower of our company.As you know, we continue to make significant investments in research, development and manufacturing. Our largest investments focus on four areas. First, we are extending our issuance offering through major additions like multifunction energy devices and robotics stapling. Second, we are improving and expanding our imaging capabilities. Third, we are developing new patient side mechanisms. And finally, we are creating surgical networking and training technologies. Overall, we are pleased with the progress of our product development teams and our technology partners both in the depth of their achievements and in the speed with which they are accomplishing them.Lastly, as we enter new surgical markets and drive into new product arenas, we will invest in building our team, in expanding partnerships and in acquiring those technologies that can make a difference to robotic surgery. This quarter, we added 94 people to our team, predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D, bringing our total team to 1,357 employees. And with that, I'll pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer."
30239,99255861,56284,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2010",2010-04-15,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. Prior to providing you with the details of our first quarter results, I would like to provide you with a quick review of the deferral accounting that took place during 2009, which sets into context the proper comparables. Last year, we of",1329,"Thank you, Gary. Prior to providing you with the details of our first quarter results, I would like to provide you with a quick review of the deferral accounting that took place during 2009, which sets into context the proper comparables. Last year, we offered certain first quarter 2009 customers the opportunity to upgrade their da Vinci S systems to da Vinci Si systems at a discount to the otherwise list price for such an upgrade. We also offered those customers the opportunity to return da Vinci S accessories in exchange for da Vinci Si accessories. As a result, we deferred a total of $20 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2009, comprised of $18 million of system revenue associated with system upgrade offers and $2 million of accessory revenue. We recognized $14 million of the total $20 million deferral in our second quarter of 2009 and the remaining $6 million in the third quarter of 2009.I will now walk you through our revenue results with the comparisons to the first quarter of 2009 as though the deferral had not occurred. Our first quarter revenue was $329 million, up 58% compared with $209 million for the first quarter of 2009, and up 2% compared with $323 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. First quarter revenues by product category were as follows: First quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $123 million, up 50% compared with $82 million for the first quarter of 2009 and up 8% compared with $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase compared with prior quarters reflects procedure growth and higher initial stocking orders.The amount of instrument and accessory revenue we realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,970 per procedure, which is approximately $170 higher than the first quarter of 2009 and approximately the same as the fourth quarter. The year-to-year increase primarily reflects higher stocking orders in the current quarter in customer buying patterns as we believe that customers reduced inventory levels in the first quarter of 2009 in the face of a deteriorating economic environment. We expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline over time given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger install base.First quarter 2010 systems revenue of $155 million increased 77%, compared with $88 million of systems revenue for the first quarter of 2009 and decreased 4% compared with $162 million of systems revenue for the fourth quarter. We sold 104 systems in the first quarter of 2010, compared with 66 systems last year and 110 systems last quarter. 80 of the 104 or 77% of the units sold in the quarter were da Vinci Si systems. There were 17 da Vinci standard systems traded in this quarter, compared to six in the first quarter of 2009 and 23 last quarter.First quarter system revenue also included $5 million of upgrade revenue, compared to none in the first quarter of 2009 and $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our first quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models, but excluding upgrades in the revenue deferral was $1.45 million, an increase from $1.33 million realized in the first quarter of 2009 and an increase from the $1.41 million realized in the fourth quarter.The increase compared to the prior year reflects the introduction of the Si product, which has a higher price point than the S. The increase compared to the fourth quarter reflects favorable customer and product mix. We expect ASPs over the next several quarters to return to historical levels.Service revenue increased to $51 million, up 29% compared with $39 million last year, and up 6% compared with $48 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was driven by a larger system install base.Total first quarter recurring revenue comprised of Instrument, Accessory and Service revenue, increased to $173 million, up 43% compared with the first quarter of 2009, and up 8% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. Recurring revenue represented 53% of total first quarter revenue compared with 58% in the first quarter last year and 50% last quarter.Revenue by geography was as follows: Non-U.S. revenue represented 21% of our total revenue in the quarter, compared with 25% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2009 and 22% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009. Overall procedures grew faster outside of the U.S. We sold 24 systems outside the U.S., compared with 22 in the first quarter of 2009 and 30 last quarter. Seven of the systems sold in the first quarter were early thought leaders in Japan. We would remind you, however, that adoption in Japan is expected to proceed slowly. And therefore, we expect system volume to decline in Japan quarter-to-quarter.  Excluding Japan, non-U.S. system sales decreased attributable to reduced capital spending in a challenging European economic environment.Moving onto the remainder of the P&L. Let me remind you that there were no costs deferred in conjunction with the first quarter 2009 revenue deferral. And therefore, the $20 million deferral had an equal impact on revenue, gross profit and operating income.Gross margin in the first quarter was 73%, compared with first quarter 2009 gross margin, excluding the impact of the deferral of 71%, and compared with fourth quarter 2009 gross margin of 72%. The increase in gross margin reflects increased system ASPs, material cost reductions and absorption of fixed costs over a larger revenue base.First quarter 2010 operating expenses of $111 million were up 32%, compared with the first quarter of 2009 and up 6% compared with the fourth quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter and increased investment in research and development. We added 94 employees during the quarter, including 49 employees in the sales service organization, as we continue to expand our clinical sales force. And 39 employees in operations, as we continue to grow manufacturing capacity and invest in research and development. First Quarter 2010 operating income was $130 million or 40% of sales, compared with $65 million or 31% of sales for the first quarter of 2009, excluding the impact of the deferral, and $128 million or 40% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2009.First quarter 2010 operating income reflected $27 million of non-cash stock compensation expense, compared with $23 million for the first quarter of 2009 and $25 million last quarter. The growth in non-cash compensation reflects our annual grant made February 15 of each year. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 36% was lower than our 2009 rate of 41%, reflecting the implementation of our international tax structure.Our net income was $85 million or $2.12 per share, compared with $40 million or $1.02 per share for the first quarter of 2009, excluding the impact of the deferral, and $78 million or $1.95 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009.Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter of 2010 with cash and investments of $1,396,000,000, up $224 million compared with December 31, 2009. The increase during the quarter reflects $153 million of cash flows from operations and $93 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $16 million of capital expenditures. $3 million of our capital expenditures relate to the construction of our new manufacturing facility next to our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale. We anticipate that building to be completed in early 2011.Our accounts receivable balance decreased to $180 million at March 31 from $205 million at December 31. The decrease in accounts receivable reflects the timing of systems shipments. Our net inventory increased to $69 million at March 31 from $58 million at December 31. We increased inventory during the quarter since we believe that inventory at December 31 was below optimal levels. We will likely continue to increase inventory levels in future quarters. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

During the first quarter, we sold 104 da Vinci Systems; 80 in the United States, 11 in Europe and 13 in Rest of World markets. As part of the 104 systems sales, 17 standard da Vinci Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 87 system additions to the install base during the quarter, which brings to 1,482 accumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide. 1,091 in the U.S., 264 in Europe and 127 in Rest of World markets. 44 of the 104 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers. Also during the quarter, nine customers purchased upgrades to convert their da Vinci S Systems into da Vinci Si Systems. The outlier this quarter was Japan, with seven da Vinci placements. As was stated earlier, several of these placements were sold to early Japanese thought leaders who are anxiously awaiting shown-in clearance and importation rights. Although we're pleased with these sales, we don't expect this rate of Japanese purchases to continue for the near future.Clinically, we had another nice quarter, with good sequential procedure growth within our targeted procedures. da Vinci Hysterectomy and Prostatectomy showed solid growth, whereas Partial Nephrectomy, Sacrocolpopexy, ENT and colon and rectal procedures showed large percentage sequential growth. Within our Hysterectomy business, for the first time in several quarters, dVH for malignant conditions showed larger sequential growth than dVH for benign conditions. It's difficult to say for certain why that was but it's our belief that three factors probably played a role. One, the Q1 reset of copayment minimum spending. Two, high unemployment rates. And three, the difficult sales force task of simultaneously managing multiple high-growth procedure businesses. The latter, we can do something about. In fact, we've recently made some adjustments to our sales structure to better-support the large, benign hysterectomy market. During the quarter, nearly 300 da Vinci-related clinical publications and abstracts appeared within various peer-reviewed journals. With a current trend in healthcare policy moving directionally toward comparative effectiveness research, it's our belief that we'll be well positioned in the evidence-based environment. With volumes of peer-reviewed da Vinci publications already in print, as well as more due to be published, clinicians, policymakers and patients are in position to make informed healthcare decisions. As we've said before, comparative effectiveness research done well is something we very much support. As it pertains to dVP versus open prostatectomy, an excellent comparative study out of Vanderbilt University was recently published in the Journal of Urology. The paper emanated out of the university's Department of Urology and Biostatistics and is entitled, Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy Versus Radical Retropubic Prostatectomy for Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: Comparison of Short-Term Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival. 1,904 men represented the cohort study between June of 2003 and January of 2008, where 491 received an open retro-pubic prostatectomy and 1,413 received a dVP. As you might suspect, the study is filled with detailed analysis, which I'll spare you today. But I'd encourage those of you interested to pick up a copy and read through it yourselves. To summarize, the three-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate was statistically similar between the da Vinci Prostatectomy and the radical retro-pubic prostatectomy groups on the whole, as well as when stratified by pathological stage, grade and margin status. On a multi-variant analysis, extra-capsular extension, pathological grade 7 or greater and positive surgical margin were independent predictors of biochemical recurrence, while surgical approach was not. The authors concluded by saying, and I quote, ""The likelihood of biochemical recurrence was similar between groups when stratified by known risk factors of recurrence. Surgical approach was not a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence in the multi-variant model. Our analysis is suggestive of comparative effectiveness for robotic-assisted prostatectomy.""Of all the desired endpoints associated with prostatectomy, none is more important than cancer control. One of the fastest-growing procedures that you haven't heard a great deal about is da Vinci's Sacrocolpopexy. Sacrocolpopexy is performed for the condition of vaginal vault prolapse and has an estimated annual U.S. market opportunity of between 60,000 and 70,000 patients. The gold standard surgical approach for this debilitating condition is an open sacrocolpopexy. But since this approach requires a laparotomy, which is associated with longer hospitalization and increased blood loss, the postoperative road to recovery is often slow and painful as compared with less invasive approaches. Traditional laparoscopic approaches were introduced nearly 15 years ago. And in the hands of skilled laparoscopists can be an alternative to the open approach. However, laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy is considered technically challenging due to its limitations, such as lack of depth perception and surgical access required for difficult suture placements. Da Vinci is rapidly proving capable in overcoming these clinical and technical challenges. A paper out of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Rochester Medical Center entitled, Recovery after Robotic-Assisted (sic) [Robot-Assisted] Laparoscopic Sacrocolpopexy, the patient's perspective, authored by McNanley, Buchsbaum, et al, look closely at the patient's perioperative experience. In their analysis, patients were queried about resumption of activities, such as work, driving, bowel function, whether recovery went as expected and whether they would recommend this surgery to others. Use of pain medication, pain scores and perioperative data were collected. And with 21 patients, which is admittedly small, but smaller-than-desired sample sizes is the reality of evaluating procedures that are still in the early part of the adoption curve. Be that as it may, I think it's pretty significant when 100% of the respondents stated that they would recommend a da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy to a friend. 72% indicated that the recovery went better than expected. 28% felt that the recovery went as expected and 0% felt that the recovery went worse than expected. Patient advocates had been a powerful component to the success of several da Vinci procedures, so we're encouraged when we hear the early reports on an emerging procedure support this trend.Over the past few quarters, you've heard us describe substantive product development projects aimed toward the general and colorectal surgery markets. We've also highlighted that colorectal and, specifically, low rectal cancer resections, are among our fastest-growing procedures. The number of peer-reviewed publications in these specialties has grown rapidly, and this past quarter was no exception. In the Annals of Surgical Oncology, a study entitled, Multicentric Study on Robotic Tumor-Specific Mesorectal Excision for the Treatment of Rectal Cancer, was published. It was a prospective of three-center study on 143 consecutive patients, which, for the record, was analyzed by an independent researcher. The three centers included City of Hope National Cancer Center in California, the European Institute of Oncology in Milan and Hospital San Matteo in Spoleto, Italy. In their commentary, the authors stated that to the best of their knowledge, the present study evaluating robotic-assisted, tumor-specific rectal surgery represents the largest series ever published with the longest follow-up period. The majority of the patient cohort had either mid- or low-rectal tumor, and 65% received neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Even though both conditions are known to render surgical dissection demanding, successful excisions were successfully completed in over 95% of the patients and successful restoration of bowel continuity was achieved in 78.3% of them. Margin clearance was obtained in all but one patient, with the number of harvested nodes that compares favorably with that of open and laparoscopic series. Survival curve analysis revealed a three-year overall survival rate of 97%, and isolated local recurrence were not found during mean follow-up of 17.4 months.When discussing the technical differences between laparoscopy and robotic approaches, the authors stated, and I quote, ""Laparoscopy offers an optimal tumor-specific mesorectal excision, or TME, with intact pelvic fascia and even greater accuracy than the open technique, but use of non-articulated forceps, camera tremor and surgeon fatigue make this procedure demanding and restricted to a few centers. Robotic TME seems to enhance microdissection accuracy, leading to a better and more comfortable mesorectal dissection with a lower risk of circumferential resection margin."" Later, the authors went on to say, and again I quote, ""We feel that robotic surgery could dramatically change the standard approach to rectal cancer employed to date.""This week, the 12th World Congress of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, or SAGES, convenes in Landover, Maryland. This year, Intuitive will have a bigger present than in the years passed. Clinical prototypes of our single-site product for single incision da Vinci surgery will be on display at our booth. But to be clear, these products are early within the FDA clearance process and should not be viewed as commercially available products at this stage. However, da Vinci multiport, general and colorectal surgery products and procedures, which are commercially available, will be discussed and featured within various conference sessions.Our product development and marketing groups have been very active in the area of general and colorectal surgery. And the reason is simple, it's our belief and the belief of many of our customers at the benefits of da Vinci surgery can positively affect a number of patients being treated within these specialties.Though we are in the early phases of procedure adoption within these specialties, the early indicators appear positive. That concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn the time over to Ben [ph] (40.15)."

I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2010, including procedures, revenues and the other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates on significant non-cash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows.Starting with procedures. As Gary mentioned, our procedures this past quarter grew 37% over the year ago first quarter. We continue to expect our total procedures to grow approximately 35% for the year from the approximately 205,000 procedures performed in 2009. Moving on to revenues. Based on the upside we recorded in the first quarter, we are increasing our forecast for annual revenue growth to 27% to 30%, which is up from our previous estimate of 25%. As a reminder, our revenues can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as system placements may vary. With regard to our Japan revenues, as previously mentioned, while we sold seven systems in Q1, we do not expect to maintain this level of quarterly system sales in Japan for the balance of 2010.With regard to gross margin, the 73% margin we achieved in Q1 was higher than in previous quarters, due to higher ASPs on systems and manufacturing efficiencies. We expect ASPs to return to historical levels. As Gary indicated, we will continue to share productivity gains with our customers and as a result, we expect gross margins to be approximately 72% for the year.Moving to operating expense. We are making significant investments across multiple areas of our business, particularly our sales force, manufacturing and R&D. We now expect our total GAAP operating expense to grow by 27% to 29% in 2010, compared with our previous forecast of 25% growth.In terms of non-cash expenses, we expect to record stock compensation charges of approximately $122 million in 2010, which is a little lower than our previous forecast of $127 million. In addition, previous purchases of intellectual property are scheduled to amortize in our R&D line at approximately $15 million for the year. Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, is expected to come in between $16 million and $18 million for the year. With regard to income tax, as Marshall mentioned earlier, we have begun taking advantage of the international tax structure we created to report a lower tax rate this year. We recorded a 36.2% tax rate for Q1 and we expect to record the same rate for the full year. This is a significant improvement over the 41% tax rate we recorded for 2009.For calculating earnings per share, we ended the first quarter with 39.2 million common shares outstanding and approximately 5.1 million option shares outstanding. Depending on our average stock price this year, a portion of the 5.1 million auction shares will be added to the fully diluted shares calculation.Assuming our stock price remains where it is today, we estimate that our share count for calculating EPS in Q2 will be approximately 40.6 million shares. And for calculating EPS for the year, we estimate it'll be approximately 40.8 million shares.Finally, regarding our cash flows. Since we are forecasting to report over $137 million in non-cash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generate from operations is a better measure of our actual performance than net income. Once again, cash flows from operations in Q1 were $153 million compared with our net income of $85 million. And with that, we would like to open the call to your questions."

That's a procedure that's done in a lot of different places, and there are a lot of people that own large practices. So we're really trying to focus some specialists, if you will, in that area, so they don't have to make the decision on, should they go and support a prostatectomy case or a partial nephrectomy case. Believe me, there's a lot of integration that is going to be natural in the sales organization, but we're really looking to bolster that side of it a little bit more."

So I think what we have always believed is where there's great patient value, we stand a very good chance to be rapidly adopted. Now within all of those procedures, I should say within some of those procedures in the broader category, you find that laparoscopy has been introduced or had been introduced 15 or -- is many as 20 years ago in some of those areas, but the penetration is very low. Why? Because it's technically demanding. And so what we have found in the past is where those procedures have been technically demanding laparoscopically, where we can prove capable, we tend to have rapid adoption.

If you look at low rectal cancers, there is laparoscopic colorectal surgery being done all over the United States and all over the world. But when you get to the low rectal cancers, those tend to be restricted to a few centers, high-volume centers. There seems to be a lot of consistency between that anatomy obviously and the male pelvic anatomy and working in prostatectomy. The same challenges that existed in laparoscopic prostatectomy exist in laparoscopic low rectal cancers. So there are some indicators there that I think are favorable. When you move into other areas, such as, again, now moving up into general thoracic sort of non-cardiac thoracic operations, that could be a large area.

As we have said previously as we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following experiences give you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients.One patient is Ronda of Florida. Ronda describes her experience as follows.""Although I have had a uterine fibroid for years, I have successfully been able to avoid surgery. I had no symptoms and the fibroid was causing no problems, so I couldn't bring myself to go through my preconceived notion of a hysterectomy when it wasn't absolutely necessary. After my recent ultrasound and subsequent CT scan revealed that it was now impacting my ureter and kidney, I could know longer avoid action. Thankfully, my new OB/GYN, Dr. Carol MacKenzie, recommended that I contact Dr. Sam [ph] about a da Vinci robotic procedure. I was concerned that the fibroid was too big to even consider a robotic procedure, so I called to check before even making an appointment. I felt very confident that I wanted her to do the surgery but had previously scheduled a second appointment with a prominent surgeon who had performed this surgery on my friend just a few weeks earlier. At my consultation with him, he was adamant that the fibroid was simply too large to consider anything other than an abdominal hysterectomy. I called Dr. Sam's [ph] office to discuss it. And while she couldn't guarantee that it could be done robotically, she was 80% to 85% sure that she could do it that way. For me, those were good enough odds. And I truly believe that if anyone could do it, she was the one. I went home the day after my surgery and was able to get up and down the stairs without significant pain, though I moved slowly. 72 hours after my surgery, I felt well enough to go to my daughter's soccer game and accompany my husband to his holiday party later that evening. Although I was still feeling a little bloated and swollen, for the most part I felt amazing. For me, this experience has underscored how important it is for people to find out the latest treatments available yet how important it is for people to also realize how critical it is to select the most competent and experienced technician. After years of avoiding this surgery, it's so nice to finally have it behind me.""The second patient is Doug, a Marketing Director at a hospital in West Virginia, who describes his experience as follows:""I had been diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse as a child. But it had never progressed to anything remarkable until September of 2009 when I began experiencing shortness of breath, chest and back tightness and uncomfortable palpitations. After numerous tests, it was determined that my mitral valve prolapse had progressed to severe mitral regurgitation. And that I would need to either have my valve repaired or replaced. After considerable research, I was committed to finding a physician and a facility that could most importantly repair my mitral valves. And secondarily, repair it with robotic assistance from the da Vinci Surgical System. My research led me to Dr. Marc Gillinov at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, who did a fantastic job repairing both the anterior and posterior leaflets of my mitral valve, robotically. My recovery has been remarkably fast and easy. I feel great and there are no signs of regurgitation or a heart murmur anymore. I'm completely fixed. I can't tell you what a relief it is to know that my health problems are now solved, that my sternum didn't have to be sawed and spread apart. And that I can look forward to living a long, healthy life with my wonderful family. I truly feel blessed."" Patients like these are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference. This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking with you again in three months."

30239,99255861,56426,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2010",2010-04-15,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you for joining us today. In this first quarter, our team has executed well. We continue to see broad interest in da Vinci Surgery by our customers across a variety of procedures, which is reflected in our strong financial results for the quarter. W",672,"Thank you for joining us today. In this first quarter, our team has executed well. We continue to see broad interest in da Vinci Surgery by our customers across a variety of procedures, which is reflected in our strong financial results for the quarter. With regard to procedures, we experienced continued growth in numerous specialties. Urologic and gynecologic procedures continue to lead the way and we see early signs of growth in both general and colorectal surgery and thoracic procedures. We are also pleased that European procedure growth was strong in the quarter.
While the diversity of procedures is encouraging, it presents both opportunities and sales management challenges. The breadth of procedures is commanding increased investments in our sales force and is reflected in our recent hiring.
Turning to Systems, U.S. sales were robust. We did, however, see an increase in pressure on hospital capital budgets in Europe, where capital sales conversations mirrored those in the U.S. during the first half of last year. Lastly, we sold our first Systems in Japan this quarter post our shown-in approval. We'll discuss Japan in greater detail later in the call.
As we move to highlights for the first quarter, recall that Q1 2009 financials included a revenue deferral associated with the introduction of the da Vinci Si system. In my year-over-year comparisons, I will compare financial performance excluding the deferral to give a more accurate picture of relative performance. 
With that as background, operating highlights for the first quarter are as follows: Procedures grew 37% over the first quarter of 2009. We sold 104 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up 38 from 66 during the first quarter of last year. Total revenue was $329 million, up 58% over last year.
Instrument and Accessory revenue increased to $123 million, up 50% over last year. Total recurring revenue grew to $173 million, up 43% from prior year and comprising 53% of total revenue. Net income was $85 million, up 112% over last year. We generated an operating profit of $157 million before non-cash stock option expense, up 78% from the first quarter of last year and representing 48% of Q1 revenue.
With operating profit percentage at this level, we do not expect to pursue further margin expansion. We will continue to share productivity gains with our customers and we will continue to invest in R&D and long-term growth opportunities for the business. 
We ended the quarter with $1,396,000,000 in cash and investments, up $224 million from last quarter and up $574 million from last year. Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $16 million invested in intellectual property and fixed assets. Excluding the impact of these outlays as well as $93 million from stock proceeds and $6 million used for working capital, we generated $153 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 180% of our reported GAAP net income in the first quarter.  I shared this number with you because we believe that it is the best measure of the economic horsepower of our company.
As you know, we continue to make significant investments in research, development and manufacturing. Our largest investments focus on four areas. First, we are extending our Eschmann offering through major additions like multifunction energy devices and robotics stapling. Second, we are improving and expanding our imaging capabilities. Third, we are developing new patient side mechanisms. And finally, we are creating surgical networking and training technologies. Overall, we are pleased with the progress of our product development teams and our technology partners, both in the depth of their achievements, and in the speed with which they are accomplishing them.
Lastly, as we enter new surgical markets and drive into new product arenas, we will invest in building our team, in expanding partnerships and in acquiring those technologies that can make a difference to robotic surgery. This quarter, we added 94 people to our team, predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D, bringing our total team to 1,357 employees. And with that, I'll pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer."
30239,99255861,56426,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 15, 2010",2010-04-15,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. Prior to providing you with the details of our first quarter results, I would like to provide you with a quick review of the deferral accounting that took place during 2009, which sets into context the proper comparables. Last year, we",1343,"Thank you, Gary. Prior to providing you with the details of our first quarter results, I would like to provide you with a quick review of the deferral accounting that took place during 2009, which sets into context the proper comparables. 
Last year, we offered certain first quarter 2009 customers the opportunity to upgrade their da Vinci S systems to da Vinci Si systems at a discount to the otherwise list price for such an upgrade. We also offered those customers the opportunity to return da Vinci S accessories in exchange for da Vinci Si accessories. 
As a result, we deferred a total of $20 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2009, comprised of $18 million of system revenue associated with system upgrade offers and $2 million of accessory revenue. We recognized $14 million of the total $20 million deferral in our second quarter of 2009 and the remaining $6 million in the third quarter of 2009.
I will now walk you through our revenue results with comparisons to the first quarter of 2009 as though the deferral had not occurred. Our first quarter revenue was $329 million, up 58% compared with $209 million for the first quarter of 2009, and up 2% compared with $323 million for the fourth quarter of 2009. 
First quarter revenues by product category were as follows: First quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $123 million, up 50% compared with $82 million for the first quarter of 2009, and up 8% compared with $113 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. The increase compared with prior quarters reflects procedure growth and higher initial stocking orders.
The amount of instrument and accessory revenue we realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders, was approximately $1,970 per procedure, which is approximately $170 higher than the first quarter of 2009 and approximately the same as the fourth quarter. The year-to-year increase primarily reflects higher stocking orders in the current quarter in customer buying patterns as we believe that customers reduced inventory levels in the first quarter of 2009 in the face of a deteriorating economic environment. We expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline over time given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger install base.
First quarter 2010 systems revenue of $155 million increased 77% compared with $88 million of systems revenue for the first quarter of 2009, and decreased 4% compared with $162 million of systems revenue for the fourth quarter. We sold 104 systems in the first quarter of 2010, compared with 66 systems last year and 110 systems last quarter. 80 of the 104 or 77% of the units sold in the quarter were da Vinci Si systems. There were 17 da Vinci standard systems traded in this quarter compared to six in the first quarter of 2009 and 23 last quarter.
First quarter system revenue also included $5 million of upgrade revenue compared to none in the first quarter of 2009, and $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our first quarter average sales price per system, including all da Vinci models, but excluding upgrades in the revenue deferral, was $1.45 million, an increase from $1.33 million realized in the first quarter of 2009 and an increase from the $1.41 million realized in the fourth quarter.
The increase compared to the prior year reflects the introduction of the Si product, which has a higher price point than the S. The increase compared to the fourth quarter reflects favorable customer and product mix. We expect ASPs over the next several quarters to return to historical levels.
Service revenue increased to $51 million, up 29% compared with $39 million last year, and up 6% compared with $48 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was driven by a larger system install base.
Total first quarter recurring revenue comprised of Instrument, Accessory and Service revenue, increased to $173 million, up 43% compared with the first quarter of 2009, and up 8% compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. Recurring revenue represented 53% of total first quarter revenue compared with 58% in the first quarter last year and 50% last quarter.
Revenue by geography was as follows: Non-U.S. revenue represented 21% of our total revenue in the quarter, compared with 25% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2009 and 22% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of 2009. Overall procedures grew faster outside of the U.S. 
We sold 24 systems outside the U.S. compared with 22 in the first quarter of 2009 and 30 last quarter. Seven of the systems sold in the first quarter were early thought leaders in Japan. We would remind you, however, that adoption in Japan is expected to proceed slowly. And therefore, we expect system volume to decline in Japan quarter-to-quarter.  Excluding Japan, non-U.S. system sales decreased attributable to reduced capital spending and a challenging European economic environment.
Moving onto the remainder of the P&L. Let me remind you that there were no costs deferred in conjunction with the first quarter 2009 revenue deferral. And therefore, the $20 million deferral had an equal impact on revenue, gross profit and operating income.
Gross margin in the first quarter was 73% compared with first quarter 2009 gross margin, excluding the impact of the deferral of 71%, and compared with fourth quarter 2009 gross margin of 72%. The increase in gross margin reflects increased system ASPs, material cost reductions and absorption of fixed costs over a larger revenue base.
First quarter 2010 operating expenses of $111 million were up 32% compared with the first quarter of 2009, and up 6% compared with the fourth quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter and increased investment in research and development. We added 94 employees during the quarter, including 49 employees in the sales service organization, as we continue to expand our clinical sales force, and 39 employees in operations, as we continue to grow manufacturing capacity and invest in research and development. 
First quarter 2010 operating income was $130 million or 40% of sales compared with $65 million or 31% of sales for the first quarter of 2009, excluding the impact of the deferral, and $128 million or 40% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2009.
First quarter 2010 operating income reflected $27 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $23 million for the first quarter of 2009 and $25 million last quarter. The growth in non-cash compensation reflects our annual grant made February 15 of each year. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 36% was lower than our 2009 rate of 41%, reflecting the implementation of our international tax structure.
Our net income was $85 million or $2.12 per share compared with $40 million or $1.02 per share for the first quarter of 2009, excluding the impact of the deferral, and $78 million or $1.95 per share for the fourth quarter of 2009.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter of 2010 with cash and investments of $1,396,000,000, up $224 million compared with December 31, 2009. The increase during the quarter reflects $153 million of cash flows from operations and $93 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $16 million of capital expenditures. $3 million of our capital expenditures relate to the construction of our new manufacturing facility next to our corporate headquarters in Sunnyvale. We anticipate that building to be completed in early 2011.
Our accounts receivable balance decreased to $180 million at March 31 from $205 million at December 31. The decrease in accounts receivable reflects the timing of systems shipments. 
Our net inventory increased to $69 million at March 31 from $58 million at December 31. We increased inventory during the quarter since we believe that inventory at December 31 was below optimal levels. We will likely continue to increase inventory levels in future quarters. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

During the first quarter, we sold 104 da Vinci Systems; 80 in the United States, 11 in Europe and 13 in Rest of World markets. As part of the 104 systems sales, 17 standard da Vinci Systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 87 system additions to the install base during the quarter, which brings to 1,482 accumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide. 1,091 in the U.S., 264 in Europe and 127 in Rest of World markets. 44 of the 104 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers. 
Also during the quarter, nine customers purchased upgrades to convert their da Vinci S Systems into da Vinci Si Systems. The outlier this quarter was Japan, with seven da Vinci placements. As was stated earlier, several of these placements were sold to early Japanese thought leaders who are anxiously awaiting shown-in clearance and importation rights. Although we're pleased with these sales, we don't expect this rate of Japanese purchases to continue for the near future.
Clinically, we had another nice quarter, with good sequential procedure growth within our targeted procedures. da Vinci Hysterectomy and Prostatectomy showed solid growth, whereas Partial Nephrectomy, Sacrocolpopexy, ENT and colon and rectal procedures showed large percentage sequential growth. 
Within our Hysterectomy business, for the first time in several quarters, dVH for malignant conditions showed larger sequential growth than dVH for benign conditions. It's difficult to say for certain why that was, but it's our belief that three factors probably played a role: One, the Q1 reset of copayment minimum spending; two, high unemployment rates; and three, the difficult sales force task of simultaneously managing multiple high-growth procedure businesses. The latter we can do something about. In fact, we've recently made some adjustments to our sales structure to better support the large, benign hysterectomy market. 
During the quarter, nearly 300 da Vinci-related clinical publications and abstracts appeared within various peer-reviewed journals. With a current trend in healthcare policy moving directionally toward comparative effectiveness research, it's our belief that we'll be well positioned in the evidence-based environment. With volumes of peer-reviewed da Vinci publications already in print, as well as more due to be published, clinicians, policymakers and patients are in position to make informed healthcare decisions. 
As we've said before, comparative effectiveness research done well is something we very much support. As it pertains to dVP versus open prostatectomy, an excellent comparative study out of Vanderbilt University was recently published in the Journal of Urology. The paper emanated out of the university's Department of Urology and Biostatistics and is entitled, Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy Versus Radical Retropubic Prostatectomy for Clinically Localized Prostate Cancer: Comparison of Short-Term Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival. 1,904 men represented the cohort study between June of 2003, and January of 2008, where 491 received an open retro-pubic prostatectomy and 1,413 received a dVP. 
As you might suspect, the study is filled with detailed analysis, which I'll spare you today. But I'd encourage those of you interested to pick up a copy and read through it yourselves. 
To summarize, the three-year biochemical recurrence-free survival rate was statistically similar between the da Vinci Prostatectomy and the radical retro-pubic prostatectomy groups on the whole, as well as when stratified by pathological stage, grade and margin status. On a multi-variant analysis, extra-capsular extension, pathological grade 7 or greater and positive surgical margin were independent predictors of biochemical recurrence, while surgical approach was not. 
The authors concluded by saying, and I quote, ""The likelihood of biochemical recurrence was similar between groups when stratified by known risk factors of recurrence. Surgical approach was not a significant predictor of biochemical recurrence in the multi-variant model. Our analysis is suggestive of comparative effectiveness for robotic-assisted prostatectomy.""
Of all the desired endpoints associated with prostatectomy, none is more important than cancer control. One of the fastest-growing procedures that you haven't heard a great deal about is da Vinci's Sacrocolpopexy. Sacrocolpopexy is performed for the condition of vaginal vault prolapse and has an estimated annual U.S. market opportunity of between 60,000 and 70,000 patients. 
The gold standard surgical approach for this debilitating condition is an open sacrocolpopexy. But since this approach requires a laparotomy, which is associated with longer hospitalization and increased blood loss, the postoperative road to recovery is often slow and painful as compared with less invasive approaches. 
Traditional laparoscopic approaches were introduced nearly 15 years ago. And in the hands of skilled laparoscopists can be an alternative to the open approach. However, laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy is considered technically challenging due to its limitations, such as lack of depth perception and surgical access required for difficult suture placements. 
Da Vinci is rapidly proving capable in overcoming these clinical and technical challenges. A paper out of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Rochester Medical Center entitled, Recovery after Robotic-Assisted (sic) [Robot-Assisted] Laparoscopic Sacrocolpopexy, the patient's perspective, authored by McNanley, Buchsbaum, et al, look closely at the patient's perioperative experience. In their analysis, patients were queried about resumption of activities, such as work, driving, bowel function, whether recovery went as expected and whether they would recommend this surgery to others. Use of pain medication, pain scores and perioperative data were collected. And with 21 patients, which is admittedly small, but smaller-than-desired sample sizes is the reality of evaluating procedures that are still in the early part of the adoption curve. 
Be that as it may, I think it's pretty significant when 100% of the respondents stated that they would recommend a da Vinci Sacrocolpopexy to a friend. 72% indicated that the recovery went better than expected. 28% felt that the recovery went as expected and 0% felt that the recovery went worse than expected. Patient advocates had been a powerful component to the success of several da Vinci procedures, so we're encouraged when we hear the early reports on an emerging procedure support this trend.
Over the past few quarters, you've heard us describe substantive product development projects aimed toward the general and colorectal surgery markets. We've also highlighted that colorectal and, specifically, low rectal cancer resections, are among our fastest-growing procedures. The number of peer-reviewed publications in these specialties has grown rapidly, and this past quarter was no exception. 
In the Annals of Surgical Oncology, a study entitled, Multicentric Study on Robotic Tumor-Specific Mesorectal Excision for the Treatment of Rectal Cancer, was published. It was a prospective of three-center study on 143 consecutive patients, which, for the record, was analyzed by an independent researcher. The three centers included City of Hope National Cancer Center in California, the European Institute of Oncology in Milan and Hospital San Matteo in Spoleto, Italy. 
In their commentary, the authors stated that to the best of their knowledge, the present study evaluating robotic-assisted, tumor-specific rectal surgery represents the largest series ever published with the longest follow-up period. The majority of the patient cohort had either mid- or low-rectal tumor, and 65% received neoadjuvant chemoradiation. 
Even though both conditions are known to render surgical dissection demanding, successful excisions were successfully completed in over 95% of the patients and successful restoration of bowel continuity was achieved in 78.3% of them. Margin clearance was obtained in all but one patient, with the number of harvested nodes that compares favorably with that of open and laparoscopic series. Survival curve analysis revealed a three-year overall survival rate of 97%, and isolated local recurrence were not found during mean follow-up of 17.4 months.
When discussing the technical differences between laparoscopy and robotic approaches, the authors stated, and I quote, ""Laparoscopy offers an optimal tumor-specific mesorectal excision, or TME, with intact pelvic fascia and even greater accuracy than the open technique, but use of non-articulated forceps, camera tremor and surgeon fatigue make this procedure demanding and restricted to a few centers. Robotic TME seems to enhance microdissection accuracy, leading to a better and more comfortable mesorectal dissection with a lower risk of circumferential resection margin."" Later, the authors went on to say, and again I quote, ""We feel that robotic surgery could dramatically change the standard approach to rectal cancer employed to date.""
This week, the 12th World Congress of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons, or SAGES, convenes in Landover, Maryland. This year, Intuitive will have a bigger present than in the years passed. 
Clinical prototypes of our single-site product for single incision da Vinci surgery will be on display at our booth. But to be clear, these products are early within the FDA clearance process and should not be viewed as commercially available products at this stage. However, da Vinci multiport, general and colorectal surgery products and procedures, which are commercially available, will be discussed and featured within various conference sessions.
Our product development and marketing groups have been very active in the area of general and colorectal surgery. And the reason is simple, it's our belief and the belief of many of our customers at the benefits of da Vinci surgery can positively affect a number of patients being treated within these specialties.
Though we are in the early phases of procedure adoption within these specialties, the early indicators appear positive. That concludes my remarks, and I'll now turn the time over to Ben."

I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2010, including procedures, revenues and the other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates on significant non-cash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows.
Starting with procedures. As Gary mentioned, our procedures this past quarter grew 37% over the year ago first quarter. We continue to expect our total procedures to grow approximately 35% for the year from the approximately 205,000 procedures performed in 2009. 
Moving on to revenues. Based on the upside we recorded in the first quarter, we are increasing our forecast for annual revenue growth to 27% to 30%, which is up from our previous estimate of 25%. As a reminder, our revenues can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as system placements may vary. With regard to our Japan revenues, as previously mentioned, while we sold seven systems in Q1, we do not expect to maintain this level of quarterly system sales in Japan for the balance of 2010.
With regard to gross margin, the 73% margin we achieved in Q1 was higher than in previous quarters, due to higher ASPs on systems and manufacturing efficiencies. We expect ASPs to return to historical levels. As Gary indicated, we will continue to share productivity gains with our customers and as a result, we expect gross margins to be approximately 72% for the year.
Moving to operating expense. We are making significant investments across multiple areas of our business, particularly our sales force, manufacturing and R&D. We now expect our total GAAP operating expense to grow by 27% to 29% in 2010 compared with our previous forecast of 25% growth.
In terms of non-cash expenses, we expect to record stock compensation charges of approximately $122 million in 2010, which is a little lower than our previous forecast of $127 million. In addition, previous purchases of intellectual property are scheduled to amortize in our R&D line at approximately $15 million for the year. Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, is expected to come in between $16 million and $18 million for the year. 
With regard to income tax, as Marshall mentioned earlier, we have begun taking advantage of the international tax structure we created to report a lower tax rate this year. We recorded a 36.2% tax rate for Q1 and we expect to record the same rate for the full year. This is a significant improvement over the 41% tax rate we recorded for 2009.
For calculating earnings per share, we ended the first quarter with 39.2 million common shares outstanding and approximately 5.1 million option shares outstanding. Depending on our average stock price this year, a portion of the 5.1 million option shares will be added to the fully diluted shares calculation.
Assuming our stock price remains where it is today, we estimate that our share count for calculating EPS in Q2 will be approximately 40.6 million shares. And for calculating EPS for the year, we estimate it will be approximately 40.8 million shares.
Finally, regarding our cash flows. Since we are forecasting to report over $137 million in non-cash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operations is a better measure of our actual performance than net income. Once again, cash flows from operations in Q1 were $153 million compared with our net income of $85 million. And with that, we would like to open the call to your questions."

If you look at low rectal cancers, there is laparoscopic colorectal surgery being done all over the United States and all over the world. But when you get to the low rectal cancers, those tend to be restricted to a few centers, high-volume centers. There seems to be a lot of consistency between that anatomy obviously and the male pelvic anatomy and working in prostatectomy. The same challenges that existed in laparoscopic prostatectomy exist in laparoscopic low rectal cancers. So there are some indicators there that I think are favorable. When you move into other areas, such as, again, now moving up into general thoracic sort of non-cardiac thoracic operations, that could be a large area.

I think generally, from a sort of 5,000-foot level, when we look at some of those procedures -- if we look at where the multi-port da Vinci procedures have not been able to penetrate, they tend to be in some of the, ""simpler procedures"" within general surgery. The single port -- so anything we're able to really pick up in that area, we look at as accretive. And beyond that, it's really hard for me to go into great detail whether it be laparoscopic colorectal or some of the other high-volume, low technical challenging procedures. It's hard to say. We will wait until it comes out, until we start doing some procedures in abundance and we can start looking at the data and really determining what the value is going to be."

As we have said previously as we focus on financial metrics such as revenues, profits and cash flow during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following experiences give you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients.
One patient is Ronda of Florida. Ronda describes her experience as follows.
""Although I have had a uterine fibroid for years, I have successfully been able to avoid surgery. I had no symptoms and the fibroid was causing no problems, so I couldn't bring myself to go through my preconceived notion of a hysterectomy when it wasn't absolutely necessary. After my recent ultrasound and subsequent CT scan revealed that it was now impacting my ureter and kidney, I could know longer avoid action. 
Thankfully, my new OB/GYN, Dr. Carol MacKenzie, recommended that I contact Dr. Sam [ph] about a da Vinci robotic procedure. I was concerned that the fibroid was too big to even consider a robotic procedure, so I called to check before even making an appointment. I felt very confident that I wanted her to do the surgery but had previously scheduled a second appointment with a prominent surgeon who had performed this surgery on my friend just a few weeks earlier. 
At my consultation with him, he was adamant that the fibroid was simply too large to consider anything other than an abdominal hysterectomy. I called Dr. Sam's [ph] office to discuss it. And while she couldn't guarantee that it could be done robotically, she was 80% to 85% sure that she could do it that way. For me, those were good enough odds. And I truly believe that if anyone could do it, she was the one. 
I went home the day after my surgery and was able to get up and down the stairs without significant pain, though I moved slowly. 72 hours after my surgery, I felt well enough to go to my daughter's soccer game and accompany my husband to his holiday party later that evening. Although I was still feeling a little bloated and swollen, for the most part I felt amazing. 
For me, this experience has underscored how important it is for people to find out the latest treatments available yet how important it is for people to also realize how critical it is to select the most competent and experienced technician. After years of avoiding this surgery, it's so nice to finally have it behind me.""
The second patient is Doug, a Marketing Director at a hospital in West Virginia, who describes his experience as follows:
""I had been diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse as a child. But it had never progressed to anything remarkable until September of 2009 when I began experiencing shortness of breath, chest and back tightness and uncomfortable palpitations. After numerous tests, it was determined that my mitral valve prolapse had progressed to severe mitral regurgitation. And that I would need to either have my valve repaired or replaced. 
After considerable research, I was committed to finding a physician and a facility that could most importantly repair my mitral valves. And secondarily, repair it with robotic assistance from the da Vinci Surgical System. 
My research led me to Dr. Marc Gillinov at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, who did a fantastic job repairing both the anterior and posterior leaflets of my mitral valve, robotically. My recovery has been remarkably fast and easy. 
I feel great and there are no signs of regurgitation or a heart murmur anymore. I'm completely fixed. I can't tell you what a relief it is to know that my health problems are now solved, that my sternum didn't have to be sawed and spread apart.

In the second quarter our team executed well. We continued to expand da Vinci Surgery to a broader base of customers, which is reflected in our financial results for the quarter. In the quarter we experienced strong growth",791,"Thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter our team executed well. We continued to expand da Vinci Surgery to a broader base of customers, which is reflected in our financial results for the quarter. In the quarter we experienced strong growth in several markets. da Vinci Hysterectomy became the largest single procedure in our business this quarter. We also experienced growth in other benign gynecology procedures including da Vinci Myomectomy and da Vinci Sacral Colpopexy.
In Urology, da Vinci Surgery continues to expand and we see continuing growth in da Vinci partial Nephrectomy and da Vinci Cystectomey. da Vinci Prostatectomy is now maturing the United States and was flat relative to last quarter. We expect dVP growth to be largely driven by international markets as we go forward.
da Vinci Surgery is also being adopted in other surgical specialties. We are experiencing growth in da Vinci Transoral surgery by ENT surgeons; in general surgery, colorectal procedures are growing; and in thoracic surgery we are achieving early success in da Vinci Surgery for lung cancer. While we are not ready to declare these procedures as full-scale adoptions, their early growth is encouraging.
Now, looking at systems sales, we sold 108 da Vinci Systems in the quarter. U.S. sales grew sequentially over Q1 and we sold slightly more systems in Europe this quarter than last. That said, we continue to see fiscal pressures in Europe. Lastly, we are pleased with our systems sales performance in Asia, outside of Japan. As we have mentioned previously, we expect Japan system and revenue growth to be slow as we work through post market surveillance and reimbursement pathways.
As we move to highlights for the second quarter, recall that Q2 2009 financials include a recognition of revenue that was deferred in association with the introduction of the da Vinci Si System. In my year-over-year comparisons, I will compare financial performance excluding the deferral to give a more accurate picture of relative performance. With that as background, operating highlights for the second quarter were as follows: Procedures grew 36% over second quarter of 2009. We sold 108 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 76 during the second quarter of last year. Total revenue was $351 million, up 42% over Q2 2009. Instrument and accessory revenue increased to $128 million, up 35% over last year. Total recurring revenue grew to $183 million, up 35% from prior year and comprising 52% of total revenue.
Net income was $89 million, up 64% over the last year. We generated an operating profit of $170 million before non-cash stock option expense, up 54% from the second quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with $1,588 million in cash and investments, up $193 million from last quarter and up $686 million from second quarter 2009.
Significant cash outlays for the quarter included $20 million invested in intellectual property and fixed assets. Excluding the impact of this outlay as well as $23 million from stock proceeds and $53 million return from working capital, we generated $137 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 154% or reported GAAP net income in the second quarter.
As I mentioned on our last call, we are increasing investments in our business by building our sales force, by bringing to market new technologies that will extend our products into new procedures and bring additional patient value to existing procedures and by increasing our manufacturing capability. The investment made in sales force expansion in the first quarter is just beginning to make an impact in the field and early indications are positive. We believe that close clinical sales support of emerging and high growth procedures is an important catalyst for procedure adoption. This quarter we added an additional 119 people to our team predominantly in sales, manufacturing, and R&D, bringing our total team to 1476 employees.
In product development and research, our teams are making substantial progress in our focus areas. Our instrument development teams are progressing and developing robotic stapling and energy instruments. We are improving and expanding our imaging capabilities through investments in image acquisition and fluorescence imaging. We are developing patient side technologies that will allow for single port robotic surgery.
And finally, we are making substantial progress in bringing to market surgical networking and training technologies. Overall, we are pleased with the progress of our product development teams and our technology partners in the depth of their achievements and in the speed with which they are accomplishing them. We continue to invest in adding outstanding players to our team and expanding partnerships and in developing and acquiring those technologies that can make a difference to robotic surgery. With that, I will pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.

30239,107941314,68304,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. Prior to providing you with the details of our second quarter results, I will quickly review the deferral accounting that took place during 2009, which sets into context the proper comparables. Last year, we offered certain first quarter",1626,"Thank you, Gary. Prior to providing you with the details of our second quarter results, I will quickly review the deferral accounting that took place during 2009, which sets into context the proper comparables. Last year, we offered certain first quarter 2009 customers the opportunity to upgrade their da Vinci S System to da Vinci Si Systems at a discount to the otherwise list price for such an upgrade. We also offered those customers the opportunity to return da Vinci S accessories in exchange for da Vinci Si accessories.
As a result, we deferred a total of $20 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2009 comprised of $18 million of system revenue and $2 million of accessory revenue. We recognized of $14 million of the total $20 million deferral in our second quarter of 2009 and the remaining $6 million in the third quarter of 2009. I will now walk you through our revenue results with comparisons to second quarter of 2009 as though the deferral had not occurred.
Our second quarter 2010 revenue was $351 million, up 42% compared with $247 million for the second quarter of 2009 and up 7% compared with $329 million for the first quarter of 2010. Second quarter revenues by product categories were as follows: Second quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $128 million, up 35% compared with $94 million for the second quarter of 2009 and up 4% compared with $123 million in the first quarter of 2010. The increase compared with the prior year reflects procedure growth and higher initial stocking orders. The increase compared with the prior quarter reflects procedure growth partially offset by decreased stocking orders. The timing of stocking orders can vary from customer to customer and fewer were completed in the second quarter compared with the first quarter. The amount of instrument and accessory revenue we realized per procedure, including stocking orders was approximately $1870 per procedure, which is approximately the same as the second quarter of 2009 and approximately $100 lower than the first quarter of 2010.
Year-over-year stocking orders increased. However, they have a smaller impact on our larger installed base, resulting in little change in revenue per procedure. The decrease from the first quarter reflects lower stocking orders. We expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline slowly over time given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on our larger installed base.
Second quarter 2010 systems revenue of $168 million increased 51% compared with $111 million of systems revenue for the second quarter of 2009, and increased 8% compared with $155 million of systems revenue for the first quarter. We sold 108 systems in the second quarter of 2010 compared with 76 systems last year and 104 systems last quarter. 89 of the 108 or 82% of the systems sold in the quarter were da Vinci Si systems.
Second quarter system revenue also included $8 million of upgrade revenue compared to $2 million in the second quarter of 2009, and $5 million in the first quarter of 2010. The increase compared to prior quarters reflects increased Si upgrade revenue. Our second quarter average sales price per system including all da Vinci models, but excluding upgrades and the revenue deferral was $1.48 million, an increase from the $1.43 million realized in the second quarter of 2009 and an increase from the $1.45 million realized in the first quarter. The increase as compared to the prior periods primarily reflects an increase in the proportion of Si systems, which carry a higher ASP.
The mix of customers and products over the past two quarters has been positive, generating ASPs greater than those we expect in future periods. Service revenue increased to $55 million, up 34% compared to $41 million last year and up 9% compared with $51 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system installed base and an increase in the mix of Si’s, which carry a higher annual service fee.
Total second quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue increased to $183 million, up 35% compared with second quarter of 2009, and up 6% compared with the first quarter of 2010. Recurring revenue represents 52% of total second quarter revenue compared with 55% in the second quarter of last year and 53% last quarter. Non-U.S. revenue represented 18% of our total revenue in the quarter compared with 22% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2009 and 21% of total revenue in the first quarter of 2010.
We sold 22 systems outside the U.S. compared with 20 in the second quarter of 2009 and 24 last quarter. One of the systems sold in the second quarter and seven of the systems sold in the first quarter of 2010 were to Japanese customers. We sold three more systems in Europe this quarter compared with last quarter. However, the capital sales market in Europe continues to be challenging, reflecting macroeconomic environment. We lock in hedges on system revenue every six months. So, currency had little impact on our second quarter European revenue. However, the rates we have locked in for the remainder of 2010 are lower by approximately 15%.
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L, let me remind you that there were no costs deferred in conjunction with the first quarter of 2009 revenue deferral and therefore the $20 million deferral and subsequent reversals had an equal impact on revenue, gross profit and operating income.
Gross margin in the second quarter was 73% compared with second quarter of 2009 gross margin, excluding the impact of the deferral of 72% and compared with first quarter 2010 gross margin of 73%. The increase in gross margin compared to the prior year reflect increased system ASPs, material cost reductions and absorption of fixed cost over a larger revenue base. Compared to the prior quarter, the impact of higher ASPs was partially offset by higher manufacturing costs.
Second quarter 2010 operating expenses of $117 million were up 29% compared with second quarter of 2009 and up 6% compared with the first quarter. The quarter over quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter and increased investment in research and development. We added 119 employees during the quarter, including 81 employees in the sales and service organization as we continue to expand our clinical sales force and 35 employees in operations as we continue to invest in research and development and grow manufacturing capacity.
Second quarter 2010 operating income was $140 million, or 40% of sales compared with $86 million, or 36% of sales for the second quarter of 2009, excluding the impact of the deferral and $130 million, or 40% of sales for the first quarter of 2010.
Second quarter 2010 operating income reflected $30 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $25 million for the second quarter of 2009 and $27 million last quarter. The growth in non-cash compensation reflects our annual grant made February 15th of each year.
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 38% was lower than our 2009 tax rate of 41%, reflecting the implementation of our international tax structure. Our second quarter rate was higher than the 36% reported for the first quarter, reflecting an increase in U.S. versus non - U.S. income for the year. Our net income was $89 million, or $2.19 per share for the second quarter of 2010 compared with $54 million or $1.40 per share for the second quarter of 2009, excluding the impact of the deferral and $85 million or $2.12 per share for the first quarter of 2010.
Let me quickly summarize our results for the first six months of 2010. The comparable numbers for the first six months of 2009 exclude the impact of the first quarter 2009 deferral. Procedures grew by 36% for the first six months of 2010 compared to 2009. Total revenue for the first six months of 2010 was $679 million, up 49% compared with $455 million last year. This included recurring revenue growth of 39% and an increase in systems revenue of 63%. The increase in systems revenue clearly reflects the impact of curtailed hospital spending for capital equipment during 2009.
Operating income for the first six months of 2010 was $269 million, up 79% compared with $151 million last year. Operating income included $57 million of stock-based compensation charges in the first six months of 2010 compared with $47 million in 2009. Net income for the first six months of 2010 was $174 million or $4.31 per share compared with $94 million or $2.42 per share last year.
Now, moving to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter of 2010 with cash and investments of $1,588 million, up $193 million compared with March 31st, 2010. The increase during the current quarter reflects $137 million of cash flows from operations and $23 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $20 million of capital expenditures. $10 million of our capital expenditures relate to the construction of a new manufacturing facility next to our corporate head quarters in Sunnyvale. We anticipate that building to be completed in early 2011.
Our accounts receivable balance increased to $195 million at June 30th from $180 million at March 31st. The increase in accounts receivable reflects increased revenue and the timing of system shipments. Our net inventory increased to $74 million at June 30th from $69 million at March 31st. We increased inventory during the quarter since we believe that inventory was below optimal levels. We will likely continue to increase inventory levels in future quarters.
And with that, I would like to turn it over to Aleks who will go over our sales, marketing, and clinical highlights.

During the second quarter we sold 108 da Vinci systems, 86 in the United States, 14 in Europe, and eight in the rest of world markets. As part of the 108 system sales, 19 standard da Vinci systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si systems. We had a net 89 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 1571 the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide, 1160 in the U.S., 276 in Europe and 135 in rest of world markets. 44 of the 108 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers.
Also during the quarter, 10 customers purchased upgrades to convert their da Vinci S systems into da Vinci Si systems. Internationally, we sold four da Vinci systems into Germany and three to both Italy and France. Japan represented one new system sales.
Clinically, we had a strong quarter, most notably in gyn, more specifically benign dVH. While dVH from malignant conditions showed very good sequential growth, benign dVH growth was significantly stronger, both in actual procedure growth and in percentage growth. As of Q2, dVH has eclipsed dVP to become our single largest procedure. Other areas of robust growth for the quarter included general surgery, ENT, thoracic surgery, as well as several emerging urologic procedures. As one would expect with dVP flattening in the U.S., our urology growth rate totaled - was lower than past quarters.
As far as our overall procedure business is concerned sequential growth for Q2 was strong. Also during the quarter nearly 300 da Vinci related clinical publications and abstracts representing multiple surgical specialties appeared within various peered reviewed journals. Our recent clearance for transoral otolaryngologic surgical procedures has allowed us to extend the benefits of minimally invasive surgery to a category of patients who were being subjected to large and potentially disfiguring open operations. Within this specialty, da Vinci’s patient value equation appears to be as great and potentially greater than in any we currently target. And it has led to impressive early growth.
In a recent edition of the Archives of Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Cancer, a paper by Den and Rosenthal from the University of Alabama-Birmingham, looked at a comparison between 43 patients who underwent surgical resections for T1 and T2 oropharyngeal cancers. The patients were classified within three cohorts, robotic assisted surgery for primary neoplasms, two, robotic assisted salvage surgery for recurrent decrease, and three, open salvage surgery for recurrent decrease.
And the results: The median length of stay in the open salvage group was 8.2 days compared to five days for the robotic salvage group and 1.5 days for the robotic primary resection group. Regarding post-surgical diets, 43% of the patients who underwent open salvage procedures were gastrostomy of feeding tube dependant six months following treatment compared to zero patients in the robotic surgery groups. 7% of the patients who underwent open salvage procedures also remained tracheotomy tube dependant after six months compared with zero patients in the robotic groups.
There were no complications reported in the robotic groups. However, two patients who underwent open salvage resections developed post-operative hematomas and two developed room [ph] inflections. Reductions in both length of stay and complications have been synonymous with da Vinci procedures across all specialties and it appears that transoral surgery will follow suit.
In addition to dVH, da Vinci Myomectomy has been one our most rapidly emerging gyn procedures. Myomectomy is the removal of uterine fibroids while preserving the uterus. Fibroids are amongst the leading causes of pelvic pain in women as well as being a sufficient - or significant contributor to the need for benign hysterectomy. It’s estimated that approximately 40,000 procedures are performed in the U.S. annually and many more outside the U.S.
In the June edition of the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology, Dr. Charles J. Ascher-Walsh from Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York compared his first 75 da Vinci myomectomies to his last 50 open myomectomies, which is currently the predominant approach for surgical treatment. The variables measured included blood loss, hospital stay, time to regular diet and febrile morbidity. Febrile morbidity is defined as at least one episode of temperature rise above 38 degrees C lasting more than 24 hours.
Regarding blood loss, in the open group, patients lost an average of 459 milliliters of blood compared to 226 for the da Vinci group. Hospital stay was 3.3 days for the open group compared to 0.5 days for the da Vinci group. Time to regular diet was 2.3 days for the open group compared to 0.85 days for the da Vinci patients. And finally, 38% of the open group had febrile morbidity compared to 1% for the da Vinci group. Overall, I’d say this is a pretty impressive improvement.
During the quarter, our activities within the various society meetings were exceptionally high and included a large presence at the AUA, SAGES, World Robotic Symposium, ACOG, AATS, and the American Society of Colorectal Surgery, to name a few. At the AUA meeting alone, with over 12,000 participants over 130 robotic abstracts were presented. Six AUA postgraduate courses were offered, which included two live surgery courses, not to mention over a dozen booth presentations and several live surgery broadcasts.
The booth traffic and the number of surgeon leads were truly impressive. At the World Robotic Symposium in Orlando over 100 surgeons representing 36 countries were in attendance. The program included a dozen live surgeries and hundreds of robotic abstracts, posters and presentations. Several of the abstracts were noteworthy but I will highlight one from the Mayo Clinic, Rochester that really resonated with me. It resonated with me because the condition they studied reaches far wider than dVP, which was the topic of the paper. The paper is entitled, ‘Contemporary analysis of surgical site infection after radical prostatectomy - a comparison of open and robotic approaches. The objective of the study was to determine the incidence of surgical site infections in prostatectomy, and determine if the approach to surgery affects this rate.
5908 patients undergoing either retropubic or robotic radical prostatectomy at the Mayo Clinic between 2004 and 2008 were identified. 4824 open and 1084 robotic. The metrics were pretty straightforward. Within the open retropubic group 5.4% of the men developed a surgical site infection compared to 0.9% with the robotic group. Said another way, a patient undergoing an open prostatectomy was six times more likely to encounter a surgical site infection than a patient undergoing a dVP. A surgical site infection is a well-know complication that can have significant negative consequences both clinically for the patient and economically for the hospital. If we expand the computation across nearly 100,000 annual prostatectomy or hundreds of thousands of overall da Vinci procedures, the improved clinical, patient and economic value is significant.
That concludes my remarks and I will now turn the time over to Calvin.

30239,107941314,68304,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2010, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis.

I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2010, including procedures, revenues and other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates on significant non-cash expenses, provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows.
Starting with procedures, our second quarter and first half 2010 procedures were up approximately 36% compared to last year. We continue to expect our total 2010 procedures to grow approximately 35% for the year from the base of approximately 205,000 procedures performed in 2009.
Moving on to revenues. Based on our first half results and our view into our second half sales pipeline, we are raising our forecast for total 2010 revenue. We now anticipate 2010 full year revenue to grow between 30% and 33% compared to 27% to 30% forecasted on our previous call. As a reminder, our revenues can fluctuate quarter to quarter as system sales placements may vary.
In Europe, while procedures continued to grow, system sales in the short term may be impacted by the economic climate. System sales into Japan are likely to remain modest as we work through the reimbursement pathway.
With regards to gross margin, we reported 73% margin in both Q1 and Q2 of this year. going forward, in the second half of the year, we expect gross margins to decline from this level, driven by lower anticipated average system selling prices. We expect the ASP to decline in the second half, reflecting a lower priced product mix and lower U.S. dollar revenue recognized on euro based sales.
We recorded first half euro based sales at rates averaging about $1.43 consistent with the contractual rates under our currency hedging program. As we enter the second half of the year, we’ve reset our hedges and anticipate recording the remainder of our 2010 euro based system sales at a rate of approximately $1.22.
We also expect the manufacturing capacity growth that Marshall referred to earlier to shift our gross margin slightly lower in the second half of the year. Although second half gross margins should be a bit lower than the first, based upon our first half results, we are increasing our guidance for full year 2010 gross profit margin. We now anticipate our full year gross profit percentage to come in between 72% and 73% compared to 72% forecasted on our last call.
Moving to operating expense. We have made and we’ll continue to make significant investments across multiple areas of our business, particularly in clinical sales force and new product development projects. We added 119 employees in the second quarter and 213 so far this year compared to 75 added during the first half of last year.
We now expect our total GAAP operating expenses to grow by 29% to 31% in 2010 compared with our previous forecast of 27% to 29% growth. In terms of non-cash expenses, we expect to record stock compensation charges of approximately $120 million in 2010, which is a bit lower than our previous forecast of $122 million. our guidance for intellectual property amortization remains intact at $15 million for the year.
Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income is expected to come in around $18 million for the year, at the high end of the $16 million to $18 million range forecasted last quarter. With regard to income tax, our year-to-date tax rate now stands at 37.4% of pre-tax income. We now expect to record income taxes at approximately that 37.4% rate for the rest of 2010.
For calculating earnings per share, we ended the second quarter with 39.4 million common shares outstanding, and approximately five million option shares outstanding. Depending on our average stock price this year, a portion of the five million option shares will be added to the fully diluted shares calculation. Assuming our stock price remain where it is today, we estimate that our diluted share count for calculating EPS in Q3 will be approximately 40.7 million shares. Our estimate for the full year is 40.6 million shares.
Finally, regarding our cash flows, since we are forecasting over $135 million in non-cash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flow generated from operations is a better measure of our actual performance than net income.
And with that, we would like to open the call to your questions.

We’ve seen some pressure across the women’s health segment from some of the kind of derivative competitors. Did you see any pressure on hospital-based hysterectomy trends in the quarter; do you think that weighed on procedural trends? And then part B would be obviously a significant increase in sales reps here end of the quarter. Can you kind of talk about where they stand from a utilization or capacity perspective and I got one followup? Thank you.

If you recall, last quarter we had called out the fact that there had been some slowing in da Vinci Hysterectomy specifically the benign side and we had called out potentially three reason why that might be, either a reset on the premiums, insurance premiums for potentially high incidence of COBRA fallout and then just the activities that our sales people had in just having a full plate. Well if you looked at it this quarter it was actually a significant move in benign hysterectomy, so it was actually a very strong turnaround. So, if there were trends that we saw they were really favorable on the benign side of the business and I think that speaks also for myomectomy and even the uro and gyn procedures and sacral colpopexy. So the sales people certainly I think we feel that it’s still early, but we’d like the momentum that we are building with the additional feet on the street. So, there really wasn’t anything we can point to and say that it was really specific to that segment that would be macro in nature.

You see - just for definitions of what training is and means and so often you’ll hear different people talk about acentotes versus training the components and so on. It’s pretty hard to describe why the popular press goes one direction versus the clinical publications. That said we are focused on training. We continue to be and we have made some investments going forward that we think take advantage of some of the unique attributes of robotic surgery. Dual Council [ph] is one of them. Dual Council is being adopted well for use in training. And we’ve talked about surgical simulation as being another one. Robotic surgery has kind of a unique opportunity for a surgical simulation in that you can train exactly in the environment in which you are going to do the surgery. And so we think that will make difference. So it hasn’t been a step change for us. It’s something that we’ve understood for a while and have been making investments to continue to improve.

While we focus on financial metrics during these calls, organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following da Vinci Surgery experiences will give you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. Rosa [ph] works in healthcare delivery in Kansas and writes of her da Vinci experience. “I had a robotic hysterectomy on May 25th, 2010. It’s been three weeks since my surgery and I am back to work and feeling great. I work in surgery as a surgical technician and have scrubbed in on robotic hysterectomies, open techniques, and laparoscopic techniques over the past nine years. I can say from a medical standpoint that there is just no comparison between the open technique and the robotic technique. My mom had an open technique and was in the hospital for four days and missed eight weeks of work plus got an infection and had to go back to surgery to repair the tissue. I left the hospital the same day I had surgery. I was sore from my abdominal incisions, but never real pain. I took it easy for two weeks but after the first week I was starting to feel back to normal. I returned to work two weeks after the procedure with no heavy lifting. It’s three weeks today and I can say I feel pretty normal. My abdomen is not sore and I haven’t had any vaginal bleeding at all. I am definitely an advocate for robotic surgery as a patient and as a surgical technician.”
Our second patient is William of Colorado. He describes his experience as follows. “After accidental discovery of a 2.5 centimeter tumor on the bottom of the right kidney, I researched kidney cancer and likely next steps. My research told me I needed a surgery ASAP via open or laparoscopic technique. The six to eight week recovery for the traditional open surgery and the large incision was very concerning. The da Vinci method became my focus. But finding an experienced and skilled surgeon was a challenge. I was looking for a surgeon who was young enough to have the da Vinci training and old enough to have many successful procedures under his belt. A doctor in the area where I live had had Dr. Sriram [ph] perform the da Vinci on his kidney two years prior with a very successful outcome and recommendation for both Dr. Sriram and the da Vinci procedure. After meeting Dr. Sriram, it was obviously he met my criteria, causing the operation to be scheduled as soon as possible. I was very pleased with the outcome and was up about and walking within 24 hours, feeling good, very good after seven days and performing normal activities after four weeks. da Vinci for this type of partial kidney removal is the only way to go. 15 years ago the surgery would have been the open procedure, removing the entire right kidney. I lost only 10% of my kidney with normal kidney function today.”
Patients like these are the strongest advocates for da Vinci Surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly make a difference.
This concludes today’s call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery and we look forward to talking to you again in three months time.

In what is historically a seasonally challenging quarter, Q3 2010 provided some added macroeconomic headwinds. In the face of these challenges, our procedures showed a slight growth sequentially from Q2 and 33% growth over Q3 2009. In systems, we sold 105 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 86 systems in Q3 2009. And acceptance of our Si systems in dual consoles was strong. 
In absolute numbers, gynecology continue to show strength, adding the most procedures in the quarter with contributions from both benign and malignant conditions. While Q3 is seasonally slow in Europe, prior year comparisons showed relative strength to European procedures. Ultra procedures in gynecology and neurology also reflect positive trends. 
The merging procedures continue to expand, exhibiting strong sequential quarterly growth. da Vinci Lobectomy, da Vinci Low Anterior Resection and da Vinci Transoral Surgery are delivering strong patient value and are being adopted well. On a relative basis, the procedure counts are still fairly small. However, the early growth rates remain encouraging.
Before summarizing Q3 highlights, I'd like to remind you that third quarter 2009 included a revenue deferral associated with an upgrade offer related to the introduction of our Si system. Comparisons that follow exclude the deferral. Operating highlights for the third quarter were as follows: Procedures grew 33% over the third quarter of 2009. We sold 105 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 86 during the third quarter of last year. Total revenue was $344 million, up 26% over Q3 2009. Instrument and accessory revenue was $128 million, up 27% over last year. Total recurring revenue grew to $185 million, up 28% from prior year and comprising 54% of total revenue.
Net income was $87 million, up 43% over last year. We generated an operating profit of $163 million before non-cash stock option expense, up 32% from the third quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with $1,621,000,000 in cash and investments, up $33 million from last quarter and up $597 million from third quarter 2009.
Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $50 million invested in intellectual property, related technologies and fixed assets and $59 million in stock repurchases. Excluding the impact of these outlays as well as $17 million from stock proceeds and $2 million return from working capital, we generated $126 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 145% of our reported GAAP net income in the third quarter.
We have been making substantive investments in our clinical sales force and our new product development throughout the year. We believe that close clinical sales support of emerging and high-growth procedures is an important catalyst for achieving procedure adoption. However, reaching territory productivity for new sales hires does not happen immediately. It is a multi-month process, so that hires made earlier in the year are just coming online in the field now.  We will continue to measure the productivity of these investments, and we'll adjust our spending as needed.  
This quarter, we added an additional 92 people to our team, predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D, bringing our total team to 1,568 employees. In product development and research, our teams are driving advancements in our focus areas.
Our instrument development teams are progressing and developing robotic stapling and energy instruments, as well as various specialty-specific instruments. We are improving and expanding our imaging capabilities through investments in image acquisition technologies and fluorescence imaging. We are developing patient-side technologies that allow for single port robotic surgery. And finally, we are making substantial progress in bringing to market surgical simulation and networking. 
Lastly, we have seen a shift in the approach to new product approvals by the FDA. These changes appear to be extending time lines from past norms, and we cannot predict with certainty when a new product will receive approval. We are confident in the utility and the quality of our new products going through the approval process and are focusing our inventory teams on clean execution to meet the needs of FDA. We will announce the availability of new products as they are ready to ship. 
In summary, developing and expanding procedures with strong patient value and outstanding organizational execution remain our focus with particular emphasis and execution in our clinical sales force and in our product development and regulatory teams. I will now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer."

Last year, we offered certain first quarter 2009 customers with the opportunity to upgrade their da Vinci S Systems to da Vinci Si Systems at a discount to the otherwise list price for such an upgrade. We also offered those customers the opportunity to return da Vinci S accessory in exchange for da Vinci Si accessory. As a result, we deferred a total of $20 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2009, comprised of $18 million of system revenue associated with system upgrade offers in $2 million of accessory revenue. We recognized $14 million of the $20 million deferral in our second quarter of 2009 and the remaining $6 million in the third quarter of 2009. 
I will now walk you through our revenue results with comparisons to the third quarter of 2009, as though the deferral had not occurred. Our third quarter 2010 revenue was $344 million, up 26% compared with $274 million for the third quarter of 2009 and down 2% compared with $351 million for the second quarter of 2010. 
Third quarter revenues by product category were as follows: Third quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $128 million, up 27% compared with $100 million for the third quarter of 2009 and approximately equal to the $128 million in the second quarter of 2010. The timing of customer stocking orders varies from customer to customer and are regularly placed after the da Vinci robot is shipped or installed. Fewer stocking orders were completed and a higher carryover stocking orders existed in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. 
Excluding stocking orders, growth in instrument and accessory revenue was slightly lower than the procedure growth as we would expect. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,840 per procedure, which is lower than the third quarter of 2009 by approximately $80 and approximately $30 lower than the second quarter of 2010.  The changes in instrument and accessory revenue per procedure primarily reflect changes in the impact of stocking orders. We expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline slowly over time, given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger install base. 
Third quarter 2010 systems revenue of $160 million increased 23% compared with $130 million of systems revenue for the third quarter of 2009 and decreased 5% compared with $168 million of systems revenue for the second quarter. We sold 105 systems in the third quarter of 2010 compared with 86 systems last year and 108 systems last quarter. 
Our third quarter average sales price per system including all da Vinci models, but excluding upgrades and the deferral revenue, was $1.43 million, an increase from the $1.39 million realized in the third quarter of 2009 and a decrease from the $1.48 million realized in the second quarter. The increase compared to the prior year reflects an increase in the proportion of Si and Si Dual Console system, which carry a higher ASP. 
The decrease in average sales price per system compared with the prior quarter is primarily the result of the mix of customers and the reduction in the value of our euro-to-dollar hedging position. As we indicated last quarter, the mix of systems and customers, and therefore, ASPs, in the first and second quarters of this year had been more favorable than we normally expect. We locked in hedges for most of our forecasted direct European system sales every six months. The rates locked in for July to December are lower than the rates recognized in the first six months of 2010 by approximately 15%. 
Third quarter systems revenue also included $10 million of upgrade revenue compared to $10 million in the third quarter of 2009 and $8 million in the second quarter of 2010. Service revenue increased to $57 million, up 31% compared with $44 million last year and up 3% compared with $55 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system install base and an increase in the mix of Sis, which carry a higher annual service fee. 
Total third quarter recurring revenue, comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $185 million, up 28% compared with the third quarter of 2009 and up 1% compared with the second quarter of 2010. Recurring revenue represented 54% of total third quarter revenue compared with 53% in the third quarter last year and 52% last quarter. 
Revenue by geography was as follows: Non-U.S. revenue represented 17% of our total revenue in the quarter compared with 19% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2009 and 18% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2010. The decline in the proportion of non-U.S. revenue relative to total revenue reflects the growth in U.S. business. Non-U.S. procedures grew faster at a faster pace than U.S. procedures on a year-to-year basis, although Q3 did reflect seasonality and a sequential decline. 
We sold 22 systems outside the U.S. compared with 14 in the third quarter of 2009 and 22 last quarter. Four of the systems sold in the third quarter and one of the systems sold in the second quarter of 2010 were to Japanese customers. We sold 16 systems in Europe this quarter or two more than the past quarter and eight more than last year. However, the capital sales market in Europe continues to be challenging, reflecting the macroeconomic environment. 
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Let me remind you that there were no costs deferred in the conjunction with the first quarter of 2009 revenue deferral, and therefore, the $20 million deferral and subsequent reversals had an equal impact on the revenue, gross profit and operating income.
Gross margin in the third quarter was 73% compared with third quarter 2009 gross margin, excluding the impacts of the deferral of 70% and compared with second quarter 2010 gross margin of 73%. The increase in gross margin compared to the prior year reflects increased system ASPs, material costs reductions and absorption of fixed costs over a larger revenue base. Compared to the prior quarter, lower manufacturing costs were offset by lower system ASPs.
Third quarter 2010 operating expenses of $119 million were up 25% compared with the third quarter of 2009 and up 1% compared with the second quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter, partially offset by a decrease in our R&D spending. The decrease in R&D spending reflects lower prototype costs due to the lumpy nature of prototype purchasing, which will likely be incurred in the fourth quarter. We added 92 employees in the quarter, including 77 employees in the sales and service organization as we continue to expand our clinical sales force, and 10 employees in operations.
Third quarter 2010 operating income was $132 million or 38% of sales, compared with $98 million or 36% of sales for the third quarter of 2009 excluding the impact of the deferral, and $140 million or 40% of sales for the second quarter of 2010.  Third quarter 2010 operating income reflected $30 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $25 million for the third quarter of 2009 and $30 million last quarter. The growth in non-cash compensation reflects our annual grant made February 15 of each year and the increase in the number of employees.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 37% was lower than our 2009 rate of 41%, reflecting the implementation of our international tax structure. Our third quarter rate was lower than the rate for the second quarter of 39%. 
Our net income was $87 million or $2.14 per share compared with $61 million or $1.55 per share for the third quarter of 2009 excluding the impact of the deferral, and $89 million or $2.19 per share for the second quarter of 2010.
Let me quickly summarize our results for the first nine months of 2010. The first quarter of 2009 deferral did not have an impact on the nine months of 2009 information. Procedures grew by 35% for the first nine months of 2010. Total revenue for the first nine months of 2010 was $1,024,000,000, up 40% compared with $729 million last year. This included recurring revenue growth of 35% and an increase in systems revenue of 47%. 
Operating income for the first nine months of 2010 was $402 million, up 61% compared with $249 million last year. Operating income included $88 million of stock-based compensation charges in the first nine months of 2010 compared with $72 million in 2009. Net income for the first nine months of 2010 was $261 million or $6.45 per share compared with $155 million or $3.97 per share last year.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter of 2010 with cash and investments of $1,621,000,000, up $33 million compared with June 30, 2010. The increase during the quarter reflects $126 million of cash flows from operation and $17 million from the exercise of stock option, partially offset by $59 million of stock buybacks and $50 million of capital and IT purchases. In July, our board authorized $150 million to buy back shares. Considering the previous authorization and buyback activity, we currently have $241 million authorized to buy back shares. 
Our accounts receivable balance increased to $208 million at September 30 from $195 million at June 30, reflecting the timing of revenue. Our net inventory increased to $85 million at September 30 from $74 million at June 30. The increase reflects safety stock to ensure adequate supply of certain components and inventory associated with yet-to-be-released products.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

During the third quarter, we sold 105 da Vinci systems, 83 in the United States, 16 in Europe and six in the rest of world markets. As part of the 105 system sales, 15 standard da Vinci systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 90 system additions to the install base during the quarter, which brings to 1,661 the cumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide, 1,228 in the U.S., 292 in Europe and 141 in rest of world markets. 45 of the 105 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers.
Also during the quarter, 10 customers purchased upgrades to convert their da Vinci S Systems into da Vinci Si Systems. Internationally, we sold five da Vinci Systems in Spain, four into the countries of Germany and Japan and three into France. 
Clinically, we had a solid quarter with GYN, and more specifically, benign dVH contributing the greatest absolute growth. While dVH from malignant conditions showed very good sequential growth, benign dVH growth was stronger, both in natural procedure growth and in percentage growth. Additional categories of growth included ENT, colorectal and thoracic surgery. As one would expect with dVP flattening in the U.S. and seasonality in o U.S. markets, our urology growth was tempered.
On a year-over-year comparison, overall third quarter procedures grew by approximately 33%. Also during the quarter, over 250 da Vinci related clinical publications and abstracts representing multiple surgical specialties appeared within the various peer-reviewed journals. dVH for benign conditions has become a significant driver of our overall business. 
And within this target, comparisons between dVH and traditional LAVH and Lap Supracervical Hysterectomies or LSH, are beginning to emerge. For background, in LSH is a less complete resection than a total hysterectomy, but an appropriate option for some patients. In LSH, the cervix is left in place and only the uterus is extracted. In some ways, it can be thought of as a partial hysterectomy. 
Our recent study comparing the three techniques was published in the Journal of Robotic Surgery. The study was entitled, Comparison of Minimally Invasive Surgical Approaches for Hysterectomy at a Community Hospital, and emanated out of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Spartanburg Regional Medical Center in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The study included patient cohorts comprised of the first 237 patients undergoing a dVH, the last 265 patients undergoing an LAVH and 87 patients undergoing an LSH. Among the dVH patients were cases of greater complexity that included a higher prevalence of prior abdominal pelvic surgery than found among the LAVH patients, as well as an increased number of procedures for endometriosis and pelvic reconstruction. And finally, patients which had greater uterine weights, greater by an average of 35%. 
Despite added case complexity, operative time was significantly lower in dVH than LAVH, 90 minutes compared to 125 minutes, and similar to that of LSH. Blood loss was also last in the dVH patients as compared to LAVH, 59 milliliters compared to 168 milliliters, and similar to LSH. And hospitalization was shorter for dVH than LAVH and LSH, 1.0 days compared to 1.2 days for the others. 
In their summary, the authors stated the following, and I quote: ""Our analysis of the learning curve suggests that operative time for robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy may continue to improve beyond the initial patient series, despite the increased complexity of cases undergoing this procedure. The results of this study lends support to the small but growing body literature describing the benefits of robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy over conventional laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy.""
With dVP growth in the United States flattening, we look to Europe and other o U.S. markets as fertile growth opportunities. In addition, clinical data comparing long-term outcomes in patients undergoing prostatectomy versus alternative treatments for organ confined disease is demonstrating the advantages of prostatectomy in long-term survival.
In a recent publication of the journal, Cancer, surgeons and researchers from the University of California at San Francisco and Memorial Sloan-Kettering, working for the nation's largest prostate cancer registry, CaPSURE, compared cancer-specific mortality outcomes among men who underwent radical prostatectomy, men who received external beam radiation therapy and men who received primarily androgen deprivation therapy. In the current study, 7,538 men with localized disease were analyzed. Prostate cancer risk was assessed using two well-validated instruments that were calculated from clinical data at the time of diagnosis. Then a parametric survival model was constructed to compare outcomes across treatments, adjusting for risks and age. 
The results: in total, 266 men died of prostate cancer during the follow-up. Adjusting for risk and age, the hazard ratio for cancer-specific mortality relative to prostatectomy was 2.21 for radiation therapy and 3.22 for androgen deprivation. Said another way, the analysis reports that the risk of a man dying from prostate cancer after primary radiation therapy was more than twice as great when compared to radical prostatectomy. And mortality risk for primary androgen deprivation therapy was reported to be 3x as great. 
The authors concluded their report by stating, and I quote, ""Prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer was associated with a significant and substantial reduction in mortality, relative to radiation therapy and androgen deprivation monotherapy. Although this is not a randomized study, given the multiple adjustments and sensitivity analysis, it is unlikely that the unmeasured confounding would account for the large observed differences in survival.""
The successful adoption of any new procedure or technology is directly tied to the efficacy of the training pathway. We've done a pretty good job thus far in assisting our customer base with their initial da Vinci training experience. When you consider the scale associated with training surgeons across multiple surgical specialties on a global basis, you'll quickly see that it's a significant endeavor. It has been our belief that in time, initial da Vinci procedure experience will find its way into the formal processes of academic medicine through residency and fellowship programs. 
As several da Vinci procedures have gone mainstream, we have begun to see this transition take place. Researchers from the University of Alabama, Birmingham, set out to define this developing trend within the GYN oncology fellowship programs around the country. 
UAB conducted a survey of GYN oncology follows and fellowship directors and summarized their findings in last month's edition of the International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery. The survey was designed to determine the prevalence, application and acceptance of robotics into 41 approved U.S. programs. Approximately half of the fellowship selectors responded to the survey with the following results. 95% of the respondents have a robotics system at their institution, and 94% have two or more gynecologic oncology faculty members who perform robotic surgery. 78% of the responding institutions do more than five robotic procedures per month, and 22% reported that they performed more than 12 procedures per month. 
All the responding institutions have utilized the robotic system in the management of endometrial cancer, and all respondents reported using the system from lymph node dissections. 89% reported utilization in treating cervical cancer and 83% reported robotic usage in benign hysterectomy. Furthermore, 89% of the fellows responding to the survey have been involved in cases that utilize robotic systems, and 77% have worked from the da Vinci System console. 
Although it's the first time we've seen an analysis of this form published in a peer-reviewed journal, we are aware of parallel activity taking place within the American Urology Association and the Association of Advanced Gynecological Laparoscopy, as well as in various international medical societies. The introduction of da Vinci surgery into residency and fellowship training speaks well to our product adoption thus far. But more importantly, it speaks volumes as to what we can expect with future robotics training. 
That concludes my summary, and I'll now turn the time over to Calvin."
30239,113574596,80246,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2010 including procedures, revenues and the other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates on significant non-cash expenses to provide you",601,"Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2010 including procedures, revenues and the other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates on significant non-cash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows.
Starting with procedures. We continue to project our 2010 procedures to grow approximately 35% for the year from the base of approximately 205,000 procedures performed in 2009. Moving on to revenues. Based on our results through three quarters and our view into our fourth quarter sales pipeline, we continue to expect revenue results to grow within the 30% to 33% range forecast last quarter.
Regarding the instrument and accessory portion of revenue, we would expect full year revenue growth in this category to come in slightly below the 35% forecasted procedure growth due to the diminishing impact of stocking orders on instrument and accessory revenue per procedure. As a reminder, our revenues can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as the timing of placements, system placement and instrument and accessory stocking orders may vary.
With regard to gross margin, we reported a 73.2% margin in both Q1 and Q2 of this year and a slightly lower rate of 72.8% in Q3, primarily reflecting the impact of lower Q3 system ASPs. Going forward, we expect our Q4 margins to be near our Q3 level, resulting in a full year 2010 gross margin percentage near the higher end of the 72% to 73% range projected on our last call.
Moving to operating expense. We have made and will continue to make significant investments across multiple areas of our business, particularly in our clinical sales force. We added 92 employees during the third quarter and 305 so far this year compared to 139 added through three quarters last year. 
While we continue to invest in our business, the timing of some of our expenses can be lumpy. We now expect our total GAAP operating expense to grow by 27% to 29% in 2010, compared with our previous forecast of 29% to 31% growth. In terms of non-cash expenses, we continue to expect to record stock compensation charges of approximately $120 million in 2010. Our guidance for intellectual property amortization is now $17 million compared to $15 million last quarter. This increase reflects additional amortization related to our Q3 IP investments.
Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, is expected to come in around $18.5 million for the year, just above the $18 million forecasted last quarter. With regard to income tax, our year-to-date tax rate now stands at 37.2% of pretax income. We now expect to record income taxes at approximately that 37.2% rate for the rest of 2010.
For calculating earnings per share, we ended the third quarter with 39.3 million common shares outstanding and approximately 4.9 million option shares outstanding. Depending on our average stock price in Q4, a portion of the 4.9 million option shares will be added to the fully diluted shares calculation. At present, we estimated that our diluted share count for calculating EPS in Q4 will be approximately 40.3 million shares. Our estimate for the full year is 40.4 million shares.
Finally, regarding our cash flows, since we are forecasting to report over $135 million in non-cash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operations is a better measure of our actual performance than net income. And with that, we would like to open the call to your questions."

The way we've been tracking the hysterectomy growth leaves us to believe that we're making good penetration into the complex and probably picking up some of the less complex along the way. But when we look at where we are in our growth trajectories and what the opportunity is, we are in a pretty steep part of our growth curve. So is it sustainable? In our view, absolutely, in the procedures that we're targeting. And I don't think there was anything from, let's say, a favorable tail wind through Q3 between seasonality and high unemployment rates that gave us any stimulus for the quarter.

We do have a secondary force of gynecology to reinforce for the gynecology procedures in certain regions of the country. So it's not so much of redeployment. We do think that the reps are most effective. They have their greatest leverage when procedures are at lower part of the curve, where they're helping surgeons and they're helping hospitals build their programs around new and emerging procedure, so that the percentage of their time they spend is probably highlighted on the emerging procedures versus the more mature ones. Having said that, we have full procedures in urology that are growing, [indiscernible]. And even a mature procedure requires some attention from the reps. So kind of what the ideal mix of the reps' time depends a lot on what their local area looks like in terms of procedure mix."

I think there's actually some connectivity within part A of your question and part B. And it's really the following in that, and we've said this over and over, and it just becomes even more apparent every quarter, that it's really a country-by-country market dynamic that's taking place within the EU and other markets in other parts of Asia. An example of that is we know what the macroeconomic headwinds were in the PIIGS countries over the last few quarters. But we sold five systems into Spain, because there's a number of underlying variables that really drive those sales. And that is, what the demand is for the procedures, what is the install base within that particular country and what are the underlying economic conditions? And if you kind of go through that on a case-by-case basis or a country-by-country basis, you're just going to find different parts of those ingredients that will drive the success in any given quarter or not. So I would say as a general statement as far as Europe is concerned, it still remains less predictable and probably more challenging that we have seen in some years past. And how that projects on a go-forward basis is really not something we're going to really try to assess in terms of being macroeconomists here. In terms of the o U.S. procedure growth, again, you're seeing the same variables unfold on a country-by-country basis. In some countries, it is absolutely on a very steep part of the curve. While in others, it's on an earlier part, less steep. It is not going to be as predictable or [indiscernible], if you will, of the U.S. market. And we'll try to color it up as best as we can.

And in that bucket, there are always a set of instruments and accessories that as you look out and think about how to make new procedures happen on systems, instruments and accessories come in. It's a given. The next step is really imaging visualization. What can you provide to the surgeon to have a better understanding of what's happening in the tissues?

I don't know that I'd say that we had an expectation prior, but the general comment is that we're seeing, as a whole, a greater number of questions and kind of a slower turnaround time. And that point of view has been shared around the industry. So thank you, that was our last question? 
While we focus on financial metrics during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following da Vinci surgery experience gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. 
Stephanie from California writes, ""I silently suffered from excessive menstrual bleeding and cramping for years, which seemed only to get worse as each month passed. At one of my quarterly repeat Paps, I finally decided to speak up to the nurse practitioner in Dr. Swanson's office, because I felt my periods were ruining my life and I couldn't handle it anymore. I have two teenagers and two toddlers and couldn't be limited to the bathroom for days out of the month. The nurse practitioner gave me some literature to read about my different options and suggested that I make an appointment with Dr. Swanson, who has been my doctor for over 13 years to discuss my concerns. I read a little bit and did much research on my own. And then I saw Dr. Swanson three weeks later and described my issues. He basically said my options were to do nothing, which have been working out well for me, hormone pills, ovulation or hysterectomy. I have been on several different birth-control pills and they all made me nauseated. 
Dr. Swanson informed me that I would need a pretty strong dose, so that was not an option for me either. As for ovulation, I have read many complains about women that had had the procedure and stated that the cramping was now worse. I already have bad cramps and spotting, so I didn't want to risk that. Dr. Swanson agreed that it was a possibility that cramping could worsen and suggested that I was a perfect candidate for hysterectomy. Not only would it relieve me of my excessive bleeding and cramps, it will also free me from my abnormal Paps every three months. Dr. Swanson explained the procedure to me and thoroughly answered all my questions. Finally, I felt some resolution was coming. 
In the weeks prior to my scheduled surgery, I did much research online and actually found many videos for hysterectomies done by da Vinci robot on YouTube. I felt very prepared when my surgery day rolled around. And on August 3, 2010, at St. Agnes Medical Center in Fresno, Dr. Swanson and the staff were fantastic. Everyone made me feel relaxed and cared for. 
The surgery went very well. I had very little blood loss. I was able to get up and walk around to the bathroom and around the hospital room within hours after the surgery. My pain was minimal and really no more than some discomfort rather than real pain. I stayed only one night in the hospital and was discharged the next morning. My recovery at home was very quick. I was back to my normal self within the same week as my surgery. No pain, no cramps, no bleeding. My only regret is not speaking to my doctor and having the da Vinci hysterectomy done sooner."" 
Patients like Stephanie are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand. And I assure you that we remain committed to driving the few things that really makes a difference. 
This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking with you again in three months."

In what is historically a seasonally challenging quarter, Q3 2010 provided some added macroeconomic headwinds. In the face of these challenges, our procedures showed a slight growth sequentially from Q2 and 33% growth over Q3 2009. In systems, we sold 105 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 86 systems in Q3 2009. And acceptance of our Si systems in dual consoles was strong. 
In absolute numbers, gynecology continue to show strength, adding the most procedures in the quarter with contributions from both benign and malignant conditions. While Q3 is seasonally slow in Europe, prior year comparisons showed relative strength to European procedures. Ultra procedures in gynecology and neurology also reflect positive trends. 
The merging procedures continue to expand, exhibiting strong sequential quarterly growth. da Vinci Lobectomy, da Vinci Low Anterior Resection and da Vinci Transoral Surgery are delivering strong patient value and are being adopted well. On a relative basis, the procedure counts are still fairly small. However, the early growth rates remain encouraging.
Before summarizing Q3 highlights, I'd like to remind you that third quarter 2009 included a revenue deferral associated with an upgrade offer related to the introduction of our Si system. Comparisons that follow exclude the deferral. Operating highlights for the third quarter were as follows: Procedures grew 33% over the third quarter of 2009. We sold 105 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 86 during the third quarter of last year. Total revenue was $344 million, up 26% over Q3 2009. Instrument and accessory revenue was $128 million, up 27% over last year. Total recurring revenue grew to $185 million, up 28% from prior year and comprising 54% of total revenue.
Net income was $87 million, up 43% over last year. We generated an operating profit of $163 million before non-cash stock option expense, up 32% from the third quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with $1,621,000,000 in cash and investments, up $33 million from last quarter and up $597 million from third quarter 2009.
Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $50 million invested in intellectual property, related technologies and fixed assets and $59 million in stock repurchases. Excluding the impact of these outlays as well as $17 million from stock proceeds and $2 million return from working capital, we generated $126 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 145% of our reported GAAP net income in the third quarter.
We have been making substantive investments in our clinical sales force and our new product development throughout the year. We believe that close clinical sales support of emerging and high-growth procedures is an important catalyst for achieving procedure adoption. However, reaching territory productivity for new sales hires does not happen immediately. It is a multi-month process, so that hires made earlier in the year are just coming online in the field now.  We will continue to measure the productivity of these investments, and we'll adjust our spending as needed.  
This quarter, we added an additional 92 people to our team, predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D, bringing our total team to 1,568 employees. In product development and research, our teams are driving advancements in our focus areas.
Our instrument development teams are progressing and developing robotic stapling and energy instruments, as well as various specialty-specific instruments. We are improving and expanding our imaging capabilities through investments in image acquisition technologies and fluorescence imaging. We are developing patient-side technologies that allow for single port robotic surgery. And finally, we are making substantial progress in bringing to market surgical simulation and networking. 
Lastly, we have seen a shift in the approach to new product approvals by the FDA. These changes appear to be extending time lines from past norms, and we cannot predict with certainty when a new product will receive approval. We are confident in the utility and the quality of our new products going through the approval process and are focusing our inventory teams on clean execution to meet the needs of FDA. We will announce the availability of new products as they are ready to ship. 
In summary, developing and expanding procedures with strong patient value and outstanding organizational execution remain our focus with particular emphasis and execution in our clinical sales force and in our product development and regulatory teams. I will now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer."
30239,113574596,80250,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. Prior to providing you with the details of our third quarter results, I would like to provide you with a quick review of the deferral accounting that took place during 2009, which sets into context the proper comparables. Last year, we of",1664,"Thank you, Gary. Prior to providing you with the details of our third quarter results, I would like to provide you with a quick review of the deferral accounting that took place during 2009, which sets into context the proper comparables. Last year, we offered certain first quarter 2009 customers with the opportunity to upgrade their da Vinci S Systems to da Vinci Si Systems at a discount to the otherwise list price for such an upgrade. We also offered those customers the opportunity to return da Vinci S accessory in exchange for da Vinci Si accessory. As a result, we deferred a total of $20 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2009, comprised of $18 million of system revenue associated with system upgrade offers in $2 million of accessory revenue. We recognized $14 million of the $20 million deferral in our second quarter of 2009 and the remaining $6 million in the third quarter of 2009. 
I will now walk you through our revenue results with comparisons to the third quarter of 2009, as though the deferral had not occurred. Our third quarter 2010 revenue was $344 million, up 26% compared with $274 million for the third quarter of 2009 and down 2% compared with $351 million for the second quarter of 2010. 
Third quarter revenues by product category were as follows: Third quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $128 million, up 27% compared with $100 million for the third quarter of 2009 and approximately equal to the $128 million in the second quarter of 2010. The timing of customer stocking orders varies from customer to customer and are regularly placed after the da Vinci robot is shipped or installed. Fewer stocking orders were completed and a higher carryover stocking orders existed in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. 
Excluding stocking orders, growth in instrument and accessory revenue was slightly lower than the procedure growth as we would expect. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,840 per procedure, which is lower than the third quarter of 2009 by approximately $80 and approximately $30 lower than the second quarter of 2010.  The changes in instrument and accessory revenue per procedure primarily reflect changes in the impact of stocking orders. We expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline slowly over time, given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger install base. 
Third quarter 2010 systems revenue of $160 million increased 23% compared with $130 million of systems revenue for the third quarter of 2009 and decreased 5% compared with $168 million of systems revenue for the second quarter. We sold 105 systems in the third quarter of 2010 compared with 86 systems last year and 108 systems last quarter. 
Our third quarter average sales price per system including all da Vinci models, but excluding upgrades and the deferral revenue, was $1.43 million, an increase from the $1.39 million realized in the third quarter of 2009 and a decrease from the $1.48 million realized in the second quarter. The increase compared to the prior year reflects an increase in the proportion of Si and Si Dual Console system, which carry a higher ASP. 
The decrease in average sales price per system compared with the prior quarter is primarily the result of the mix of customers and the reduction in the value of our euro-to-dollar hedging position. As we indicated last quarter, the mix of systems and customers, and therefore, ASPs, in the first and second quarters of this year had been more favorable than we normally expect. We locked in hedges for most of our forecasted direct European system sales every six months. The rates locked in for July to December are lower than the rates recognized in the first six months of 2010 by approximately 15%. 
Third quarter systems revenue also included $10 million of upgrade revenue compared to $10 million in the third quarter of 2009 and $8 million in the second quarter of 2010. Service revenue increased to $57 million, up 31% compared with $44 million last year and up 3% compared with $55 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system install base and an increase in the mix of Sis, which carry a higher annual service fee. 
Total third quarter recurring revenue, comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $185 million, up 28% compared with the third quarter of 2009 and up 1% compared with the second quarter of 2010. Recurring revenue represented 54% of total third quarter revenue compared with 53% in the third quarter last year and 52% last quarter. 
Revenue by geography was as follows: Non-U.S. revenue represented 17% of our total revenue in the quarter compared with 19% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2009 and 18% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2010. The decline in the proportion of non-U.S. revenue relative to total revenue reflects the growth in U.S. business. Non-U.S. procedures grew faster at a faster pace than U.S. procedures on a year-to-year basis, although Q3 did reflect seasonality and a sequential decline. 
We sold 22 systems outside the U.S. compared with 14 in the third quarter of 2009 and 22 last quarter. Four of the systems sold in the third quarter and one of the systems sold in the second quarter of 2010 were to Japanese customers. We sold 16 systems in Europe this quarter or two more than the past quarter and eight more than last year. However, the capital sales market in Europe continues to be challenging, reflecting the macroeconomic environment. 
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Let me remind you that there were no costs deferred in the conjunction with the first quarter of 2009 revenue deferral, and therefore, the $20 million deferral and subsequent reversals had an equal impact on the revenue, gross profit and operating income.
Gross margin in the third quarter was 73% compared with third quarter 2009 gross margin, excluding the impacts of the deferral of 70% and compared with second quarter 2010 gross margin of 73%. The increase in gross margin compared to the prior year reflects increased system ASPs, material costs reductions and absorption of fixed costs over a larger revenue base. Compared to the prior quarter, lower manufacturing costs were offset by lower system ASPs.
Third quarter 2010 operating expenses of $119 million were up 25% compared with the third quarter of 2009 and up 1% compared with the second quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter, partially offset by a decrease in our R&D spending. The decrease in R&D spending reflects lower prototype costs due to the lumpy nature of prototype purchasing, which will likely be incurred in the fourth quarter. We added 92 employees in the quarter, including 77 employees in the sales and service organization as we continue to expand our clinical sales force, and 10 employees in operations.
Third quarter 2010 operating income was $132 million or 38% of sales, compared with $98 million or 36% of sales for the third quarter of 2009 excluding the impact of the deferral, and $140 million or 40% of sales for the second quarter of 2010.  Third quarter 2010 operating income reflected $30 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $25 million for the third quarter of 2009 and $30 million last quarter. The growth in non-cash compensation reflects our annual grant made February 15 of each year and the increase in the number of employees.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 37% was lower than our 2009 rate of 41%, reflecting the implementation of our international tax structure. Our third quarter rate was lower than the rate for the second quarter of 39%. 
Our net income was $87 million or $2.14 per share compared with $61 million or $1.55 per share for the third quarter of 2009 excluding the impact of the deferral, and $89 million or $2.19 per share for the second quarter of 2010.
Let me quickly summarize our results for the first nine months of 2010. The first quarter of 2009 deferral did not have an impact on the nine months of 2009 information. Procedures grew by 35% for the first nine months of 2010. Total revenue for the first nine months of 2010 was $1,024,000,000, up 40% compared with $729 million last year. This included recurring revenue growth of 35% and an increase in systems revenue of 47%. 
Operating income for the first nine months of 2010 was $402 million, up 61% compared with $249 million last year. Operating income included $88 million of stock-based compensation charges in the first nine months of 2010 compared with $72 million in 2009. Net income for the first nine months of 2010 was $261 million or $6.45 per share compared with $155 million or $3.97 per share last year.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter of 2010 with cash and investments of $1,621,000,000, up $33 million compared with June 30, 2010. The increase during the quarter reflects $126 million of cash flows from operation and $17 million from the exercise of stock option, partially offset by $59 million of stock buybacks and $50 million of capital and IT purchases. In July, our board authorized $150 million to buy back shares. Considering the previous authorization and buyback activity, we currently have $241 million authorized to buy back shares. 
Our accounts receivable balance increased to $208 million at September 30 from $195 million at June 30, reflecting the timing of revenue. Our net inventory increased to $85 million at September 30 from $74 million at June 30. The increase reflects safety stock to ensure adequate supply of certain components and inventory associated with yet-to-be-released products.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

During the third quarter, we sold 105 da Vinci systems, 83 in the United States, 16 in Europe and six in the rest of world markets. As part of the 105 system sales, 15 standard da Vinci systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 90 system additions to the install base during the quarter, which brings to 1,661 the cumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide, 1,228 in the U.S., 292 in Europe and 141 in rest of world markets. 45 of the 105 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers.
Also during the quarter, 10 customers purchased upgrades to convert their da Vinci S Systems into da Vinci Si Systems. Internationally, we sold five da Vinci Systems in Spain, four into the countries of Germany and Japan and three into France. 
Clinically, we had a solid quarter with GYN, and more specifically, benign dVH contributing the greatest absolute growth. While dVH from malignant conditions showed very good sequential growth, benign dVH growth was stronger, both in natural procedure growth and in percentage growth. Additional categories of growth included ENT, colorectal and thoracic surgery. As one would expect with dVP flattening in the U.S. and seasonality in o U.S. markets, our urology growth was tempered.
On a year-over-year comparison, overall third quarter procedures grew by approximately 33%. Also during the quarter, over 250 da Vinci related clinical publications and abstracts representing multiple surgical specialties appeared within the various peer-reviewed journals. dVH for benign conditions has become a significant driver of our overall business. 
And within this target, comparisons between dVH and traditional LAVH and Lap Supracervical Hysterectomies or LSH, are beginning to emerge. For background, in LSH is a less complete resection than a total hysterectomy, but an appropriate option for some patients. In LSH, the cervix is left in place and only the uterus is extracted. In some ways, it can be thought of as a partial hysterectomy. 
Our recent study comparing the three techniques was published in the Journal of Robotic Surgery. The study was entitled, Comparison of Minimally Invasive Surgical Approaches for Hysterectomy at a Community Hospital, and emanated out of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Spartanburg Regional Medical Center in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The study included patient cohorts comprised of the first 237 patients undergoing a dVH, the last 265 patients undergoing an LAVH and 87 patients undergoing an LSH. Among the dVH patients were cases of greater complexity that included a higher prevalence of prior abdominal pelvic surgery than found among the LAVH patients, as well as an increased number of procedures for endometriosis and pelvic reconstruction. And finally, patients which had greater uterine weights, greater by an average of 35%. 
Despite added case complexity, operative time was significantly lower in dVH than LAVH, 90 minutes compared to 125 minutes, and similar to that of LSH. Blood loss was also last in the dVH patients as compared to LAVH, 59 milliliters compared to 168 milliliters, and similar to LSH. And hospitalization was shorter for dVH than LAVH and LSH, 1.0 days compared to 1.2 days for the others. 
In their summary, the authors stated the following, and I quote: ""Our analysis of the learning curve suggests that operative time for robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy may continue to improve beyond the initial patient series, despite the increased complexity of cases undergoing this procedure. The results of this study lends support to the small but growing body literature describing the benefits of robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy over conventional laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy.""
With dVP growth in the United States flattening, we look to Europe and other o U.S. markets as fertile growth opportunities. In addition, clinical data comparing long-term outcomes in patients undergoing prostatectomy versus alternative treatments for organ confined disease is demonstrating the advantages of prostatectomy in long-term survival.
In a recent publication of the journal, Cancer, surgeons and researchers from the University of California at San Francisco and Memorial Sloan-Kettering, working for the nation's largest prostate cancer registry, CaPSURE, compared cancer-specific mortality outcomes among men who underwent radical prostatectomy, men who received external beam radiation therapy and men who received primarily androgen deprivation therapy. In the current study, 7,538 men with localized disease were analyzed. Prostate cancer risk was assessed using two well-validated instruments that were calculated from clinical data at the time of diagnosis. Then a parametric survival model was constructed to compare outcomes across treatments, adjusting for risks and age. 
The results: in total, 266 men died of prostate cancer during the follow-up. Adjusting for risk and age, the hazard ratio for cancer-specific mortality relative to prostatectomy was 2.21 for radiation therapy and 3.22 for androgen deprivation. Said another way, the analysis reports that the risk of a man dying from prostate cancer after primary radiation therapy was more than twice as great when compared to radical prostatectomy. And mortality risk for primary androgen deprivation therapy was reported to be 3x as great. 
The authors concluded their report by stating, and I quote, ""Prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer was associated with a significant and substantial reduction in mortality, relative to radiation therapy and androgen deprivation monotherapy. Although this is not a randomized study, given the multiple adjustments and sensitivity analysis, it is unlikely that the unmeasured confounding would account for the large observed differences in survival.""
The successful adoption of any new procedure or technology is directly tied to the efficacy of the training pathway. We've done a pretty good job thus far in assisting our customer base with their initial da Vinci training experience. When you consider the scale associated with training surgeons across multiple surgical specialties on a global basis, you'll quickly see that it's a significant endeavor. It has been our belief that in time, initial da Vinci procedure experience will find its way into the formal processes of academic medicine through residency and fellowship programs. 
As several da Vinci procedures have gone mainstream, we have begun to see this transition take place. Researchers from the University of Alabama, Birmingham, set out to define this developing trend within the GYN oncology fellowship programs around the country. 
UAB conducted a survey of GYN oncology follows and fellowship directors and summarized their findings in last month's edition of the International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery. The survey was designed to determine the prevalence, application and acceptance of robotics into 41 approved U.S. programs. Approximately half of the fellowship selectors responded to the survey with the following results. 95% of the respondents have a robotics system at their institution, and 94% have two or more gynecologic oncology faculty members who perform robotic surgery. 78% of the responding institutions do more than five robotic procedures per month, and 22% reported that they performed more than 12 procedures per month. 
All the responding institutions have utilized the robotic system in the management of endometrial cancer, and all respondents reported using the system from lymph node dissections. 89% reported utilization in treating cervical cancer and 83% reported robotic usage in benign hysterectomy. Furthermore, 89% of the fellows responding to the survey have been involved in cases that utilize robotic systems, and 77% have worked from the da Vinci System console. 
Although it's the first time we've seen an analysis of this form published in a peer-reviewed journal, we are aware of parallel activity taking place within the American Urology Association and the Association of Advanced Gynecological Laparoscopy, as well as in various international medical societies. The introduction of da Vinci surgery into residency and fellowship training speaks well to our product adoption thus far. But more importantly, it speaks volumes as to what we can expect with future robotics training. 
That concludes my summary, and I'll now turn the time over to Calvin."
30239,113574596,80250,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2010 including procedures, revenues and the other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates on significant non-cash expenses to provide you",601,"Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2010 including procedures, revenues and the other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates on significant non-cash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows.
Starting with procedures. We continue to project our 2010 procedures to grow approximately 35% for the year from the base of approximately 205,000 procedures performed in 2009. Moving on to revenues. Based on our results through three quarters and our view into our fourth quarter sales pipeline, we continue to expect revenue results to grow within the 30% to 33% range forecast last quarter.
Regarding the instrument and accessory portion of revenue, we would expect full year revenue growth in this category to come in slightly below the 35% forecasted procedure growth due to the diminishing impact of stocking orders on instrument and accessory revenue per procedure. As a reminder, our revenues can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as the timing of placements, system placement and instrument and accessory stocking orders may vary.
With regard to gross margin, we reported a 73.2% margin in both Q1 and Q2 of this year and a slightly lower rate of 72.8% in Q3, primarily reflecting the impact of lower Q3 system ASPs. Going forward, we expect our Q4 margins to be near our Q3 level, resulting in a full year 2010 gross margin percentage near the higher end of the 72% to 73% range projected on our last call.
Moving to operating expense. We have made and will continue to make significant investments across multiple areas of our business, particularly in our clinical sales force. We added 92 employees during the third quarter and 305 so far this year compared to 139 added through three quarters last year. 
While we continue to invest in our business, the timing of some of our expenses can be lumpy. We now expect our total GAAP operating expense to grow by 27% to 29% in 2010, compared with our previous forecast of 29% to 31% growth. In terms of non-cash expenses, we continue to expect to record stock compensation charges of approximately $120 million in 2010. Our guidance for intellectual property amortization is now $17 million compared to $15 million last quarter. This increase reflects additional amortization related to our Q3 IP investments.
Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, is expected to come in around $18.5 million for the year, just above the $18 million forecasted last quarter. With regard to income tax, our year-to-date tax rate now stands at 37.2% of pretax income. We now expect to record income taxes at approximately that 37.2% rate for the rest of 2010.
For calculating earnings per share, we ended the third quarter with 39.3 million common shares outstanding and approximately 4.9 million option shares outstanding. Depending on our average stock price in Q4, a portion of the 4.9 million option shares will be added to the fully diluted shares calculation. At present, we estimated that our diluted share count for calculating EPS in Q4 will be approximately 40.3 million shares. Our estimate for the full year is 40.4 million shares.
Finally, regarding our cash flows, since we are forecasting to report over $135 million in non-cash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operations is a better measure of our actual performance than net income. And with that, we would like to open the call to your questions."

And it's really the following in that, and we've said this over and over, and it just becomes even more apparent every quarter, that it's really a country-by-country market dynamic that's taking place within the EU and other markets in other parts of Asia. An example of that is we know what the macroeconomic headwinds were in the PIIGS countries over the last few quarters. But we sold five systems into Spain, because there's a number of underlying variables that really drive those sales. And that is, what the demand is for the procedures, what is the install base within that particular country and what are the underlying economic conditions? And if you kind of go through that on a case-by-case basis or a country-by-country basis, you're just going to find different parts of those ingredients that will drive the success in any given quarter or not. So I would say as a general statement as far as Europe is concerned, it still remains less predictable and probably more challenging that we have seen in some years past. And how that projects on a go-forward basis is really not something we're going to really try to assess in terms of being macroeconomists here. In terms of the o U.S. procedure growth, again, you're seeing the same variables unfold on a country-by-country basis. In some countries, it is absolutely on a very steep part of the curve. While in others, it's on an earlier part, less steep. It is not going to be as predictable or [indiscernible], if you will, of the U.S. market. And we'll try to color it up as best as we can.

I think one easy way to look at it is as we look at our adoption curves, for us that's an estimation of what we think the demand is out there for the procedures. And then you look at rep productivity and that's what we can do about it. And so as Aleks said, those are the two things that we're trying to match up. On the one hand, when we look out, we think the demand for procedures is there. The macroeconomic pressures are about whether there's some influence of unemployment or headwinds against that demand and then our rep productivity is the bottoms-up side. So we look at those two things and that's how we build our estimates, but they're estimates."

While we focus on financial metrics during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following da Vinci surgery experience gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. 
Stephanie from California writes, ""I silently suffered from excessive menstrual bleeding and cramping for years, which seemed only to get worse as each month passed. At one of my quarterly repeat Paps, I finally decided to speak up to the nurse practitioner in Dr. Swanson's office, because I felt my periods were ruining my life and I couldn't handle it anymore. I have two teenagers and two toddlers and couldn't be limited to the bathroom for days out of the month. The nurse practitioner gave me some literature to read about my different options and suggested that I make an appointment with Dr. Swanson, who has been my doctor for over 13 years to discuss my concerns. I read a little bit and did much research on my own. And then I saw Dr. Swanson three weeks later and described my issues. He basically said my options were to do nothing, which have been working out well for me, hormone pills, ovulation or hysterectomy. I have been on several different birth-control pills and they all made me nauseated. 
Dr. Swanson informed me that I would need a pretty strong dose, so that was not an option for me either. As for ovulation, I have read many complains about women that had had the procedure and stated that the cramping was now worse. I already have bad cramps and spotting, so I didn't want to risk that. Dr. Swanson agreed that it was a possibility that cramping could worsen and suggested that I was a perfect candidate for hysterectomy. Not only would it relieve me of my excessive bleeding and cramps, it will also free me from my abnormal Paps every three months. Dr. Swanson explained the procedure to me and thoroughly answered all my questions. Finally, I felt some resolution was coming. 
In the weeks prior to my scheduled surgery, I did much research online and actually found many videos for hysterectomies done by da Vinci robot on YouTube. I felt very prepared when my surgery day rolled around. And on August 3, 2010, at St. Agnes Medical Center in Fresno, Dr. Swanson and the staff were fantastic. Everyone made me feel relaxed and cared for. 
The surgery went very well. I had very little blood loss. I was able to get up and walk around to the bathroom and around the hospital room within hours after the surgery. My pain was minimal and really no more than some discomfort rather than real pain. I stayed only one night in the hospital and was discharged the next morning. My recovery at home was very quick. I was back to my normal self within the same week as my surgery. No pain, no cramps, no bleeding. My only regret is not speaking to my doctor and having the da Vinci hysterectomy done sooner."" 
Patients like Stephanie are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand. And I assure you that we remain committed to driving the few things that really makes a difference. 
This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking with you again in three months."

In what is historically a seasonally challenging quarter Q3, 2010 provided some added macroeconomic head wins. In the face of these challenges, our procedures showed slight growth sequentially from Q2 and 33% growth over Q3, 2009. In systems, we sold 105 da Vinci Systems in the quarter, up from 86 systems in Q3, 2009 and acceptance of our Si Systems and Dual Console’s were strong.
In absolute numbers, gynecology continued to show strength, adding the most procedures in the quarter, with contributions from both benign and malignant conditions. While Q3 is seasonally slow in Europe, prior year comparisons show relative strength in European procedures. Pull through procedures in gynecology and neurology also reflected positive trends.
Emerging procedures continue to expand exhibiting strong sequential growth. da Vinci Lobectomy, da Vinci Low Anterior Resection and da Vinci transoral surgery are delivering strong patient value and are being adopted well. On a relative basis the procedure counts are still fairly small, however there early growth rates remain encouraging.
Before summarizing Q3 highlights, I’d like to remind you that third quarter 2009 included a revenue deferral associated with an upgrade offer related to the introduction of our Si System, in comparisons that follow exclude the deferral. Operating highlights for the third quarter were as follows.
Procedures grew 33% over the third quarter of 2009. We sold 105 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 86 during the third quarter of last year.
Total revenue was $344 million, up 26% over Q3 2009. Instrument and accessory revenue was $128 million, up 27% over last year. Total recurring revenue grew to $185 million, up 28% from prior year and comprising 54% of total revenue.
Net income was $87 million, up 43% over last year. We generated an operating profit of $163 million before non-cash stock compensation expense, up 32% from the third quarter of last year.
We ended the quarter with $1.621 billion in cash and investments, up by $33 million from last quarter and up $597 million from third quarter 2009.
Significant cash outlays for the quarter included $50 million invested in intellectual property, related technologies and fixed assets and $59 million in stock repurchases.
Excluding the impact of these outlays, as well as $17 million from stock proceeds and $2 return from working capital, we generated $126 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 145% of our reported GAAP net income in the third quarter. We have been making substantive investments in our clinical sales force and in new product development throughout the year.
We believe that close clinical sales support of emerging and high-growth procedures is an important catalyst for achieving procedure adoption. However, reaching territory productivity for new sales hire does not happen immediately.
It is a multi-month process so that hires made earlier in the year are just coming online in the field now. We will continue to measure the productivity of these investments and we’ll adjust our spending as needed. This quarter we added an additional 92 people to our team, predominantly in sales, manufacturing, and R&D, bringing our total team to 1,568 employees.
In product development and research, our teams are driving advancements in our focus areas. Our instrument development teams are progressing and developing robotic stapling and energy instruments as well as various specialty specific instruments.
We are improving and expanding our imaging capabilities through investments in image acquisition technologies and fluorescence imaging. We are developing patient-side technologies that will allow for single port robotic surgery, and finally, we are making substantial progress in bringing to market surgical simulation and networking.
Lastly, we have seen a shift in the approach to new product approvals by the FDA. These changes appear to be extending timelines from past norms, and we cannot predict with certainty when a new product will receive approval.
We are confident in the utility and the quality of our new products going through the approval process and our focusing of regulatory teams on clean execution to meet the needs of FDA. We will announce the availability of new products if they are ready to ship.
In summary, developing and expanding procedures with strong patient value and outstanding organizational execution remain our focus with particular emphasis in execution in our clinical sales force and in our product development and regulatory teams.
I’ll now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer.

30239,113574596,80266,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. Prior to providing you with the details of our third quarter results, I would like to provide you with a quick review of the deferral accounting that took place during 2009, which sets into context the proper comparables.Last year, we o",1667,"Thank you, Gary. Prior to providing you with the details of our third quarter results, I would like to provide you with a quick review of the deferral accounting that took place during 2009, which sets into context the proper comparables.
Last year, we offered certain first quarter 2009 customers with the opportunity to upgrade the da Vinci S Systems to da Vinci Si systems at a discount to the otherwise list price for such an upgrade. We also offered those customers the opportunity to return da Vinci S accessories in exchange for da Vinci Si accessories.
As a result, we deferred a total of $20 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2009 comprised of $18 million of system revenue, associated with system upgrade offers and $2 million of accessory revenue. We recognized $14 million of the total $20 million deferral in our second quarter of 2009 and the remaining $6 million in the third quarter of 2009.
I will now walk you through our revenue results with comparisons to the third quarter of 2009 as though the deferral had not occurred. Our third quarter 2010 revenue was $344 million, up 26% compared with $274 million for the third quarter of 2009 and down 2% compared with $351 million for the second quarter of 2010.
Third quarter revenues by product category were as follows. Third quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $128 million, up 27% compared with $100 million for the third quarter of 2009 and approximately equal to the $128 million in the second quarter of 2010.
The timing of customer stocking orders varies from customer to customer and are regularly placed after the da Vinci robot is shipped or installed. Fewer stocking orders were completed and a higher carryover stocking orders existed in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.
Excluding stocking orders, growth in instrument and accessory revenue was slightly lower than the procedure growth as we would expect. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure, including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,840 per procedure, which is lower than the third quarter of 2009 by approximately $80, and approximately $30 lower than the second quarter of 2010.
The changes in instrument and accessory revenue per procedure primarily reflect changes in the impact of stocking orders. We expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline slowly over time, given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on our larger installed base.
Third quarter 2010 systems revenue of $160 million increased 23% compared with $130 million of systems revenue for the third quarter of 2009, and decreased 5% compared with $168 million of systems revenue for the second quarter. We sold 105 systems in the third quarter of 2010, compared with 86 systems last year and 108 systems last quarter.
Our third quarter average sales price per system including all da Vinci models, but excluding upgrades and the deferral revenue was $1.43 million, an increase from the $1.39 million realized in the third quarter of 2009 and a decrease from the $1.48 million realized in the second quarter. The increase compared to the prior year reflects an increase in the proportion of Si and Si Dual Console systems, which carry a higher ASP.
The decrease in average sales price per system compared with the prior quarter is primarily the result of the mix of customers and the reduction in the value of our euro to dollar hedging position. As we indicated last quarter, the mix of systems and customers and therefore ASPs, in the first and second quarters of this year had been more favorable than we normally expect.
We lock in hedges for most of our forecasted direct European systems sales every six months. The rates locked for in for July to December are lower than the rates recognized in the first six months of 2010 by approximately 15%.
Third quarter systems revenue also included $10 million of upgrade revenue compared to $10 million in the third quarter of 2009 and $8 million in the second quarter of 2010.
Service revenue increased $57 million, up 31% compared with $44 million last year and up 3% compared with $55 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system install base and it increased in the mix of Sis, which carry a higher annual service fees.
Total third quarter recurring revenue comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue increased to $185 million, up 28% compared with the third quarter of 2009 and up 1% compared with the second quarter of 2010. Recurring revenue represented 54% of total third quarter revenue compared with 53% in the third quarter last year and 52% last quarter.
Revenue by geography was as follows; non-U.S. revenue represented 17% of our total revenue in the quarter compared with 19% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2009, and 18% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2010.
The decline in the proportion of non-U.S. revenue relative to total revenue reflects growth in the U.S. business. Non-U.S. procedures grew faster at a faster pace than U.S. procedures on a year-to-year basis, although Q3 did reflect seasonality in a sequential decline.
We sold 22 systems outside U.S. compared with 14 in the third quarter of 2009 and 22 last quarter. Four of the systems sold in the third quarter and one of the system sold in the second quarter of 2010 were to Japanese customers.
We sold 16 systems in Europe this quarter or two more than the past quarter and eight more than last year. However, the capital sales market in Europe continues to be challenging reflecting the macroeconomic environment.
Moving onto the remainder of the P&L, let me remind you that there were no costs deferred in conjunction with the first quarter of 2009 revenue deferral, and therefore, the $20 million deferral and subsequent reversals had an equal impact on the revenue, gross profit, and operating income.
Gross margin in the third quarter was 73% compared with third quarter 2009 gross margin, excluding the impact of the deferral of 70%, and compared with second quarter 2010 gross margin of 73%.
The increase in gross margin compared to the prior year reflects increased system ASP, material cost reductions and absorption of fixed costs over a larger revenue base. Compared to the prior quarter, lower manufacturing costs were offset by lower system ASPs.
Third quarter 2010 operating expenses of $119 million were up 25% compared with the third quarter of 2009 and up 1% compared with the second quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter, partially offset by a decrease in R&D spending.
The decrease in R&D spending reflects lower prototype costs due to the lumpy nature of prototype purchasing, which will likely be incurred in the fourth quarter.
We added 92 employees in the quarter, including 77 employees in the sales and service organization, as we continued to expand our clinical sales force and 10 employees in operation.
Third quarter 2010 operating income was $132 million or 38% of sales compared with $98 million or 36% of sales for the third quarter of 2009, excluding the impact of the deferral and $140 million or 40% of sales for the second quarter of 2010.
Third quarter 2010 operating income reflected $30 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $25 million for the third quarter of 2009 and $30 million last quarter. The growth in non-cash compensation reflects our annual grant made February 15 of each year and the increase in the number of employees.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 37% was lower than our 2009 rate of 41%, reflecting the implementation of our international tax structure. Our third quarter rate was lower than the rate for the second quarter of 39%.
Our net income was $87 million or $2.14 per share compared with $61 million or $1.55 per share for the third quarter of 2009, excluding the impact of the deferral and $89 million or $2.19 per share for the second quarter of 2010.
Let me quickly summarize our results for the first nine months of 2010. The first quarter 2009 deferral did not have an impact on the nine months of 2009 information. Procedures grew by 35% for the first nine months of 2010.
Total revenue for the first nine months of 2010 was $1.024 billion, up 40% compared with $729 million last year. This included recurring revenue growth of 35% and an increase in systems revenue of 47%.
Operating income for the first nine months of 2010 was $402 million, up 61% compared with $249 million last year. Operating income included $88 million of stock-based compensation charges in the first nine months of 2010, compared with $72 million in 2009.
Net income for the first nine months of 2010 was $261 million or $6.45 per share, compared with $155 million or $3.97 per share last year.
Now moving to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter of 2010 with cash and investments of $1.621 billion, up $33 million compared with June 30, 2010. The increase during the quarter reflects $126 million of cash flows from operation and $17 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $59 million of stock buybacks and $50 million of capital on IT purchases.
In July, our Board authorized $150 million to buy back shares. Considering the previous authorization and buyback activity, we currently have $241 million authorized to buy back shares.
Our accounts receivable balance increased to $208 million at September 30, from $195 million at June 30, reflecting the timing of revenue. Our net inventory increased to $85 million at September 30, from $74 million at June 30. The increase reflects safety stock to ensure adequate supply of certain components and inventory associated with the yet to be released products.
With that, I’d like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing, and clinical highlights.

During the third quarter, we sold 105 da Vinci Systems; 83 in the United States, 16 in Europe, and 6 into rest of world markets. As part of the 105 system sales, 15 standard da Vinci systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si systems.
We had a net 90 system additions to the installed base during the quarter, which brings to 1,661 the cumulative number of da Vinci systems worldwide; 1,228 in the U.S.; 292 in Europe; and 141 in rest of world markets. 45 of the 105 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers.
Also, during the quarter, 10 customers purchased upgrades to convert their da Vinci S systems into da Vinci Si systems.
Internationally, we sold five da Vinci systems in Spain, four into the countries of Germany and Japan and three into France. Clinically, we had a solid quarter, with GYN and more specifically benign dVH contributing the greatest absolute growth.
While dVH for malignant conditions showed very good sequential growth, benign dVH growth was stronger, both in actual procedure growth and in percentage growth.
Additional categories of growth included ENT, colorectal, and thoracic surgery. As one would expect, with dVP flatting in the U.S., and seasonality in OUS markets, our urology growth was tempered. On a year-over-year comparison, overall, third quarter procedures grew by approximately 33%.
Also, during the quarter, over 250 da Vinci related clinical publications and abstracts representing multiple surgical specialties appeared within the various peer review journals.
dVH for benign conditions has become a significant driver of our overall business and within this target comparisons between dVH and traditional LAVH and lap supracervical hysterectomies or LSH are beginning to emerge.
For background an LSH is a less complete resection than a total hysterectomy, but in appropriate options for some patients, in LSH the cervix is left in place and only the uterus is extracted. In some ways it can be thought of as a partial hysterectomy.
A recent study comparing the three techniques was published in a Journal of Robotic Surgery. The study was entitled ‘Comparison of minimally invasive surgical approaches for hysterectomy at a community hospital’ and emanated out of the Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology at Spartanburg Regional Medical Center in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The study included patient cohorts comprised of the first 237 patients undergoing a dVH, the last 265 patients undergoing an LAVH and 87 patients undergoing an LSH.
Among the dVH patients were cases of greater complexity that included a higher prevalence of prior abdominal pelvic surgery than found among the LAVH patients as well as an increased number of procedures per endometriosis and pelvic reconstruction, and finally, patients which had greater uterine weights, greater by an average of 35%.
Despite added case complexity, operative time was significantly lower in dVH than LAVH, 90 minutes compared to 125 minutes, and similar to that of LSH. Blood loss was also less in the dVH patients as compared to LAVH, 59 milliliters compared to 168 milliliters and similar to LSH; and hospitalization was shorter for dVH than LAVH and LSH, 1.0 days compared to 1.2 days for the others.
In their summary, the author stated the following and I quote, ‘Our analysis of the learning curve suggest that operative time for robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy may continue to improve beyond the initial patient series despite the increased complexity of cases undergoing this procedure.
The results of this study lend support to the small but growing body of literature describing the benefit of robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy over conventional laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy.’
With dVP growth in the United States flattening, we look to Europe and other OUS markets as fertile growth opportunities. In addition, clinical data comparing long-term outcomes in patients undergoing prostatectomy versus alternative treatments for organ confined disease is demonstrating the advantages of prostatectomy in long-term survival.
In a recent publication of the journal, Cancer, surgeons and researchers from the University of California and San Francisco and Memorial Sloan-Kettering, working from the nation’s largest prostate cancer registry, CaPSURE, compared cancer-specific mortality outcomes among men who underwent radical prostatectomy, men who received external beam radiation therapy, and men who received primary androgen-deprivation therapy.
In the current study, 7,538 men with localized disease were analyzed. Prostate cancer risk was assessed using two-well validated instruments that were calculated from clinical data at the time of diagnosis. And then a parametric survival model was constructed to compare outcomes across treatments, adjusting for risk and age.
The results; in total, 266 men died of prostate cancer during the follow-up. Adjusting for risk and age, the hazard ratio for cancer-specific mortality relative to prostatectomy was 2.21 for radiation therapy and 3.22 for androgen deprivation.
Said another way, the analysis reports that the risk of a man dying from prostate cancer after primary radiation therapy was more than twice as great when compared to radical prostatectomy and the mortality risk for primary androgen-deprivation therapy was reported to be three times as great.
The authors concluded their report by stating in a ‘Prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer was associated with a significant and substantial reduction in mortality relative to radiation therapy and androgen deprivation monotherapy. Although this is not a randomized study, given the multiple adjustments and sensitivity analysis, it is unlikely that the unmeasured confounding would account for the large observed differences in survival.’
The successful adoption of any new procedure of technology is directly tied to the efficacy of the training pathway. We’ve done a pretty good job thus far in assisting our customer base with their initial da Vinci training experience. When you consider the scale associated with training surgeons across multiple surgical specialties, on a global basis, you’ll quickly see that it’s a significant endeavor.
It has been our belief that in time initial da Vinci procedure experience will find its way into the formal processes of academic medicine through residency and fellowship programs. As several da Vinci procedures have gone main stream, we have begun to see this transition take place.
Researchers from the University of Alabama, Birmingham, set out to define this developing trend within the GYN Oncology Fellowship Programs around the country. UAB conducted a survey of GYN Oncology fellows and fellowship directors and summarized their findings in last month’s addition of the International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery.
The survey was designed to determine the prevalence, application and acceptance of robotics in the 41 approved U.S. programs. Approximately, half of the fellowship directors responded to the survey with the following results. 95% of the respondents have a robotic system at their institution and 94% have two or more gynecologic oncology faculty members who perform robotic surgery. 78% of the responding institutions do more than five robotic procedures per month and 22% reported that they have performed more than 12 procedures per month.
All responding institutions have utilized the robotic system in the management of endometrial cancer and all respondents reported using the system for lymph node dissections. 89% reported utilization in treating cervical cancer and 83% reported robotic usage in benign hysterectomy. Furthermore, 89% of the fellows responding to the survey have been involved in cases that utilize robotic systems, and 77% have worked from the da Vinci system console.
Although it’s the first time we’ve seen an analysis of this form published in peer review journal, we are aware of parallel activity taking place within the American Urology Association and the Association of Advanced Gynecological Laparoscopy, as well as in various international medical societies.
The introduction of da Vinci surgery into residency and fellowship training, speaks well to our product adoption thus far, but more importantly, it speaks volumes as to what we can expect with future robotics training.
That concludes by summary and I’ll now turn the time over to Calvin.

I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2010 including procedures, revenues, and the other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates on significant non-cash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows, starting with procedures.
We continue to project our 2010 procedures to grow approximately 35% for the year from the base of approximately 205,000 procedures performed in 2009.
Moving onto revenues, based on our results through three quarters and our view into our fourth quarter sales pipeline, we continue to expect revenue results to grow within the 30% to 33% range forecast last quarter.
Regarding the instruments and accessory portion of revenue, we would expect full year revenue growth in this category to come in slightly below the 35% forecasted procedure growth due to the diminishing impact of stocking orders on instrument and accessory revenue curve procedure.
As a reminder, our revenues can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as the timing of placements, system placements, and instruments and accessories stocking orders may vary.
With regard to gross margin, we reported a 73.2% margin in both Q1 and Q2 of this year and a slightly lower rate of 72.8% in Q3, primarily reflecting the impact of lower Q3 system ASPs.
Going forward, we expect our Q4 margins to be near our Q3 level, resulting in a full year 2010 gross margin percentage near the higher end of the 72% to 73% range projected on our last call.
Moving to operating expense, we have made and will continue to make significant investments across multiple areas of our business, particularly in our clinical sales force.
We added 92 employees during the third quarter and 305 so far this year, compared to 139 added through three quarters last year. While we continue to invest in our business, the timing of some of our expenses can be lumpy.
We now expect our total GAAP operating expense to grow by 27% to 29% in 2010 compared with our previous forecast of 29% to 31% growth.
In terms of non-cash expenses, we continue to expect to record stock-compensation charges of approximately $120 million in 2010. Our guidance for intellectual property amortization is now $17 million, compared to $15 million last quarter. This increase reflects additional amortization related to our Q3 IP investments.
Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, is expected to come in around $18.5 million for the year, just above the $18 million forecasted last quarter. With regard to income tax, our year-to-date tax rate now stands at 37.2% of pre-tax income. We now expect to record income taxes at approximately that 37.2% rate for the rest of 2010.
For calculating earnings per share, we ended the third quarter with 39.3 million common shares outstanding and approximately 4.9 million option shares outstanding.
Depending on our average stock price in Q4, a portion of the 4.9 million options shares will be added to the fully diluted shares calculation. At present, we estimated that our diluted share count for calculating EPS in Q4 will be approximately 40.3 million shares. Our estimate for the full year is 40.4 million shares.
Finally, regarding our cash flows, since we are forecasting to report over $135 million in non-cash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operations is a better measure of our actual performance than net income.
And with that we would like to open the call to your questions.

But what we have found to be the case not just in GYN, but in other procedures is the greater patient value seems to take place in the more complex procedures. Within the benign category recognize that there is an underlying condition or several underlying conditions that range from let’s say not very complex to very complex.
The way we’ve been tracking the hysterectomy growth leads us to believe that we’re making good penetration into the complex and probably picking up some of the less complex along the way. But when we look at where we are in our growth trajectories and what the opportunity is, we are in a pretty steep part of our growth curve.
So, is it sustainable in our view? Absolutely, in the procedures that we are targeting, I don’t think there was anything from a let’s say a favorable tailwind through Q3 between seasonality and high unemployment rates that gave us any stimulus for the quarter. If you recall, we’ve returned to the norm of benign growth happening at a faster or a larger percentage than malignant growth last quarter as well as this quarter. So this isn’t the first time we’ve restored that.

So, I would say as a general statement as far as Europe is concerned, it still remains less predictable and probably more challenging than we have seen in some years passed. How that projects on a go forward basis, is really not something we’re going really try to assess in terms of being macroeconomist here.
In terms of the OUS procedure growth, again you’re seeing the same variables unfold on a country-by-country basis. In some countries it is absolutely on a very steep part of the curve, while in others it’s on earlier part less steep. It is not going to be as predictable margin if you will of the U.S. market and we’ll try to color it up as best we can, but it’s difficult to try to lump it into one bucket and make a general comment about its growth rates.

We sell through distributors to Spain, Italy, Greece, and rest of world, and those customers that we sell direct to as I said earlier, we take out hedges for the majority of our estimated future sales at the beginning of every six month period. Those hedges that we took out for the second half of 2010 were at lower rate by about 15% then the earlier part.
Now mind you that about 10% or around that is the amount of our revenue that is designated in those currencies. We also have obviously costs that are incurred in those foreign currencies and then we also have I&A revenue and service revenue that’s designated in those currencies and those pretty much offset. So, we think we’re hedging the majority of the exposure and therefore, the currencies don’t have a lot of impact other than when we lock in the hedges.

Having said that, once we say, okay we know we can fund and we believe we’re still in the early phases of robotic surgery, so we want to fund R&D, and we look out and we’re really asking, what’s going to drive patient value and what’s going to drive the adoption of procedures. In that bucket, there are always a set of instruments and accessories that as you look out and think about how to make new procedures happen on systems, instruments and accessories come in. It’s a given.
The next step is really imaging visualization. What can you provide to the surgeon to have a better understanding of what’s happening in the tissue. So, that bucket is usually filled as well. From there, we look at the patient side robotics, what can we’d be doing in the robotic space that makes for a better customer experience. And then of late, the next bucket has really been training technologies. Those things that ease training and ease of use, and so that’s kind of how we think about it, and I think for the next couple of years that’s the way it will play out.

Stephanie from California writes, ‘I silently suffered from excessive menstrual bleeding and cramping for years, which seems only to get worse as each month passed. At one of my quarterly repeat perhaps I have finally decided to speak up to the nurse practitioner in Dr. Swanson office, because I felt my periods were running my life and I couldn’t handle it any more. I have two teenagers and two toddlers and couldn’t be limited to the bathroom for days out of the month. The nurse practitioner gave me some literature to read about my different options and suggested that I make an appointment with Dr. Swanson, who has been my doctor for over 13 years to discuss my concerns. I read all the literature and did much research on my own. I then saw Dr. Swanson three weeks’ later and described my issues. He basically said my options were to do nothing, which hadn’t been working out well for me, hormone pills, ablation or hysterectomy. I had been on several different birth control pills in the past and they all made me nauseated. Dr. Swanson informed me that I would need a pretty strong dose, so that was not an option for me either.
As for an ablation, I read many complaints about women that had the procedure done and stated that their cramping was now worse. I already had bad cramps since spotting, so I didn’t want to risk that. Dr. Swanson agreed that it was a possibility that cramping could worsen and suggested that I was a perfect candidate for hysterectomy. Not only would it relieve me of my excessive bleeding and cramps, it would also free me from my abnormal perhaps every three months. Dr. Swanson explained the procedure to me and I thoroughly answered all my questions.
Finally, I felt some resolution was coming. In the weeks prior to my scheduled surgery, I did much research online and actually found many videos of hysterectomy done by da Vinci robot on YouTube. I felt very prepared when my surgery day rolled around and on August 3, 2010 at St. Agnes Medical Center in Fresno Dr. Swanson and the staff were fantastic. Everyone made me feel relaxed and cared for. The surgery went very well. I had very little blood loss. I was able to get up and walk around to the bathroom and around the hospital room within hours after the surgery. My pain was minimal and really no more than some discomfort rather than real pain. I stayed only one night in the hospital and was discharged the next morning. My recovery at home was very quick. I was back to my normal self within the same week as my surgery. No pain, no cramps, no bleeding, my only regret is not speaking to my doctor and having a da Vinci hysterectomy done soon.’
Patients like Stephanie are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand and I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that really makes a difference. This concludes today’s call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery, and we look forward to talking with you again in three months.

In what is historically a seasonally challenging quarter, Q3 2010 provided some added macroeconomic headwinds. In the face of these challenges, our procedures showed a slight growth sequentially from Q2 and 33% growth over Q3 2009. In systems, we sold 105 da Vinci systems in the quarter, up from 86 systems in Q3 2009. And acceptance of our Si systems in dual consoles was strong. 
In absolute numbers, gynecology continued to show strength, adding the most procedures in the quarter with contributions from both benign and malignant conditions. While Q3 is seasonally slow in Europe, prior year comparisons showed relative strength in European procedures. Ultra procedures in gynecology and neurology also reflect positive trends. 
The emerging procedures continue to expand, exhibiting strong sequential quarterly growth. da Vinci Lobectomy, da Vinci Low Anterior Resection and da Vinci Transoral Surgery are delivering strong patient value and are being adopted well. On a relative basis, the procedure counts are still fairly small. However, their early growth rates remain encouraging.
Before summarizing Q3 highlights, I'd like to remind you that third quarter 2009 included a revenue deferral associated with an upgrade offer related to the introduction of our Si system. Comparisons that follow exclude the deferral. Operating highlights for the third quarter were as follows: Procedures grew 33% over the third quarter of 2009. We sold 105 da Vinci Surgical Systems, up from 86 during the third quarter of last year. Total revenue was $344 million, up 26% over Q3 2009. Instrument and accessory revenue was $128 million, up 27% over last year. Total recurring revenue grew to $185 million, up 28% from prior year and comprising 54% of total revenue.
Net income was $87 million, up 43% over last year. We generated an operating profit of $163 million before non-cash stock option expense, up 32% from the third quarter of last year. We ended the quarter with $1,621,000,000 in cash and investments, up $33 million from last quarter and up $597 million from third quarter 2009.
Significant cash outlays during the quarter included $50 million invested in intellectual property, related technologies and fixed assets and $59 million in stock repurchases. Excluding the impact of these outlays as well as $17 million from stock proceeds and $2 million return from working capital, we generated $126 million in gross cash flow from operations, which is 145% of our reported GAAP net income in the third quarter.
We have been making substantive investments in our clinical sales force and our new product development throughout the year. We believe that close clinical sales support of emerging and high-growth procedures is an important catalyst for achieving procedure adoption. However, reaching territory productivity for new sales hires does not happen immediately. It is a multi-month process, so that hires made earlier in the year are just coming online in the field now.  We will continue to measure the productivity of these investments, and we'll adjust our spending as needed.  
This quarter, we added an additional 92 people to our team, predominantly in sales, manufacturing and R&D, bringing our total team to 1,568 employees. In product development and research, our teams are driving advancements in our focus areas.
Our instrument development teams are progressing in developing robotic stapling and energy instruments, as well as various specialty-specific instruments. We are improving and expanding our imaging capabilities through investments in image acquisition technologies and fluorescence imaging. We are developing patient-side technologies that allow for single port robotic surgery. And finally, we are making substantial progress in bringing to market surgical simulation and networking. 
Lastly, we have seen a shift in the approach to new product approvals by the FDA. These changes appear to be extending time lines from past norms, and we cannot predict with certainty when a new product will receive approval. We are confident in the utility and the quality of our new products going through the approval process and are focusing our inventory teams on clean execution to meet the needs of FDA. We will announce the availability of new products as they are ready to ship. 
In summary, developing and expanding procedures with strong patient value and outstanding organizational execution remain our focus with particular emphasis and execution in our clinical sales force and in our product development and regulatory teams. I will now pass the time over to Marshall, our Chief Financial Officer."
30239,113574596,80294,"Intuitive Surgical, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Intuitive Surgical, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gary. Prior to providing you with the details of our third quarter results, I would like to provide you with a quick review of the deferral accounting that took place during 2009, which sets into context the proper comparables. Last year, we of",1664,"Thank you, Gary. Prior to providing you with the details of our third quarter results, I would like to provide you with a quick review of the deferral accounting that took place during 2009, which sets into context the proper comparables. Last year, we offered certain first quarter 2009 customers with the opportunity to upgrade their da Vinci S Systems to da Vinci Si Systems at a discount to the otherwise list price for such an upgrade. We also offered those customers the opportunity to return da Vinci S accessories in exchange for da Vinci Si accessories. As a result, we deferred a total of $20 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2009, comprised of $18 million of system revenue associated with system upgrade offers and $2 million of accessory revenue. We recognized $14 million of the $20 million deferral in our second quarter of 2009 and the remaining $6 million in the third quarter of 2009. 
I will now walk you through our revenue results with comparisons to the third quarter of 2009, as though the deferral had not occurred. Our third quarter 2010 revenue was $344 million, up 26% compared with $274 million for the third quarter of 2009 and down 2% compared with $351 million for the second quarter of 2010. 
Third quarter revenues by product category were as follows: Third quarter instrument and accessory revenue was $128 million, up 27% compared with $100 million for the third quarter of 2009 and approximately equal to the $128 million in the second quarter of 2010. The timing of customer stocking orders varies from customer to customer and are regularly placed after the da Vinci robot is shipped or installed. Fewer stocking orders were completed and a higher carryover of stocking orders existed in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. 
Excluding stocking orders, growth in instrument and accessory revenue was slightly lower than the procedure growth as we would expect. Instrument and accessory revenue realized per procedure including initial stocking orders was approximately $1,840 per procedure, which is lower than the third quarter of 2009 by approximately $80 and approximately $30 lower than the second quarter of 2010.  The changes in instrument and accessory revenue per procedure primarily reflect changes in the impact of stocking orders. We expect instruments and accessories per procedure to decline slowly over time, given that initial stocking orders have a lower impact on a larger install base. 
Third quarter 2010 systems revenue of $160 million increased 23% compared with $130 million of systems revenue for the third quarter of 2009 and decreased 5% compared with $168 million of systems revenue for the second quarter. We sold 105 systems in the third quarter of 2010 compared with 86 systems last year and 108 systems last quarter. 
Our third quarter average sales price per system including all da Vinci models, but excluding upgrades in the deferral revenue, was $1.43 million, an increase from the $1.39 million realized in the third quarter of 2009 and a decrease from the $1.48 million realized in the second quarter. The increase compared to the prior year reflects an increase in the proportion of Si and Si Dual Console systems, which carry a higher ASP. 
The decrease in average sales price per system compared with the prior quarter is primarily the result of the mix of customers and the reduction in the value of our euro-to-dollar hedging position. As we indicated last quarter, the mix of systems and customers, and therefore, ASPs, in the first and second quarters of this year have been more favorable than we normally expect. We lock in hedges for most of our forecasted direct European system sales every six months. The rates locked in for July to December are lower than the rates recognized in the first six months of 2010 by approximately 15%. 
Third quarter systems revenue also included $10 million of upgrade revenue compared to $10 million in the third quarter of 2009 and $8 million in the second quarter of 2010. Service revenue increased to $57 million, up 31% compared with $44 million last year and up 3% compared with $55 million last quarter. The growth in service revenue was primarily driven by a larger system install base and an increase in the mix of Sis, which carry a higher annual service fee. 
Total third quarter recurring revenue, comprised of instrument, accessory and service revenue, increased to $185 million, up 28% compared with the third quarter of 2009 and up 1% compared with the second quarter of 2010. Recurring revenue represented 54% of total third quarter revenue compared with 53% in the third quarter last year and 52% last quarter. 
Revenue by geography was as follows: Non-U.S. revenue represented 17% of our total revenue in the quarter compared with 19% of total revenue in the third quarter of 2009 and 18% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2010. The decline in the proportion of non-U.S. revenue relative to total revenue reflects the growth in U.S. business. Non-U.S. procedures grew faster at a faster pace than U.S. procedures on a year-to-year basis, although Q3 did reflect seasonality and a sequential decline. 
We sold 22 systems outside the U.S. compared with 14 in the third quarter of 2009 and 22 last quarter. Four of the systems sold in the third quarter and one of the systems sold in the second quarter of 2010 were to Japanese customers. We sold 16 systems in Europe this quarter or two more than the past quarter and eight more than last year. However, the capital sales market in Europe continues to be challenging, reflecting the macroeconomic environment. 
Moving on to the remainder of the P&L. Let me remind you that there were no costs deferred in the conjunction with the first quarter of 2009 revenue deferral, and therefore, the $20 million deferral and subsequent reversals had an equal impact on the revenue, gross profit and operating income.
Gross margin in the third quarter was 73% compared with third quarter 2009 gross margin, excluding the impacts of the deferral of 70% and compared with second quarter 2010 gross margin of 73%. The increase in gross margin compared to the prior year reflects increased system ASPs, material costs reductions and absorption of fixed costs over a larger revenue base. Compared to the prior quarter, lower manufacturing costs were offset by lower system ASPs.
Third quarter 2010 operating expenses of $119 million were up 25% compared with the third quarter of 2009 and up 1% compared with the second quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase reflects costs associated with employees added during the quarter, partially offset by a decrease in R&D spending. The decrease in R&D spending reflects lower prototype costs due to the lumpy nature of prototype purchasing, which will likely be incurred in the fourth quarter. We added 92 employees in the quarter, including 77 employees in the sales and service organization as we continue to expand our clinical sales force, and 10 employees in operations.
Third quarter 2010 operating income was $132 million or 38% of sales, compared with $98 million or 36% of sales for the third quarter of 2009 excluding the impact of the deferral, and $140 million or 40% of sales for the second quarter of 2010.  Third quarter 2010 operating income reflected $30 million of non-cash stock compensation expense compared with $25 million for the third quarter of 2009 and $30 million last quarter. The growth in non-cash compensation reflects our annual grant made February 15 of each year and the increase in the number of employees.
Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 37% was lower than our 2009 rate of 41%, reflecting the implementation of our international tax structure. Our third quarter rate was lower than the rate for the second quarter of 39%. 
Our net income was $87 million or $2.14 per share compared with $61 million or $1.55 per share for the third quarter of 2009 excluding the impact of the deferral, and $89 million or $2.19 per share for the second quarter of 2010.
Let me quickly summarize our results for the first nine months of 2010. The first quarter of 2009 deferrals did not have an impact on the nine months of 2009 information. Procedures grew by 35% for the first nine months of 2010. Total revenue for the first nine months of 2010 was $1,024,000,000, up 40% compared with $729 million last year. This included recurring revenue growth of 35% and an increase in systems revenue of 47%. 
Operating income for the first nine months of 2010 was $402 million, up 61% compared with $249 million last year. Operating income included $88 million of stock-based compensation charges in the first nine months of 2010 compared with $72 million in 2009. Net income for the first nine months of 2010 was $261 million or $6.45 per share compared with $155 million or $3.97 per share last year.
Now moving to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter of 2010 with cash and investments of $1,621,000,000, up $33 million compared with June 30, 2010. The increase during the quarter reflects $126 million of cash flows from operation and $17 million from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $59 million of stock buybacks and $50 million of capital and IT purchases. In July, our board authorized $150 million to buy back shares. Considering the previous authorization and buyback activity, we currently have $241 million authorized to buy back shares. 
Our accounts receivable balance increased to $208 million at September 30 from $195 million at June 30, reflecting the timing of revenue. Our net inventory increased to $85 million at September 30 from $74 million at June 30. The increase reflects safety stock to ensure adequate supply of certain components and inventory associated with yet-to-be-released products.
And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Aleks, who will go over our sales, marketing and clinical highlights."

During the third quarter, we sold 105 da Vinci systems, 83 in the United States, 16 in Europe and six in the rest of world markets.

During the third quarter, we sold 105 da Vinci systems, 83 in the United States, 16 in Europe and six in the rest of world markets. As part of the 105 system sales, 15 standard da Vinci systems were traded in for credit against sales for new da Vinci Si Systems. We had a net 90 system additions to the install base during the quarter, which brings to 1,661 the cumulative number of da Vinci Systems worldwide, 1,228 in the U.S., 292 in Europe and 141 in rest of world markets. 45 of the 105 systems installed represented repeat system sales to existing customers.
Also during the quarter, 10 customers purchased upgrades to convert their da Vinci S Systems into da Vinci Si Systems. Internationally, we sold five da Vinci Systems in Spain, four into the countries of Germany and Japan and three into France. 
Clinically, we had a solid quarter with GYN, and more specifically, benign dVH contributing the greatest absolute growth. While dVH from malignant conditions showed very good sequential growth, benign dVH growth was stronger, both in natural procedure growth and in percentage growth. Additional categories of growth included ENT, colorectal and thoracic surgery. As one would expect with dVP flattening in the U.S. and seasonality in o U.S. markets, our urology growth was tempered.
On a year-over-year comparison, overall third quarter procedures grew by approximately 33%. Also during the quarter, over 250 da Vinci related clinical publications and abstracts representing multiple surgical specialties appeared within the various peer-reviewed journals. dVH for benign conditions has become a significant driver of our overall business. 
And within this target, comparisons between dVH and traditional LAVH and Lap Supracervical Hysterectomies or LSH, are beginning to emerge. For background, in LSH is a less complete resection than a total hysterectomy, but an appropriate option for some patients. In LSH, the cervix is left in place and only the uterus is extracted. In some ways, it can be thought of as a partial hysterectomy. 
Our recent study comparing the three techniques was published in the Journal of Robotic Surgery. The study was entitled, Comparison of Minimally Invasive Surgical Approaches for Hysterectomy at a Community Hospital, and it emanated out of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Spartanburg Regional Medical Center in Spartanburg, South Carolina. The study included patient cohorts comprised of the first 237 patients undergoing a dVH, the last 265 patients undergoing an LAVH and 87 patients undergoing an LSH. Among the dVH patients were cases of greater complexity that included a higher prevalence of prior abdominal pelvic surgery than found among the LAVH patients, as well as an increased number of procedures for endometriosis and pelvic reconstruction. And finally, patients which had greater uterine weights, greater by an average of 35%. 
Despite added case complexity, operative time was significantly lower in dVH than LAVH, 90 minutes compared to 125 minutes, and similar to that of LSH. Blood loss was also last in the dVH patients as compared to LAVH, 59 milliliters compared to 168 milliliters, and similar to LSH. And hospitalization was shorter for dVH than LAVH and LSH, 1.0 days compared to 1.2 days for the others. 
In their summary, the authors stated the following, and I quote: ""Our analysis of the learning curve suggests that operative time for robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy may continue to improve beyond the initial patient series, despite the increased complexity of cases undergoing this procedure. The results of this study lends support to the small but growing body of literature describing the benefits of robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy over conventional laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy.""
With dVP growth in the United States flattening, we look to Europe and other o U.S. markets as fertile growth opportunities. In addition, clinical data comparing long-term outcomes in patients undergoing prostatectomy versus alternative treatments for organ confined disease is demonstrating the advantages of prostatectomy in long-term survival.
In a recent publication of the journal, Cancer, surgeons and researchers from the University of California at San Francisco and Memorial Sloan-Kettering, working from the nation's largest prostate cancer registry, CaPSURE, compared cancer-specific mortality outcomes among men who underwent radical prostatectomy, men who received external beam radiation therapy and men who received primarily androgen deprivation therapy. In the current study, 7,538 men with localized disease were analyzed. Prostate cancer risk was assessed using two well-validated instruments that were calculated from clinical data at the time of diagnosis. Then a parametric survival model was constructed to compare outcomes across treatments, adjusting for risks and age. 
The results: in total, 266 men died of prostate cancer during the follow-up. Adjusting for risk and age, the hazard ratio for cancer-specific mortality relative to prostatectomy was 2.21 for radiation therapy and 3.22 for androgen deprivation. Said another way, the analysis reports that the risk of a man dying from prostate cancer after primary radiation therapy was more than twice as great when compared to radical prostatectomy. And the mortality risk for primary androgen deprivation therapy was reported to be 3x as great. 
The authors concluded their report by stating, and I quote, ""Prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer was associated with a significant and substantial reduction in mortality, relative to radiation therapy and androgen deprivation monotherapy. Although this is not a randomized study, given the multiple adjustments and sensitivity analysis, it is unlikely that the unmeasured confounding would account for the large observed differences in survival.""
The successful adoption of any new procedure or technology is directly tied to the efficacy of the training pathway. We've done a pretty good job thus far in assisting our customer base with their initial da Vinci training experience. When you consider the scale associated with training surgeons across multiple surgical specialties on a global basis, you'll quickly see that it's a significant endeavor. It has been our belief that in time, initial da Vinci procedure experience will find its way into the formal processes of academic medicine through residency and fellowship programs. 
As several da Vinci procedures have gone mainstream, we have begun to see this transition take place. Researchers from the University of Alabama, Birmingham, set out to define this developing trend within the GYN oncology fellowship programs around the country. 
UAB conducted a survey of GYN oncology follows and fellowship directors and summarized their findings in last month's edition of the International Journal of Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery. The survey was designed to determine the prevalence, application and acceptance of robotics in the 41 approved U.S. programs. Approximately half of the fellowship selectors responded to the survey with the following results. 95% of the respondents have a robotics system at their institution, and 94% have two or more gynecologic oncology faculty members who perform robotic surgery. 78% of the responding institutions do more than five robotic procedures per month, and 22% reported that they performed more than 12 procedures per month. 
All the responding institutions have utilized the robotic system in the management of endometrial cancer, and all respondents reported using the system from lymph node dissections. 89% reported utilization in treating cervical cancer and 83% reported robotic usage in benign hysterectomy. Furthermore, 89% of the fellows responding to the survey have been involved in cases that utilize robotic systems, and 77% have worked from the da Vinci System console. 
Although it's the first time we've seen an analysis of this form published in a peer-reviewed journal, we are aware of parallel activity taking place within the American Urology Association and the Association of Advanced Gynecological Laparoscopy, as well as in various international medical societies. The introduction of da Vinci surgery into residency and fellowship training speaks well to our product adoption thus far. But more importantly, it speaks volumes as to what we can expect with future robotics training. 
That concludes my summary, and I'll now turn the time over to Calvin."

I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2010 including procedures, revenues and the other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates on significant non-cash expenses to provide you",601,"Thank you, Aleks. I will be providing an update to our financial forecast for 2010 including procedures, revenues and the other elements of the income statement on a GAAP basis. I will also provide estimates on significant non-cash expenses to provide you with visibility of our expected future cash flows.
Starting with procedures. We continue to project our 2010 procedures to grow approximately 35% for the year from the base of approximately 205,000 procedures performed in 2009. Moving on to revenues. Based on our results through three quarters and our view into our fourth quarter sales pipeline, we continue to expect revenue results to grow within the 30% to 33% range forecast last quarter.
Regarding the instrument and accessory portion of revenue, we 
would expect full year revenue growth in this category to come in slightly below the 35% forecasted procedure growth due to the diminishing impact of stocking orders on instrument and accessory revenue per procedure. As a reminder, our revenues can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter as the timing of placements, system placement and instrument and accessory stocking orders may vary.
With regard to gross margin, we reported a 73.2% margin in both Q1 and Q2 of this year and a slightly lower rate of 72.8% in Q3, primarily reflecting the impact of lower Q3 system ASPs. Going forward, we expect our Q4 margins to be near our Q3 level, resulting in a full year 2010 gross margin percentage near the higher end of the 72% to 73% range projected on our last call.
Moving to operating expense. We have made and will continue to make significant investments across multiple areas of our business, particularly in our clinical sales force. We added 92 employees during the third quarter and 305 so far this year compared to 139 added through three quarters last year. 
While we continue to invest in our business, the timing of some of our expenses can be lumpy. We now expect our total GAAP operating expense to grow by 27% to 29% in 2010, compared with our previous forecast of 29% to 31% growth. In terms of non-cash expenses, we continue to expect to record stock compensation charges of approximately $120 million in 2010. Our guidance for intellectual property amortization is now $17 million, compared to $15 million last quarter. This increase reflects additional amortization related to our Q3 IP investments.
Other income, which is mainly comprised of interest income, is expected to come in around $18.5 million for the year, just above the $18 million forecasted last quarter. With regard to income tax, our year-to-date tax rate now stands at 37.2% of pretax income. We now expect to record income taxes at approximately that 37.2% rate for the rest of 2010.
For calculating earnings per share, we ended the third quarter with 39.3 million common shares outstanding and approximately 4.9 million option shares outstanding. Depending on our average stock price in Q4, a portion of the 4.9 million option shares will be added to the fully diluted shares calculation. At present, we estimated that our diluted share count for calculating EPS in Q4 will be approximately 40.3 million shares. Our estimate for the full year is 40.4 million shares.
Finally, regarding our cash flows, since we are forecasting to report over $135 million in non-cash stock compensation and amortization expenses for the year, our cash flows will continue to be significantly higher than our reported net income. We believe cash flows generated from operations is a better measure of our actual performance than net income. And with that, we would like to open the call to your questions."

I think there's actually some connectivity between part A of your question and part B. And it's really the following in that, and we've said this over and over, and it just becomes even more apparent every quarter, that it's really a country-by-country market dynamic that's taking place within the EU and other markets in other parts of Asia. An example of that is we know what the macroeconomic headwinds were in the PIIGS countries over the last few quarters. But we sold five systems into Spain, because there's a number of underlying variables that really drive those sales. And that is, what the demand is for the procedures, what is the install base within that particular country and what are the underlying economic conditions? And if you kind of go through that on a case-by-case basis or a country-by-country basis, you're just going to find different parts of those ingredients that will drive the success in any given quarter or not. So I would say as a general statement as far as Europe is concerned, it still remains less predictable and probably more challenging than we have seen in some years past. And how that projects on a go-forward basis is really not something we're going to really try to assess in terms of being macroeconomists here. In terms of the o U.S. procedure growth, again, you're seeing the same variables unfold on a country-by-country basis. In some countries, it is absolutely on a very steep part of the curve. While in others, it's on an earlier part, less steep. It is not going to be as predictable a margin, if you will, of the U.S. market. And we'll try to color it up as best as we can.

While we focus on financial metrics during these conference calls, our organizational focus remains on increasing patient value by improving surgical outcomes and reducing surgical trauma. I hope the following da Vinci surgery experience gives you some sense of what this means in the lives of our patients. 
Stephanie from California writes, ""I silently suffered from excessive menstrual bleeding and cramping for years, which seemed only to get worse as each month passed. At one of my quarterly repeat Paps, I finally decided to speak up to the nurse practitioner in Dr. Swanson's office, because I felt my periods were ruining my life and I couldn't handle it anymore. I had two teenagers and two toddlers and couldn't be limited to the bathroom for days out of the month. The nurse practitioner gave me some literature to read about my different options and suggested that I make an appointment with Dr. Swanson, who has been my doctor for over 13 years to discuss my concerns. I read a all the literature and did much research on my own. And then I saw Dr. Swanson three weeks later and described my issues. He basically said my options were to do nothing, which hadn't been working out well for me, hormone pills, ablation or hysterectomy. I had been on several different birth-control pills and they all made me nauseated. 
Dr. Swanson informed me that I would need a pretty strong dose, so that was not an option for me either. As for ablation, I have read many complaints about women that had had the procedure done and stated that the cramping was now worse. I already had bad cramps and spotting, so I didn't want to risk that. Dr. Swanson agreed that it was a possibility that cramping could worsen and suggested that I was a perfect candidate for a hysterectomy. Not only would it relieve me of my excessive bleeding and cramps, it will also free me from my abnormal Paps every three months. Dr. Swanson explained the procedure to me and thoroughly answered all my questions. Finally, I felt some resolution was coming. 
In the weeks prior to my scheduled surgery, I did much research online and actually found many videos for hysterectomies done by da Vinci robot on YouTube. I felt very prepared when my surgery day rolled around. And on August 3, 2010, at St. Agnes Medical Center in Fresno, Dr. Swanson and the staff were fantastic. Everyone made me feel relaxed and cared for. 
The surgery went very well. I had very little blood loss. I was able to get up and walk around to the bathroom and around the hospital room within hours after the surgery. My pain was minimal and really no more than some discomfort rather than real pain. I stayed only one night in the hospital and was discharged the next morning. My recovery at home was very quick. I was back to my normal self within the same week as my surgery. No pain, no cramps, no bleeding. My only regret is not speaking to my doctor and having the da Vinci hysterectomy done sooner."" 
Patients like Stephanie are the strongest advocates for da Vinci surgery and form the very foundation of our operating performance. We have built our company to take surgery beyond the limits of the human hand. And I assure you that we remain committed to driving the vital few things that truly makes a difference. 
This concludes today's call. We thank you for your participation and support on this extraordinary journey to improve surgery. And we look forward to talking with you again in three months."
