Earlier today, we announced our Q3 results, which were in line with the update we provided on January 11. We also provided our FY '11 guidance, which, at the midpoint of our range, translates to more than a 40% increase in non-GAAP EPS. O",363,"Thank you, Mary. Earlier today, we announced our Q3 results, which were in line with the update we provided on January 11. We also provided our FY '11 guidance, which, at the midpoint of our range, translates to more than a 40% increase in non-GAAP EPS. On today's call, I'll begin with brief comments in our progress, Eric will review the Q3 results and review our guidance in detail. John Schappert will provide an operations update, and then we'll take your questions.Let me start with an update on EA's execution framed against the four strategic initiatives we have identified as crucial to our long-term growth and profitability. First, product quality. In calendar '09, we shipped 19 titles with a Metacritic rating of 80 or better, the next best third-party publisher shipped only six. We also just shipped Mass Effect 2 with a Metacritic rating of 96, one of the highest-rated games ever released on Xbox 360. EA is clearly the quality leader among multi-platform publishers. I believe this is a significant driver in the fact that EA has gained share, fiscal year to date.Second, creating hits in core packaged goods. We're very proud that both Madden and FIFA remained at the top of the charts again in calendar '09. We're also pleased that we've established two new eyepiece, a sequel-ready successes so far this fiscal year in Dragon Age and EA SPORTS Active, that our recent win with Mass Effect suggests these three titles can be sequel successfully in the future.Third, our investment in Digital revenue stream meeting, and in many cases, exceeding our own high expectations. We achieved a record $152 million in quarterly non-GAAP net revenue in Q3. This brings us to 30% growth in Digital revenue in fiscal year to date. Our overall Digital business is now at scale over $500 million annually, growing very rapidly and profitable.Lastly, operating efficiencies. In the past two years, we have dramatically lowered headcount despite acquisitions and the addition of multiple Digital business models. Our operating costs are expected to be down on FY '10 versus FY '09, and down even further in FY '11. With that, I will turn it over to Eric."

First, EA's Q3 together with our guidance for Q4 is at the lower end of the range we guided on January 11. While we are very pleased with the performance per title so far in the fourth quarter, we remain cautious in the packaged goods market that remains soft overall and hit driven. Second, our guidance for F '11 is framed by three major considerations. While we see reasons for optimism for the packaged goods sector, we believe using a minus 3% rate for the sector is a better planning assumption. We've made the call to deemphasize low-margin distribution in our FY '11 guidance, which reduces top line revenue but has limited effect in earnings. While there may be the occasional distribution deal that meets our criteria going forward, part of our mantra, fewer and bigger, since the recognition that tighter focus will yield better results. Lastly, we note that we've built a plan around an expense base that is approximately $100 million lower in F '11 than F '10 and like-on-like, adjusting for foreign exchange bonus and Playfish run rate is approximately $200 million lower on a non-GAAP basis.By driving down expenses aggressively, we're able to guide to non-GAAP EPS growth of 40% at the mid-point of our guidance range, while maintaining a realistic stance on the packaged goods sector. I will now provide industry comments and then turn to EA results. For Western markets overall, the packaged goods sector was down 9% in the quarter versus expectations of a flat quarter. Both North America and Europe were down 9%. Europe's biggest market, the U.K., was down 16% year-over-year.In the quarter, Sony PS3 hardware sales increased 48% year-over-year, Wii hardware sales decreased 2% year-over-year, while Xbox 360 hardware sales declined 21% year-over-year. Hardware sales responded to price promotions, particularly the Wii in North America with Wal-Mart promoting the Wii at an effective $149 price point. In North America, concentration of sales in the top titles continued, with the top 20 titles in calendar Q4 '09, representing 48% share in dollars versus 37% share in calendar Q4 '06.For the global market including Asia, we estimate that total Packaged Goods represented approximately 60% of the overall software market for calendar 2009, while total Digital, consisting of mobile and online, was approximately 40%. While Packaged Goods were down 9% in calendar '09, we estimate that total Digital increased by approximately 28%, growing the combination of Packaged Goods plus Digital by 3% year-over-year.EA's fiscal third quarter results were in line with the update we provided on our January 11, 2010 call. Non-GAAP net revenue was $1.346 billion, short of our going-in expectations due to a soft December for EA and the weak overall packaged goods sector. We also experienced product mix shift to lower margin distribution titles in the December quarter in North America. On a GAAP basis, net revenue was $1.243 billion. At constant currency rates, net revenue decreased $435 million or 25% year-over-year. The primary cause of change year-over-year was the greater number of front-line titles like Need for Speed, Mirror's Edge, and Dead Space in Q3 fiscal '09.In our Packaged Goods business, FIFA 10 sold through over 7 million copies at retail in the quarter for Europe and North America combined and launched with a Metacritic rating of 91 on the PS3 and Xbox 360. In Europe, it was the number two title across all platforms in the quarter and the number two title in calendar '09. Madden NFL 10 sold through over 2.3 million copies at retail in the quarter in North America. Madden NFL 10 charted number four overall in calendar '09. Year-over-year, Madden sales in all platforms combined continue to close the gap in North America from minus 17% through Q2 to minus 6% through the end of Q3. Our core platforms, PS3 and Xbox 360, are up 15% on a cumulative basis.Dragon Age: Origins was a key front-line title for the quarter. It's sold in 2.7 million copies worldwide on the PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 platforms and received a Metacritic rating of 88 across all platforms. In our Distribution business, Left 4 Dead 2 in partnership with Dell exceeded our expectations with 2.9 million copies sold in worldwide on the PC and Xbox 360 during the holiday quarter, and it charted in the top 10 in North America according to NPD. In our Digital business, FIFA 10 with its innovative Ultimate Team mode, Dragon Age premium digital content, Battlefield 1943 and The Sims Store all performed well in the quarter. Pogo continues to be the number one online game site worldwide in terms of user engagement. We started recognizing Playfish revenue in the fiscal third quarter. During Q3, we had two of the top 10 Facebook games.We continue to be the number one mobile games provider in Western markets. We had seven of the top 11 games in December for the iPhone and four of the top five selling games for 2009. EA had seven of the top 10 games on Verizon during the quarter and achieved over 50% of the top 10 games on AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile.We had 1.9 million total subscribers in the quarter. This includes Pogo, as well as massively multi-player online or MMO subscribers. We finished the quarter with 49 million registered users, and our central user identity management system up 16% from the prior quarter. This includes console and PC users. Performance by Digital business model included the following for the quarter: We achieved another record quarter with $152 million in non-GAAP Digital net revenue, up 30% year-over-year; Mobile revenue was $57 million, up 14% year-over-year; Digital revenue from all other non-mobile sources was $95 million for the quarter, up 42% year-over-year. This includes full game downloads, PC and console premium downloadable content or PDLC, browser games, subscriptions, social games and advertising.Moving to the rest of the income statement, non-GAAP gross profit margin was 51.6% versus 47.1% a year ago. This is up from the prior year due to a greater mix of published titles. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $540 million, down $47 million or 8% year-over-year. Total bonus accrued as of the end of Q3 is $54 million compared to the $43 million through Q3 last year. Total variable market expense in the quarter was $149 million compared with $187 million in the same quarter last year, which is in line with a different title plan where we had more front-line releases last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $154 million versus non-GAAP operating income of $234 million a year ago.Below the operating income line, non-GAAP other income and expense was negative $2 million versus positive $14 million a year ago. This reduction is due to lower cash balances and the $7 million adverse foreign currency movement compared to a year ago. On a GAAP basis, we recorded a tax benefit of $28 million, primarily due to a reduction in our deferred tax valuation allowance related to the change in U.S. tax law for tax laws secured backs. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported taxes at 28%. GAAP diluted loss per share was $0.25 versus a diluted loss per share of $2 a year ago. Last year, we recorded a significant goodwill impairment and tax valuation allowance charge in Q3. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.33 versus diluted earnings per share of $0.56 a year ago. In Q3, we generated $221 million of operating cash flow versus $212 million a year ago. Fiscal year to date, our operating cash flow improved by $102 million versus last year. We ended the quarter with 8,537 employees versus 9,760 a year ago. 20% of our employees are now in low-cost locations versus 17% a year ago.Turning to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1.466 billion at quarter end, down approximately $159 million from last quarter, primarily due to the acquisition of Playfish. Marketable equity securities was $318 million, down $69 million from last quarter, primarily due to the sale of benign shares and a decline in the value of our Ubisoft investment. At quarter end, we had $179 million of net unrealized gains on investments. Gross accounts receivable were $762 million, down $335 million from last year or down 31%. DSOs were 51 days versus 57 last year. Reserves against outstanding receivables totaled $267 million, down $36 million from a year ago. Reserve levels were 8% of trailing nine-month non-GAAP revenue versus 9% a year ago.Inventory was $144 million, down $151 million from a year ago. Ending deferred net revenue from Packaged Goods and Digital Content was $895 million, up $383 million from a year ago due to the additional deferral for all console and online-enabled PC games. Restructuring update. Our restructuring plan is on track. During Q3, we recorded $96 million of restructuring expense for our fiscal '10 restructuring plan of the estimated total amount of $150 million to $155 million. We closed five locations and are approximately 2/3 complete with position reductions at the end of January 2010.Now to our outlook for Q4 fiscal '10. Revenue. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenue of $925 million to $1 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenue of $800 million to $850 million. Operating expenses. We expect GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $625 million to $640 million and non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $520 million to $535 million. Below the line, we expect GAAP diluted EPS of $0.05 to $0.23. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.02 to $0.06. For taxes, we expect a GAAP tax expense of approximately $0 million to $10 million, excluding the impact of tax-related charges that may arise in connection with the Playfish integration. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect to report taxes at 28%. For share count, please use 328 million shares to compute both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS.FY '11 outlook and guidance. As we go through our fiscal '11 guidance, we will refer to three principal lines of business. First, packaged goods, this includes higher margin EA-owned titles and co-published titles. PC titles like The Sims 3 can yield up to a 90% gross profit margin and owned console products typically yield 60% to 70% gross profit margins. Distribution, this includes third-party titles distributed by EA yielded in net margin, typically in the teen percent range. Digital, this is the aggregation of our online, global and digital products and services. The business units at scale in our portfolio like Pogo and Mobile have pro-forma operating margins of 20% or more.For fiscal '11, we are making the following assumptions. Sector. Our guidance is based on an assumption that total worldwide Packaged Goods will be down 3% in calendar year 2010. We are projecting continued robust growth in Digital of approximately 26%, which is expected to grow the composite sector by 8% for calendar 2010. While there is a possibility of software catalysts, including A, a strong industry title slate, B,  growth coming from the introduction of Microsoft and Sony motion controllers and C, growth coming from potential console price reductions in calendar '10, we are not counting on Packaged Goods software growth in our fiscal '11 plan.Total EA. We expect to end fiscal '10 with a total of approximately 8,120 headcount. We expect to end fiscal '11 with roughly the same total headcount. Total low-cost location headcount is increasing from approximately 21% or 1,800 pre-restructuring at the end of Q2 to 2,100 or 26% at the end of fiscal '11. For exchange rates, we are assuming $1.43 U.S. to the euro, $0.95 U.S. to the Canadian dollar and $1.60 U.S. to the British pound. Currency markets are still volatile, and our R&D costs will increase if the Canadian dollar strengthens.Packaged goods. Our fiscal '11 plan currently includes a total of 36 titles for the fiscal year versus 54 in fiscal '10. This number excludes expansion packs. Our top 20 titles for fiscal '11 are expected to generate approximately 80% of total non-distribution packaged goods revenue. This compares to an estimated 76% for the top 20 titles in fiscal '10. We have included a fiscal '11 title plan with our earnings press release, which details our principal titles, including digital games for console and PC. Our total variable marketing and advertising in fiscal '11 is an estimated $475 million to $495 million, which is comparable to the total amount for fiscal '10. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect fiscal '11 revenue from EA-published packaged goods titles to be between $2.75 billion to $3 billion, which reflects flat share at the middle of the range. Distribution. While we have great relationships with our partners, we are modeling the reduction in our Distribution business as we concentrate on higher margin EA-owned titles and digital initiatives. This will result in a $450 million year-over-year reduction in expected Distribution revenue.Digital. We are not assuming that we bring a major new MMO to market in fiscal '11. We will continue to incur significant development costs as we prepare this title for launch. In fiscal '11, we will continue to introduce new service and product features that benefit unique registered purchasers on PC and console games. Our most recent example is the Cerberus Content Network introduced with Mass Effect 2. We are planning a number of digital launches in fiscal '11, including Tiger Woods Online, going from beta to full launch, FIFA Online and Need for Speed World. We expect to launch a similar number of mobile and social network games compared to fiscal '10.We expect to grow our total Digital direct revenue by 30% or more from approximately $575 million in fiscal '10 to at least $750 million in fiscal '11. The year-over-year dollar growth is expected to be comprised of 1/4 from console full games and PDLC, 1/4 from PC and browser full games and PDLC, and 1/2 from games services and advertising, which includes Playfish, social games, Pogo, mobile and subscriptions.Q1 fiscal '11 guidance. Revenue. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenue of $710 million to $750 million. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenue of $460 million to $500 million. Q1 revenues down year-over-year as we are comparing to a Q1 last year that included The Sims 3 and EA SPORTS Active launches. The Q1 fiscal '11 title slate includes FIFA World Cup, Skate 3, Tiger PGA Tour and The Sims 3 expansion pack. There's a total of four front-line titles compared to 10 front-line titles last year. Looking at Q1 year-over-year, World Cup comp's active, and there are no Q1 fiscal '11 comps for Harry Potter and The Sims 3. Below the line, we expect GAAP EPS ranging from a loss per share of $0.05 to a profit of $0.05 per share. We expect non-GAAP loss per share of $0.35 to $0.40. Fiscal '11 full year guidance. Revenue. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenue of $3.45 billion to $3.7 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect total revenue of $3.65 billion to $3.9 billion. Breaking this down into three components, we expect Digital revenue of $750 million or more in fiscal '11. We expect approximately $160 million in Distribution revenue, which is a $450 million year-over-year decrease. And we expect Packaged Goods revenue ranging from approximately $2.75 billion to $3 billion. Gross margins. We expect GAAP gross profit margins of approximately 57% to 58% and non-GAAP gross profit margins of approximately 60%. Operating expenses. We expect GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.3 billion and non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $2 billion. Absolute non-GAAP operating expenses are down $100 million overall. On a like-on-like basis, operating expenses are down approximately $200 million year-over-year, if we adjust for the impact of foreign exchange, the assumption of full bonus and the impact of the Playfish expenses. The $200 million savings compares favorably to the $100 million net savings expectations we communicated when we announced our fiscal '10 restructuring plan. At the bottom line, we expect GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.60 to $0.90. We expect to be profitable and generate non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 to $0.70. We expect that non-GAAP other income and expense would be approximately $5 million. We expect our GAAP tax rate will continue to be volatile on an absolute dollar basis and subject to changes in the business or the tax laws. We expect tax expense ranging from $30 million to $40 million. We expect GAAP losses in fiscal '11, creating additional valuation allowances on U.S. deferred tax assets. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect to report taxes at 28%. For share count, please use 328 million shares to compute the GAAP loss per share and 330 million shares to compute non-GAAP EPS.Fiscal '11 revenue phasing. We currently expect the total of 36 front-line titles shipping in fiscal '11 versus 54 in fiscal '10. By quarter, we currently expect the following number of titles to ship in fiscal '11: Q1, four titles; Q2, nine titles; Q3, 14 titles; and Q4, nine titles. I'd like to remind everyone that last year's first fiscal quarter had unusually high revenue due to the launch schedule and the additional week of reported business. We expect fiscal '11's quarterly revenue phasing to be more consistent with prior years with non-GAAP revenue distributed as follows: Q1, approximately 30%; Q2, approximately 25%; Q3, approximately 40%; and Q4, approximately to 20% to 25%. This concludes our outlook and guidance. And with that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, John Schappert."

I'll start by highlighting three of our biggest titles in the current quarter. BioWare's Mass Effect 2 shipped January 26 on Xbox 360 and PC to record pre-orders and record-setting quality. 40 critics gave it a perfect 10, and the game launched with a Metacritic rating of 96. We backed it with a big marketing campaign, and we're very pleased with both the quality and consumer response on this one. We announced the shipment of 2 million copies and the early read on sell-through is strong. Dante's Inferno from our Visceral studio ships tomorrow, February 9, on PS3, Xbox 360 and PSP. We have another strong marketing campaign for Dante's, including our first ever Super Bowl ad, which aired yesterday. We saw more than 3 million downloads of our demo, pre-orders are tracking well, and we're eager for the launch this week.Battlefield: Bad Company 2 from our DICE studio ships March 2 on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC. Early feedback from critics has been very positive, and we're very excited about this title. Now I'd like to sketch some of the product highlights for fiscal '11. Included in our earnings release is a table that shows you most but not all of the titles we are planning for the fiscal year, as well as preliminary platform plans and estimated launch window. And while this list shows some of our big launches, it does not reflect the large and growing revenue we hope to see from digital opportunities like Playfish and mobile, from online games like FIFA Online, or from post-launch downloadable content we offer with most of our games. So while this list can then form your modeling, it is by no means a complete look at EA's overall opportunity. With that, here are a few highlights, starting with Q1. 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa, as fan excitement builds for the world's biggest sporting event, our game will feature all the teams from qualifying nations and authentic online tournament mode. Next, Skate 3 is an award-winning new franchise that has gone head to head with an old competitor, AND1. This year's Skate 3 will include a co-op skateboarding experience and online features that allow players to form teams and compete against rival crews. Also in Q1, is Tiger Woods PGA TOUR '11. I should also mention that our web-based Tiger Woods PGA TOUR online game recently one of the open beta and offers a terrific online experience.And finally, Need for Speed World is a web-based, open-world game with licensed cars, extensive game modes and a massive online environment. This game will launch in open beta in the quarter. In Q2, we are laying down some big bets with blockbusters from EA SPORTS and the EA Games label. I'll start with the North American flagships, NCAA Football 11 and Madden NFL 11, and of course, the world's most beautiful game, FIFA 11. We will also be bringing FIFA Online to the Western world, a totally web-based expense that has been extremely popular in Asian markets. And finally from EA SPORTS, the franchise that won so much recognition from critics, NHL 11. My final callout for Q2 is the return of Medal of Honor. This great franchise is leading World War II and taking players directly into today's war in Afghanistan. I saw the demo last week, and this one is shaping up to be terrific. Now on to Q3, our holiday quarter. EA SPORTS Active for the Wii was one of EA's most successful new franchises in 2009, will back in 2010 but this time across multiple platforms. Also from EA SPORTS in Q3, NBA Live 11, and you'll see the return of arcade favorite, NBA Jam. Next, one of the most anticipated new properties of the year, EA SPORTS MMA. Our mixed martial arts game will feature an array of the top fighters and fighting styles. Also in the holiday quarter, The Sims 3 is coming to console. we're also launching a new Harry Potter title, a new action based Need for Speed from our Criterion studio and several offerings for kids and families from our partnership with Hasbro.Another game for the holiday is Crysis 2 from our partners at Crytek. This is a publishing agreement with full EA margins, issued or based in New York City and is coming to both consoles and the PC. And finally, Q4, Winter of 2011 marks the chilling return of Dead Space, a highly rated, wholly owned the franchise, another big driving simulation from Need for Speed, a new shooter being developed by Epic studios and co-published by EA, and finally, something far-reaching from Mass Effect. That's a look at some of our big title launches for both packaged goods and online. In fiscal '11, everyone of EA's releases will have an online component, both downloadable content and online play. And don't forget that we have a full roster of titles coming from our online subscription site, pogo.com, from our mobile and iPhone group, and of course, our social gaming team, Playfish. That's a lot of exciting content and revenue opportunities coming through all three of our businesses, Packaged Goods, Digital and Distribution. With that, I'll turn the call back over to John."

First up, we do have data and research on the amount of time consumers are spending with games. And increasingly and importantly, they're spending more time with their console than they ever had before. So I don't think it's a consumer behavior issue if it's anything at all. And I do think it's fair to characterize 2009 as being a consequence of a relatively less powerful slate industrywide compared to 2008. I think the second factor, and I've pointed this before in 2009, was sort of a lack of aggressive pricing on first party, sort of if you will, a little bit too late with their price cuts, and frankly and broadly, the economic circumstance and if you will, the recession that hit in most Western markets or all Western markets. Net-net time, is up. The market was soft for the reasons I just identified. As we look to 2010, there's nothing that suggest that consumers aren't going to continue to increase use of their console. Relative to others that have provided guidance for the year, we've decided to be a little bit more conservative. And frankly, that's a function of the fact that we haven't seen enough data that suggest that the purchase behaviors are there yet in Spain. What makes us feel good about it, though, is if there's a strong slate, we've got a strong belief in new motion controllers. So there's reason to be optimistic. We just chose to not give, I think it's a better planning assumption to be more conservative here."

So I think it's fair to say that the Packaged Goods business, absent breakout hits, is a single-digit margin business, at least the way they see it.

And first observation is our costs are very competitive, it's not lower for like/unlike quality. The second thing is what's in this business for leverage? Our goal with few of the better is to drive to higher positions on the charts. And I'll give you two reference points. Same title plan, any one title breaking at an extra million and half units is about $0.10 EPS. So that's one title breaking can add about $0.10 in EPS. We're referring to like Need for Speed at its peak, that could be as much $0.30 to $0.40 EPS delta, given that it had done in the past as many as 4.5 million to 6 million units higher. And that's the key title we're driving to push up in the charts. Put another way, same title plan, one market share point, that's roughly $0.25 EPS. To give you a sense of the world we're working in, we think we've got our costs down tight. We think our cost per title is very competitive, and again, on the aggressively tight side of the equation, and what we're driving for now is using quality to drive leverage in the P&L by pushing it up further in the chart."

You'll see that pricing is higher this cycle than last cycle. And compared to last cycle, retail pricing is holding at least as well as it did in the last cycle. If you actually study the individual press announcements, retail price announcements, promotions, et cetera, that were run by major retailers, you would see that we're probably getting to this lower pricing or the discounting you're referring to in a slightly different way than it happened in the last cycle. In the last cycle, which you saw by this point in the cycle, is frontline pricing for all that the biggest titles already break by $10. That hasn't happened in this cycle. What's happened in this cycle thus far is frontline pricing is holding, but then once it's in the market place, it's getting discounted more quickly than it did before. That's a slight difference in behavior. It can have -- I understand how that could make it look like there's ramp at discounting. But again, last cycle, what we saw was actually price reductions so there weren't as many discounts that took place against as price reductions. All in all, I think the analysis shows or the data shows that pricing's holding pretty well."

And while it's very difficult to point to a particular ad, break even against 50,000 units, given the strong results we saw with Mass Effect, seems like something that almost certainly occurred. We did a similar investment yesterday with Dante and we saw a similar spike, but it was our own internal metrics or metrics like where you stand on the charts on Amazon pre-orders. So some really good statistics to suggest these things are working well for us. And so with Eric's point, frontline feels pretty good in Q4. In terms of the SPORTS franchises, FIFA pre-digital is up sharply year-over-year. And Madden, as John indicated in his prepared comments, after starting week, has continued to make progress week-to-week, virtually every week and it's up on the core consoles, which seems a strong performance from NHL this year, and I would make that point sort of independent of Digital, which is adding to the totals and adding to the top line. So we feel pretty good about our SPORTS portfolio. One area where we want to see a pickup in the coming fiscal year, and we'll be talking about that at a later call, is an innovation we have across the range and then in particular in NBA Live, where we'd like to make progress versus the competition."

I think as a starting point, we're probably at the lower end of the range for what most people are going to guide to for packaged goods sector performance in calendar '10. Our minus three result though is probably not inconsistent with what's going to happen in January. So at least in January, where we've indicated -- but yes, there's 11 months to go and the lion's share is going to take place in the fall. As I think we mentioned, we see some titles have the potential for breakout. My way of thinking about it is, on a label-by-label basis, SPORTS has got net plus titles year-over-year in the form of MMA, and a broader base on Active against platforms. The game's label sort of swaps one title for another, it's neither up nor down on a 12-month basis in terms of its title slate. And The Sims label, basically, swaps out on console for PC lunch at the highest level. Yes, we loss one movie title in the form of G.I. Joe. That was a relatively modest performer for us in this past fiscal year. And we're adding a multi-platform MySims title and then a second Sims title in the year. So when we look at that portfolio, we've guided that to be flat. If there are significant breakouts, we would see market share growth, but we haven't assumed that in our model. And if I were to point to things that I think have potential to break out, that are not counting on as breakouts, that would include sort of Medal of Honor, Crysis, Sims console and perhaps a few other titles. I'm really bullish about Dead Space 2 in the fourth quarter."

The second point is, and this is something that might be fun to look at, I often like to look at things over a longer period. And just the last week of the month or quarter, '03 to '09, I think if you're just to pick a cycle as opposed to [ph] we are now, the top three in top 30 are 2x if not 3x larger in the business. So a few of it better [ph] is designed to finish further up in those charts and benefit from that. And lastly, I think it's really early on in this Q to give you a revenue for downloadable content across the full range of our products. But I will give you these indicators. In many cases, the number can be double digits, like north of $10. But those are typically isolated circumstances where that occurs with a game. Across the weighted average of our portfolio, I would like to see it to get to that. But it's certainly nowhere near that on our FY '11 model. It's in that $2 range. That's a gigantic pickup from zero. That is essentially brand new ARPU, and it's part of our digital growth story. I see lots of reasons to believe that will move north over time. And as I was trying to say, it could have been in a broad or many way how people can interpret or misinterpret the packaged goods business. I would say EA strategy is fewer but bigger and higher ARPU. Two of it, bigger drives revenue per title at the retail level and/or download, if that model develops more fully over time. In all the PDLC and stuff that we get on the back end, that's ARPU against each desk [ph]. And so that's what we're seeking to do.

An observation about F '10. We, too, are disappointed with the F '10 results. We guided at the beginning of F '10, the 7% top-line growth for the sector, and it ended up being roughly minus 10, 17-point split. And our most recent guidance for the fiscal year versus original was 4 3 and we're 4 1 in our most recent guidance. So we're adhering top line much, much better than the sector overall, which is reflective in the fact that our fiscal year-to-date market shares are up and projected to be up through the fiscal year. I would say that our biggest challenge on visibility in fiscal '10 was at the sector level. We've pretty much charted where we thought. Our expenses came in as we thought. Our business performed at the market share level as we thought. We delivered the titles that we said we would deliver with extreme fidelity. What we missed was the top line, which was driven primarily by factors related to the sector. And for what its worth, even making up half the revenue forecast loss at the sector level. And having that play in the EA, we would have made our plans. So it's a tough one. So it's a tough one. I don't know that we were alone in forecasting the industry off in calendar year '09. It was a very frustrating and challenging experience for us. As we look into fiscal '10, I only hope that we're as accurate as we have been on our title slip versus non-title slips, the quality of our games, the windows that we had in the market share that we achieved because we nailed it with almost perfect accuracy in '09. So the key question for me is more about the sector level. At this point, we think minus three is the best assumption going in. We also noted that we're sensitive to that assumption. 5%, neither direction is a little bit North of $0.20. So it's a very, very important assumption for us. By the way, it's about the same for -- impact is a one share, one market share point. In terms of the 5%, what's underperforming or over performing in the packaged goods portfolio, what we've gotten to now is 36 major titles. I think if you did sort of a study of our business until you got major breakout hits, that makes up a significant portion of your portfolio, single-digit returns is fairly typical. On pure Packaged Goods businesses, it has -- and our goal this year is to break out and drive above that. We've identified in quarters past and years past that our biggest deficit coming out of the fiscal -- for the fiscal '04, '05 console transition was that we basically had lost Lord of the Rings, Bond, Medal of Honor and we were down on Need for Speed. And where we're going now is we're replacing that with Dragon Age, Mass Effect, back the Medal of Honor, growth on Need for Speed. So our goal is to replace that and get back in the double-digit strongly. We're not guiding to it because we're waiting for it to happen first."

On today's call, I'll begin with brief comments in our progress, Eric will review the Q3 results and review our guidance in detail. John Schappert will provide an operations update, and then we'll take your questions.Let me start with an update on EA's execution framed against the four strategic initiatives we have identified as crucial to our long-term growth and profitability. First, product quality. In calendar '09, we shipped 19 titles with a Metacritic rating of 80 or better, the next best third-party publisher shipped only six. We also just shipped Mass Effect 2 with a Metacritic rating of 96, one of the highest-rated games ever released on Xbox 360. EA is clearly the quality leader among multi-platform publishers. I believe this is a significant driver in the fact that EA has gained share, fiscal year to date.Second, creating hits in core packaged goods. We're very proud that both Madden and FIFA remained at the top of the charts again in calendar '09. We're also pleased that we've established two new eyepiece, a sequel-ready successes so far this fiscal year in Dragon Age and EA SPORTS Active, that our recent win with Mass Effect suggests these three titles can be sequel successfully in the future.Third, our investment in Digital revenue stream meeting, and in many cases, exceeding our own high expectations. We achieved a record $152 million in quarterly non-GAAP net revenue in Q3. This brings us to 30% growth in Digital revenue in fiscal year to date. Our overall Digital business is now at scale over $500 million annually, growing very rapidly and profitable.Lastly, operating efficiencies. In the past two years, we have dramatically lowered headcount despite acquisitions and the addition of multiple Digital business models. Our operating costs are expected to be down on FY '10 versus FY '09, and down even further in FY '11. With that, I will turn it over to Eric."

First, EA's Q3 together with our guidance for Q4 is at the lower end of the range we guided on January 11. While we are very pleased with the performance per title so far in the fourth quarter, we remain cautious in the packaged goods market that remains soft overall and hit driven. Second, our guidance for F '11 is framed by three major considerations. While we see reasons for optimism for the packaged goods sector, we believe using a minus 3% rate for the sector is a better planning assumption. We've made the call to deemphasize low-margin distribution in our FY '11 guidance, which reduces top line revenue but has limited effect in earnings. While there may be the occasional distribution deal that meets our criteria going forward, part of our mantra, fewer and bigger, since the recognition that tighter focus will yield better results. Lastly, we note that we've built a plan around an expense base that is approximately $100 million lower in F '11 than F '10 and like-on-like, adjusting for foreign exchange bonus and Playfish run rate is approximately $200 million lower on a non-GAAP basis.By driving down expenses aggressively, we're able to guide to non-GAAP EPS growth of 40% at the mid-point of our guidance range, while maintaining a realistic stance on the packaged goods sector. I will now provide industry comments and then turn to EA results. For Western markets overall, the packaged goods sector was down 9% in the quarter versus expectations of a flat quarter. Both North America and Europe were down 9%. Europe's biggest market, the U.K., was down 16% year-over-year.In the quarter, Sony PS3 hardware sales increased 48% year-over-year, Wii hardware sales decreased 2% year-over-year, while Xbox 360 hardware sales declined 21% year-over-year. Hardware sales responded to price promotions, particularly the Wii in North America with Wal-Mart promoting the Wii at an effective $149 price point. In North America, concentration of sales in the top titles continued, with the top 20 titles in calendar Q4 '09, representing 48% share in dollars versus 37% share in calendar Q4 '06.For the global market including Asia, we estimate that total packaged goods represented approximately 60% of the overall software market for calendar 2009, while total Digital, consisting of mobile and online, was approximately 40%. While packaged goods were down 9% in calendar '09, we estimate that total Digital increased by approximately 28%, growing the combination of packaged goods plus Digital by 3% year-over-year.EA's fiscal third quarter results were in line with the update we provided on our January 11, 2010 call. Non-GAAP net revenue was $1.346 billion, short of our going-in expectations due to a soft December for EA and the weak overall packaged goods sector. We also experienced product mix shift to lower margin distribution titles in the December quarter in North America. On a GAAP basis, net revenue was $1.243 billion. At constant currency rates, net revenue decreased $435 million or 25% year-over-year. The primary cause of change year-over-year was the greater number of front-line titles like Need for Speed, Mirror's Edge and Dead Space in Q3 fiscal '09.In our Packaged Goods business, FIFA 10 sold through over 7 million copies at retail in the quarter for Europe and North America combined, and launched with a Metacritic rating of 91 on the PS3 and Xbox 360. In Europe, it was the number two title across all platforms in the quarter, and the number two title in calendar '09. Madden NFL 10 sold through over 2.3 million copies at retail in the quarter. In North America, Madden NFL 10 charted number four overall in calendar '09. Year-over-year, Madden sales in all platforms combined continue to close the gap in North America from minus 17% through Q2 to minus 6% through the end of Q3. Our core platforms, PS3 and Xbox 360, are up 15% on a cumulative basis.Dragon Age: Origins was a key front-line title for the quarter. It sold in 2.7 million copies worldwide on the PC, PS3 and Xbox 360 platforms, and received a Metacritic rating of 88 across all platforms. In our Distribution business, Left 4 Dead 2 in partnership with Valve exceeded our expectations with 2.9 million copies sold in worldwide on the PC and Xbox 360 during the holiday quarter, and it charted in the top 10 in North America according to NPD. In our Digital business, FIFA 10 with its innovative Ultimate Team mode, Dragon Age premium digital content, Battlefield 1943 and The Sims Store all performed well in the quarter. Pogo continues to be the number one online game site worldwide in terms of user engagement. We started recognizing Playfish revenue in the fiscal third quarter. During Q3, we had two of the top 10 Facebook games.We continue to be the number one mobile games provider in Western markets. We had seven of the top 11 games in December for the iPhone and four of the top five selling games for 2009. EA had seven of the top 10 games on Verizon during the quarter, and achieved over 50% of the top 10 games on AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile.We had 1.9 million total subscribers in the quarter. This includes Pogo, as well as massively multi-player online or MMO subscribers. We finished the quarter with 49 million registered users, and our central user identity management system up 16% from the prior quarter. This includes console and PC users. Performance by Digital business model included the following for the quarter: We achieved another record quarter with $152 million in non-GAAP Digital net revenue, up 30% year-over-year; Mobile revenue was $57 million, up 14% year-over-year; Digital revenue from all other non-mobile sources was $95 million for the quarter, up 42% year-over-year. This includes full game downloads, PC and console premium downloadable content or PDLC, browser games, subscriptions, social games and advertising.Moving to the rest of the income statement, non-GAAP gross profit margin was 51.6% versus 47.1% a year ago. This is up from the prior year due to a greater mix of published titles. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $540 million, down $47 million or 8% year-over-year. Total bonus accrued as of the end of Q3 is $54 million compared with $43 million through Q3 last year. Total variable market expense in the quarter was $149 million compared with $187 million in the same quarter last year, which is in line with a different title plan where we had more front-line releases last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $154 million versus non-GAAP operating income of $234 million a year ago.Below the operating income line, non-GAAP other income and expense was negative $2 million versus positive $14 million a year ago. This reduction is due to lower cash balances and the $7 million adverse foreign currency movement compared to a year ago. On a GAAP basis, we recorded a tax benefit of $28 million, primarily due to a reduction in our deferred tax valuation allowance related to the change in U.S. tax law for tax laws secured backs. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported taxes at 28%. GAAP diluted loss per share was $0.25 versus a diluted loss per share of $2 a year ago. Last year, we recorded a significant goodwill impairment and tax valuation allowance charge in Q3. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.33 versus diluted earnings per share of $0.56 a year ago. In Q3, we generated $221 million of operating cash flow versus $212 million a year ago. Fiscal year to date, our operating cash flow improved by $102 million versus last year. We ended the quarter with 8,537 employees versus 9,760 a year ago. 20% of our employees are now in low-cost locations versus 17% a year ago.Turning to the balance sheet, cash and short-term investments were approximately $1.466 billion at quarter end, down approximately $159 million from last quarter, primarily due to the acquisition of Playfish. Marketable equity securities was $318 million, down $69 million from last quarter, primarily due to the sale of benign shares and a decline in the value of our Ubisoft investment. At quarter end, we had $179 million of net unrealized gains on investments. Gross accounts receivable were $762 million, down $335 million from last year or down 31%. DSOs were 51 days versus 57 last year. Reserves against outstanding receivables totaled $267 million, down $36 million from a year ago. Reserve levels were 8% of trailing nine-month non-GAAP revenue versus 9% a year ago.Inventory was $144 million, down $151 million from a year ago. Ending deferred net revenue from Packaged Goods and Digital Content was $895 million, up $383 million from a year ago due to the additional deferral for all console and online-enabled PC games. Restructuring update. Our restructuring plan is on track. During Q3, we recorded $96 million of restructuring expense for our fiscal '10 restructuring plan of the estimated total amount of $150 million to $155 million. We closed five locations and are approximately 2/3 complete with position reductions at the end of January 2010.Now to our outlook for Q4 fiscal '10. Revenue. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenue of $925 million to $1 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenue of $800 million to $850 million. Operating expenses. We expect GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $625 million to $640 million and non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $520 million to $535 million. Below the line, we expect GAAP diluted EPS of $0.05 to $0.23. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.02 to $0.06. For taxes, we expect a GAAP tax expense of approximately $0 million to $10 million, excluding the impact of tax-related charges that may arise in connection with the Playfish integration. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect to report taxes at 28%. For share count, please use 328 million shares to compute both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS.FY '11 outlook and guidance. As we go through our fiscal '11 guidance, we will refer to three principal lines of business. First, packaged goods, this includes higher margin EA-owned titles and co-published titles. PC titles like The Sims 3 can yield up to a 90% gross profit margin and owned console products typically yield 60% to 70% gross profit margins. Distribution, this includes third-party titles distributed by EA yielded in net margin, typically in the teen percent range. Digital, this is the aggregation of our online, global and digital products and services. The business units at scale in our portfolio like Pogo and Mobile have pro-forma operating margins of 20% or more.For fiscal '11, we are making the following assumptions. Sector. Our guidance is based on an assumption that total worldwide Packaged Goods will be down 3% in calendar year 2010. We are projecting continued robust growth in Digital of approximately 26%, which is expected to grow the composite sector by 8% for calendar 2010. While there is a possibility of software catalysts, including A, a strong industry title slate, B,  growth coming from the introduction of Microsoft and Sony motion controllers and C, growth coming from potential console price reductions in calendar '10, we are not counting on Packaged Goods software growth in our fiscal '11 plan.Total EA. We expect to end fiscal '10 with a total of approximately 8,120 headcount. We expect to end fiscal '11 with roughly the same total headcount. Total low-cost location headcount is increasing from approximately 21% or 1,800 pre-restructuring at the end of Q2 to 2,100 or 26% at the end of fiscal '11. For exchange rates, we are assuming $1.43 U.S. to the euro, $0.95 U.S. to the Canadian dollar and $1.60 U.S. to the British pound. Currency markets are still volatile, and our R&D costs will increase if the Canadian dollar strengthens.Packaged goods. Our fiscal '11 plan currently includes a total of 36 titles for the fiscal year versus 54 in fiscal '10. This number excludes expansion packs. Our top 20 titles for fiscal '11 are expected to generate approximately 80% of total non-distribution packaged goods revenue. This compares to an estimated 76% for the top 20 titles in fiscal '10. We have included a fiscal '11 title plan with our earnings press release, which details our principal titles, including digital games for console and PC. Our total variable marketing and advertising in fiscal '11 is an estimated $475 million to $495 million, which is comparable to the total amount for fiscal '10. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect fiscal '11 revenue from EA-published packaged goods titles to be between $2.75 billion to $3 billion, which reflects flat share at the middle of the range. Distribution. While we have great relationships with our partners, we are modeling the reduction in our Distribution business as we concentrate on higher margin EA-owned titles and digital initiatives. This will result in a $450 million year-over-year reduction in expected Distribution revenue.Digital. We are not assuming that we bring a major new MMO to market in fiscal '11. We will continue to incur significant development costs as we prepare this title for launch. In fiscal '11, we will continue to introduce new service and product features that benefit unique registered purchasers on PC and console games. Our most recent example is the Cerberus Content Network introduced with Mass Effect 2. We are planning a number of digital launches in fiscal '11, including Tiger Woods Online, going from beta to full launch, FIFA Online and Need for Speed World. We expect to launch a similar number of mobile and social network games compared to fiscal '10.We expect to grow our total Digital direct revenue by 30% or more from approximately $575 million in fiscal '10 to at least $750 million in fiscal '11. The year-over-year dollar growth is expected to be comprised of 1/4 from console full games and PDLC, 1/4 from PC and browser full games and PDLC, and 1/2 from games services and advertising, which includes Playfish, social games, Pogo, mobile and subscriptions.Q1 fiscal '11 guidance. Revenue. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenue of $710 million to $750 million. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect revenue of $460 million to $500 million. Q1 revenue is down year-over-year as we are comparing to a Q1 last year that included The Sims 3 and EA SPORTS Active launches. The Q1 fiscal '11 title slate includes FIFA World Cup, Skate 3, Tiger PGA Tour and The Sims 3 expansion pack. There's a total of four front-line titles compared to 10 front-line titles last year. Looking at Q1 year-over-year, World Cup comp's active, and there are no Q1 fiscal '11 comps for Harry Potter and The Sims 3. Below the line, we expect GAAP EPS ranging from a loss per share of $0.05 to a profit of $0.05 per share. We expect non-GAAP loss per share of $0.35 to $0.40. Fiscal '11 full year guidance. Revenue. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenue of $3.45 billion to $3.7 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect total revenue of $3.65 billion to $3.9 billion. Breaking this down into three components, we expect Digital revenue of $750 million or more in fiscal '11. We expect approximately $160 million in Distribution revenue, which is a $450 million year-over-year decrease. And we expect Packaged Goods revenue ranging from approximately $2.75 billion to $3 billion. Gross margins. We expect GAAP gross profit margins of approximately 57% to 58% and non-GAAP gross profit margins of approximately 60%. Operating expenses. We expect GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.3 billion and non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $2 billion. Absolute non-GAAP operating expenses are down $100 million overall. On a like-on-like basis, operating expenses are down approximately $200 million year-over-year, if we adjust for the impact of foreign exchange, the assumption of full bonus and the impact of the Playfish expenses. The $200 million savings compares favorably to the $100 million net savings expectations we communicated when we announced our fiscal '10 restructuring plan. At the bottom line, we expect GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.60 to $0.90. We expect to be profitable and generate non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 to $0.70. We expect that non-GAAP other income and expense would be approximately $5 million. We expect our GAAP tax rate will continue to be volatile on an absolute dollar basis and subject to changes in the business or the tax laws. We expect tax expense ranging from $30 million to $40 million. We expect GAAP losses in fiscal '11, creating additional valuation allowances on U.S. deferred tax assets. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect to report taxes at 28%. For share count, please use 328 million shares to compute the GAAP loss per share and 330 million shares to compute non-GAAP EPS.Fiscal '11 revenue phasing. We currently expect the total of 36 front-line titles shipping in fiscal '11 versus 54 in fiscal '10. By quarter, we currently expect the following number of titles to ship in fiscal '11: Q1, four titles; Q2, nine titles; Q3, 14 titles; and Q4, nine titles. I'd like to remind everyone that last year's first fiscal quarter had unusually high revenue due to the launch schedule and the additional week of reported business. We expect fiscal '11's quarterly revenue phasing to be more consistent with prior years with non-GAAP revenue distributed as follows: Q1, approximately 30%; Q2, approximately 25%; Q3, approximately 40%; and Q4, approximately to 20% to 25%. This concludes our outlook and guidance. And with that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, John Schappert."

I'll start by highlighting three of our biggest titles in the current quarter. BioWare's Mass Effect 2 shipped January 26 on Xbox 360 and PC to record pre-orders and record-setting quality. 40 critics gave it a perfect 10, and the game launched with a Metacritic rating of 96. We backed it with a big marketing campaign, and we're very pleased with both the quality and consumer response on this one. We announced the shipment of 2 million copies and the early read on sell-through is strong. Dante's Inferno from our Visceral studio ships tomorrow, February 9, on PS3, Xbox 360 and PSP. We have another strong marketing campaign for Dante's, including our first ever Super Bowl ad, which aired yesterday. We saw more than 3 million downloads of our demo, pre-orders are tracking well and we're eager for the launch this week.Battlefield: Bad Company 2 from our DICE Studio ships March 2 on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC. Early feedback from critics has been very positive, and we're very excited about this title. Now I'd like to sketch some of the product highlights for fiscal '11. Included in our earnings release is a table that shows you most, but not all of the titles we are planning for the fiscal year, as well as preliminary platform plans and estimated launch window. And while this list shows some of our big launches, it does not reflect the large and growing revenue we hope to see from digital opportunities like Playfish and mobile, from online games like FIFA Online, or from post-launch downloadable content we offer with most of our games. So while this list can inform your modeling, it is by no means a complete look at EA's overall opportunity. With that, here are a few highlights, starting with Q1. 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa, as fan excitement builds for the world's biggest sporting event, our game will feature all the teams from qualifying nations and authentic online tournament mode. Next, Skate 3 is an award-winning new franchise that has gone head to head with an old competitor, AND1 [ph]. This year's Skate 3 will include a co-op skateboarding experience and online features that allow players to form teams and compete against rival crews. Also in Q1, is Tiger Woods PGA TOUR '11. I should also mention that our web-based Tiger Woods PGA TOUR online game recently went into open beta, and offers a terrific online experience.And finally, Need for Speed World is a web-based, open-world game with licensed cars, extensive game modes and a massive online environment. This game will launch in open beta in the quarter. In Q2, we are laying down some big bets with blockbusters from EA SPORTS and the EA Games label. I'll start with the North American flagships, NCAA Football 11 and Madden NFL 11, and of course, the world's most beautiful game, FIFA 11. We will also be bringing FIFA Online to the Western world, a totally web-based expense that has been extremely popular in Asian markets. And finally from EA SPORTS, the franchise that won so much recognition from critics, NHL 11. My final callout for Q2 is the return of Medal of Honor. This great franchise is leading World War II and taking players directly into today's war in Afghanistan. I saw the demo last week, and this one is shaping up to be terrific. Now on to Q3, our holiday quarter. EA SPORTS Active for the Wii was one of EA's most successful new franchises in 2009, will back in 2010 but this time across multiple platforms. Also from EA SPORTS in Q3, NBA Live 11, and you'll see the return of arcade favorite, NBA Jam. Next, one of the most anticipated new properties of the year, EA SPORTS MMA. Our mixed martial arts game will feature an array of the top fighters and fighting styles. Also in the holiday quarter, The Sims 3 is coming to console. we're also launching a new Harry Potter title, a new action based Need for Speed from our Criterion studio and several offerings for kids and families from our partnership with Hasbro.Another game for the holiday is Crysis 2 from our partners at Crytek. This is a publishing agreement with full EA margins, issued or based in New York City and is coming to both consoles and the PC. And finally, Q4, Winter of 2011 marks the chilling return of Dead Space, a highly rated, wholly owned the franchise, another big driving simulation from Need for Speed, a new shooter being developed by Epic studios and co-published by EA, and finally, something far-reaching from Mass Effect. That's a look at some of our big title launches for both packaged goods and online. In fiscal '11, everyone of EA's releases will have an online component, both downloadable content and online play. And don't forget that we have a full roster of titles coming from our online subscription site, pogo.com, from our mobile and iPhone group, and of course, our social gaming team, Playfish. That's a lot of exciting content and revenue opportunities coming through all three of our businesses, Packaged Goods, Digital and Distribution. With that, I'll turn the call back over to John."

We have an outstanding portfolio of IP that is getting stronger with the addition of Dragon Age, Mass Effect, EA SPORTS Active and the reinvigoration of key franchises like Need for Speed, Battlefield and FIFA. And while EA's IP portfolio was described by some as tired a few short years ago, it has now a major competitive advantage. Our Packaged Goods business is performing. We have gained market share this fiscal year as a result of great quality and improved marketing. In fiscal '11, we believe titles like Medal of Honor, Crysis 2, Dead Space, The Sims 3 on console and others have break-out potential. We have a profitable scale Digital business that recently hit the $500 million threshold. Our Digital business is growing at 30% and is projected to break through three quarters at $1 billion in fiscal '11. We have programs in place that should take just to well beyond $1 billion in the coming two fiscal years. John, Eric and I will now be happy to take your questions."

First up, we do have data and research on the amount of time consumers are spending with games. And increasingly and importantly, they're spending more time with their console than they ever had before. So I don't think it's a consumer behavior issue if it's anything at all. And I do think it's fair to characterize 2009 as being a consequence of a relatively less powerful slate industrywide compared to 2008. I think the second factor, and I've pointed this before in 2009, was sort of a lack of aggressive pricing on first party, sort of if you will, a little bit too late with their price cuts, and frankly and broadly, the economic circumstance and if you will, the recession that hit in most Western markets or all Western markets. Net-net time, is up. The market was soft for the reasons I just identified. As we look to 2010, there's nothing that suggest that consumers aren't going to continue to increase use of their console. Relative to others that have provided guidance for the year, we've decided to be a little bit more conservative. And frankly, that's a function of the fact that we haven't seen enough data that suggest that the purchase behaviors are there yet in Spain. What makes us feel good about it, though, is if there's a strong slate, we've got a strong belief in new motion controllers. So there's reason to be optimistic. We just chose to not give, I think it's a better planning assumption to be more conservative here."

That's not to say though that every other line of business within the overall Digital portfolio is at 20%. So you can't take, 5 75 for this year or 7 50 for next year, times 20% necessarily. I think it's important to understand the profitability of these businesses if they get to critical mass. The second part of your question regards to Playfish. We're not going to specifically mention upcoming titles. But back when we announced the Playfish acquisition in November, we said quite clearly that one, we were acquiring a pre-existing, owned IP portfolio from a great set of developers.

I know you don't want one more answer to this, but I got to give you a perspective because I think, Colin, implicit in your question is a little bit about what kind of margin leverage is there in the business. And I think and I'd like to address that a little bit. So I think it's fair to say that the Packaged Goods business, absent breakout hits, is a single-digit margin business, at least the way they see it. When we study the business very carefully and look at we're investing in R&D frontline titles, we've got a great view of the industry because we see the cause of a lot of our partners, external developers with no corporate healthcare [ph] et cetera. And first observation is our costs are very competitive, it's not lower for like/unlike quality. The second thing is what's in this business for leverage? Our goal with few of the better is to drive to higher positions on the charts. And I'll give you two reference points. Same title plan, any one title breaking at an extra million and half units is about $0.10 EPS. So that's one title breaking can add about $0.10 in EPS. We're referring to like Need for Speed at its peak, that could be as much $0.30 to $0.40 EPS delta, given that it had done in the past as many as 4.5 million to 6 million units higher. And that's the key title we're driving to push up in the charts. Put another way, same title plan, one market share point, that's roughly $0.25 EPS. To give you a sense of the world we're working in, we think we've got our costs down tight. We think our cost per title is very competitive, and again, on the aggressively tight side of the equation, and what we're driving for now is using quality to drive leverage in the P&L by pushing it up further in the chart."

So we can't describe our plans to moderate influence or adjust pricing on a pro forma future basis. We just can't go there. We're well advised on that front. What I would point you to if you want to understand this particular phenomenon better would be to compare of any sort of long-range top 10, top 20, top 30, you-pick-your-top range, and you will see the following things. You'll see that pricing is higher this cycle than last cycle. And compared to last cycle, retail pricing is holding at least as well as it did in the last cycle. If you actually study the individual press announcements, retail price announcements, promotions, et cetera, that were run by major retailers, you would see that we're probably getting to this lower pricing or the discounting you're referring to in a slightly different way than it happened in the last cycle. In the last cycle, which you saw by this point in the cycle, is frontline pricing for all that the biggest titles already break by $10. That hasn't happened in this cycle. What's happened in this cycle thus far is frontline pricing is holding, but then once it's in the market place, it's getting discounted more quickly than it did before. That's a slight difference in behavior. It can have -- I understand how that could make it look like there's ramp at discounting. But again, last cycle, what we saw was actually price reductions so there weren't as many discounts that took place against as price reductions. All in all, I think the analysis shows or the data shows that pricing's holding pretty well."

One of the things that sort of an interesting is we brought forward fairly high-profile marketing programs for both Mass Effect and for Dante. We advertise in both the AFC and FC Championship Games with the Mass Effect and we saw immediate response in terms of almost every metric we track. And as a perspective, those investments took about 50,000 units to break even. And while it's very difficult to point to a particular ad, break even against 50,000 units, given the strong results we saw with Mass Effect, seems like something that almost certainly occurred. We did a similar investment yesterday with Dante and we saw a similar spike, but it was our own internal metrics or metrics like where you stand on the charts on Amazon pre-orders. So some really good statistics to suggest these things are working well for us. And so with Eric's point, frontline feels pretty good in Q4. In terms of the SPORTS franchises, FIFA pre-digital is up sharply year-over-year. And Madden, as John indicated in his prepared comments, after starting weak, has continued to make progress week-to-week, virtually every week and it's up on the core consoles. We’ve seen a strong performance from NHL this year, and I would make that point sort of independent of Digital, which is adding to the totals and adding to the top line. So we feel pretty good about our SPORTS portfolio. One area where we want to see a pickup in the coming fiscal year, and we'll be talking about that at a later call, is an innovation we have across a range, and then in particular in NBA Live, where we'd like to make progress versus the competition."

And then in terms of Star Wars, I agree with -- we may have been asked that similar question about trying to normal -- get a better grip inside that number. And we really don't think we can go further than we already have, which is a significant cost. MMOs can cost as much as 2x to 6x, 7x as much as a frontline title, if they're done right.

I think as a starting point, we're probably at the lower end of the range for what most people are going to guide to for packaged goods sector performance in calendar '10. Our minus three result though is probably not inconsistent with what's going to happen in January. So at least in January, where we've indicated -- but yes, there's 11 months to go and the lion's share is going to take place in the fall. As I think we mentioned, we see some titles have the potential for breakout. My way of thinking about it is, on a label-by-label basis, SPORTS has got net plus titles year-over-year in the form of MMA, and a broader base on Active against platforms. The game's label sort of swaps one title for another, it's neither up nor down on a 12-month basis in terms of its title slate. And The Sims label, basically, swaps out on console for PC lunch at the highest level. Yes, we loss one movie title in the form of G.I. Joe. That was a relatively modest performer for us in this past fiscal year. And we're adding a multi-platform MySims title and then a second Sims title in the year. So when we look at that portfolio, we've guided that to be flat. If there are significant breakouts, we would see market share growth, but we haven't assumed that in our model. And if I were to point to things that I think have potential to break out, that are not counting on as breakouts, that would include sort of Medal of Honor, Crysis, Sims console and perhaps a few other titles. I'm really bullish about Dead Space 2 in the fourth quarter."

And maybe even put that within the context -- the answer that you gave at the beginning of the call about the consoles being used is one thing. I mean, time is one thing, but they're being used for an awful lot of other things, and none of the video games guys are getting much revenue, also some net sites [ph] being downstream, TSM for instance. So what I'm trying to get at is how you compensate for that, and maybe talk about that within that ARPU context?"

The second point is, and this is something that might be fun to look at, I often like to look at things over a longer period. And just the last week of the month or quarter, '03 to '09, I think if you're just to pick a cycle as opposed to [ph] we are now, the top three in top 30 are 2x if not 3x larger in the business. So a few of it better [ph] is designed to finish further up in those charts and benefit from that. And lastly, I think it's really early on in this Q to give you a revenue for downloadable content across the full range of our products. But I will give you these indicators. In many cases, the number can be double digits, like north of $10. But those are typically isolated circumstances where that occurs with a game. Across the weighted average of our portfolio, I would like to see it to get to that. But it's certainly nowhere near that on our FY '11 model. It's in that $2 range. That's a gigantic pickup from zero. That is essentially brand new ARPU, and it's part of our digital growth story. I see lots of reasons to believe that will move north over time. And as I was trying to say, it could have been in a broad or many way how people can interpret or misinterpret the packaged goods business. I would say EA strategy is fewer but bigger and higher ARPU. Two of it, bigger drives revenue per title at the retail level and/or download, if that model develops more fully over time. In all the PDLC and stuff that we get on the back end, that's ARPU against each desk [ph]. And so that's what we're seeking to do.

The first one shows a visibility, an observation about F '10. And we, too, are disappointed with the F '10 results. We guided at the beginning of F '10, the 7% top-line growth for the sector, and it ended up being roughly minus 10, 1",543,"A couple of thoughts. The first one shows a visibility, an observation about F '10. And we, too, are disappointed with the F '10 results. We guided at the beginning of F '10, the 7% top-line growth for the sector, and it ended up being roughly minus 10, 17-point split. And our most recent guidance for the fiscal year versus original was 4 3 and we're 4 1 in our most recent guidance. So we're adhering top line much, much better than the sector overall, which is reflective in the fact that our fiscal year-to-date market shares are up and projected to be up through the fiscal year. I would say that our biggest challenge on visibility in fiscal '10 was at the sector level. We've pretty much charted where we thought. Our expenses came in as we thought. Our business performed at the market share level as we thought. We delivered the titles that we said we would deliver with extreme fidelity. What we missed was the top line, which was driven primarily by factors related to the sector. And for what its worth, even making up half the revenue forecast loss at the sector level. And having that play in the EA, we would have made our plans. So it's a tough one. So it's a tough one. I don't know that we were alone in forecasting the industry off in calendar year '09. It was a very frustrating and challenging experience for us. As we look into fiscal '10, I only hope that we're as accurate as we have been on our title slip versus non-title slips, the quality of our games, the windows that we had in the market share that we achieved because we nailed it with almost perfect accuracy in '09. So the key question for me is more about the sector level. At this point, we think minus three is the best assumption going in. We also noted that we're sensitive to that assumption. 5%, neither direction is a little bit North of $0.20. So it's a very, very important assumption for us. By the way, it's about the same for -- impact is a one share, one market share point. In terms of the 5%, what's underperforming or over performing in the packaged goods portfolio, what we've gotten to now is 36 major titles. I think if you did sort of a study of our business until you got major breakout hits, that makes up a significant portion of your portfolio, single-digit returns is fairly typical. On pure Packaged Goods businesses, it has -- and our goal this year is to break out and drive above that. We've identified in quarters past and years past that our biggest deficit coming out of the fiscal -- for the fiscal '04, '05 console transition was that we basically had lost Lord of the Rings, Bond, Medal of Honor and we were down on Need for Speed. And where we're going now is we're replacing that with Dragon Age, Mass Effect, back the Medal of Honor, growth on Need for Speed. So our goal is to replace that and get back in the double-digit strongly. We're not guiding to it because we're waiting for it to happen first."

We are reaffirming our FY '11 financial guidance. Details on the quarter, our fiscal year financial performance and our guidance are in our press release and will be covered in more depth by Eric Brown. Key points I would highlight include these and note, these are non-GAAP numbers.
FY '10 was EA's highest revenue year in history. We had a strong financial rebound and FY '10 versus FY '09 increasing EPS by $0.74. We made significant progress on each of our four strategic objectives: Cost management, fewer but bigger games, improving game quality and driving digital revenue streams.
On cost. We successfully implemented a restructuring program, significantly reducing our cost base, packaged goods fewer but bigger gains. We were the number one publisher overall in Europe and North America combined. We're the number one publisher on PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 2. We achieved share growth in FY '10 versus FY '09 on 20% fewer titles.
Quality. Our investment in quality was a key reason for our segment share success. EA leads the industry in quality with 20 titles in fiscal '10 that received the Metacritic rating of 80 and above.
Digital. FY '10 revenue from our digital initiatives was up 33% over fiscal year '09. We saw a substantial growth in post-released downloadable content sales with big titles like Dragon Age, Mass Effect 2 and Battlefield: Bad Company 2. 
We continue to lead on mobile, iPhone and now, iPad. In a tough market, our advertising sales were up and the acquisition of Playfish makes us a strong leader in social network gaming. 
We enter FY '11 with strong momentum. The quality of our titles, both packaged goods and digital is something we feel passionate about at EA. We couldn't be more pleased with the people that make these games. This investment in quality is what allows us to extend our properties, connecting them to millions of consumers online. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric."

Non-GAAP gross profit margin was 65.2% compared to 49.6% a year ago. This was up from the prior year primarily due to product mix featuring more owned IP and less distribution product versus Q4 last year. 
On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin was 69.6% versus 59.4% a year ago. Non-GAAP operating income was $34 million versus a non-GAAP operating loss of $165 million a year ago. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $83 million versus an operating loss of $62 million a year ago.

Headcount. We ended the quarter with 7,842 employees versus 9,106 a year ago. 22% of our employees are now on low-cost locations versus 18% a year ago. Cash flow from operations this quarter totaled $253 million versus $215 million a year ago. Fiscal year-to-date operating cash flow improved by $140 million from last year to $152 million.
Q4 fiscal '10 highlights. In our packaged goods business. EA was the number one publisher in North America and Europe for the quarter reflecting a four-point share gain year-over-year. We were also number one for the fiscal year with four titles in the top 20 in both North America and Europe. 
Battlefield: Bad Company 2. We sold through 3 million packaged and digital units in the quarter for Europe and North America combined. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 launched with the Metacritic grading of 89. And to date, we have sold through to over 4 million units of Battlefield: Bad Company 2.
Mass Effect 2 sold through over 1.6 million package and digital units in the quarter for Europe and North America combined and launched with the Metacritic rating of 96 on the Xbox 360.
Dante's Inferno sold through almost 1 million units in the quarter for Europe and North America combined, more than any other new intellectual property during the quarter. And the sequel title, ARMY OF TWO: THE 40th DAY sold through over 1 million units worldwide in the quarter.
Highlights from our digital business include downloadable content including Madden Ultimate Team, FIFA 10 Ultimate Team, Battlefield 1943 and Dragon Age which performed well in the quarter.
Mobile sales continue to grow year-over-year, and we had a strong launch of games from the iPad in April. We had 1.8 million total paying subscribers in the quarter. This includes Pogo as well as Massively Multiplayer Online or MMO subscribers. We finished the quarter with over 58 million registered users, up 18% from the prior quarter. Battlefield: Bad Company 2, FIFA 10 and Madden 10 were the top three titles driving user registrations in Q4.
Highlights from our catalog. FIFA 10 continues to be a top-selling title, ranking number six in Europe for Q4. To date, FIFA 10 has sold in over 10 million units since launch. Madden 10 finished the fiscal year strong, growing 9% year-over-year on the PS3 and Xbox 360 combined, a market improvement from the relatively slow start we have with Madden in Q2.  Digital business results include the following: For the fiscal year, we had total digital revenue of $570 million, up 33% year-over-year, meeting our expeditions. 
We reported record mobile non-GAAP revenue of $212 million, up 12% year-over-year. We reported $358 million non-GAAP digital revenue from nonmobile sources, up 49% year-over-year. In the quarter, mobile non-GAAP revenue was $55 million, up 15% year-over-year driven by Tetris, The Sims 3, Bejeweled and Need for Speed.  Q4 non-GAAP revenue from nonmobile sources was $101 million, up 66% year-over-year. 
We have three different businesses in our Digital portfolio. Let me give you detail on each category.
The first category is console full games and downloadable content or DLC, which consists of digitally delivered, fully playable games and associated content packs. In Q4, EA SPORTS launched Madden Ultimate Team and FIFA 10 Ultimate Team. Both Madden Ultimate Team and FIFA 10 Ultimate Team exceeded our expectations. Our front-line titles in Q4 had extensive console deal sale offerings. 
The second category is PC and browser full games and associated DLC, which consists of digitally delivered, fully playable PC games, associated content packs and free-to-play PC games with paid micro-transaction content. During the quarter, we launched several PC and browser games including Battlefield: Bad Company 2, Mass Effect 2, Command & Conquer 4 and Lord of Ultima. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 exceeded our expeditions as a PC-download title in Q4. Playfish launched a browser game called Hotel City in March, which looks promising and has already reached 13 million monthly active users and is a top 15 Facebook application.
The third category is mobile game services, subscriptions and advertising. Mobile consists of games delivered on feature phones, smartphones and handhelds such as the iPhone and the iPad. We launched five games on the iPad at the tail end of Q4. Game services, subscriptions and advertising, include advertising in Playfish social games, Pogo subscriptions, MMOs and browser-based games with subscription models. Pogo's subscription revenue for fiscal 10 was up 3%. 
A few comments on the industry. The total sector inclusive of packaged goods and digital was up 3% in calendar '09. The worldwide packaged goods subsector was down 9% which was more than offset by digital being up by approximately 28%. 
In the quarter, for Western markets overall, the total sector, including digital was up. The packaged goods subsector was down 2% which was more than offset by digital. By region, North America was down 5% and Europe was up 1%. We saw a growth trends in Spain, Italy and Germany although U.K. and France were down. In fiscal '10 the packaged goods subsector in both North America and Europe was down 11% which contrasts sharply with EA's strong performance.
In the quarter and despite console hardware shortages, year-over-year PS3 software sales increased 41% in Western world markets, Xbox 360 software sales increased 1% and Wii software sales decreased 9%. In the quarter, top 20 titles in North America increased dollar share to 43% versus 41% in the prior year.
For fiscal '11, we are affirming our Q1 non-GAAP and GAAP guidance, our full-year non-GAAP guidance and we are updating our full-year GAAP guidance. We expect the market, inclusive of packaged goods and digital, to grow 8% year-to-year in calendar 2010 based on the assumption that total worldwide packaged goods, consistent with the recent industry reports, will be down 3% offset by digital growth of approximately 26%.
We expect to end fiscal '11 with total headcount of approximately 8,200, and our managing headcount consistent with the restructuring plan that called for a shift from high-cost to low-cost locations. Total low-cost location headcount is increasing from approximately 22% to 26% at the end of fiscal '11.
Regarding exchange rates, we are assuming the $1.36 U.S. to the euro, $0.95 U.S. to the Canadian dollar and $1.55 U.S. to the British pound. Currency markets are volatile, and our R&D costs will increase if the Canadian dollar strengthens.
Packaged goods. Our fiscal '11 plan currently includes a total of 36 titles for the fiscal year excluding expansion packs. Our top 20 titles for fiscal '11 are expected to generate approximately 80% of total non-distribution packaged goods revenue. This compares to 76% in fiscal '10.
There is an updated FY '11 title plan in our earnings press release detailing our principal titles. 
Our total variable marketing and advertising in fiscal '11 is an estimated $475 million, comparable to the total amount spent in fiscal '10. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect fiscal '11 revenue from EA published packaged goods titles to be between $2.75 billion to $3 billion which reflects flat share at the middle of the range.
Distribution. We expect approximately $150 million in non-GAAP distribution revenue for fiscal '11. 
Digital. EA is incurring significant development costs for a major new Massively Multiplayer Online game. However, this game is not expected to ship in fiscal '11.
In fiscal '11, we will continue to introduce new service and product features that benefit unique registered purchasers on PC and console games. Our most recent examples are the Map Packs that we released for Battlefield: Bad Company 2.
We are planning a number of digital service launches in fiscal '11. In March, we announced Need for Speed World in Beta, the MMO action racing game. This April, we launched Tiger Woods Online, an authentic and futuristic golf videogame experience available to a web browser. In Q2, we will launch FIFA Online.
We expect to grow our total digital revenue by approximately 30% from $570 million at fiscal '10 to approximately $750 million at fiscal '11. The year-over-year dollar growth of approximately $180 million is divided roughly as follows: Approximately 1/4 from console full games and DLC; approximately 1/2 from PC and browser full games and DLC; approximately 1/4 from mobile game services, suspensions and advertising. 
Now to our guidance.  We are maintaining our Q1 fiscal '11 GAAP and non-GAAP guidance.
Revenue. On a GAAP basis, we expect Q1 FY '11 revenue of $710 million to $715 million. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect Q1 FY '11 revenue of $460 million to $500 million. Q1 revenue is down year-over-year as we are comparing to a Q1 last year that included The Sims 3 and EA SPORTS Active launches.
The Q1 F '11 titles slate includes FIFA World Cup South Africa, Skate 3 and Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 11. There are five front-line titles versus 10 in the prior year. Below the line, we expect GAAP EPS ranging from a loss per share of $0.05 to a profit of $0.05 per share. We expect non-GAAP loss per share of $0.35 to $0.40.
For the full fiscal year, we expect the following: Revenue; on a GAAP basis we expect revenue of $3.35 billion to $3.6 billion, down from prior expectations of $3.45 billion to $3.7 billion primarily due to release schedule changes, which affect revenue deferrals; on a non-GAAP basis, we are affirming our total revenue guidance of $3.65 billion to $3.90 billion. Breaking this down into three components, we expect digital revenue of approximately $750 million in F '11. We expect approximately $150 million in distribution revenue, roughly a $450 million decrease year-over-year and we expect packaged goods revenue ranging from approximately $2.75 billion to $3 billion.
Revenue phasing. We currently expect the total of 36 front-line titles shipping in fiscal '11. By quarter, we expect to release the following number of titles in fiscal '11: Q1, six titles; Q2, seven titles; Q3, 16 titles; and Q4, seven titles.
I would like to remind everyone that last year's first fiscal quarter had unusually high revenue due to the launch schedule and the additional week of reported business. We expect fiscal '11's quarterly revenue phasing to be more consistent with prior years with non-GAAP revenue distributed as follows: Q1, approximately 13%; Q2, approximately 21%; Q3, approximately 42%; and Q4, approximately 24%.
Please note that as announced on May 5 and representing a change from our last earnings call, we have moved Medal of Honor to October 12, 2010, to optimize the launch window. This move has a negligible impact on full-year fiscal '11 non-GAAP net revenue, non-GAAP EPS and cash flow.
Q2 non-GAAP EPS is impacted due to the high margin of the Medal of Honor title and other items. We estimate an approximate $0.25 EPS reduction versus current analyst Q2 expectations.
Gross margins. We expect full-year GAAP gross profit margins of approximately 56% and non-GAAP gross profit margins of approximately 60%. Below the line, we expect GAAP-diluted loss per share of $0.85 to $1.15. We expect to generate non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 to $0.70.
This concludes our outlook and guidance, and with that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, John Schappert."

Q4 was a strong finish to the fiscal year, thanks to the launch of some great franchises in the quarter. EA has ranked number one in the western world with 19% segment share for fiscal '10. We had five titles that sold more than 4 million",1049,"Thanks, Eric. Q4 was a strong finish to the fiscal year, thanks to the launch of some great franchises in the quarter. 
EA has ranked number one in the western world with 19% segment share for fiscal '10. We had five titles that sold more than 4 million copies this fiscal year: Madden NFL 10, The Sims 3, Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and Need for Speed SHIFT. Our top-selling title was FIFA 10 which sold in more than 10 million copies since launch.
In terms of the current trading environment, the overall industry has remained positive, thanks to digital offsetting a slight decline in packaged goods. On the packaged goods side, in North America was down 5% in the March quarter, while Europe was up 1%, both better than the December quarter and consistent with our guidance for the year.  We expect the packaged goods in April were sharply down with the console mix shift change favoring EA. We expect the overall packaged goods sector to pick up in the summer when major titles launch. We remain confident in our overall expectations for growth of this sector with packaged goods declining 3% in the calendar year.
Turning to E3. This year, you're going to see a strong portfolio of blockbuster titles from EA. The EA SPORTS Label will showcase Madden NFL 11, FIFA 11, NHL 11, NBA Live 11, Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 11 and EA SPORTS Active. We will also unveil games that make use of the new motion controllers from Sony and Microsoft. 
That EA Play Label will showcase a new Harry Potter game and some great titles from our partnership with Hasbro. The Sims 3, EA's mainstream gaming mega brand with over 125 million units sold, is coming to consoles and will be available this fall on the PS3, Xbox 360, Wii and Nintendo DS. We will also highlight The Sims 3 expansion packs, including the recently announced The Sims 3 Ambitions Expansion Pack.
The EA Games Label will unveil a new Need for Speed title, Dead Space 2, and the return of one of the most storied franchises in first-person shooter history, Medal of Honor. EA Partners will run Bulletstorm from Epic Games, Crysis 2 from Crytek and in partnership with Lucas Arts, we will highlight the much anticipated Star Wars: The Old Republic. We will also show a marquee title in breathtaking 3D.
Next, I'd like to provide some highlights on our EA Interactive business unit which includes EA Mobile, Pogo and Playfish.
First on EA Mobile. We continue to be the number one mobile games publisher in Western markets. In March, we had seven of the top 10 games on Verizon and achieved more than half of the top 10 games on AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile. I want to highlight that EA is the number one App Store publisher, a formidable achievement that affirms our belief that mobile consumers gravitate towards high quality and brands they recognize from other platforms.
Proving the point again that consumers love IP that they know, we launched five games on the iPad at the end of Q4 and had two of the top three grossing titles. Scrabble was the number one grossing title and Need for Speed was number three.
Second, Pogo continues to be one of the most engaging online gaming destinations, generating 5.4 billion minutes of play in March. It is one of the most diversified models in casual gaming generating multiple revenue streams: Subscription, advertising and micro-transactions. 
From February to March, Pogo grew U.S. monthly unique visitors by 9% versus flat for the market and grew total online gaming minutes by 8% versus 2% for the market. Pogo's play rate among daily and monthly active users is 30%, placing it on par with the best performing social network games. At the end of Q4, we launched Pogo Facebook Beta. This application includes a total of 12 games including Poppit! and Word Whomp. 
And third, Playfish is the number two social gaming site in a rapidly lower growing market. In Q4, we had two of the top 10 Facebook games: Restaurant City and Pet Society. In March, Playfish launched Hotel City, which is off to a promising start with 13 million monthly active users and is also a top 15 Facebook game.
At the end of April, Playfish had a total of 59 million monthly active users, up 17% since January. Daily active users have increased 23% since January. We couldn't be happier with the integration process and look forward to Playfish launching the first EA-branded title, FIFA Superstars, which is now in beta testing and is coming soon. We continue to believe that social network gamers will mass behind quality and brands they recognize as they have done in the Mobile segment.
Finally, I'd like to offer some detail on our progress in extending the consumer experience with online services and content. Yesterday, EA SPORTS introduced Online Pass, a program to give game owners more features and content by using a one-time use, game-specific access code printed on the back of the game manual. When the first purchaser goes online to register the software, he or she can receive title-specific bonus content and access the services like Clubs and Leagues, as well as online game play. Benefits that registered users also get and include news feeds from EA Sports, ESPN and others. Other content may be available after launch, and online pass will be available to secondary purchases for a fee.
EA Sports titles, including Tiger Woods PGA TOUR, NCAA Football, Madden NFL, NHL, Fight Night and MMA Mixed Martial Arts will feature online pass. This concept builds upon similar initiatives from recent releases. Last year, The Sims 3 launched with an entire second city available for players who registered their game online. And Mass Effect 2, consumers were provided access to the server's network which offers additional missions, equipment, even a new character when the game is registered online.
Similar offerings were included the Dragon Age and Battlefield: Bad Company 2. These offerings reward purchase, add value to the game and keep players engaged. We believe the ship-it-and-forget-it mentality is giving way to much deeper relationships between the consumer, the game and the publisher. 
With that, I'll hand it back over to John."

Before we take your questions let me leave you with one last thought on a topic that means a great deal to us, the quality of our game. 
We banked on success as a company on a simple idea, fewer bigger hits in our core business which will translate into success in digital. What underpins this opportunity of extending the consumer experience with new content and new revenue opportunity is 100% dependent on ensuring that the consumers' first experience with each game delivers an extraordinary quality. 
Gamers are the most discerning consumers in the world of entertainment. They will not tolerate a shoddy product. Today, I believe that EA has turned a corner and that consumers now identify our games with high quality and innovation. I see it when I review games with our many talented teams and when I read the blogs where gamers communicate.  We are rebuilding EA's reputation with consumers. Now we want to show investors how that translates into new revenue streams and increasing profitability. With that, John, Eric and I would be happy to take your questions."

So our goal is to turn these customers from thinking that kind of it ends with a disc to really starts with a disc, that there's a lot of additional content for them to be able to purchase and to use in addition to the content that we give away. You mentioned -- we've done this before in a few of our past games, and the uptick of the, if you will, the registration, has been very, very high, exceeding 70% from the codes that we included with the likes of Battlefield: Bad Company and Dragon Age and our recent Q4 releases.

First off, the challenge, I think, we and many other publishers had in what was our fiscal '10 was an opening expectation for big to high, if not double-digit sector growth of the packaged good side.

First off, the challenge, I think, we and many other publishers had in what was our fiscal '10 was an opening expectation for big to high, if not double-digit sector growth of the packaged good side. And we actually saw double-digit decline, so a big shift in expectations going into the year versus exiting the year. And I think you know that our strategy responded to a variety of different pressures, but we've been talking for a couple of years about shifting our profile. We made large number of titles, exploited a few of them in one way, packaged goods, with a much shorter number of titles that are much bigger, higher quality, exploited on multiple business models. And that's exactly what we're doing. So if you just go back to fiscal '09, when we had mid-70s in the number of titles. Fiscal '11, we've got mid-30s number of titles. We've cut our titles slate by a little bit more than half. Now in doing that, we're also getting more revenue per IP, and we're getting more revenue per IP by exploiting the best IP across multiple revenue models. Using FIFA as an example, it was once upon a time just a packaged-goods game. Now there is a fee for the packaged-goods game. There is FIFA Ultimate Team, which is disc-based DLC. We just announced our social network game. It's about to go out into a launch from its development stage. We are strong on Mobile. We have our FIFA franchise. We've done well on the iPhone. We've got FIFA Online in Korea. We've actually launched two titles this year: World Cup in addition to the core packaged-goods game people love and coming later in the year. Another great example is Need for Speed. Need for Speed is now two packaged-goods games. It was just an action game in the fall. We now have an Action business and a Simulation business. We brought our Simulation business out last year. We're turning to Action this year. In addition to that, we've announced Need for Speed online. I think you know it's a leading title on the iPhone. It's a leading title on the iPad. It's done well on a number of business models, including post-release downloadable contents. So what we've been doing is bringing up slight down in terms of the number and broaden it. Broadening it is a mild joke. We've been saying that kind of short and fat is the new tall and thin, meaning, a shorter list, but more broad-based spread across properties. So to answer your question, I think what we saw was a depression largely across the board relative to our early expectations as a consequence of less packaged-goods sales, overall. We're pleased with a number of our titles kind of reaching hit status, including titles like FIFA, Madden, Battlefield: Bad Company and a few others, The Sims. And as we go forward, we think we can better navigate the current environment, the rapid increase in Digital revenue stream with a lesser slate, exploited more ways."

And so that feels solid for us overall, an incremental title in like a World Cup year. What it under underpins, EA's core feels very solid. The Arcade business is really driven increasingly by First Party. And so the First Party business is still offering, packed down as it is with Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort. It'll be interesting to see what the specific titles are that might or might not exist in around the other platform holders this year. Something that fit into that kind of Arcade category would include titles from EA this year like NBA Jam, which we previously announced.

My general expectation this year is that we'll see unit growth, but we'll not see dollar growth as consumers buy fewer hardware peripherals associated with perhaps the Wii Fit platform because we're buying software expansions having the physical apparatus in place already. But overall, it feels like a solid business on the SPORTS side. Core is what we focused most on and that's looks real healthy."

I would tell you that, and this is probably maybe one of the largest statements we'll make on the call, we're not going to be happy until we've taken the leadership back in the first-person shooter category. And the tip of the spear is a combination of Battlefield: Bad Company and Medal of Honor. So we fully expect this to be a successful title this year. We're using a lot of the same technology between the two, the multi-player game. That is part of Medal of Honor this year. It's in fact built by our DICE Studio, which builds the Battlefield: Bad Company and Battlefield franchises for us, and we think it's a particularly strong title. So we've made great strides with Battlefield: Bad Company, and we expect to make further strides with Medal of Honor, and we have strong plans for years to come. This is an important strategic priority inside of our company, taking market share precisely here. In terms of FIFA, generally speaking, a World Cup title will do less than half, quarter-over-quarter, of what we would get out of a full FIFA franchise. And the challenge in every given time that we have a World Cup year is to get the title out there and then roll it back in. So there's nothing on the shelf for when the FIFA '11 ships into the marketplace."

And we saw a low percentage, single-digit percent of purchasers, non-first-time registers purchasing the code. What we also saw there more so was by giving people this access code, we got them into the online world. And so we've seen very, very strong uptick in downloadable content across all of those titles because we have: a, content available on day one for purchase; and b, we've seeded it with a bonus token of free content.

Just for clarity's sake, we don't have a way to distinguish a used consumer versus a new consumer when they're hitting our servers. We can't distinguish between someone who's got the code and doesn't have the code. And then we sell the code. I think what you're getting at is the answer to a question that we'll probably be in a better position to answer towards the end of this fiscal year in terms of exactly how much business we build among users that don't have codes or that they purchased the codes. What we can tell you is, and virtually, every way imaginable, the scenario where the consumer puts in the disc and reaches for their business models is on an uptick. And we've established this strategy among others to build our Direct-to-Consumer business often starting with the disc. We think it's a great idea. We think it's going to build our business, and we think it's a positive consumer experience. Invariably, the consumer is getting a boatload, more content and experience than the otherwise would. We used to literally pull our teams off of a game within probably four to six weeks pre-shift, and then they go work on something else because the game was done. It was going into manufacturing. Their job was done. John Schappert referred to that on his script earlier as once you shipped it [ph], forget it. Our teams are being held in place up through and beyond shift. They continue to create content to entertainment the consumer with new content associated with the IP they like best. This is why when we go from 72 titles or 75 titles a few short years ago, we believe we can successfully go to 36 titles, having our title counts and retaining our revenue by generating more revenue per IP, by extending our business models into subscriptions, into micro-transactions and to downloadable content. And then in the new platforms like social networks, we're putting our IP through the Pogo. We're building directed services like Tiger Online, FIFA Online and Battlefield Online."

It's going to be a big push, obviously, for the hardware companies. This fall, it's going to bring a lot of attention to our industry, a lot of new users to our industry and breathe some new life into these consoles, which is kind of exciting. So we're bullish on their upside for our space. With respect to Facebook, we're happy to say that our Playfish team has booked the MAU and DAU decline in the fourth quarter that Facebook saw. So basically, while most of the top 25 games dropped, in fact, they dropped by 4% in DAUs, Playfish increased by 23%. And their MAUs ended at 59 million at the end of April, which is up 17% since January. Now that was because of some nice, good reengineering efforts on Pet Society and Restaurant City to keep those titles fresh and new, as well as the launch of Hotel City, which is certainly made up for any declines in growing their share as well. So we're pretty bullish there. And again, we're excited about the upcoming launch of FIFA Superstars with them, too."

We finished the fiscal year in the fourth quarter slightly ahead of the guidance we provided the Street on February 8. The quarter came in stronger than Street consensus. We are reaffirming our FY '11 financial guidance. Details on the quarter, our fiscal year financial performance and our guidance are in our press release and will be covered in more depth by Eric Brown. Key points I would highlight include these and note, these are non-GAAP numbers.
FY '10 was EA's highest revenue year in history. We had a strong financial rebound and FY '10 versus FY '09 increasing EPS by $0.74. We made significant progress on each of our four strategic objectives: Cost management, fewer but bigger games, improving game quality and driving digital revenue streams.
On cost. We successfully implemented a restructuring program, significantly reducing our cost base, packaged goods fewer but bigger gains. We were the number one publisher overall in Europe and North America combined. We're the number one publisher on PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 2. We achieved share growth in FY '10 versus FY '09 on 20% fewer titles.
Quality. Our investment in quality was a key reason for our segment share success. EA leads the industry in quality with 20 titles in fiscal '10 that received the Metacritic rating of 80 and above.
Digital. FY '10 revenue from our digital initiatives was up 33% over fiscal year '09. We saw a substantial growth in post-released downloadable content sales with big titles like Dragon Age, Mass Effect 2 and Battlefield: Bad Company 2. 
We continue to lead on mobile, iPhone and now, iPad. In a tough market, our advertising sales were up and the acquisition of Playfish makes us a strong leader in social network gaming. 
We enter FY '11 with strong momentum. The quality of our titles, both packaged goods and digital is something we feel passionate about at EA. We couldn't be more pleased with the people that make these games. This investment in quality is what allows us to extend our properties, connecting them to millions of consumers online. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric."

Non-GAAP EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance range of",2075,"Thank you, John. EA reported solid Q4 financial results today with non-GAAP revenue coming in at the high end of the guidance range of $800 million to $815 million that we provided on February 8. Non-GAAP EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance range of $0.02 to $0.06 per share. Non-GAAP net revenue was $815 million, up 40% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, net revenue was $979 million.
At constant-currency rates, non-GAAP net revenue increased $210 million or 34% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, net revenue increased $85 million or 10% year-over-year.
Non-GAAP gross profit margin was 65.2% compared to 49.6% a year ago. This was up from the prior year primarily due to product mix featuring more owned IP and less distribution product versus Q4 last year. 
On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin was 69.6% versus 59.4% a year ago. Non-GAAP operating income was $34 million versus a non-GAAP operating loss of $165 million a year ago. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $83 million versus an operating loss of $62 million a year ago. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.07 versus diluted loss per share of $0.37 a year ago. GAAP-diluted earnings per share was $0.09 versus a diluted loss per share of $0.13 a year ago.
Headcount. We ended the quarter with 7,842 employees versus 9,106 a year ago. 22% of our employees are now on low-cost locations versus 18% a year ago. Cash flow from operations this quarter totaled $253 million versus $215 million a year ago. Fiscal year-to-date operating cash flow improved by $140 million from last year to $152 million.
Q4 fiscal '10 highlights. In our packaged goods business. EA was the number one publisher in North America and Europe for the quarter reflecting a four-point share gain year-over-year. We were also number one for the fiscal year with four titles in the top 20 in both North America and Europe. 
Battlefield: Bad Company 2. We sold through 3 million packaged and digital units in the quarter for Europe and North America combined. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 launched with the Metacritic grading of 89. And to date, we have sold through to over 4 million units of Battlefield: Bad Company 2.
Mass Effect 2 sold through over 1.6 million package and digital units in the quarter for Europe and North America combined and launched with the Metacritic rating of 96 on the Xbox 360.
Dante's Inferno sold through almost 1 million units in the quarter for Europe and North America combined, more than any other new intellectual property during the quarter. And the sequel title, ARMY OF TWO: THE 40th DAY sold through over 1 million units worldwide in the quarter.
Highlights from our digital business include downloadable content including Madden Ultimate Team, FIFA 10 Ultimate Team, Battlefield 1943 and Dragon Age which performed well in the quarter.
Mobile sales continue to grow year-over-year, and we had a strong launch of games from the iPad in April. We had 1.8 million total paying subscribers in the quarter. This includes Pogo as well as Massively Multiplayer Online or MMO subscribers. We finished the quarter with over 58 million registered users, up 18% from the prior quarter. Battlefield: Bad Company 2, FIFA 10 and Madden 10 were the top three titles driving user registrations in Q4.
Highlights from our catalog. FIFA 10 continues to be a top-selling title, ranking number six in Europe for Q4. To date, FIFA 10 has sold in over 10 million units since launch. Madden 10 finished the fiscal year strong, growing 9% year-over-year on the PS3 and Xbox 360 combined, a market improvement from the relatively slow start we have with Madden in Q2.  Digital business results include the following: For the fiscal year, we had total digital revenue of $570 million, up 33% year-over-year, meeting our expeditions. 
We reported record mobile non-GAAP revenue of $212 million, up 12% year-over-year. We reported $358 million non-GAAP digital revenue from nonmobile sources, up 49% year-over-year. In the quarter, mobile non-GAAP revenue was $55 million, up 15% year-over-year driven by Tetris, The Sims 3, Bejeweled and Need for Speed.  Q4 non-GAAP revenue from nonmobile sources was $101 million, up 66% year-over-year. 
We have three different businesses in our Digital portfolio. Let me give you detail on each category.
The first category is console full games and downloadable content or DLC, which consists of digitally delivered, fully playable games and associated content packs. In Q4, EA SPORTS launched Madden Ultimate Team and FIFA 10 Ultimate Team. Both Madden Ultimate Team and FIFA 10 Ultimate Team exceeded our expectations. Our front-line titles in Q4 had extensive console deal sale offerings. 
The second category is PC and browser full games and associated DLC, which consists of digitally delivered, fully playable PC games, associated content packs and free-to-play PC games with paid micro-transaction content. During the quarter, we launched several PC and browser games including Battlefield: Bad Company 2, Mass Effect 2, Command & Conquer 4 and Lord of Ultima. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 exceeded our expeditions as a PC-download title in Q4. Playfish launched a browser game called Hotel City in March, which looks promising and has already reached 13 million monthly active users and is a top 15 Facebook application.
The third category is mobile game services, subscriptions and advertising. Mobile consists of games delivered on feature phones, smartphones and handhelds such as the iPhone and the iPad. We launched five games on the iPad at the tail end of Q4. Game services, subscriptions and advertising, include advertising in Playfish social games, Pogo subscriptions, MMOs and browser-based games with subscription models. Pogo's subscription revenue for fiscal 10 was up 3%. 
A few comments on the industry. The total sector inclusive of packaged goods and digital was up 3% in calendar '09. The worldwide packaged goods subsector was down 9% which was more than offset by digital being up by approximately 28%. 
In the quarter, for Western markets overall, the total sector, including digital was up. The packaged goods subsector was down 2% which was more than offset by digital. By region, North America was down 5% and Europe was up 1%. We saw a growth trends in Spain, Italy and Germany although U.K. and France were down. In fiscal '10 the packaged goods subsector in both North America and Europe was down 11% which contrasts sharply with EA's strong performance.
In the quarter and despite console hardware shortages, year-over-year PS3 software sales increased 41% in Western world markets, Xbox 360 software sales increased 1% and Wii software sales decreased 9%. In the quarter, top 20 titles in North America increased dollar share to 43% versus 41% in the prior year.
For fiscal '11, we are affirming our Q1 non-GAAP and GAAP guidance, our full-year non-GAAP guidance and we are updating our full-year GAAP guidance. We expect the market, inclusive of packaged goods and digital, to grow 8% year-to-year in calendar 2010 based on the assumption that total worldwide packaged goods, consistent with the recent industry reports, will be down 3% offset by digital growth of approximately 26%.
We expect to end fiscal '11 with total headcount of approximately 8,200, and our managing headcount consistent with the restructuring plan that called for a shift from high-cost to low-cost locations. Total low-cost location headcount is increasing from approximately 22% to 26% at the end of fiscal '11.
Regarding exchange rates, we are assuming the $1.36 U.S. to the euro, $0.95 U.S. to the Canadian dollar and $1.55 U.S. to the British pound. Currency markets are volatile, and our R&D costs will increase if the Canadian dollar strengthens.
Packaged goods. Our fiscal '11 plan currently includes a total of 36 titles for the fiscal year excluding expansion packs. Our top 20 titles for fiscal '11 are expected to generate approximately 80% of total non-distribution packaged goods revenue. This compares to 76% in fiscal '10.
There is an updated FY '11 title plan in our earnings press release detailing our principal titles. 
Our total variable marketing and advertising in fiscal '11 is an estimated $475 million, comparable to the total amount spent in fiscal '10. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect fiscal '11 revenue from EA published packaged goods titles to be between $2.75 billion to $3 billion which reflects flat share at the middle of the range.
Distribution. We expect approximately $150 million in non-GAAP distribution revenue for fiscal '11. 
Digital. EA is incurring significant development costs for a major new Massively Multiplayer Online game. However, this game is not expected to ship in fiscal '11.
In fiscal '11, we will continue to introduce new service and product features that benefit unique registered purchasers on PC and console games. Our most recent examples are the Map Packs that we released for Battlefield: Bad Company 2.
We are planning a number of digital service launches in fiscal '11. In March, we announced Need for Speed World in Beta, the MMO action racing game. This April, we launched Tiger Woods Online, an authentic and futuristic golf videogame experience available to a web browser. In Q2, we will launch FIFA Online.
We expect to grow our total digital revenue by approximately 30% from $570 million at fiscal '10 to approximately $750 million at fiscal '11. The year-over-year dollar growth of approximately $180 million is divided roughly as follows: Approximately 1/4 from console full games and DLC; approximately 1/2 from PC and browser full games and DLC; approximately 1/4 from mobile game services, suspensions and advertising. 
Now to our guidance.  We are maintaining our Q1 fiscal '11 GAAP and non-GAAP guidance.
Revenue. On a GAAP basis, we expect Q1 FY '11 revenue of $710 million to $715 million. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect Q1 FY '11 revenue of $460 million to $500 million. Q1 revenue is down year-over-year as we are comparing to a Q1 last year that included The Sims 3 and EA SPORTS Active launches.
The Q1 F '11 titles slate includes FIFA World Cup South Africa, Skate 3 and Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 11. There are five front-line titles versus 10 in the prior year. Below the line, we expect GAAP EPS ranging from a loss per share of $0.05 to a profit of $0.05 per share. We expect non-GAAP loss per share of $0.35 to $0.40.
For the full fiscal year, we expect the following: Revenue; on a GAAP basis we expect revenue of $3.35 billion to $3.6 billion, down from prior expectations of $3.45 billion to $3.7 billion primarily due to release schedule changes, which affect revenue deferrals; on a non-GAAP basis, we are affirming our total revenue guidance of $3.65 billion to $3.90 billion. Breaking this down into three components, we expect digital revenue of approximately $750 million in F '11. We expect approximately $150 million in distribution revenue, roughly a $450 million decrease year-over-year and we expect packaged goods revenue ranging from approximately $2.75 billion to $3 billion.
Revenue phasing. We currently expect the total of 36 front-line titles shipping in fiscal '11. By quarter, we expect to release the following number of titles in fiscal '11: Q1, six titles; Q2, seven titles; Q3, 16 titles; and Q4, seven titles.
I would like to remind everyone that last year's first fiscal quarter had unusually high revenue due to the launch schedule and the additional week of reported business. We expect fiscal '11's quarterly revenue phasing to be more consistent with prior years with non-GAAP revenue distributed as follows: Q1, approximately 13%; Q2, approximately 21%; Q3, approximately 42%; and Q4, approximately 24%.
Please note that as announced on May 5 and representing a change from our last earnings call, we have moved Medal of Honor to October 12, 2010, to optimize the launch window. This move has a negligible impact on full-year fiscal '11 non-GAAP net revenue, non-GAAP EPS and cash flow.
Q2 non-GAAP EPS is impacted due to the high margin of the Medal of Honor title and other items. We estimate an approximate $0.25 EPS reduction versus current analyst Q2 expectations.
Gross margins. We expect full-year GAAP gross profit margins of approximately 56% and non-GAAP gross profit margins of approximately 60%. Below the line, we expect GAAP-diluted loss per share of $0.85 to $1.15. We expect to generate non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 to $0.70.
This concludes our outlook and guidance, and with that, I'll turn the call over to our Chief Operating Officer, John Schappert."

Q4 was a strong finish to the fiscal year, thanks to the launch of some great franchises in the quarter. EA has ranked number one in the western world with 19% segment share for fiscal '10. We had five titles that sold more than 4 million",1049,"Thanks, Eric. Q4 was a strong finish to the fiscal year, thanks to the launch of some great franchises in the quarter. 
EA has ranked number one in the western world with 19% segment share for fiscal '10. We had five titles that sold more than 4 million copies this fiscal year: Madden NFL 10, The Sims 3, Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and Need for Speed SHIFT. Our top-selling title was FIFA 10 which sold in more than 10 million copies since launch.
In terms of the current trading environment, the overall industry has remained positive, thanks to digital offsetting a slight decline in packaged goods. On the packaged goods side, in North America was down 5% in the March quarter, while Europe was up 1%, both better than the December quarter and consistent with our guidance for the year.  We expect the packaged goods in April were sharply down with the console mix shift change favoring EA. We expect the overall packaged goods sector to pick up in the summer when major titles launch. We remain confident in our overall expectations for growth of this sector with packaged goods declining 3% in the calendar year.
Turning to E3. This year, you're going to see a strong portfolio of blockbuster titles from EA. The EA SPORTS Label will showcase Madden NFL 11, FIFA 11, NHL 11, NBA Live 11, Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 11 and EA SPORTS Active. We will also unveil games that make use of the new motion controllers from Sony and Microsoft. 
That EA Play Label will showcase a new Harry Potter game and some great titles from our partnership with Hasbro. The Sims 3, EA's mainstream gaming mega brand with over 125 million units sold, is coming to consoles and will be available this fall on the PS3, Xbox 360, Wii and Nintendo DS. We will also highlight The Sims 3 expansion packs, including the recently announced The Sims 3 Ambitions Expansion Pack.
The EA Games Label will unveil a new Need for Speed title, Dead Space 2, and the return of one of the most storied franchises in first-person shooter history, Medal of Honor. EA Partners will run Bulletstorm from Epic Games, Crysis 2 from Crytek and in partnership with Lucas Arts, we will highlight the much anticipated Star Wars: The Old Republic. We will also show a marquee title in breathtaking 3D.
Next, I'd like to provide some highlights on our EA Interactive business unit which includes EA Mobile, Pogo and Playfish.
First on EA Mobile. We continue to be the number one mobile games publisher in Western markets. In March, we had seven of the top 10 games on Verizon and achieved more than half of the top 10 games on AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile. I want to highlight that EA is the number one App Store publisher, a formidable achievement that affirms our belief that mobile consumers gravitate towards high quality and brands they recognize from other platforms.
Proving the point again that consumers love IP that they know, we launched five games on the iPad at the end of Q4 and had two of the top three grossing titles. Scrabble was the number one grossing title and Need for Speed was number three.
Second, Pogo continues to be one of the most engaging online gaming destinations, generating 5.4 billion minutes of play in March. It is one of the most diversified models in casual gaming generating multiple revenue streams: Subscription, advertising and micro-transactions. 
From February to March, Pogo grew U.S. monthly unique visitors by 9% versus flat for the market and grew total online gaming minutes by 8% versus 2% for the market. Pogo's play rate among daily and monthly active users is 30%, placing it on par with the best performing social network games. At the end of Q4, we launched Pogo Facebook Beta. This application includes a total of 12 games including Poppit! and Word Whomp. 
And third, Playfish is the number two social gaming site in a rapidly lower growing market. In Q4, we had two of the top 10 Facebook games: Restaurant City and Pet Society. In March, Playfish launched Hotel City, which is off to a promising start with 13 million monthly active users and is also a top 15 Facebook game.
At the end of April, Playfish had a total of 59 million monthly active users, up 17% since January. Daily active users have increased 23% since January. We couldn't be happier with the integration process and look forward to Playfish launching the first EA-branded title, FIFA Superstars, which is now in beta testing and is coming soon. We continue to believe that social network gamers will mass behind quality and brands they recognize as they have done in the Mobile segment.
Finally, I'd like to offer some detail on our progress in extending the consumer experience with online services and content. Yesterday, EA SPORTS introduced Online Pass, a program to give game owners more features and content by using a one-time use, game-specific access code printed on the back of the game manual. When the first purchaser goes online to register the software, he or she can receive title-specific bonus content and access the services like Clubs and Leagues, as well as online game play. Benefits that registered users also get and include news feeds from EA Sports, ESPN and others. Other content may be available after launch, and online pass will be available to secondary purchases for a fee.
EA Sports titles, including Tiger Woods PGA TOUR, NCAA Football, Madden NFL, NHL, Fight Night and MMA Mixed Martial Arts will feature online pass. This concept builds upon similar initiatives from recent releases. Last year, The Sims 3 launched with an entire second city available for players who registered their game online. And Mass Effect 2, consumers were provided access to the server's network which offers additional missions, equipment, even a new character when the game is registered online.
Similar offerings were included the Dragon Age and Battlefield: Bad Company 2. These offerings reward purchase, add value to the game and keep players engaged. We believe the ship-it-and-forget-it mentality is giving way to much deeper relationships between the consumer, the game and the publisher. 
With that, I'll hand it back over to John."

Before we take your questions let me leave you with one last thought on a topic that means a great deal to us, the quality of our game. 
We banked on success as a company on a simple idea, fewer bigger hits in our core business which will translate into success in digital. What underpins this opportunity of extending the consumer experience with new content and new revenue opportunity is 100% dependent on ensuring that the consumers' first experience with each game delivers an extraordinary quality. 
Gamers are the most discerning consumers in the world of entertainment. They will not tolerate a shoddy product. Today, I believe that EA has turned a corner and that consumers now identify our games with high quality and innovation. I see it when I review games with our many talented teams and when I read the blogs where gamers communicate.  We are rebuilding EA's reputation with consumers. Now we want to show investors how that translates into new revenue streams and increasing profitability. With that, John, Eric and I would be happy to take your questions."

First off, the challenge, I think, we and many other publishers had in what was our fiscal '10 was an opening expectation for big to high, if not double-digit sector growth of the packaged good side. And we actually saw double-digit decline, so a big shift in expectations going into the year versus exiting the year. And I think you know that our strategy responded to a variety of different pressures, but we've been talking for a couple of years about shifting our profile. We made large number of titles, exploited a few of them in one way, packaged goods, with a much shorter number of titles that are much bigger, higher quality, exploited on multiple business models. And that's exactly what we're doing. So if you just go back to fiscal '09, when we had mid-70s in the number of titles. Fiscal '11, we've got mid-30s number of titles. We've cut our titles slate by a little bit more than half. Now in doing that, we're also getting more revenue per IP, and we're getting more revenue per IP by exploiting the best IP across multiple revenue models. Using FIFA as an example, it was once upon a time just a packaged-goods game. Now there is a fee for the packaged-goods game. There is FIFA Ultimate Team, which is disc-based DLC. We just announced our social network game. It's about to go out into a launch from its development stage. We are strong on Mobile. We have our FIFA franchise. We've done well on the iPhone. We've got FIFA Online in Korea. We've actually launched two titles this year: World Cup in addition to the core packaged-goods game people love and coming later in the year. Another great example is Need for Speed. Need for Speed is now two packaged-goods games. It was just an action game in the fall. We now have an Action business and a Simulation business. We brought our Simulation business out last year. We're turning to Action this year. In addition to that, we've announced Need for Speed online. I think you know it's a leading title on the iPhone. It's a leading title on the iPad. It's done well on a number of business models, including post-release downloadable contents. So what we've been doing is bringing up slight down in terms of the number and broaden it. Broadening it is a mild joke. We've been saying that kind of short and fat is the new tall and thin, meaning, a shorter list, but more broad-based spread across properties. So to answer your question, I think what we saw was a depression largely across the board relative to our early expectations as a consequence of less packaged-goods sales, overall. We're pleased with a number of our titles kind of reaching hit status, including titles like FIFA, Madden, Battlefield: Bad Company and a few others, The Sims. And as we go forward, we think we can better navigate the current environment, the rapid increase in Digital revenue stream with a lesser slate, exploited more ways."

And so that feels solid for us overall, an incremental title in like a World Cup year. What it under underpins, EA's core feels very solid. The Arcade business is really driven increasingly by First Party. And so the First Party business is still offering, packed down as it is with Wii Sports and Wii Sports Resort. It'll be interesting to see what the specific titles are that might or might not exist in around the other platform holders this year. Something that fit into that kind of Arcade category would include titles from EA this year like NBA Jam, which we previously announced. That's likely pretty volatile and driven more by the individual leases from First Parties and anything else. And lastly, Fitness, the Fitness business, we're a leader there with the EA SPORTS Active. We have a strong release slate this year. We can certainly expect more innovation from Nintendo. We expect a lot of competition. My general expectation this year is that we'll see unit growth, but we'll not see dollar growth as consumers buy fewer hardware peripherals associated with perhaps the Wii Fit platform because we're buying software expansions having the physical apparatus in place already. But overall, it feels like a solid business on the SPORTS side. Core is what we focused most on and that's looks real healthy."

I think what you're getting at is the answer to a question that we'll probably be in a better position to answer towards the end of this fiscal year in terms of exactly how much business we build among users that don't have codes or that they purchased the codes. What we can tell you is, and virtually, every way imaginable, the scenario where the consumer puts in the disc and reaches for their business models is on an uptick. And we've established this strategy among others to build our Direct-to-Consumer business often starting with the disc. We think it's a great idea. We think it's going to build our business, and we think it's a positive consumer experience. Invariably, the consumer is getting a boatload, more content and experience than the otherwise would. We used to literally pull our teams off of a game within probably four to six weeks pre-shift, and then they go work on something else because the game was done. It was going into manufacturing. Their job was done. John Schappert referred to that on his script earlier as once you shipped it [ph], forget it. Our teams are being held in place up through and beyond shift. They continue to create content to entertainment the consumer with new content associated with the IP they like best. This is why when we go from 72 titles or 75 titles a few short years ago, we believe we can successfully go to 36 titles, having our title counts and retaining our revenue by generating more revenue per IP, by extending our business models into subscriptions, into micro-transactions and to downloadable content. And then in the new platforms like social networks, we're putting our IP through the Pogo. We're building directed services like Tiger Online, FIFA Online and Battlefield Online."

Secondly, on the Facebook games, John, I think we've seen a bit of a low in growth there in the past couple of months. I'm wondering if you could provide your perspective on that. And then third, curious also on your perspective on what seems to be a bigger push at retail for the used products, someone in opposition of where you're headed with the Online Pass and whether you expect any impact there on new product sales as Wal-Mart and Best Buy seem to dig in on used."

I'll take your first two, the first one with respect to motion-sensing controls in our products. We've only announced Tiger Woods for the Sony move to date, and we have more announcements you can expect from us at E3, inclusive of demos of some of this technology. So you'll have to wait until then to see and hear more. That said, we're bullish on these new controllers and this new technology because we think it brings new consumers into the market. It's going to be a big push, obviously, for the hardware companies. This fall, it's going to bring a lot of attention to our industry, a lot of new users to our industry and breathe some new life into these consoles, which is kind of exciting. So we're bullish on their upside for our space. With respect to Facebook, we're happy to say that our Playfish team has booked the MAU and DAU decline in the fourth quarter that Facebook saw. So basically, while most of the top 25 games dropped, in fact, they dropped by 4% in DAUs, Playfish increased by 23%. And their MAUs ended at 59 million at the end of April, which is up 17% since January. Now that was because of some nice, good reengineering efforts on Pet Society and Restaurant City to keep those titles fresh and new, as well as the launch of Hotel City, which is certainly made up for any declines in growing their share as well. So we're pretty bullish there. And again, we're excited about the upcoming launch of FIFA Superstars with them, too."

I think it's notable that GameStop joined us with our press release to announce EA SPORTS Online Pass. I think it's an opportunity for us to build the business direct to consumers. I think retailers will ultimately find the best way to participate, and I think we'll be able to grow our business very successfully behind this strategy. Now in terms of the other retailers getting into second sale, they're mostly using third parties to do so. There has been a number of announcements. I would probably suffice it to say that it's a challenging business to operate because you're taking in inventory, repackaging the inventory, reselling the inventory, but I'm certainly happy not to begin. But for us at least, we look at our Online Pass and analogous businesses and strategies we've put in place over the last couple of years as being very pro-consumer, with delivering more content to consumers just the way they like it, and we're very pleased that the key retailers are supportive of our strategy just that."

Our bottom line reflected solid performance on the Digital side and successful cost management. EA is focused on three strategic objectives to drive shareholder value: Producing fewer, bigger, better packaged goods games; driving growth in our digital revenue streams; and controlling costs and finding operational efficiencies. In Q1, we delivered against all three objectives. Two great examples of fewer better games are hits like 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa and Battlefield: Bad Company 2. These titles owe their success in the market place to our ability to deliver top-quality games on time with effective marketing support. 
We grew digital revenues through a combination of paid, downloadable content, social games and our success on the iPad and iPhone. In addition, we successfully launched EA SPORTS Online Pass to build loyalty and online participation. We also remain on track to reduce operating expenses by $100 million this year, thanks to lower headcount, global sourcing and shared technologies.
Based on this performance and our expectation for the remainder of the year, we reaffirm our non-GAAP FY '11 financial guidance. Now I'll turn the call over to Eric."

Non-GAAP revenue of $539 million reflects our efforts to build Digital revenue and drive Packaged Goods hits. Combined with cost controls, Q1 revenue upside translated to a non-GAAP EPS loss of $0.24, which was better than our expectation for the loss of $0.40 to $0.35 per share for the quarter.
Q1 non-GAAP net revenue was $539 million, down 34% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, net revenue was $815 million, up 27% year-over-year. Non-GAAP revenue was down as compared to Q1 last year, which had 10 titles including The Sims 3 and its launch window, as well as an additional week of reported business.
The impact of foreign exchange rates on non-GAAP revenue year-over-year was essentially zero this quarter. Q1 non-GAAP gross profit margin was 59.6% compared to 61.2% a year ago as a greater mix of EA Digital revenue offset the prior year's high margin, The Sims 3 release.
On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin was 72.8% versus 50.2% a year ago. Q1 non-GAAP operating income was a loss of $109 million versus a non-GAAP operating loss of $11 million a year ago. On a GAAP basis, operating income was positive $98 million versus an operating loss of $245 million a year ago.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $0.24 versus a loss per share of $0.02 a year ago. GAAP-diluted earnings per share was $0.29 versus a diluted loss per share of $0.72 a year ago.
Headcount. We ended the quarter with 7,758 employees versus 8,948 a year ago, and 7,842 in Q4 fiscal '10. 21% of our employees are now in low-cost locations.
Cash flow from operations this quarter totaled a loss of $148 million versus a loss of $328 million a year ago. Our trailing 12-month operating cash flow has increased significantly growing from a deficit of $25 million in the 12 months ended Q1 last year to positive $332 million in the 12 months ended Q1 fiscal '11. At the same time, capital expenditures have fallen excluding the purchase of our headquarters’ facilities. This has led to an increase in free cash flow from a deficit of $117 million to positive $257 million in the 12 months just ended.
EA remains on track to generate $250 million to $300 million in operating cash flow this year.
EA has approximately $5.25 per share in cash, short-term investments and marketable securities. Compared with year-ago levels, cash, short-term investments and marketable securities balances are down due to cash payments for the acquisition of Playfish, the purchase of our headquarters’ facilities and lower strategic investment values.
Inventory levels were well managed in the quarter and fell to $82 million from $215 million in the prior year. We are carrying significantly less distribution-related inventory compared to last year.
Reserves for sales returns and allowances as a percentage of trailing six-month non-GAAP net revenue are flat at 13% and up slightly on a nine-month basis from 6% to 7% compared to last year.
Subsequent to the end of Q1, in July we sold our minority stake in Ubisoft for a gain of approximately $28 million.
For the industry overall, we estimate that the western world packaged goods software market is down 7% year-over-year for the June quarter and down 5% on a calendar year-to-date basis.
Year-over-year, we see Europe performing better than North America with Europe Packaged Goods software flat calendar year-to-date compared to a decrease of 9% for North America. For the June quarter, Europe was also flat year-over-year, while North America was down 15%. Much of the weakness in the market is related to the Nintendo Wii and the music category, where EA has less exposure. 
On the positive side, we are starting to see signs of strength in the high-definition console software market, which we estimate is up 14% or $1.1 billion year-over-year and 21% calendar year-to-date. This is driven by the Sony PlayStation 3 which is up sharply on its attractive price point. Microsoft is also starting to gain traction with its new enhanced Xbox 360 form factor. This trend plays into our strength given our share position on high-definition consoles. 
The digital portion of the market continues to perform well. We estimate that the digital sector was up 25% to 35% year-over-year for the June quarter and calendar year-to-date. The total sector, inclusive of packaged goods and digital is flat to up on a calendar year-to-date basis.
EA had a lighter release schedule for Packaged Goods in Q1 fiscal '11 with six front-line titles compared to 10 front-line titles last year including the very high margin, The Sims 3 title. Our share in Q1 was 13% in North America, 15% in Europe and 14% overall. Our calendar year-to-date share through June was 17% in North America, 16% in Europe and 16% overall.
EA's western world Packaged Goods share is stable on a trailing 12-month basis at 18%, with a 16% share coming from EA-published titles excluding distribution.
In Q1, our key front-line Packaged Goods title was 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa, which sold 3 million units in the quarter offsetting performance of Skate 3 and Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 11. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 continues to be a strong catalog title with 1 million units sold during Q1.
Madden 10 continued to generate sales, meeting our expectations, selling an accumulative total of more than 6 million units through the end of Q1. FIFA 10 benefited from the success of the World Cup with live-to-date selling of approximately 11 million units, up 10% on the prior year's FIFA title. Net, we see slightly favorable trends in catalog sales. Our mix of catalog revenue was 22% for Q1 fiscal '11 compared to 21% for Q4 fiscal '10 and 17% for Q1 fiscal '10.
Q1 non-GAAP Digital revenue increased by 52% from $124 million to $188 million year-over-year, comprising 35% of total revenue this quarter. This is the result of significant increases in PC-Digital distribution, console-downloadable content, and favorable phasing on approximately $20 million in Digital revenue, which we do not anticipate in future quarters. Mobile revenue was up slightly year-over-year to $52 million with Smart phone-related revenue compensating for a drop-off on feature phones.
We also met internal expectations for social games-related revenue. We now have 60 million unique core registered users in our nucleus database, up from 33 million a year ago. Titles like Battlefield: Bad Company 2, FIFA 10 and 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa drove registrations in Q1. EA has 52 million monthly active social game users or MAUs. Playfish usage has remained stable, while other Facebook games have seen their MAU count fall by 25%. 
For the 12 months ended Q1 fiscal '11, non-GAAP gross profit margins improved by 3.5 points from 51.1% to 54.7% on higher Digital revenue and an improved mix of EA-published titles, showing 12-month non-GAAP operating margins improve from 0.5% to 2.5%.
In terms of guidance, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP guidance for both revenue and EPS for the fiscal year.
I would like to start with foreign exchange rate assumptions. Currency exchange rates remain volatile, and rate changes impact our reported revenue more than non-GAAP EPS, thanks to natural hedges in our business. On a full year basis, our earnings are mostly hedged versus the euro. Our R&D costs will increase if the Canadian dollar strengthens and we have both revenue and earnings exposure to a weakening British pound. 
Our guidance assumes the following foreign exchange rates for the fiscal year: U.S. $1.29 to the euro; U.S. $0.96 to the Canadian dollar; and U.S. $1.54 to the British pound. The spot rates as of July 30, 2010, persist during the fiscal year. We anticipate a $0.01 benefit to non-GAAP EPS and a $15 million to $20 million benefit to non-GAAP revenue for the year.
On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the total of $3.65 billion to $3.90 billion in fiscal '11 revenue. Our Packaged Goods expectations call for publishing revenue ranging from $2.725 billion to $2.975 billion. Our Distribution revenue expectations are for approximately $175 million, and we expect approximately $750 million in Digital revenue.
The year-over-year dollar growth of $180 million in Digital is divided roughly as follows: Approximately 25% from console full games and DLC; approximately 50% from PC and browser full games and DLC; approximately 25% for mobile, game services, subscriptions and advertising. 
We expect full year GAAP gross profit margin of approximately 56% and non-GAAP gross profit margin of approximately 60%. We expect the worldwide market inclusive of packaged goods and digital to grow 7% year-over-year in calendar 2010 based on the assumption that total worldwide packaged goods consistent with the recent industry reports will be down 3% offset by digital growth of approximately 24%.
We expect non-GAAP revenue for the full year to be phased roughly as follows versus our midpoint revenue guidance: Q2, 21%; Q3, 38%; and Q4, 26% to 27%.
Our title schedule still assumes 36 titles in the fiscal year, but the quarterly phasing has been changed slightly with Crysis 2 moving from Q3 to Q4. EA now plans to release seven titles in Q2, 15 titles in Q3, and eight titles in Q4.
The shift of Crysis 2 along with other updates to our forecast changes the phasing of Q3 non-GAAP revenue, which is now expected to be approximately 38% of full year revenue. In addition, Q4 phasing increases to a range of 26% to 27%.
Our top 20 titles for fiscal '11 are expected to generate approximately 80% of total non-distribution Packaged Goods revenue. This compares to 76% in fiscal '10.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the full year are expected to be approximately $2.0 billion and are phased as follows: Approximately $500 million in Q2, with 55% of the remaining operating expense spending falling into Q3 and 45% falling into Q4; we expect 27% to 28% R&D; 18% to 19% marketing and sales; and 7% G&A for the full year as a percent of total revenue.
EA is incurring significant development costs for a major new massively multiplayer online game. However, this game is not expected to ship in fiscal '11.
We expect to end fiscal '11 with total headcount of approximately 8,200 and are managing headcount consistent with the restructuring plan that called for a shift from high-cost to low-cost locations.
Total low-cost location headcount is expected to increase to 25% by the end of fiscal '11.
In terms of non-GAAP EPS, we are maintaining guidance for the full year at $0.50 to $0.70 per share on 334 million diluted shares. This corresponds to a non-GAAP operating income margin of approximately 6% to 8%. Net, we maintain the EPS range as we offset stronger-than-expected Q1 performance with currency fluctuations, evolving market conditions, title level forecast risks and phasing changes in our title plan. With only 14% of the year's revenue behind us and some timing-related upside in Q1, we encourage modeling in line with our full year guidance.
On a GAAP basis, we are reaffirming our GAAP net review guidance of $3.35 billion to $3.60 billion while we are slightly increasing GAAP EPS guidance to a range of a loss of $1.00 to $0.70 per share due to a gain on sale of strategic investments and reduced stock-compensation expense.
For Q2 fiscal '11, we're providing non-GAAP revenue and EPS guidance in line with our comments from last quarter. We expect Q2 non-GAAP revenue between $775 million and $825 million and a non-GAAP EPS loss of $0.15 to $0.10.
Non-GAAP gross profit margin is expected to be approximately 55%. Operating expense is expected to be approximately $500 million and share count is an estimated $329 million. This concludes our outlook and guidance. Now I'll turn the call over to John Schappert."

I'm going to start with the video game industry. Then, I'll review our Packaged Goods titles and their achievements at E3.

Then, I'll review our Packaged Goods titles and their achievements at E3. I'll end with our key Digital initiative.
The western world video game industry is solid and well ahead of where we were at this point in the last cycle. All in, it's a $30 billion segment counting Digital, second sale and traditional Packaged Goods. This industry has doubled in the last five years. 
Packaged Goods alone in North America and Europe were $19.9 billion in 2009 versus $14 billion at the same point in the PS2 cycle back in 2004. That's about $6 billion of growth in Packaged Goods. 
Second, reports that Packaged Goods is down 9% year-to-date in North America can be misunderstood without recognizing the disproportionate impact of the music category, where EA has limited exposure and where plastic skews the software sales numbers. In North America, adjusting for music, Packaged Goods are actually down 4% year-over-year versus down 9% as reported.
EA is a leading third-party publisher in Europe, which is performing better than North America year-over-year. Europe is not represented in the North American industry reports. 
Third, let's not forget second sale is one way consumers are satisfying their growing appetite for gaming. We estimate that Packaged Goods' revenue would be as much as 15% bigger including second sale, which is absent from industry data report.
Finally, the list of digital revenue streams not captured by data services include digital-game downloads, MMO subscriptions, mobile-iPad revenues, payments for virtual goods and free-to-play browser games, console-downloadable content and social network gaming and advertising. By some estimates, as much as 25% of the Western Games segment is not counted in industry data reports.
Turning to the quarter just ended in the current year, the picture is very strong where EA participates most. We're seeing a bump in high-definition console sales, which is good for EA and should translate into positive momentum for software revenue. While Wii software is down 13% year-to-date in the western world, high-definition console software revenue is up 21% year-to-date. It was up 25% for the quarter. 
The redesigned Slim PS3 from last fall and recently released, Slim Xbox 360, continue to sell well. In particular, PlayStation 3 software’s up 40% both year-to-date and in the quarter, which substantially benefits EA as the leading third-party publisher on this platform. 
EA share remains healthy at 14% on a tighter slate, thanks to high quality and blockbuster franchises such as FIFA and Battlefield, which are generating both Packaged and Digital revenue.
In summary, we believe games are healthy, particularly where EA leads on high-definition console and in Digital.
Turning to specific game platforms. Our trends remain strong with western world PC share north of 30%, thanks to the Sims and other titles. Our North American share on Xbox 360 and PS3 positioned EA to benefit from high-definition console momentum. And our Wii share, while lower, continues to lead western third-party publishers.
Now to E3. Critics recognize EA's singular focus and commitment to quality. When it was over, EA won more nominations than any other publisher, 15. And we won more awards than any other publisher, four. NBA Jam from EA Canada won Best Sports Game. Rock Band 3 from Harmonix MTV, won Best Social Game. Need for Speed Hot Pursuit from Criterion, won Best Racing Game. And Star Wars: The Old Republic from BioWare and Lucas Arts, won Best Role-Playing Game.
Q2 is shaping up well, with NCAA Football '11 off to a good start. This year's game earned a Metacritic rating of 86, up three points from last year, which is contributing to the early buzz. Madden NFL 11 from our Tiburon Studio has solid pre-orders and is allowing demo users with a breakthrough innovation called GameFlow that gets players into the action much quicker without sacrificing the deep playbook hard-core fans demand. 
GameFlow makes Madden much more accessible to new players. 
The World Cup has already been very good to EA, and it sets up FIFA '11 from EA Canada for a strong release in Q2. World Cup years tend to face special dividends to FIFA in the fall. And this year, we’ve got a game that is packed with innovations including Personality Plus for enhancing player authenticity, Pro Passing and a creation center tool for deep customization of teams and players online.
Turning to the holiday quarter. We'll lead off Q3 with Medal of Honor, which explores the conflict in Afghanistan with a deeply engaging single-player game built at EA Los Angeles, along with an incredible multiplayer experience from the Battlefield team at our DICE Studio in Stockholm. 
The superior multiplayer is a big point of difference with other distributors in this market and we plan to promote it heavily. Medal of Honor blew away the critics at E3 in June. Mo [ph 31:16] is back and represents another step towards our goal of regaining leadership in the FPS segment. 
Next up is Need for Speed Hot Pursuit, another winner at E3. We were especially excited by the return of Police: The Hot Pursuit. This action racing title is strongly anticipated at retail, and with great online features like auto log, raises the bar for multiplayer racing.
EA SPORTS will also be launching EA SPORTS Active 2, the first cross-platform fitness game and the first fitness game that includes a heart rate monitor. EA SPORTS Active 2 is also the first fitness game with downloadable exercise routines and strong community features.
EA play will publish the first console and handheld versions of The Sims 3. For the first time, Sims fans can enjoy playing at high-definition on PS3 and Xbox 360.
Our EA Games Label has a Q4 lineup anchored by Crysis 2 from Crytek, which has been moved from Q3 for a better window and polishing. Crysis 2 was a standout at E3 and is part of our ongoing campaign for FPS leadership.
Dead Space 2 follows on one of the most popular horror games of 2008 and has a great fan base, selling through 2 million copies in its first iteration. This year, the game is even better and jam-packed with action and horror.
We’re thrilled to bring bigger, better hits from the best talent in the industry to the broadest base of platforms and channels, feel very good about the Games segment and our Packaged Goods plan.
Now I'll move to our Digital initiative. We’re seeing good growth for our full game downloads through PC-download retailers, particularly Battlefield: Bad Company 2 performed well. We're also seeing good results on popular full games through the console networks such as Battlefield 1943 and Death Spank. 
Consumers are embracing downloadable content. Additional content for FIFA Ultimate Team 2, Dragon Age and Mass Effect 2 has been strong. PlayStation is gaining share on Facebook. EA has over 15 million monthly active social game users. Playfish titles driving usage include Pet Society, Restaurant City, Hotel City and FIFA Superstars. Playfish is gaining share on the platform as its usage has remained stable, while other Facebook games have seen their monthly audience fall by 25% on average due to revisions to access and communications channels on the site.
In Asia, FIFA Online 2 Korea had record results. In June, we surpassed 5 million registered players and had our highest grossing revenue month ever. We remain a top three game in the world's most online-oriented market.
Turning to Mobile. Smart phone revenue continues to grow with the popularity of the Apple platform. By revenue, EA is the number one publisher on the app store and had nine of the top 10 grossing games on the iPhone 4 launch last month. On feature phones, EA is taking share and now has 34% of the U.S. feature phone game market according to Nielsen.
And on Android, EA launched FIFA 10 with more titles coming soon.
Lastly, a word about EA SPORTS Online Pass. Based on early Tiger and NCAA Football results, we are pleased to see 60% to 70% of online-connected users redeeming the code. 
The level of online play amongst our user base is up from last year and revenue from paid-downloadable content is also up. Now I'll turn the call back to John Riccitiello."

Stepping back, we’ve long been focusing on three strategic objectives. 
First, build fewer, bigger Packaged Goods titles with great quality to support those bets with marketing that rebuilds long-line franchises and pushes all of our titles higher in the charts. Second, drive multiple digital revenue streams and invest in an infrastructure that supports seamless, cross-platform game experiences. And third, relentlessly focus on cost and efficiencies throughout our operations. 
EA is executing against these strategic objectives and driving shareholder value. We are gaining share on half the number of titles we had three years ago. We lead on the strongest platforms and have a broad, rapidly growing base of Digital businesses with powerful synergies with our Packaged Goods portfolio. Executing as well as we did in Q1 built shareholder value and value for both our employees and gamers around the world. Now we would be happy to take your questions."

In terms of operating expense expectations, we've given some pretty good detail about phasing. So in Q1, we had a shorter title slate of six front-line titles versus 10 a year ago. And so, clearly that's going to impact the year-over-year comparisons in terms of marketing and sales spent. It was down sharply year-over-year Q1 versus Q1 last year. Obviously, we're going to ramp marketing sales expense through the year, and we expect, obviously, peak marketing and sales spending in the third quarter, the holiday quarter. So that's something you should build into your modeling. We are starting to get more leverage on the franchises. The important point to note is that, this is a good, all-round quarter 4 for FIFA, we talked about the success of the World Cup title with 3 million units. We also commented on the fact that live-to-date, the core FIFA 10 franchise is up about 10% versus FIFA 09, and so that's a positive indicator for leveraging sports. And lastly, for the first time, we're extending key EA properties from the packaged goods space into the social game space with FIFA Superstars. So that in and of itself represents leverage on the IP portfolio."

One, you asked about the MMO we have in development and how whether most of the spend in R&D is behind us. We’ve said previously that we’re not planning to launch a title on this fiscal year and you can expect it next. Given it’s a multi-year investment process, I guess, technically, the majority of R&D is certainly behind us by the end of this fiscal year. So correct observation. And we're looking forward to taking this into, sort of, a net investment phase in F11 to obviously what comes after that, which is hopefully build and harvest phase in F12 and beyond. On marketing, I would add just a little color. I would say that what we've been going through these last couple of years has been investing to take franchises, some of which were not performing as well or been living with lesser quality titles, like we've done in sort of fiscal '07, '08 and '09 on Need for Speed and Medal of Honor and reinvesting for growth. It's a process we've done before. We understand it well, and we think we're going to make great progress this year. And it’s our hope and my belief that we can drive marketing efficiencies in years to come as we drive chart position. But frankly, I expect to sell more Need for Speed this year than last year. And as we build that franchise, marketing will not have to scale with the overall scale of the franchise meaning marketing leverage. We want to repeat that story across many of our front-line titles."

A quick top line. I think it's actually pretty early to give you an answer on ARPU given that most Digital distribution that we've seen so far in the Packaged Goods side, particularly tests we've done on console, are very substantially active on release of the title. So it's really competing with catalog on that side of the house. On the PC side and the smaller titles that we put out there not sort of a full-PC game that are on Xbox LIVE and other services, we're pretty pleased with premium pricing, margin structure that is similar to or slightly better than our Packaged Goods business. And I think probably the thing that’s most interesting is, the margin structure is comparable to our Packaged Goods business, like on like, when it goes through a partner for distribution on the Digital side. What's interesting is we're increasingly seeing the products going directly to our own distribution which is margin-enhancing."

Between Battlefield and Medal of Honor, we’re going to see a substantial increase in our share against the FPS sector in calendar year '10 versus '09, '08, '07, '06, pick the year. I think we got a shot at getting back into a leadership position over the next couple of years. And just watch this space for news we bring you on future titles, sort of in calendar '11 and beyond. But make no mistake, we think we've got the people and the brands to take the leadership back in the FPS space. And we're intending to make a good positive share gain this year. I think that's almost a foregone conclusion that we’ll get the share gain. I don’t expect to topple either Halo or CoD this year. On Star Wars, I'd make a couple of points. One is MMO RPGs are often sort of late in coming together relative to being able to see how great a product it is. RPGs in general are that way and MMOs are even more so that way. It's actually been in the last quarter literally from what you could see at E3 on, that you can actually see just how great the title is going to be. So we've gone from the last, say, couple of years of saying, “BioWare’s a great studio, the game design is a great game design. The technology underlying architecture is well conceived and the creative team is really talented. So they should make a good game.” To still believing all those things and seeing a great game. That feels a lot better to us. It's a process you go through with most game titles and one that we sort of passed through in sort of May or June of this calendar year. In terms of how much cost we're carrying, we've never specifically identified the number although Eric and I in prior communications have indicated that the investment in the calendar year exceeds that for a typical high-scale Packaged Goods title. MMOs are an expensive business and we're investing to realize great success."

So it's about 52% growth year-over-year with strong performance across the entire portfolio. We identified about $20 million of this as being phasing-related meaning it could have fallen into any other quarter of, say, fiscal '11 or Q4 last year. And so we don't want people to extrapolate necessarily off the $20 million. I mean, if you were to take 188 and multiply it by four, it would actually tie out to our $750 million full year target. The more accurate way to look at Digital is we had strong performance here, but we're expecting a bit of a ramp up through the balance of the year to hit the 750. Second question was guidance. We’re reaffirming full year non-GAAP EPS guidance. I think it's important to keep in mind that if you look at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range for the full year, we have about 14% of the year behind us and 86% to go. And there's a lot of uncertainty out there with currency rates, demand in the key holiday quarter, et cetera. And so, we're not rolling forward upside from Q1 here into the balance of the year. So as I stated on the prepared remarks, we strongly encourage people to stay within the $0.50 to $0.70 non-GAAP EPS guidance range for the year. Your third question was title count. We have 36 titles today. We've announced a slight change in phasing for one title, but it's the same number of titles that we'd talked about 90 days ago. We’re not in a position to talk about title count for fiscal F12. It's still a bit early. But as we’ve said before, we felt that we’d restructured to a number of core titles. It felt about right. And it still allows us to get the focus and leverage on key existing Packaged Goods franchises, while still allowing each of the labels to introduce one, two or possibly three new ideas per year. So we feel that we're about in the right spot with the title count, but it's still way too early to comment about what that number might be for fiscal '12."

I'll give you some shaping though. Asia is clearly moved more to time in item-based. And if you look at the principal players in that market place, China in particular, the public traded companies, actually saw the best I can tell, an increase in their EBIT margins or their operating margins as they moved to time and item-based in part because they grow peak simultaneous users. In the western markets, we actually haven't seen sort of big heavy client-server-type setups like Eve Online or Warhammer or even World of Warcraft offer anything other than subscription with additional bolt-on charges for various moves from server-to-server and a variety of other special fees and charges. A variety of Tribe, we're working on it now. We’re seeing some success with it. But I think the market is bifurcating in a way around, maybe trifurcation, if you want to do it that way, around a couple of different ideas. Lighter experiences that are working on sites like a Pogo or sites like some of the other game sites and/or social networks are working very well for a combination of micro-transaction and advertising. We're seeing Asia move to that same model, but they came out of the game room to only a short bout with subscription, then quickly moved into micro-transaction-type models and time-based models. And at least the bigger products in the West seem to support a subscription model better. Having said that, and we’re not getting at anything in particular, we’ve anticipated that particular idea. It's something we've thought a lot about and we think there’s actually more potential on the upside than there is risk on the downside for model evolution for that type of product."

Shooters can have a very high attach rate to map pack when you’ve got strong franchises and/or partially downloadable content delivered similarly.
RPGs do as well. Sports have not traditionally provided a great good basis for that. But we've got great traction when we introduced FIFA Ultimate Team and Madden Ultimate Team and we’re building on that across a range of sports titles. I guess what I would probably tell you right now is, there appears to be a strong formula for almost all of these things when the content is great. And it's not uncommon for us to experiment once or twice before we get it right. When we put FIFA Ultimate Team out, we had a similar idea, but not exactly the same for Madden.

We're not going to get into specifics on the dollars for Playfish, but as Eric mentioned, we were at our internal forecast and they did well last quarter. That said, the comment we made was about Facebook apps in general were down 25% in DAUs. And that's because Facebook is always refining their platform. They're always making changes. They’re changing notifications. They're clamping down on some of the overuse and spam that some people were going through and changing their bookmarking system. And so they’re refining that. And as they kind of did that, we saw the overall DAUs drop for apps in general and certain games by about 25%. And now happily, we were able to -- Playfish was able to gain share because they launched some new games and grew their share. So we stayed -- we went up in MAUs and stayed pretty flat to slightly up in DAUs as well. With respect to those changes, as you can see, they kind of netted out and it feels pretty good right now. But I also will suspect that Facebook is looking at this space and seeing what they can do to try to drive even more usage there. So I don't think that the negative impacts are going to continue.

I think one of the things to remember as well is relative to the console business, the southern markets are nowhere near as developed as the U.K. And so, I do think that's a fair judgment that you're making, but I think it's also worth pointing out that the southern European markets on a installed base are substantially lower and so they’ve just probably got more room to grow. They also historically relative to consoles who’ve tended to be more price sensitive and they pick up more as price come down and you tend to get more early adopters in Scandinavia and the U.K., so they have a little bit less to grow when you see price reduction as we have this past year. So I think it's another factor. In the German market, it never fully embraced console. It tends to be more PC-centric. So it's great that you're asking the question. While we tend to want to think of Europe as one market, it is anything but. We have different regulatory regimes for how we deal with gradings in these different markets. Germany standing outside of most of the rest of Europe has. And so it's just different uptake depending on platform and titles. It's a market where Sony tends to outperform. Microsoft struggles little bit more. It's not really a mirror of the U.S.. and across North to South it tends to move differently, with the southern markets, I think, having a little more room to run given that they started a little slower."

So that's something we're going to stay abreast of, and hopefully see new opportunities for us. Lastly, with the impact of Pogo, Pogo is slightly down in terms of Club Pogo subscribers. However, they're hanging in there pretty well with revenue. And what we're doing is we’ve got a very dedicated user base there, spending about 5 billion minutes a month. And we are certainly going to continue to cultivate our portal and domain. At the same time, we’re also looking at bringing Pogo over to some of the social gaming sites, so you'll see that this year.

What we were trying to say and I would like to stick with is we think we've got the right marketing investment for introducing some of the new franchises we had this year and driving upside too, I think, or at least [indiscernible 1:11:27] for existing franchises like Madden, Medal of Honor, Need for Speed and others. So we think we've got the number about right. We, of course, make adjustments if we want to do things in the market place. So if things aren’t performing or they are performing sometimes you chase opportunities and sometimes you cut back to deal with risks, but you try to avoid a downside. I can't see through that [indiscernible 1:11:49] right now given that it’s still in front of us. The point I was trying to make, JT, is this. Great franchises often are a string of one title doing better than the last. And the one after that doing better than that. Two’s doing better than one, three’s doing better than two’s. It's judicious investment and you get marketing leverage and can grow those franchises. Franchises like Dead Space and FIFA and Madden and Medal of Honor and Battlefield are exactly the kind of franchises we want to build and take market share and grow from top 30 to top 20 to top 10 to top five over time. We think we know how to do that. We think we’ve got the quality to do that, and it's in achieving that over the course of the next couple of years, that we'll realize marketing efficiencies. It makes us better from a financial perspective where it’s a percentage spent where marketing sales can go from some 17-ish to a lower number. And so what I was trying to get at was not some I’ve-got-a-hidden-back-pocket-just-in-case-scenario, what I was trying to make was a strategic point that I frankly think we’re over-investing a couple, three points in marketing to reestablish the growth trends that are these brands. We started it last year, we got our quality right last year, sort of this management team’s second year in operation where it was their games up and the quality one up, we got better results than the year before. We want to see more of that this year and we want to continue to drive that chart position which yields the leverage. And by the way, it doesn't cost more to make those same games when they sell more units. That's our leverage drops through our business and that's what will drive it."

 Throughout this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our earnings release and the earnings slides provide a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision.
 All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise stated. Now I'll turn the call over to John Riccitiello. John?

Our bottom line reflected solid performance on the Digital side and successful cost management. EA is focused on three strategic objectives to drive shareholder value: Producing fewer, bigger, better packaged goods games; driving growth in our digital revenue streams; and controlling costs and finding operational efficiencies. In Q1, we delivered against all three objectives. Two great examples of fewer better games are hits like 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa and Battlefield: Bad Company 2. These titles owe their success in the market place to our ability to deliver top-quality games on time with effective marketing support.
 We grew digital revenues through a combination of paid, downloadable content, social games and our success on the iPad and iPhone. In addition, we successfully launched EA SPORTS Online Pass to build loyalty and online participation. We also remain on track to reduce operating expenses by $100 million this year, thanks to lower headcount, global sourcing and shared technologies.
 Based on this performance and our expectation for the remainder of the year, we reaffirm our non-GAAP FY '11 financial guidance. Now I'll turn the call over to Eric.

Non-GAAP revenue of $539 million reflects our efforts to build Digital revenue and drive Packaged Goods hits. Combined with cost controls, Q1 revenue upside translated to a non-GAAP EPS loss of $0.24, which was better than our expectation for the loss of $0.40 to $0.35 per share for the quarter.
 Q1 non-GAAP net revenue was $539 million, down 34% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, net revenue was $815 million, up 27% year-over-year. Non-GAAP revenue was down as compared to Q1 last year, which had 10 titles including The Sims 3 and its launch window, as well as an additional week of reported business.
 The impact of foreign exchange rates on non-GAAP revenue year-over-year was essentially zero this quarter. Q1 non-GAAP gross profit margin was 59.6% compared to 61.2% a year ago as a greater mix of EA Digital revenue offset the prior year's high margin, The Sims 3 release.
 On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin was 72.8% versus 50.2% a year ago. Q1 non-GAAP operating income was a loss of $109 million versus a non-GAAP operating loss of $11 million a year ago. On a GAAP basis, operating income was positive $98 million versus an operating loss of $245 million a year ago.
 Non-GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $0.24 versus a loss per share of $0.02 a year ago. GAAP-diluted earnings per share was $0.29 versus a diluted loss per share of $0.72 a year ago.
 Headcount. We ended the quarter with 7,758 employees versus 8,948 a year ago, and 7,842 in Q4 fiscal '10. 21% of our employees are now in low-cost locations.
 Cash flow from operations this quarter totaled a loss of $148 million versus a loss of $328 million a year ago. Our trailing 12-month operating cash flow has increased significantly growing from a deficit of $25 million in the 12 months ended Q1 last year to positive $332 million in the 12 months ended Q1 fiscal '11. At the same time, capital expenditures have fallen excluding the purchase of our headquarters’ facilities. This has led to an increase in free cash flow from a deficit of $117 million to positive $257 million in the 12 months just ended.
 EA remains on track to generate $250 million to $300 million in operating cash flow this year.
 EA has approximately $5.25 per share in cash, short-term investments and marketable securities. Compared with year-ago levels, cash, short-term investments and marketable securities balances are down due to cash payments for the acquisition of Playfish, the purchase of our headquarters’ facilities and lower strategic investment values.
 Inventory levels were well managed in the quarter and fell to $82 million from $215 million in the prior year. We are carrying significantly less distribution-related inventory compared to last year.
 Reserves for sales returns and allowances as a percentage of trailing six-month non-GAAP net revenue are flat at 13% and up slightly on a nine-month basis from 6% to 7% compared to last year.
 Subsequent to the end of Q1, in July we sold our minority stake in Ubisoft for a gain of approximately $28 million.
 For the industry overall, we estimate that the western world packaged goods software market is down 7% year-over-year for the June quarter and down 5% on a calendar year-to-date basis.
 Year-over-year, we see Europe performing better than North America with Europe Packaged Goods software flat calendar year-to-date compared to a decrease of 9% for North America. For the June quarter, Europe was also flat year-over-year, while North America was down 15%. Much of the weakness in the market is related to the Nintendo Wii and the music category, where EA has less exposure.
 On the positive side, we are starting to see signs of strength in the high-definition console software market, which we estimate is up 14% or $1.1 billion year-over-year and 21% calendar year-to-date. This is driven by the Sony PlayStation 3 which is up sharply on its attractive price point. Microsoft is also starting to gain traction with its new enhanced Xbox 360 form factor. This trend plays into our strength given our share position on high-definition consoles.
 The digital portion of the market continues to perform well. We estimate that the digital sector was up 25% to 35% year-over-year for the June quarter and calendar year-to-date. The total sector, inclusive of packaged goods and digital is flat to up on a calendar year-to-date basis.
 EA had a lighter release schedule for Packaged Goods in Q1 fiscal '11 with six front-line titles compared to 10 front-line titles last year including the very high margin, The Sims 3 title. Our share in Q1 was 13% in North America, 15% in Europe and 14% overall. Our calendar year-to-date share through June was 17% in North America, 16% in Europe and 16% overall.
 EA's western world Packaged Goods share is stable on a trailing 12-month basis at 18%, with a 16% share coming from EA-published titles excluding distribution.
 In Q1, our key front-line Packaged Goods title was 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa, which sold 3 million units in the quarter offsetting performance of Skate 3 and Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 11. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 continues to be a strong catalog title with 1 million units sold during Q1.
 Madden 10 continued to generate sales, meeting our expectations, selling an accumulative total of more than 6 million units through the end of Q1. FIFA 10 benefited from the success of the World Cup with live-to-date selling of approximately 11 million units, up 10% on the prior year's FIFA title. Net, we see slightly favorable trends in catalog sales. Our mix of catalog revenue was 22% for Q1 fiscal '11 compared to 21% for Q4 fiscal '10 and 17% for Q1 fiscal '10.
 Q1 non-GAAP Digital revenue increased by 52% from $124 million to $188 million year-over-year, comprising 35% of total revenue this quarter. This is the result of significant increases in PC-Digital distribution, console-downloadable content, and favorable phasing on approximately $20 million in Digital revenue, which we do not anticipate in future quarters. Mobile revenue was up slightly year-over-year to $52 million with Smart phone-related revenue compensating for a drop-off on feature phones.
 We also met internal expectations for social games-related revenue. We now have 60 million unique core registered users in our nucleus database, up from 33 million a year ago. Titles like Battlefield: Bad Company 2, FIFA 10 and 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa drove registrations in Q1. EA has 52 million monthly active social game users or MAUs. Playfish usage has remained stable, while other Facebook games have seen their MAU count fall by 25%.
 For the 12 months ended Q1 fiscal '11, non-GAAP gross profit margins improved by 3.5 points from 51.1% to 54.7% on higher Digital revenue and an improved mix of EA-published titles, showing 12-month non-GAAP operating margins improve from 0.5% to 2.5%.
 In terms of guidance, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP guidance for both revenue and EPS for the fiscal year.
 I would like to start with foreign exchange rate assumptions. Currency exchange rates remain volatile, and rate changes impact our reported revenue more than non-GAAP EPS, thanks to natural hedges in our business. On a full year basis, our earnings are mostly hedged versus the euro. Our R&D costs will increase if the Canadian dollar strengthens and we have both revenue and earnings exposure to a weakening British pound.
 Our guidance assumes the following foreign exchange rates for the fiscal year: U.S. $1.29 to the euro; U.S. $0.96 to the Canadian dollar; and U.S. $1.54 to the British pound. The spot rates as of July 30, 2010, persist during the fiscal year. We anticipate a $0.01 benefit to non-GAAP EPS and a $15 million to $20 million benefit to non-GAAP revenue for the year.
 On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the total of $3.65 billion to $3.90 billion in fiscal '11 revenue. Our Packaged Goods expectations call for publishing revenue ranging from $2.725 billion to $2.975 billion. Our Distribution revenue expectations are for approximately $175 million, and we expect approximately $750 million in Digital revenue.
 The year-over-year dollar growth of $180 million in Digital is divided roughly as follows: Approximately 25% from console full games and DLC; approximately 50% from PC and browser full games and DLC; approximately 25% for mobile, game services, subscriptions and advertising.
 We expect full year GAAP gross profit margin of approximately 56% and non-GAAP gross profit margin of approximately 60%. We expect the worldwide market inclusive of packaged goods and digital to grow 7% year-over-year in calendar 2010 based on the assumption that total worldwide packaged goods consistent with the recent industry reports will be down 3% offset by digital growth of approximately 24%.
 We expect non-GAAP revenue for the full year to be phased roughly as follows versus our midpoint revenue guidance: Q2, 21%; Q3, 38%; and Q4, 26% to 27%.
 Our title schedule still assumes 36 titles in the fiscal year, but the quarterly phasing has been changed slightly with Crysis 2 moving from Q3 to Q4. EA now plans to release seven titles in Q2, 15 titles in Q3, and eight titles in Q4.
 The shift of Crysis 2 along with other updates to our forecast changes the phasing of Q3 non-GAAP revenue, which is now expected to be approximately 38% of full year revenue. In addition, Q4 phasing increases to a range of 26% to 27%.
 Our top 20 titles for fiscal '11 are expected to generate approximately 80% of total non-distribution Packaged Goods revenue. This compares to 76% in fiscal '10.
 Non-GAAP operating expenses for the full year are expected to be approximately $2.0 billion and are phased as follows: Approximately $500 million in Q2, with 55% of the remaining operating expense spending falling into Q3 and 45% falling into Q4; we expect 27% to 28% R&D; 18% to 19% marketing and sales; and 7% G&A for the full year as a percent of total revenue.
 EA is incurring significant development costs for a major new massively multiplayer online game. However, this game is not expected to ship in fiscal '11.
 We expect to end fiscal '11 with total headcount of approximately 8,200 and are managing headcount consistent with the restructuring plan that called for a shift from high-cost to low-cost locations.
 Total low-cost location headcount is expected to increase to 25% by the end of fiscal '11.
 In terms of non-GAAP EPS, we are maintaining guidance for the full year at $0.50 to $0.70 per share on 334 million diluted shares. This corresponds to a non-GAAP operating income margin of approximately 6% to 8%. Net, we maintain the EPS range as we offset stronger-than-expected Q1 performance with currency fluctuations, evolving market conditions, title level forecast risks and phasing changes in our title plan. With only 14% of the year's revenue behind us and some timing-related upside in Q1, we encourage modeling in line with our full year guidance.
 On a GAAP basis, we are reaffirming our GAAP net review guidance of $3.35 billion to $3.60 billion while we are slightly increasing GAAP EPS guidance to a range of a loss of $1.00 to $0.70 per share due to a gain on sale of strategic investments and reduced stock-compensation expense.
 For Q2 fiscal '11, we're providing non-GAAP revenue and EPS guidance in line with our comments from last quarter. We expect Q2 non-GAAP revenue between $775 million and $825 million and a non-GAAP EPS loss of $0.15 to $0.10.
 Non-GAAP gross profit margin is expected to be approximately 55%. Operating expense is expected to be approximately $500 million and share count is an estimated $329 million. This concludes our outlook and guidance. Now I'll turn the call over to John Schappert.

Then, I'll review our Packaged Goods titles and their achievements at E3. I'll end with our key Digital initiative.
 The western world video game industry is solid and well ahead of where we were at this point in the last cycle. All in, it's a $30 billion segment counting Digital, second sale and traditional Packaged Goods. This industry has doubled in the last five years.
 Packaged Goods alone in North America and Europe were $19.9 billion in 2009 versus $14 billion at the same point in the PS2 cycle back in 2004. That's about $6 billion of growth in Packaged Goods.
 Second, reports that Packaged Goods is down 9% year-to-date in North America can be misunderstood without recognizing the disproportionate impact of the music category, where EA has limited exposure and where plastic skews the software sales numbers. In North America, adjusting for music, Packaged Goods are actually down 4% year-over-year versus down 9% as reported.
 EA is a leading third-party publisher in Europe, which is performing better than North America year-over-year. Europe is not represented in the North American industry reports.
 Third, let's not forget second sale is one way consumers are satisfying their growing appetite for gaming. We estimate that Packaged Goods' revenue would be as much as 15% bigger including second sale, which is absent from industry data report.
 Finally, the list of digital revenue streams not captured by data services include digital-game downloads, MMO subscriptions, mobile-iPad revenues, payments for virtual goods and free-to-play browser games, console-downloadable content and social network gaming and advertising. By some estimates, as much as 25% of the Western Games segment is not counted in industry data reports.
 Turning to the quarter just ended in the current year, the picture is very strong where EA participates most. We're seeing a bump in high-definition console sales, which is good for EA and should translate into positive momentum for software revenue. While Wii software is down 13% year-to-date in the western world, high-definition console software revenue is up 21% year-to-date. It was up 25% for the quarter.
 The redesigned Slim PS3 from last fall and recently released, Slim Xbox 360, continue to sell well. In particular, PlayStation 3 software’s up 40% both year-to-date and in the quarter, which substantially benefits EA as the leading third-party publisher on this platform.
 EA share remains healthy at 14% on a tighter slate, thanks to high quality and blockbuster franchises such as FIFA and Battlefield, which are generating both Packaged and Digital revenue.
 In summary, we believe games are healthy, particularly where EA leads on high-definition console and in Digital.
 Turning to specific game platforms. Our trends remain strong with western world PC share north of 30%, thanks to the Sims and other titles. Our North American share on Xbox 360 and PS3 positioned EA to benefit from high-definition console momentum. And our Wii share, while lower, continues to lead western third-party publishers.
 Now to E3. Critics recognize EA's singular focus and commitment to quality. When it was over, EA won more nominations than any other publisher, 15. And we won more awards than any other publisher, four. NBA Jam from EA Canada won Best Sports Game. Rock Band 3 from Harmonix MTV, won Best Social Game. Need for Speed Hot Pursuit from Criterion, won Best Racing Game. And Star Wars: The Old Republic from BioWare and Lucas Arts, won Best Role-Playing Game.
 Q2 is shaping up well, with NCAA Football '11 off to a good start. This year's game earned a Metacritic rating of 86, up three points from last year, which is contributing to the early buzz. Madden NFL 11 from our Tiburon Studio has solid pre-orders and is allowing demo users with a breakthrough innovation called GameFlow that gets players into the action much quicker without sacrificing the deep playbook hard-core fans demand.
 GameFlow makes Madden much more accessible to new players.
 The World Cup has already been very good to EA, and it sets up FIFA '11 from EA Canada for a strong release in Q2. World Cup years tend to face special dividends to FIFA in the fall. And this year, we’ve got a game that is packed with innovations including Personality Plus for enhancing player authenticity, Pro Passing and a creation center tool for deep customization of teams and players online.
 Turning to the holiday quarter. We'll lead off Q3 with Medal of Honor, which explores the conflict in Afghanistan with a deeply engaging single-player game built at EA Los Angeles, along with an incredible multiplayer experience from the Battlefield team at our DICE Studio in Stockholm.
 The superior multiplayer is a big point of difference with other distributors in this market and we plan to promote it heavily. Medal of Honor blew away the critics at E3 in June. Mo [ph 31:16] is back and represents another step towards our goal of regaining leadership in the FPS segment.
 Next up is Need for Speed Hot Pursuit, another winner at E3. We were especially excited by the return of Police: The Hot Pursuit. This action racing title is strongly anticipated at retail, and with great online features like auto log, raises the bar for multiplayer racing.
 EA SPORTS will also be launching EA SPORTS Active 2, the first cross-platform fitness game and the first fitness game that includes a heart rate monitor. EA SPORTS Active 2 is also the first fitness game with downloadable exercise routines and strong community features.
 EA play will publish the first console and handheld versions of The Sims 3. For the first time, Sims fans can enjoy playing at high-definition on PS3 and Xbox 360.
 Our EA Games Label has a Q4 lineup anchored by Crysis 2 from Crytek, which has been moved from Q3 for a better window and polishing. Crysis 2 was a standout at E3 and is part of our ongoing campaign for FPS leadership.
 Dead Space 2 follows on one of the most popular horror games of 2008 and has a great fan base, selling through 2 million copies in its first iteration. This year, the game is even better and jam-packed with action and horror.
 We’re thrilled to bring bigger, better hits from the best talent in the industry to the broadest base of platforms and channels, feel very good about the Games segment and our Packaged Goods plan.
 Now I'll move to our Digital initiative. We’re seeing good growth for our full game downloads through PC-download retailers, particularly Battlefield: Bad Company 2 performed well. We're also seeing good results on popular full games through the console networks such as Battlefield 1943 and Death Spank.
 Consumers are embracing downloadable content. Additional content for FIFA Ultimate Team 2, Dragon Age and Mass Effect 2 has been strong. PlayStation is gaining share on Facebook. EA has over 15 million monthly active social game users. Playfish titles driving usage include Pet Society, Restaurant City, Hotel City and FIFA Superstars. Playfish is gaining share on the platform as its usage has remained stable, while other Facebook games have seen their monthly audience fall by 25% on average due to revisions to access and communications channels on the site.
 In Asia, FIFA Online 2 Korea had record results. In June, we surpassed 5 million registered players and had our highest grossing revenue month ever. We remain a top three game in the world's most online-oriented market.
 Turning to Mobile. Smart phone revenue continues to grow with the popularity of the Apple platform. By revenue, EA is the number one publisher on the app store and had nine of the top 10 grossing games on the iPhone 4 launch last month. On feature phones, EA is taking share and now has 34% of the U.S. feature phone game market according to Nielsen.
 And on Android, EA launched FIFA 10 with more titles coming soon.
 Lastly, a word about EA SPORTS Online Pass. Based on early Tiger and NCAA Football results, we are pleased to see 60% to 70% of online-connected users redeeming the code.
 The level of online play amongst our user base is up from last year and revenue from paid-downloadable content is also up. Now I'll turn the call back to John Riccitiello.

Stepping back, we’ve long been focusing on three strategic objectives.
 First, build fewer, bigger Packaged Goods titles with great quality to support those bets with marketing that rebuilds long-line franchises and pushes all of our titles higher in the charts. Second, drive multiple digital revenue streams and invest in an infrastructure that supports seamless, cross-platform game experiences. And third, relentlessly focus on cost and efficiencies throughout our operations.
 EA is executing against these strategic objectives and driving shareholder value. We are gaining share on half the number of titles we had three years ago. We lead on the strongest platforms and have a broad, rapidly growing base of Digital businesses with powerful synergies with our Packaged Goods portfolio. Executing as well as we did in Q1 built shareholder value and value for both our employees and gamers around the world. Now we would be happy to take your questions.

In terms of operating expense expectations, we've given some pretty good detail about phasing. So in Q1, we had a shorter title slate of six front-line titles versus 10 a year ago. And so, clearly that's going to impact the year-over-year comparisons in terms of marketing and sales spent. It was down sharply year-over-year Q1 versus Q1 last year. Obviously, we're going to ramp marketing sales expense through the year, and we expect, obviously, peak marketing and sales spending in the third quarter, the holiday quarter. So that's something you should build into your modeling. We are starting to get more leverage on the franchises. The important point to note is that, this is a good, all-round quarter 4 for FIFA, we talked about the success of the World Cup title with 3 million units. We also commented on the fact that live-to-date, the core FIFA 10 franchise is up about 10% versus FIFA 09, and so that's a positive indicator for leveraging sports. And lastly, for the first time, we're extending key EA properties from the packaged goods space into the social game space with FIFA Superstars. So that in and of itself represents leverage on the IP portfolio.

One, you asked about the MMO we have in development and how whether most of the spend in R&D is behind us. We’ve said previously that we’re not planning to launch a title on this fiscal year and you can expect it next. Given it’s a multi-year investment process, I guess, technically, the majority of R&D is certainly behind us by the end of this fiscal year. So correct observation. And we're looking forward to taking this into, sort of, a net investment phase in F11 to obviously what comes after that, which is hopefully build and harvest phase in F12 and beyond. On marketing, I would add just a little color. I would say that what we've been going through these last couple of years has been investing to take franchises, some of which were not performing as well or been living with lesser quality titles, like we've done in sort of fiscal '07, '08 and '09 on Need for Speed and Medal of Honor and reinvesting for growth. It's a process we've done before. We understand it well, and we think we're going to make great progress this year. And it’s our hope and my belief that we can drive marketing efficiencies in years to come as we drive chart position. But frankly, I expect to sell more Need for Speed this year than last year. And as we build that franchise, marketing will not have to scale with the overall scale of the franchise meaning marketing leverage. We want to repeat that story across many of our front-line titles.

A quick top line. I think it's actually pretty early to give you an answer on ARPU given that most Digital distribution that we've seen so far in the Packaged Goods side, particularly tests we've done on console, are very substantially active on release of the title. So it's really competing with catalog on that side of the house.

And I think probably the thing that’s most interesting is, the margin structure is comparable to our Packaged Goods business, like on like, when it goes through a partner for distribution on the Digital side. What's interesting is we're increasingly seeing the products going directly to our own distribution which is margin-enhancing.

Between Battlefield and Medal of Honor, we’re going to see a substantial increase in our share against the FPS sector in calendar year '10 versus '09, '08, '07, '06, pick the year. I think we got a shot at getting back into a leadership position over the next couple of years. And just watch this space for news we bring you on future titles, sort of in calendar '11 and beyond. But make no mistake, we think we've got the people and the brands to take the leadership back in the FPS space. And we're intending to make a good positive share gain this year. I think that's almost a foregone conclusion that we’ll get the share gain. I don’t expect to topple either Halo or CoD this year. On Star Wars, I'd make a couple of points. One is MMO RPGs are often sort of late in coming together relative to being able to see how great a product it is. RPGs in general are that way and MMOs are even more so that way. It's actually been in the last quarter literally from what you could see at E3 on, that you can actually see just how great the title is going to be. So we've gone from the last, say, couple of years of saying, “BioWare’s a great studio, the game design is a great game design. The technology underlying architecture is well conceived and the creative team is really talented. So they should make a good game.” To still believing all those things and seeing a great game. That feels a lot better to us. It's a process you go through with most game titles and one that we sort of passed through in sort of May or June of this calendar year. In terms of how much cost we're carrying, we've never specifically identified the number although Eric and I in prior communications have indicated that the investment in the calendar year exceeds that for a typical high-scale Packaged Goods title. MMOs are an expensive business and we're investing to realize great success.

Wondering if you could quantify that. And I was wondering given the upside in the first quarter, if you guys chose not to raise at least the lower end of the EPS guidance. If you could comment on that a little bit. And then the second question is on the SKU count from this point on or title count, I think 36 this year. Is 35 to 40 sort of a fair number to assume for the coming years with growth coming from higher installed base and more sell through?

So it's about 52% growth year-over-year with strong performance across the entire portfolio. We identified about $20 million of this as being phasing-related meaning it could have fallen into any other quarter of, say, fiscal '11 or Q4 last year. And so we don't want people to extrapolate necessarily off the $20 million. I mean, if you were to take 188 and multiply it by four, it would actually tie out to our $750 million full year target. The more accurate way to look at Digital is we had strong performance here, but we're expecting a bit of a ramp up through the balance of the year to hit the 750. Second question was guidance. We’re reaffirming full year non-GAAP EPS guidance. I think it's important to keep in mind that if you look at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range for the full year, we have about 14% of the year behind us and 86% to go. And there's a lot of uncertainty out there with currency rates, demand in the key holiday quarter, et cetera. And so, we're not rolling forward upside from Q1 here into the balance of the year. So as I stated on the prepared remarks, we strongly encourage people to stay within the $0.50 to $0.70 non-GAAP EPS guidance range for the year. Your third question was title count. We have 36 titles today. We've announced a slight change in phasing for one title, but it's the same number of titles that we'd talked about 90 days ago. We’re not in a position to talk about title count for fiscal F12. It's still a bit early. But as we’ve said before, we felt that we’d restructured to a number of core titles. It felt about right. And it still allows us to get the focus and leverage on key existing Packaged Goods franchises, while still allowing each of the labels to introduce one, two or possibly three new ideas per year. So we feel that we're about in the right spot with the title count, but it's still way too early to comment about what that number might be for fiscal '12.

I'll give you some shaping though. Asia is clearly moved more to time in item-based. And if you look at the principal players in that market place, China in particular, the public traded companies, actually saw the best I can tell, an increase in their EBIT margins or their operating margins as they moved to time and item-based in part because they grow peak simultaneous users. In the western markets, we actually haven't seen sort of big heavy client-server-type setups like Eve Online or Warhammer or even World of Warcraft offer anything other than subscription with additional bolt-on charges for various moves from server-to-server and a variety of other special fees and charges. A variety of Tribe, we're working on it now. We’re seeing some success with it. But I think the market is bifurcating in a way around, maybe trifurcation, if you want to do it that way, around a couple of different ideas. Lighter experiences that are working on sites like a Pogo or sites like some of the other game sites and/or social networks are working very well for a combination of micro-transaction and advertising. We're seeing Asia move to that same model, but they came out of the game room to only a short bout with subscription, then quickly moved into micro-transaction-type models and time-based models. And at least the bigger products in the West seem to support a subscription model better. Having said that, and we’re not getting at anything in particular, we’ve anticipated that particular idea. It's something we've thought a lot about and we think there’s actually more potential on the upside than there is risk on the downside for model evolution for that type of product.

Fairly typically in the 20% to 40% range, depending how successful the individual pack is. Shooters can have a very high attach rate to map pack when you’ve got strong franchises and/or partially downloadable content delivered similarly.
 RPGs do as well. Sports have not traditionally provided a great good basis for that. But we've got great traction when we introduced FIFA Ultimate Team and Madden Ultimate Team and we’re building on that across a range of sports titles. I guess what I would probably tell you right now is, there appears to be a strong formula for almost all of these things when the content is great. And it's not uncommon for us to experiment once or twice before we get it right. When we put FIFA Ultimate Team out, we had a similar idea, but not exactly the same for Madden. Madden didn't work, FIFA did. Now Ultimate Team’s the formula across the board. So I would tell you this is our fastest-growing Digital revenue stream. It's doing really well for us. We're seeing more success than failure, but as we build this business, we’re still learning as we go along.

So we stayed -- we went up in MAUs and stayed pretty flat to slightly up in DAUs as well. With respect to those changes, as you can see, they kind of netted out and it feels pretty good right now. But I also will suspect that Facebook is looking at this space and seeing what they can do to try to drive even more usage there. So I don't think that the negative impacts are going to continue. In fact, I wouldn't doubt if we see some positive changes too as they continue to refine their canvas.

I think one of the things to remember as well is relative to the console business, the southern markets are nowhere near as developed as the U.K. And so, I do think that's a fair judgment that you're making, but I think it's also worth pointing out that the southern European markets on a installed base are substantially lower and so they’ve just probably got more room to grow. They also historically relative to consoles who’ve tended to be more price sensitive and they pick up more as price come down and you tend to get more early adopters in Scandinavia and the U.K., so they have a little bit less to grow when you see price reduction as we have this past year. So I think it's another factor. In the German market, it never fully embraced console. It tends to be more PC-centric. So it's great that you're asking the question. While we tend to want to think of Europe as one market, it is anything but. We have different regulatory regimes for how we deal with gradings in these different markets. Germany standing outside of most of the rest of Europe has. And so it's just different uptake depending on platform and titles. It's a market where Sony tends to outperform. Microsoft struggles little bit more. It's not really a mirror of the U.S.. and across North to South it tends to move differently, with the southern markets, I think, having a little more room to run given that they started a little slower.

That being said, we also understood it was a new segment so we were pioneering something and I think that we're happy with the results that we've seen. And as I've said before, we think that our IP will continue to do well in this space, so there will be other games from Playfish using EA IP that you’ll be seeing launch in the not-too-distant future. Nothing to announce right now, though. With respect to the announcements, and you mentioned Google and Yahoo and other social networking sites, there's a lot of talk and a lot of buzz these days. We get excited about that. So we are platform agnostic and we do well when there's other platforms and we love our success on Facebook and at the same time look forward to other people creating new platforms for us to take our IP and excel on. So that's something we're going to stay abreast of, and hopefully see new opportunities for us. Lastly, with the impact of Pogo, Pogo is slightly down in terms of Club Pogo subscribers. However, they're hanging in there pretty well with revenue. And what we're doing is we’ve got a very dedicated user base there, spending about 5 billion minutes a month. And we are certainly going to continue to cultivate our portal and domain. At the same time, we’re also looking at bringing Pogo over to some of the social gaming sites, so you'll see that this year. And Pogo is already in beta on Facebook. So we've got high hopes for Pogo and it hangs in there pretty well despite the trends in casual gaming being kind of down in that segment. They're hanging in there pretty well and we have upside, we hope, if the Facebook consumer will enjoy Pogo later this year when I launch it.

What we were trying to say and I would like to stick with is we think we've got the right marketing investment for introducing some of the new franchises we had this year and driving upside too, I think, or at least [indiscernible 1:11:27] for existing franchises like Madden, Medal of Honor, Need for Speed and others. So we think we've got the number about right. We, of course, make adjustments if we want to do things in the market place. So if things aren’t performing or they are performing sometimes you chase opportunities and sometimes you cut back to deal with risks, but you try to avoid a downside. I can't see through that [indiscernible 1:11:49] right now given that it’s still in front of us. The point I was trying to make, JT, is this. Great franchises often are a string of one title doing better than the last. And the one after that doing better than that. Two’s doing better than one, three’s doing better than two’s. It's judicious investment and you get marketing leverage and can grow those franchises. Franchises like Dead Space and FIFA and Madden and Medal of Honor and Battlefield are exactly the kind of franchises we want to build and take market share and grow from top 30 to top 20 to top 10 to top five over time. We think we know how to do that. We think we’ve got the quality to do that, and it's in achieving that over the course of the next couple of years, that we'll realize marketing efficiencies. It makes us better from a financial perspective where it’s a percentage spent where marketing sales can go from some 17-ish to a lower number. And so what I was trying to get at was not some I’ve-got-a-hidden-back-pocket-just-in-case-scenario, what I was trying to make was a strategic point that I frankly think we’re over-investing a couple, three points in marketing to reestablish the growth trends that are these brands. We started it last year, we got our quality right last year, sort of this management team’s second year in operation where it was their games up and the quality one up, we got better results than the year before. We want to see more of that this year and we want to continue to drive that chart position which yields the leverage. And by the way, it doesn't cost more to make those same games when they sell more units. That's our leverage drops through our business and that's what will drive it.

Our bottom line reflected solid performance on the Digital side and successful cost management. EA is focused on three strategic objectives to drive shareholder value: Producing fewer, bigger, better packaged goods games; driving growth in our digital revenue streams; and controlling costs and finding operational efficiencies. In Q1, we delivered against all three objectives. Two great examples of fewer better games are hits like 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa and Battlefield: Bad Company 2. These titles owe their success in the market place to our ability to deliver top-quality games on time with effective marketing support. 
We grew digital revenues through a combination of paid, downloadable content, social games and our success on the iPad and iPhone. In addition, we successfully launched EA SPORTS Online Pass to build loyalty and online participation. We also remain on track to reduce operating expenses by $100 million this year, thanks to lower headcount, global sourcing and shared technologies.

Non-GAAP revenue of $539 million reflects our efforts to build Digital revenue and drive Packaged Goods hits. Combined with cost controls, Q1 revenue upside translated to a non-GAAP EPS loss of $0.24, which was better than our expectation for the loss of $0.40 to $0.35 per share for the quarter.
Q1 non-GAAP net revenue was $539 million, down 34% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, net revenue was $815 million, up 27% year-over-year. Non-GAAP revenue was down as compared to Q1 last year, which had 10 titles including The Sims 3 and its launch window, as well as an additional week of reported business.
The impact of foreign exchange rates on non-GAAP revenue year-over-year was essentially zero this quarter. Q1 non-GAAP gross profit margin was 59.6% compared to 61.2% a year ago as a greater mix of EA Digital revenue offset the prior year's high margin, The Sims 3 release.
On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin was 72.8% versus 50.2% a year ago. Q1 non-GAAP operating income was a loss of $109 million versus a non-GAAP operating loss of $11 million a year ago. On a GAAP basis, operating income was positive $98 million versus an operating loss of $245 million a year ago.
Non-GAAP earnings per share was a loss of $0.24 versus a loss per share of $0.02 a year ago. GAAP-diluted earnings per share was $0.29 versus a diluted loss per share of $0.72 a year ago.
Headcount. We ended the quarter with 7,758 employees versus 8,948 a year ago, and 7,842 in Q4 fiscal '10. 21% of our employees are now in low-cost locations.
Cash flow from operations this quarter totaled a loss of $148 million versus a loss of $328 million a year ago. Our trailing 12-month operating cash flow has increased significantly growing from a deficit of $25 million in the 12 months ended Q1 last year to positive $332 million in the 12 months ended Q1 fiscal '11. At the same time, capital expenditures have fallen excluding the purchase of our headquarters’ facilities. This has led to an increase in free cash flow from a deficit of $117 million to positive $257 million in the 12 months just ended.
EA remains on track to generate $250 million to $300 million in operating cash flow this year.
EA has approximately $5.25 per share in cash, short-term investments and marketable securities. Compared with year-ago levels, cash, short-term investments and marketable securities balances are down due to cash payments for the acquisition of Playfish, the purchase of our headquarters’ facilities and lower strategic investment values.
Inventory levels were well managed in the quarter and fell to $82 million from $215 million in the prior year. We are carrying significantly less distribution-related inventory compared to last year.
Reserves for sales returns and allowances as a percentage of trailing six-month non-GAAP net revenue are flat at 13% and up slightly on a nine-month basis from 6% to 7% compared to last year.
Subsequent to the end of Q1, in July we sold our minority stake in Ubisoft for a gain of approximately $28 million.
For the industry overall, we estimate that the western world packaged goods software market is down 7% year-over-year for the June quarter and down 5% on a calendar year-to-date basis.
Year-over-year, we see Europe performing better than North America with Europe Packaged Goods software flat calendar year-to-date compared to a decrease of 9% for North America. For the June quarter, Europe was also flat year-over-year, while North America was down 15%. Much of the weakness in the market is related to the Nintendo Wii and the music category, where EA has less exposure. 
On the positive side, we are starting to see signs of strength in the high-definition console software market, which we estimate is up 14% or $1.1 billion year-over-year and 21% calendar year-to-date. This is driven by the Sony PlayStation 3 which is up sharply on its attractive price point. Microsoft is also starting to gain traction with its new enhanced Xbox 360 form factor. This trend plays into our strength given our share position on high-definition consoles. 
The digital portion of the market continues to perform well. We estimate that the digital sector was up 25% to 35% year-over-year for the June quarter and calendar year-to-date. The total sector, inclusive of packaged goods and digital is flat to up on a calendar year-to-date basis.
EA had a lighter release schedule for Packaged Goods in Q1 fiscal '11 with six front-line titles compared to 10 front-line titles last year including the very high margin, The Sims 3 title. Our share in Q1 was 13% in North America, 15% in Europe and 14% overall. Our calendar year-to-date share through June was 17% in North America, 16% in Europe and 16% overall.
EA's western world Packaged Goods share is stable on a trailing 12-month basis at 18%, with a 16% share coming from EA-published titles excluding distribution.
In Q1, our key front-line Packaged Goods title was 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa, which sold 3 million units in the quarter offsetting performance of Skate 3 and Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 11. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 continues to be a strong catalog title with 1 million units sold during Q1.
Madden 10 continued to generate sales, meeting our expectations, selling an accumulative total of more than 6 million units through the end of Q1. FIFA 10 benefited from the success of the World Cup with live-to-date selling of approximately 11 million units, up 10% on the prior year's FIFA title. Net, we see slightly favorable trends in catalog sales. Our mix of catalog revenue was 22% for Q1 fiscal '11 compared to 21% for Q4 fiscal '10 and 17% for Q1 fiscal '10.
Q1 non-GAAP Digital revenue increased by 52% from $124 million to $188 million year-over-year, comprising 35% of total revenue this quarter. This is the result of significant increases in PC-Digital distribution, console-downloadable content, and favorable phasing on approximately $20 million in Digital revenue, which we do not anticipate in future quarters. Mobile revenue was up slightly year-over-year to $52 million with Smart phone-related revenue compensating for a drop-off on feature phones.
We also met internal expectations for social games-related revenue. We now have 60 million unique core registered users in our nucleus database, up from 33 million a year ago. Titles like Battlefield: Bad Company 2, FIFA 10 and 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa drove registrations in Q1. EA has 52 million monthly active social game users or MAUs. Playfish usage has remained stable, while other Facebook games have seen their MAU count fall by 25%. 
For the 12 months ended Q1 fiscal '11, non-GAAP gross profit margins improved by 3.5 points from 51.1% to 54.7% on higher Digital revenue and an improved mix of EA-published titles, showing 12-month non-GAAP operating margins improve from 0.5% to 2.5%.
In terms of guidance, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP guidance for both revenue and EPS for the fiscal year.
I would like to start with foreign exchange rate assumptions. Currency exchange rates remain volatile, and rate changes impact our reported revenue more than non-GAAP EPS, thanks to natural hedges in our business. On a full year basis, our earnings are mostly hedged versus the euro. Our R&D costs will increase if the Canadian dollar strengthens and we have both revenue and earnings exposure to a weakening British pound. 
Our guidance assumes the following foreign exchange rates for the fiscal year: U.S. $1.29 to the euro; U.S. $0.96 to the Canadian dollar; and U.S. $1.54 to the British pound. The spot rates as of July 30, 2010, persist during the fiscal year. We anticipate a $0.01 benefit to non-GAAP EPS and a $15 million to $20 million benefit to non-GAAP revenue for the year.
On a non-GAAP basis, we expect the total of $3.65 billion to $3.90 billion in fiscal '11 revenue. Our Packaged Goods expectations call for publishing revenue ranging from $2.725 billion to $2.975 billion. Our Distribution revenue expectations are for approximately $175 million, and we expect approximately $750 million in Digital revenue.
The year-over-year dollar growth of $180 million in Digital is divided roughly as follows: Approximately 25% from console full games and DLC; approximately 50% from PC and browser full games and DLC; approximately 25% for mobile, game services, subscriptions and advertising. 
We expect full year GAAP gross profit margin of approximately 56% and non-GAAP gross profit margin of approximately 60%. We expect the worldwide market inclusive of packaged goods and digital to grow 7% year-over-year in calendar 2010 based on the assumption that total worldwide packaged goods consistent with the recent industry reports will be down 3% offset by digital growth of approximately 24%.
We expect non-GAAP revenue for the full year to be phased roughly as follows versus our midpoint revenue guidance: Q2, 21%; Q3, 38%; and Q4, 26% to 27%.
Our title schedule still assumes 36 titles in the fiscal year, but the quarterly phasing has been changed slightly with Crysis 2 moving from Q3 to Q4. EA now plans to release seven titles in Q2, 15 titles in Q3, and eight titles in Q4.
The shift of Crysis 2 along with other updates to our forecast changes the phasing of Q3 non-GAAP revenue, which is now expected to be approximately 38% of full year revenue. In addition, Q4 phasing increases to a range of 26% to 27%.
Our top 20 titles for fiscal '11 are expected to generate approximately 80% of total non-distribution Packaged Goods revenue. This compares to 76% in fiscal '10.
Non-GAAP operating expenses for the full year are expected to be approximately $2.0 billion and are phased as follows: Approximately $500 million in Q2, with 55% of the remaining operating expense spending falling into Q3 and 45% falling into Q4; we expect 27% to 28% R&D; 18% to 19% marketing and sales; and 7% G&A for the full year as a percent of total revenue.
EA is incurring significant development costs for a major new massively multiplayer online game. However, this game is not expected to ship in fiscal '11.
We expect to end fiscal '11 with total headcount of approximately 8,200 and are managing headcount consistent with the restructuring plan that called for a shift from high-cost to low-cost locations.
Total low-cost location headcount is expected to increase to 25% by the end of fiscal '11.
In terms of non-GAAP EPS, we are maintaining guidance for the full year at $0.50 to $0.70 per share on 334 million diluted shares. This corresponds to a non-GAAP operating income margin of approximately 6% to 8%. Net, we maintain the EPS range as we offset stronger-than-expected Q1 performance with currency fluctuations, evolving market conditions, title level forecast risks and phasing changes in our title plan. With only 14% of the year's revenue behind us and some timing-related upside in Q1, we encourage modeling in line with our full year guidance.
On a GAAP basis, we are reaffirming our GAAP net review guidance of $3.35 billion to $3.60 billion while we are slightly increasing GAAP EPS guidance to a range of a loss of $1.00 to $0.70 per share due to a gain on sale of strategic investments and reduced stock-compensation expense.
For Q2 fiscal '11, we're providing non-GAAP revenue and EPS guidance in line with our comments from last quarter. We expect Q2 non-GAAP revenue between $775 million and $825 million and a non-GAAP EPS loss of $0.15 to $0.10.
Non-GAAP gross profit margin is expected to be approximately 55%. Operating expense is expected to be approximately $500 million and share count is an estimated $329 million. This concludes our outlook and guidance. Now I'll turn the call over to John Schappert."

Then, I'll review our Packaged Goods titles and their achievements at E3. I'll end with our key Digital initiative.
The western world video game industry is solid and well ahead of where we were at this point in the last cycle. All in, it's a $30 billion segment counting Digital, second sale and traditional Packaged Goods. This industry has doubled in the last five years. 
Packaged Goods alone in North America and Europe were $19.9 billion in 2009 versus $14 billion at the same point in the PS2 cycle back in 2004. That's about $6 billion of growth in Packaged Goods. 
Second, reports that Packaged Goods is down 9% year-to-date in North America can be misunderstood without recognizing the disproportionate impact of the music category, where EA has limited exposure and where plastic skews the software sales numbers. In North America, adjusting for music, Packaged Goods are actually down 4% year-over-year versus down 9% as reported.
EA is a leading third-party publisher in Europe, which is performing better than North America year-over-year. Europe is not represented in the North American industry reports. 
Third, let's not forget second sale is one way consumers are satisfying their growing appetite for gaming. We estimate that Packaged Goods' revenue would be as much as 15% bigger including second sale, which is absent from industry data report.
Finally, the list of digital revenue streams not captured by data services include digital-game downloads, MMO subscriptions, mobile-iPad revenues, payments for virtual goods and free-to-play browser games, console-downloadable content and social network gaming and advertising. By some estimates, as much as 25% of the Western Games segment is not counted in industry data reports.
Turning to the quarter just ended in the current year, the picture is very strong where EA participates most. We're seeing a bump in high-definition console sales, which is good for EA and should translate into positive momentum for software revenue. While Wii software is down 13% year-to-date in the western world, high-definition console software revenue is up 21% year-to-date. It was up 25% for the quarter. 
The redesigned Slim PS3 from last fall and recently released, Slim Xbox 360, continue to sell well. In particular, PlayStation 3 software’s up 40% both year-to-date and in the quarter, which substantially benefits EA as the leading third-party publisher on this platform. 
EA share remains healthy at 14% on a tighter slate, thanks to high quality and blockbuster franchises such as FIFA and Battlefield, which are generating both Packaged and Digital revenue.
In summary, we believe games are healthy, particularly where EA leads on high-definition console and in Digital.
Turning to specific game platforms. Our trends remain strong with western world PC share north of 30%, thanks to the Sims and other titles. Our North American share on Xbox 360 and PS3 positioned EA to benefit from high-definition console momentum. And our Wii share, while lower, continues to lead western third-party publishers.
Now to E3. Critics recognize EA's singular focus and commitment to quality. When it was over, EA won more nominations than any other publisher, 15. And we won more awards than any other publisher, four. NBA Jam from EA Canada won Best Sports Game. Rock Band 3 from Harmonix MTV, won Best Social Game. Need for Speed Hot Pursuit from Criterion, won Best Racing Game. And Star Wars: The Old Republic from BioWare and Lucas Arts, won Best Role-Playing Game.
Q2 is shaping up well, with NCAA Football '11 off to a good start. This year's game earned a Metacritic rating of 86, up three points from last year, which is contributing to the early buzz. Madden NFL 11 from our Tiburon Studio has solid pre-orders and is allowing demo users with a breakthrough innovation called GameFlow that gets players into the action much quicker without sacrificing the deep playbook hardcore fans demand. 
GameFlow makes Madden much more accessible to new players. 
The World Cup has already been very good to EA, and it sets up FIFA '11 from EA Canada for a strong release in Q2. World Cup years tend to face special dividends to FIFA in the fall. And this year, we’ve got a game that is packed with innovations including Personality Plus for enhancing player authenticity, Pro Passing and a creation center tool for deep customization of teams and players online.
Turning to the holiday quarter. We'll lead off Q3 with Medal of Honor, which explores the conflict in Afghanistan with a deeply engaging single-player game built at EA Los Angeles, along with an incredible multiplayer experience from the Battlefield team at our DICE Studio in Stockholm. 
The superior multiplayer is a big point of difference with other distributors in this market and we plan to promote it heavily. Medal of Honor blew away the critics at E3 in June. Moe [ph] (31:16) is back and represents another step towards our goal of regaining leadership in the FPS segment. 
Next up is Need for Speed Hot Pursuit, another winner at E3. We were especially excited by the return of Police: The Hot Pursuit. This action racing title is strongly anticipated at retail, and with great online features like auto log, raises the bar for multiplayer racing.
EA SPORTS will also be launching EA SPORTS Active 2, the first cross-platform fitness game and the first fitness game that includes a heart rate monitor. EA SPORTS Active 2 is also the first fitness game with downloadable exercise routines and strong community features.
EA play will publish the first console and handheld versions of The Sims 3. For the first time, Sims fans can enjoy playing at high-definition on PS3 and Xbox 360.
Our EA Games Label has a Q4 lineup anchored by Crysis 2 from Crytek, which has been moved from Q3 for a better window and polishing. Crysis 2 was a standout at E3 and is part of our ongoing campaign for FPS leadership.
Dead Space 2 follows on one of the most popular horror games of 2008 and has a great fan base, selling through 2 million copies in its first iteration. This year, the game is even better and jam-packed with action and horror.
We’re thrilled to bring bigger, better hits from the best talent in the industry to the broadest base of platforms and channels and feel very good about the Games segment and our Packaged Goods plan.
Now I'll move to our Digital initiative. We’re seeing good growth for our full game downloads through PC-download retailers, particularly Battlefield: Bad Company 2 performed well. We're also seeing good results on popular full games sold through the console networks such as Battlefield 1943 and Death Spank. 
Consumers are embracing downloadable content. Additional content for FIFA Ultimate Team 2, Dragon Age and Mass Effect 2 has been strong. PlayStation is gaining share on Facebook. EA has over 50 million monthly active social game users. Playfish titles driving usage include Pet Society, Restaurant City, Hotel City and FIFA Superstars. Playfish is gaining share on the platform as its usage has remained stable, while other Facebook games have seen their monthly audience fall by 25% on average due to revisions to access and communications channels on the site.
In Asia, FIFA Online 2 Korea had record results. In June, we surpassed 5 million registered players and had our highest grossing revenue month ever. We remain a top three game in the world's most online-oriented market.
Turning to Mobile. Smart phone revenue continues to grow with the popularity of the Apple platform. By revenue, EA is the number one publisher on the app store and had nine of the top 10 grossing games on the iPhone 4 launch last month. On feature phones, EA is taking share and now has 34% of the U.S. feature phone game market according to Nielsen.
And on Android, EA launched FIFA 10 with more titles coming soon.
Lastly, a word about EA SPORTS Online Pass. Based on early Tiger and NCAA Football results, we are pleased to see 60% to 70% of online-connected users redeeming the code. 
The level of online play amongst our user base is up from last year and revenue from paid-downloadable content is also up. 
Now I'll turn the call back to John Riccitiello."

Stepping back, we’ve long been focusing on three strategic objectives. 
First, build fewer, bigger Packaged Goods titles with great quality to support those bets with marketing that rebuilds long-line franchises and pushes all of our titles higher in the charts. Second, drive multiple digital revenue streams and invest in an infrastructure that supports seamless, cross-platform game experiences. And third, relentlessly focus on cost and efficiencies throughout our operations. 
EA is executing against these strategic objectives and driving shareholder value. We are gaining share on half the number of titles we had three years ago. We lead on the strongest platforms and have a broad, rapidly growing base of Digital businesses with powerful synergies with our Packaged Goods portfolio. Executing as well as we did in Q1 built shareholder value and value for both our employees and gamers around the world. Now we would be happy to take your questions."

Obviously, we're going to ramp marketing sales expense through the year, and we expect, obviously, peak marketing and sales spending in the third quarter, the holiday quarter. So that's something you should build into your modeling. We are starting to get more leverage on the franchises. The important point to note is that, this is a good, all-round quarter 4 for FIFA, we talked about the success of the World Cup title with 3 million units. We also commented on the fact that live-to-date, the core FIFA 10 franchise is up about 10% versus FIFA 09, and so that's a positive indicator for leveraging sports. And lastly, for the first time, we're extending key EA properties from the packaged goods space into the social game space with FIFA Superstars.

Given it’s a multi-year investment process, I guess, technically, the majority of R&D is certainly behind us by the end of this fiscal year. So correct observation. And we're looking forward to taking this into, sort of, a net investment phase in F11 to obviously what comes after that, which is hopefully build and harvest phase in F12 and beyond. On marketing, I would add just a little color. I would say that what we've been going through these last couple of years has been investing to take franchises, some of which were not performing as well or been living with lesser quality titles, like we've done in sort of fiscal '07, '08 and '09 on Need for Speed and Medal of Honor and reinvesting for growth. It's a process we've done before. We understand it well, and we think we're going to make great progress this year. And it’s our hope and my belief that we can drive marketing efficiencies in years to come as we drive chart position. But frankly, I expect to sell more Need for Speed this year than last year. And as we build that franchise, marketing will not have to scale with the overall scale of the franchise meaning marketing leverage. We want to repeat that story across many of our front-line titles."

I think that's almost a foregone conclusion that we’ll get the share gain. I don’t expect to topple either Halo or CoD this year. On Star Wars, I'd make a couple of points. One is MMO RPGs are often sort of late in coming together relative to being able to see how great a product it is. RPGs in general are that way and MMOs are even more so that way. It's actually been in the last quarter literally from what you could see at E3 on, that you can actually see just how great the title is going to be. So we've gone from the last, say, couple of years of saying, “BioWare’s a great studio, the game design is a great game design. The technology underlying architecture is well conceived and the creative team is really talented. So they should make a good game.” To still believing all those things and seeing a great game. That feels a lot better to us. It's a process you go through with most game titles and one that we sort of passed through in sort of May or June of this calendar year. In terms of how much cost we're carrying, we've never specifically identified the number although Eric and I in prior communications have indicated that the investment in the calendar year exceeds that for a typical high-scale Packaged Goods title.

If you could comment on that a little bit. And then the second question is on the SKU count from this point on or title count, I think 36 this year. Is 35 to 40 sort of a fair number to assume for the coming years with growth coming from higher installed base and more sell through?"

So it's about 52% growth year-over-year with strong performance across the entire portfolio. We identified about $20 million of this as being phasing-related meaning it could have fallen into any other quarter of, say, fiscal '11 or Q4 last year. And so we don't want people to extrapolate necessarily off the $20 million. I mean, if you were to take 188 and multiply it by four, it would actually tie out to our $750 million full year target. The more accurate way to look at Digital is we had strong performance here, but we're expecting a bit of a ramp up through the balance of the year to hit the 750. Second question was guidance. We’re reaffirming full year non-GAAP EPS guidance. I think it's important to keep in mind that if you look at the midpoint of our revenue guidance range for the full year, we have about 14% of the year behind us and 86% to go. And there's a lot of uncertainty out there with currency rates, demand in the key holiday quarter, et cetera. And so, we're not rolling forward upside from Q1 here into the balance of the year. So as I stated on the prepared remarks, we strongly encourage people to stay within the $0.50 to $0.70 non-GAAP EPS guidance range for the year. Your third question was title count. We have 36 titles today. We've announced a slight change in phasing for one title, but it's the same number of titles that we'd talked about 90 days ago. We’re not in a position to talk about title count for fiscal F12. It's still a bit early. But as we’ve said before, we felt that we’d restructured to a number of core titles. It felt about right. And it still allows us to get the focus and leverage on key existing Packaged Goods franchises, while still allowing each of the labels to introduce one, two or possibly three new ideas per year. So we feel that we're about in the right spot with the title count, but it's still way too early to comment about what that number might be for fiscal '12."

I'll give you some shaping though. Asia is clearly moved more to time in item-based. And if you look at the principal players in that market place, China in particular, the public traded companies, actually saw the best I can tell, an increase in their EBIT margins or their operating margins as they moved to time and item-based in part because they grow peak simultaneous users. In the western markets, we actually haven't seen sort of big heavy client-server-type setups like Eve Online or Warhammer or even World of Warcraft offer anything other than subscription with additional bolt-on charges for various moves from server-to-server and a variety of other special fees and charges. A variety of Tribe, we're working on it now. We’re seeing some success with it. But I think the market is bifurcating in a way around, maybe trifurcation, if you want to do it that way, around a couple of different ideas. Lighter experiences that are working on sites like a Pogo or sites like some of the other game sites and/or social networks are working very well for a combination of micro-transaction and advertising. We're seeing Asia move to that same model, but they came out of the game room to only a short bout with subscription, then quickly moved into micro-transaction-type models and time-based models. And at least the bigger products in the West seem to support a subscription model better. Having said that, and we’re not getting at anything in particular, we’ve anticipated that particular idea. It's something we've thought a lot about and we think there’s actually more potential on the upside than there is risk on the downside for model evolution for that type of product."

Shooters can have a very high attach rate to map pack when you’ve got strong franchises and/or partially downloadable content delivered similarly.
RPGs do as well. Sports have not traditionally provided a great good basis for that. But we've got great traction when we introduced FIFA Ultimate Team and Madden Ultimate Team and we’re building on that across a range of sports titles. I guess what I would probably tell you right now is, there appears to be a strong formula for almost all of these things when the content is great. And it's not uncommon for us to experiment once or twice before we get it right. When we put FIFA Ultimate Team out, we had a similar idea, but not exactly the same for Madden. Madden didn't work, FIFA did. Now Ultimate Team’s the formula across the board. So I would tell you this is our fastest-growing Digital revenue stream. It's doing really well for us.

While we tend to want to think of Europe as one market, it is anything but. We have different regulatory regimes for how we deal with gradings in these different markets. Germany standing outside of most of the rest of Europe has. And so it's just different uptake depending on platform and titles. It's a market where Sony tends to outperform. Microsoft struggles little bit more. It's not really a mirror of the U.S.. and across North to South it tends to move differently, with the southern markets, I think, having a little more room to run given that they started a little slower."

Again, we certainly had expectations and it exceeded our expectations. That being said, we also understood it was a new segment so we were pioneering something and I think that we're happy with the results that we've seen. And as I've said before, we think that our IP will continue to do well in this space, so there will be other games from Playfish using EA IP that you’ll be seeing launch in the not-too-distant future. Nothing to announce right now, though. With respect to the announcements, and you mentioned Google and Yahoo and other social networking sites, there's a lot of talk and a lot of buzz these days. We get excited about that. So we are platform agnostic and we do well when there's other platforms and we love our success on Facebook and at the same time look forward to other people creating new platforms for us to take our IP and excel on. So that's something we're going to stay abreast of, and hopefully see new opportunities for us. Lastly, with the impact of Pogo, Pogo is slightly down in terms of Club Pogo subscribers. However, they're hanging in there pretty well with revenue. And what we're doing is we’ve got a very dedicated user base there, spending about 5 billion minutes a month. And we are certainly going to continue to cultivate our portal and domain. At the same time, we’re also looking at bringing Pogo over to some of the social gaming sites, so you'll see that this year. And Pogo is already in beta on Facebook. So we've got high hopes for Pogo and it hangs in there pretty well despite the trends in casual gaming being kind of down in that segment. They're hanging in there pretty well and we have upside, we hope, if the Facebook consumer will enjoy Pogo later this year when I launch it."

What we were trying to say and I would like to stick with is we think we've got the right marketing investment for introducing some of the new franchises we had this year and driving upside to, I think, or at least growth for existing franchises like Madden, Medal of Honor, Need for Speed and others. So we think we've got the number about right. We, of course, make adjustments if we want to do things in the market place. So if things aren’t performing or they are performing sometimes you chase opportunities and sometimes you cut back to deal with risks, you're trying to avoid a downside. I can't see through that for you on a call right now given that it’s still in front of us. The point I was trying to make, JT [ph], is this. Great franchises often are a string of one title doing better than the last. And the one after that doing better than that. Two’s doing better than one, three’s doing better than two’s. It's judicious investment and you get marketing leverage and can grow those franchises. Franchises like Dead Space and FIFA and Madden and Medal of Honor and Battlefield are exactly the kind of franchises we want to build and take market share and grow from top 30 to top 20 to top 10 to top five over time. We think we know how to do that. We think we’ve got the quality to do that, and it's in achieving that over the course of the next couple of years that we'll realize marketing efficiencies, at least recited [ph] (1:12:34.0) from a financial perspective whereas the percent of spend for marketing sales can go from sort of 17-ish to a lower number. And so what I was trying to get at was not some I’ve-got-a-hidden-back-pocket-just-in-case-scenario, what I was trying to make was a strategic point that I frankly think we’re over-investing a couple, three points in marketing to reestablish the growth trends that are these brands. We started it last year, we got our quality right last year, sort of this management team’s second year in operation where it was their games up and the quality one up, we got better results than the year before. We want to see more of that this year and we want to continue to drive that chart position which yields the leverage. And by the way, it doesn't cost more to make those same games when they sell more units. That's our leverage drops through our business and that's what will drive it."

We are pleased to report a strong Q2 with revenues and EPS above expectations. This completes a strong first half of fiscal '11. EA continues to focus on three strategic objectives to drive shareholder value: producing fewer, bigger better packaged good games; driving growth in digital; controlling costs and creating operating efficiencies. In Q2, we delivered against all three objectives. 
A great example of fewer, bigger, better games is FIFA 11. The title owes its success in the marketplace to our ability to deliver top quality games, on time, with effective marketing support. FIFA sales are up 20% versus last year on a comparable basis with sell-in approaching 8 million units. We grew Digital revenue by 35% year-over-year in the first half of fiscal '11 through a combination of paid downloadable content, social games and our success in the iPad and iPhone. We are also making excellent progress on Digital revenue derived from our core packaged goods titles. 
DLC revenue on packaged goods is up 200% year-over-year. In Q2, we also implemented EA's SPORTS Online pass, which creative yet another Digital revenue stream from games that start with a disk. We remain on track to reduce annualized operating expenses by $100 million this year thanks to a better leveraged product portfolio, more efficient marketing, global sourcing and shared technologies. EA is focused on cost containment, and Eric will discuss our restructuring plan to reduce key licensing and development costs further starting in fiscal '12. 
While we are ahead of our plan at the mid-year point, we still have most of the year ahead of us in terms of revenue and earnings. We are maintaining full year guidance top and bottom line. Now let me step back and offer a take on the industry. 
The games industry is growing. Digital is growing by 25% to 30%, and we're seeing solid double-digit growth in the High-Definition Packaged Good segments. Packaged software sales for PC and High-Definition consoles are expected to be up in mid-teens in the current calendar year, whereas standard definition software for the Wii and dedicated handhelds are expected to be down sharply. What we are seeing is three distinct market segments: strong growth in Digital, strong growth in High-Definition package and declines for Wii and handheld software. This distinction is highly relevant for investors that often lost in the broader headlines about packaged goods trends as reported by NPD. 
Before I turn it over to Eric, I want to thank our studio and publishing team for great execution in Q2. Eric?"

Q2 results exceeded our expectations for both non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP EPS. Non-GAAP revenue of $884 million reflects our efforts to build Digital revenue and drive Packaged Good hits, with notable contributions from the worldwide launch of FIFA 11 and strong catalog sales. Combined with higher gross margins and delayed expense phasing, Q2 revenue upside translated to non-GAAP EPS of $0.10, which was better than our expectations of a non-GAAP loss of $0.15 to $0.10 per share for the quarter. 
Q2 non-GAAP net revenue is $884 million, down 23% year-over-year as expected on fewer titles. On a GAAP basis, net revenue was $631 million. Non-GAAP revenue was down on a lighter title schedule compared to Q2 last year, which had nine titles, including The Beatles: Rock Band and Need for Speed SHIFT in its launch schedule. Q2 GAAP net revenue of $631 million was down by 20% year-over-year. The effect of foreign exchange rates on non-GAAP revenue year-over-year was an adverse impact of $23 million this quarter. 
Q2 non-GAAP gross profit margin was 59.2% compared to 48.4% a year ago due to lower distribution revenues, a higher mix of EA-owned catalog titles and a greater percentage of Digital revenues at higher margins. On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin was 42.5% versus 24.7% a year ago. Q2 non-GAAP operating income was $39 million versus non-GAAP operating income of $19 million a year ago. On a GAAP basis, operating loss was $252 million versus an operating loss of $417 million a year ago.  Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.10 versus $0.06 a year ago. GAAP diluted loss per share was $0.61 versus a diluted loss per share of $1.21 a year ago. 
Headcount. We ended the quarter with 7,820 employees versus 8,829 a year ago and 7,758 in Q1 fiscal '11. 22% of our employees are now in low-cost locations.  Cash flow from operations this quarter totaled negative $134 million versus positive $6 million a year ago. Our trailing 12-month operating cash flow has increased significantly, growing from $105 million in the 12 months ended Q2 last year to $192 million in the 12 months ended Q2 fiscal '11. At the same time, capital expenditures have declined, excluding the purchase of our headquarters facility. This has led to an increase in free cash flow from $19 million to $131 million in the 12 months just ended. EA remains on track to generate $250 million to $300 million in operating cash flow this year. EA has approximately $5 per share in cash, short-term investments and marketable securities. 
Inventory levels were well managed in the quarter and fell to $155 million from $250 million in the prior year. We are carrying significantly less distribution-related inventory compared to last year. Reserves for sales returns and allowances as a percentage of trailing six-month non-GAAP net revenue were 11%, up from 10% a year ago and are down on a nine-month basis to 7% from 8% last year. 
Overall, the Worldwide Interactive Entertainment segment, inclusive of Packaged Goods and Digital, is flat to up 5% on a calendar year-to-date basis. Consumers are moving towards High-Definition platforms and touch-enabled smartphones and tablets, built on Apple iOS, Google Android and Windows Phone 7. 
The Digital segment continues to perform well. We estimate that the total digital sector worldwide is growing at 25% to 30% year-over-year on an annualized basis, and that September quarter was also strong. In Packaged Goods, we continue to see strength in the High-Definition console plus PC software market, which we estimate is up 25% year-over-year in the Western world for the quarter and is up approximately 15% calendar year-to-date. This trend plays into our strength given our share position on High-Definition consoles and our market leadership on the PC. 
Packaged software sales for standard definition and handheld platforms, including the Wii, PlayStation 2, PSP and Nintendo DS, are down, we estimate, by approximately 32% in the quarter and calendar year-to-date. Particular areas of weakness are the Nintendo Wii and the music category where EA has less exposure. In the Western world, Wii software is down 34%, and music is down by 60% year-over-year for the quarter. 
We estimate that the total Western world Packaged Good software market is down 2% year-over-year for the September quarter and down 4% on a calendar year-to-date basis. We see Europe performing better than North America, with the Europe packaged goods software remaining flat compared to a decrease of 8% for North America. For the September quarter, Europe was up 2% year-over-year, while North America was down 6%. 
Turning to market share. EA was the number one publisher for the quarter and calendar year-to-date. Our share in Q2 fiscal '11 was 21% overall, with 23% in North America and 20% in Europe. Our calendar year-to-date share was 18% overall, with 19% in North America and 17% in Europe. On a trailing 12-month basis, EA's Western world packaged good share is stable at 18%, with 16% share coming from EA published titles excluding distribution versus 15% a year ago. In Q2, our key frontline packaged goods title were FIFA 11 and Madden NFL 11, which sold in over 6 million and 3 million units in the quarter, respectively. Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 11, Battlefield: Bad Company 2, The Sims 3 and FIFA 10 were strong catalog titles. 
Our mix of catalog revenue was 16% for Q2. We attribute this continued strength in catalog sales to higher quality and the fact that almost all of our games now have digital-content expansions and feature online multiplayer modes. 
Q2 non-GAAP Digital revenue increased by 20%, from $138 million to $166 million year-over-year comprising 19% of total revenue this quarter. This is the result of increases in PC digital distribution and console downloadable content.  Mobile revenue was down slightly year-over-year at $49 million, with growth in smartphone-related revenue approximately compensating for reduction in feature phone-related revenue. 
We now have over 80 million registered users in our Nucleus consumer registration system, up from $41 million a year ago. Titles like FIFA, Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and Madden NFL 11 drove registrations in Q2. Approximately 20% of registered users are active on a monthly basis. EA has 49 million monthly active social game users or MAUs, and 8.5 million daily active users or DAUs. Playfish experienced improved monetization on the continued strength of Pet Society, Restaurant City, FIFA Superstars and Madden Superstars. 
For the 12 months ended Q2 fiscal '11, non-GAAP gross profit margins improved by over seven points, from 50.5% to 57.8% on an improved mix of EA published titles and higher Digital revenue. Trailing 12 months non-GAAP operating margins improved from 1.8% to 3.3%. 
Before moving into guidance, I would like to comment on two Q3 items. First, EA purchased Chillingo, a leading publisher of iPhone and iPad games. Chillingo publishes two of the top grossing mobile games, Angry Birds and Cut the Rope. The total purchase price was $17 million upfront, with up to another $12 million in earn out over the next three years. Chillingo has the industry-leading mobile publishing platform, which we intend to leverage across EAI. 
Second, we announced a plan to restructure key licensing and development agreements to improve the long-term profitability of our Packaged Goods business. Consequently, we expect to incur a one-time GAAP charges of up to approximately $180 million in the second half of fiscal '11.  Benefits of the restructuring are expected starting in fiscal 2012 and beyond. 
I'd like to highlight a few points about this restructuring. First, with these actions, there is no significant overall change in the total payments for licenses and contracts. We are, in large part, setting aside rights we won't be using. Net, there is an incremental cash outlay of only $10 million versus existing contractual amounts. 
Second, there are other contracts that are also being negotiated that do not qualify as part of this restructuring. While we won't discuss the details of any one deal, we are addressing structural issues and contracts that were signed years ago under significantly different market conditions. 
Third, while some employees are impacted by this restructuring, it is a relatively small number. This is not a major personnel reorganization. We are continuing to hire in selected franchise teams and our digital businesses. Once restructured, we expect that these deals will improve our long-term profitability, provide higher rates of return under current market conditions and provide us with downside protection should there be a league lockout. 
For full year guidance, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP revenue and EPS ranges for fiscal '11. The first topic I would like to address is why we are keeping full year revenue and EPS guidance unchanged despite $0.20 of non-GAAP EPS over performance in Q2 versus prior guidance. The answer is straightforward. First, we were able to bring the original Q3 launch of FIFA 11 in North America forward into Q2 for a simultaneous release with Europe. This is approximately $0.05 worth of EPS phased from the second half of the year into Q2. 
Second, we just announced the cancellation of NBA ELITE 11. This is a loss of approximately $0.05 of EPS in the second half of fiscal '11. Third, we're able to delay expenses for marketing, contracted services and other items out of Q2 into the second half of the year. This is approximately negative $0.05 worth of EPS moved from Q2 into the second half. That adds to $0.15, and we carry the remaining $0.05 of Q2 EPS upside into the second half of the year as additional buffer against title level performance in the key peak season. 
Currency exchange rates remain volatile, and rate changes impact our reported revenue more than non-GAAP EPS, thanks to natural hedges in our business. For the first half of fiscal '11, we did not experience any FX variance for non-GAAP EPS versus our original cross rate assumptions. On a full year basis, our earnings are mostly hedged versus the euro. Our R&D costs will increase if the Canadian dollar strengthens, and we have both revenue and earnings exposure should the British pound weaken.
Our updated guidance assumes the following FX rates for the balance of the fiscal year: USD $1.36 to the euro; USD $0.97 to the Canadian dollar; and USD $1.58 to the British pound. If spot rates as of October 29, 2010, persist during the fiscal year, we anticipate no impact to non-GAAP EPS and zero to $10 million benefit to non-GAAP revenue for the year. 
On a non-GAAP basis, we continue to expect the total of $3.65 billion to $3.9 billion in fiscal '11 revenue. Our packaged goods expectations call for publishing revenue ranging from $2.725 billion to $2.975 billion. Our distribution revenue expectations are for at least $175 million, and we expect approximately $750 million in Digital revenue.
The year-over-year dollar growth of $180 million in Digital is divided roughly as follows: approximately 30% from console full games and DLC; approximately 40% from PC and browser full games and DLC; approximately 30% from mobile, game services, subscriptions and advertising. 
We expect the worldwide market, inclusive of Packaged Goods and Digital, to grow 7% year-over-year in calendar 2010 based on the assumptions that total worldwide Packaged Goods will be down 5% and will be more than offset by Digital growth of approximately 25% to 30%. Analysts and investors should carefully examine the calendar '10 Western Packaged Goods software segment to understand our trends. 
High-level NPD data does not provide a complete picture of the games industry. Based on our data and industry reports, we expect software for High-Definition platforms, the Xbox 360 and PS3 consoles and the PC, to be up mid-teens for calendar 2010. We expect this growth will be offset by weak sales of packaged goods software for the Wii, PlayStation 2, PSP and NDS. 
Netting these subsegments results in an overall Packaged Goods decline of 5%, which is more than offset by growth on the Digital side. On a full year basis, our Packaged Goods business, excluding distribution, is expected to be approximately 85% on High-Definition platforms and approximately 15% on standard definition and handheld platform. 
Our title schedule now assumes 35 titles in the fiscal year versus 36 titles in our original plan. EA plans to release 14 titles in Q3 and eight titles in Q4. Our top 20 titles for fiscal '11 are expected to generate approximately 77% of total non-distribution Packaged Goods revenue. This compares to 76% in fiscal '10. 
In regards to full year non-GAAP operating expenses, of the approximately $2 billion, we expect 26% to 28% R&D, 18% to 19% marketing sales and 7% G&A for the year as a percent of total revenue. EA is incurring significant development costs for a major new massively multiplayer online game. This game is not expected to ship in fiscal '11. 
We expected to end fiscal 11 with total headcount of less than 8,000 and continue to move resources from high-cost to low-cost locations. Total low-cost location headcount is expected to increase to 24% by the end of fiscal '11. In terms of non-GAAP EPS, we are maintaining guidance for the full year at $0.50 to $0.70 per share on 334 million diluted shares. This corresponds to a non-GAAP operating income margin of approximately 68%, with approximately $5 million in other income and expense. 
We are maintaining the EPS range taking into account FIFA 11 North American Q2 launch timing, the cancellation of NBA ELITE 11 in Q3 and second-half expense phasing. On a non-GAAP basis, we are reaffirming our GAAP net revenue guidance of $3.35 billion to $3.6 billion and updating our GAAP EPS guidance to a loss of $0.85 to a loss of $0.55 per share. The GAAP guidance excludes second-half restructuring charges, which we are finalizing. 
For Q3 fiscal '11, we expect Q3 non-GAAP revenue between $1.375 billion and $1.5 billion, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 to $0.60. This reflects a shift of FIFA 11 North American units from Q3 to Q2 and the cancellation of NBA ELITE 11. Non-GAAP gross profit margin is expected to be approximately 58%. Operating expenses is expected to be approximately $575 million to $590 million, and share count is an estimated 334 million. 
For Q4 fiscal '11, we expect non-GAAP revenue between $850 million and $975 million, and a non-GAAP EPS of $0.13 to $0.23, based on potential schedule risk at the end of the quarter. Non-GAAP gross profit margin is expected to be approximately 63% to 64%, operating expense is expected to be approximately $480 million to $500 million and share count is an estimated 335 million. 
This concludes our outlook and guidance. And now I'd like to turn the call over to John Schappert."

I'm going to offer some perspective on the sector, then outline EA's retail performance. I'll finish with an update on our progress in mobile and online games and services. The segments of our industry where EA is investing are strong. As",1393,"Thanks, Eric. I'm going to offer some perspective on the sector, then outline EA's retail performance. I'll finish with an update on our progress in mobile and online games and services. 
The segments of our industry where EA is investing are strong. As Eric mentioned, we expect the total software sector to be up 7% worldwide this year, driven by growth in digital and High-Definition and PC packaged goods. 
Total Packaged Goods have declined 4% in the calendar year-to-date. However, the High-Definition platforms, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, have grown by 23% in the same period. EA's portfolio strongly favors these growth platforms, and we now command a 25% segment share on HD consoles. 
Another positive for HD consoles is the introduction of new motion control technology from both Sony and Microsoft. We're encouraged by the early data we're seeing on Move and the prelaunch data on Kinect. EA is launching two titles for Kinect: EA SPORTS Active 2 and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1. For the Move, we have Dead Space Extraction, Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 11 and Create. We believe these innovations will grow the HD console market. 
The next point I want to make about the sector is that the impressive growth of the digital online business is largely invisible in the industry's retail tracking data. Today, we estimate that digital sales represent roughly 30% of revenue in Western markets, yet none of this is captured in retail tracking data. EA has the leading share on the high-growth digital portable platforms, iPad and iPhone, and a comparatively small exposure on traditional handheld. 
So our overall take on the sector is that contrary to the headlines, there's a solid growth story for publishers that have invested in platforms where millions of consumers are choosing to play: HD consoles and online digital platforms. With that, I'll now go over some highlights of EA's retail performance. 
By now you're familiar with our mantra: fewer, bigger, better. We've dramatically reduced our SKU plan, improved our overall product quality and focus on hits we can take to the top of the charts. This strategy is working. 
On the spring, we released Battlefield: Bad Company 2, with a Metacritic index of 89. Today, Bad Company 2 is sold through almost 6 million units, more than double the sales of the original. Congratulations to the team at our DICE Studio in Stockholm for  turning Battlefield: Bad Company into a new stand-alone franchise for EA. 
Medal of Honor was released just two weeks ago and has already sold through more than 2 million units. This is a game we are proud of, and the sales speak for themselves. Built with a superior multiplayer experience, Medal of Honor is a key element in our strategy to capture shooter-category leadership along with blockbusters like Battlefield: Vietnam, Bulletstorm, Crysis 2 and the much-anticipated Battlefield 3. 
Last week, we brought our flagship PC franchise, The Sims 3, to High-Definition console for the first time ever. The early read on sales looks good. EA SPORTS launched two new franchises: NBA JAM and MMA. NBA JAM is a great title for the Wii and will soon be available on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. MMA, or Mixed Martial Arts game, launched with a great roster of fighters and innovative online features. It's off to a slow start, but we are optimistic that this one will find an audience of fight fans over the holidays. Also, as Eric mentioned, we have elected to cancel NBA ELITE 11. Future development of that franchise will be handled at EA Tiburon in Orlando. 
Our soccer game, FIFA 11, is breaking worldwide sales record. The game has sold in almost 8 million units to date, up more than 20% over last year's great performance. FIFA 11 has captured a worldwide segment share of more than 80%. It remains the number one title on Europe and has sold almost twice as many units as the number two game in Europe. This is amazing growth from our largest franchise, which has sold, life-to-date, over 100 million units. Congratulations to the developers of EA Canada and the European publishing team who drove it to the top of the charts. 
Looking ahead, we are preparing for the launch of more holiday blockbusters, including EA SPORTS Active 2 and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1. Our biggest release for Q3 is Need for Speed Hot Pursuit. This is one of EA's greatest franchises and is back with action, cops, high-speed chases, crashes and a hugely new innovative online feature, Autolog. A suite of connected features that allows friends and competitors to set up match races, compare times and share their experiences. This one looks like a true holiday blockbuster. 
Our message on Packaged Goods is simple: our strategy is working. EA is delivering fewer titles, better quality and bigger hits. In Q2, we have six of the top 20 titles in the Western world, and we're the number one publisher with a 21% share. On HD consoles and PC, our share was 28% in Q2. We lead on the largest, most attractive platform. 
Now I'll turn to our Digital and Online business. Digital extensions to Packaged Goods software and a division we call EAI, which includes mobile, Pogo online games for the PC and Facebook and the Playfish social net gaming network. As Eric mentioned, we are on track to hit 750 million in total Digital revenue this fiscal year, and we're very excited about this side of our business. I'll start with the proliferation of smartphones, tablets and mobile operating systems. 
In recent weeks, we've seen great new products for Apple's iOS, Google's Android platform and Microsoft's Windows Phone 7. We've also seen a strong launch of commercial games for Amazon's Kindle. At EA, we're particularly proud of our leadership in this space. We are the number one publisher across the entire Apple App Store. Our recent acquisition, Chillingo, is the number three publisher, further strengthening our reach on this key platform.
Chillingo adds another dimension to our mobile leadership. EA Mobile has nailed this market with established brands like FIFA, Madden, The Sims and Tetris. Chillingo works with independent developers to bring their innovative, original creations to market. They provide the technology and expertise to turn a good indie game into a great big hit. And they approved it with great games like Angry Birds and Cut the Rope. Another asset they bring to EA is Chillingo's social gaming platform, which allows friends to challenge each other, earning achievements, compete on leaderboards and share their experiences on Facebook and Twitter. 
Other opportunities for growth in mobile, include Android and Windows Phone 7. Android is growing incredibly fast. And then there's the Kindle, where the Scrabble game we published in partnership with Hasbro outsold all other Kindle books to secure the number one position in the Kindle store. Yes, an EA game with the number one selling product, more than any book on the Kindle store for almost two straight weeks. Scrabble was knocked out of first place by another EA game, Solitaire for the Kindle. Each of these, Android, Windows Phone 7 and the Kindle, represent new platforms and opportunities for our games. 
Next, some big news from our casual online division, Pogo. Pogo has launched an initiative to grow beyond its strong PC base and reach millions of new players on new platforms. To start, a beta version of Pogo is now available on Facebook with about 20 of Pogo's favorite games, including Poppit!, Word Whomp, Turbo 21 and First Class Solitaire. Also, on Pogo for Facebook are popular Hasbro titles such as Scrabble, Monopoly, Boggle, Yahtzee Party!, and Trivial Pursuit. Watch for more Pogo news, games and exciting new platforms in the weeks ahead. 
Facebook continues to grow rapidly, with an estimated 250 million gamers each playing an average of 3.5 hours per month. In Q2, Playfish saw improved monetization thanks to the launch of Madden NFL Superstars and continued success of their top franchises. And today, we announced a five-year agreement with Facebook, a strategic partnership to establish a simplified experience for consumer transactions. Going forward, we will use Facebook credits as the exclusive play payment method for our transactions on that platform. 
And now I'll turn the call back to John Riccitiello."

Our Q3 slate is ready to go. Medal of Honor and The Sims 3 console are tracking well. Between now and the holidays, we have a great slate highlighted by Need for Speed Hot Pursuit. EA is executing against our three key strategic objectives. We are outpacing the industry in terms of digital growth, and we are creating meaningful digital revenue streams in our well-positioned Packaged Goods business. And we are proving that our IP is working well, not only on the growing High-Definition platforms, but also on casual platforms from social networks to mobile, helping drive our 35% growth rate on the digital side. We continue to lead in the most attractive segment of a growing game industry. 
In closing, I'd like to mention one of our most important franchises, Need for Speed. Need for Speed is back in a huge way. So take a day off on November 16 to play Need for Speed Hot Pursuit with Autolog. You're going to love it. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions."

So as an observation, mid-70s is generally perceived to be pretty good. I think ultimately, what happened there and pretty much as we'd expected, the game appeals really well to a mass market, your average gamer. There is a small minority of folks, sometimes well represented by core gamer reviewers or game magazine reviewers, where best I can tell there's been 80 or 90 hours a week playing first person shooters. They are very core to that segment, and some of them didn't like the title. Again, not on the kind of expected. So far, the title has outperformed our sales expectations, continues to outperform our expectations through to week three, which we didn't include in the numbers we just gave you. So it feels very good. As an aside, one of the things that we track very carefully is input to our customer service call-in lines and web question-and-answer from our service personnel. And it's interesting that Medal of Honor is getting some of the strongest positive reviews on fun to play and other positive attributes, more so than other shooters we've shipped in the past. So by and large, it feels like the game that we've got on this one is from an exceptionally narrow demographic of reviewers that gave it a negative review, offset by a more overwhelming majority of people that are buying it and enjoying it.

There is essentially a $10 million delta versus the baseline commitments, and that's why we called that out as being nominal.

What I like about EA is I think it's going to really present itself to the consumer in two ways. One is stuff that looks a lot like what we do in EAI with our more casual offerings, and I think a big part of it is going to feel more traditional. And I think we can participate in both. It's likely to promote more direct-to-consumer digital models, which, as we've indicated up until now, leave more of the money in our pockets of business than they do of various folks taking a piece out of the middle. So I think it's a long-term positive. I think it supports both core and more casual offerings.

So one observation and a comment I should have made earlier with respect to Medal of Honor. The game has exceeded our plan and expectations sell-through and sell-in, and those expectations were they went up as they went from planned to forecast and as we updated our forecast through for the year. So in every possible gate of opportunity to increase the forecast we did, and then we exceeded those forecast based on strong selling numbers. So it is absolutely clear success as a business for us. And consumer feedback has been strong to suggest that we've got a franchise now, once again, that we could successfully and effectively sequel in the future. Now I think it's the first step with this franchise, sort of back into the marketplace where Battlefield: Bad Company is essentially on its fifth edition, alternating between Battlefield 1, Battlefield 2 and a couple of additions of various expansions in the Bad Company franchise. So that we had expected, and we realized greater sales on Battlefield: Bad Company 2 than Medal of Honor, but just slightly based on the first few weeks of sell-in. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 in its third week, as I recall, I don't have the numbers in front of me, spiked up in week three more than we thought. It actually decayed less in week three than we'd thought, and that was really strong word of mouth among gamer press. We started to see sort of a quality-driven rise, where Medal of Honor is following a slightly more traditional decay curve as what we would have expected this time of the year."

We are pleased to report a strong Q2 with revenues and EPS above expectations. This completes a strong first half of fiscal '11. EA continues to focus on three strategic objectives to drive shareholder value: producing fewer, bigger, better packaged goods games; driving growth in digital; controlling costs and creating operating efficiencies. In Q2, we delivered against all three objectives. 
A great example of fewer, bigger, better games is FIFA 11. The title owes its success in the marketplace to our ability to deliver top quality games, on time, with effective marketing support. FIFA sales are up 20% versus last year on a comparable basis with sell-in approaching 8 million units. We grew Digital revenue by 35% year-over-year in the first half of fiscal '11 through a combination of paid downloadable content, social games and our success on the iPad and iPhone. We are also making excellent progress on Digital revenue derived from our core packaged goods titles. 
DLC revenue on packaged goods is up 200% year-over-year. In Q2, we also implemented EA's SPORTS Online pass, which creates yet another Digital revenue stream from games that start with a disk. We remain on track to reduce annualized operating expenses by $100 million this year thanks to a better-leveraged product portfolio, more efficient marketing, global sourcing and shared technologies. EA is focused on cost containment, and Eric will discuss our restructuring plan to reduce key licensing and development costs further starting in fiscal '12. 
While we are ahead of our plan at the mid-year point, we still have most of the year ahead of us in terms of revenue and earnings. We are maintaining full year guidance top and bottom line. Now let me step back and offer a take on the industry. 
The games industry is growing. Digital is growing by 25% to 30%, and we're seeing solid double-digit growth in the High-Definition Packaged Good segments. Packaged software sales for PC and High-Definition consoles are expected to be up in the mid-teens in the current calendar year, whereas standard definition software for the Wii and dedicated handhelds are expected to be down sharply. What we are seeing is three distinct market segments: strong growth in Digital, strong growth in High-Definition package and declines for Wii and handheld software. This distinction is highly relevant for investors that often lost in the broader headlines about packaged goods trends as reported by NPD. 
Before I turn it over to Eric, I want to thank our studio and publishing team for great execution in Q2. Eric?"

Q2 results exceeded our expectations for both non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP EPS.

Q2 results exceeded our expectations for both non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP EPS. Non-GAAP revenue of $884 million reflects our efforts to build Digital revenue and drive Packaged Good hits, with notable contributions from the worldwide launch of FIFA 11 and strong catalog sales. Combined with higher gross margins and delayed expense phasing, Q2 revenue upside translated to non-GAAP EPS of $0.10, which was better than our expectations of a non-GAAP loss of $0.15 to $0.10 per share for the quarter. 
Q2 non-GAAP net revenue is $884 million, down 23% year-over-year as expected on fewer titles. On a GAAP basis, net revenue was $631 million. Non-GAAP revenue was down on a lighter title schedule compared to Q2 last year, which had nine titles, including The Beatles: Rock Band and Need for Speed SHIFT in its launch schedule. Q2 GAAP net revenue of $631 million was down by 20% year-over-year. The effect of foreign exchange rates on non-GAAP revenue year-over-year was an adverse impact of $23 million this quarter. 
Q2 non-GAAP gross profit margin was 59.2% compared to 48.4% a year ago due to lower distribution revenues, a higher mix of EA-owned catalog titles and a greater percentage of Digital revenues at higher margins. On a GAAP basis, gross profit margin was 42.5% versus 24.7% a year ago. Q2 non-GAAP operating income was $39 million versus non-GAAP operating income of $19 million a year ago. On a GAAP basis, operating loss was $252 million versus an operating loss of $417 million a year ago.  Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.10 versus $0.06 a year ago. GAAP diluted loss per share was $0.61 versus a diluted loss per share of $1.21 a year ago. 
Headcount. We ended the quarter with 7,820 employees versus 8,829 a year ago and 7,758 in Q1 fiscal '11. 22% of our employees are now in low-cost locations.  Cash flow from operations this quarter totaled negative $134 million versus positive $6 million a year ago. Our trailing 12-month operating cash flow has increased significantly, growing from $105 million in the 12 months ended Q2 last year to $192 million in the 12 months ended Q2 fiscal '11. At the same time, capital expenditures have declined, excluding the purchase of our headquarters facility. This has led to an increase in free cash flow from $19 million to $131 million in the 12 months just ended. EA remains on track to generate $250 million to $300 million in operating cash flow this year. EA has approximately $5 per share in cash, short-term investments and marketable securities. 
Inventory levels were well managed in the quarter and fell to $155 million from $250 million in the prior year. We are carrying significantly less distribution-related inventory compared to last year. Reserves for sales returns and allowances as a percentage of trailing six-month non-GAAP net revenue were 11%, up from 10% a year ago and are down on a nine-month basis to 7% from 8% last year. 
Overall, the Worldwide Interactive Entertainment segment, inclusive of Packaged Goods and Digital, is flat to up 5% on a calendar year-to-date basis. Consumers are moving towards High-Definition platforms and touch-enabled smartphones and tablets, built on Apple iOS, Google Android and Windows Phone 7. 
The Digital segment continues to perform well. We estimate that the total digital sector worldwide is growing at 25% to 30% year-over-year on an annualized basis, and that September quarter was also strong. In Packaged Goods, we continue to see strength in the High-Definition console plus PC software market, which we estimate is up 25% year-over-year in the Western world for the quarter and is up approximately 15% calendar year-to-date. This trend plays into our strength, given our share position on High-Definition consoles and our market leadership on the PC. 
Packaged software sales for standard definition and handheld platforms, including the Wii, PlayStation 2, PSP and Nintendo DS, are down, we estimate, by approximately 32% in the quarter and calendar year-to-date. Particular areas of weakness are the Nintendo Wii and the music category where EA has less exposure. In the Western world, Wii software is down 34%, and music is down by 60% year-over-year for the quarter. 
We estimate that the total Western world Packaged Good software market is down 2% year-over-year for the September quarter and down 4% on a calendar year-to-date basis. We see Europe performing better than North America, with the Europe packaged goods software remaining flat compared to a decrease of 8% for North America. For the September quarter, Europe was up 2% year-over-year, while North America was down 6%. 
Turning to market share. EA was the number one publisher for the quarter and calendar year-to-date. Our share in Q2 fiscal '11 was 21% overall, with 23% in North America and 20% in Europe. Our calendar year-to-date share was 18% overall, with 19% in North America and 17% in Europe. On a trailing 12-month basis, EA's Western world packaged good share is stable at 18%, with 16% share coming from EA published titles excluding distribution versus 15% a year ago. In Q2, our key frontline packaged goods title were FIFA 11 and Madden NFL 11, which sold in over 6 million and 3 million units in the quarter, respectively. Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 11, Battlefield: Bad Company 2, The Sims 3 and FIFA 10 were strong catalog titles. 
Our mix of catalog revenue was 16% for Q2. We attribute this continued strength in catalog sales to higher quality and the fact that almost all of our games now have digital-content expansions and feature online multiplayer modes. 
Q2 non-GAAP Digital revenue increased by 20%, from $138 million to $166 million year-over-year comprising 19% of total revenue this quarter. This is the result of increases in PC digital distribution and console downloadable content.  Mobile revenue was down slightly year-over-year at $49 million, with growth in smartphone-related revenue approximately compensating for reduction in feature phone-related revenue. 
We now have over 80 million registered users in our Nucleus consumer registration system, up from $41 million a year ago. Titles like FIFA, Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and Madden NFL 11 drove registrations in Q2. Approximately 20% of registered users are active on a monthly basis. EA has 49 million monthly active social game users or MAUs, and 8.5 million daily active users or DAUs. Playfish experienced improved monetization on the continued strength of Pet Society, Restaurant City, FIFA Superstars and Madden Superstars. 
For the 12 months ended Q2 fiscal '11, non-GAAP gross profit margins improved by over seven points, from 50.5% to 57.8% on an improved mix of EA published titles and higher Digital revenue. Trailing 12 months non-GAAP operating margins improved from 1.8% to 3.3%. 
Before moving into guidance, I would like to comment on two Q3 items. First, EA purchased Chillingo, a leading publisher of iPhone and iPad games. Chillingo publishes two of the top grossing mobile games, Angry Birds and Cut the Rope. The total purchase price was $17 million upfront, with up to another $12 million in earn out over the next three years. Chillingo has the industry-leading mobile publishing platform, which we intend to leverage across EAI. 
Second, we announced a plan to restructure key licensing and development agreements to improve the long-term profitability of our Packaged Goods business. Consequently, we expect to incur one-time GAAP charges of up to approximately $180 million in the second half of fiscal '11.  Benefits of the restructuring are expected starting in fiscal 2012 and beyond. 
I'd like to highlight a few points about this restructuring. First, with these actions, there is no significant overall change in the total payments for licenses and contracts. We are, in large part, setting aside rights we won't be using. Net, there is an incremental cash outlay of only $10 million versus existing contractual amounts. 
Second, there are other contracts that are also being negotiated that do not qualify as part of this restructuring. While we won't discuss the details of any one deal, we are addressing structural issues and contracts that were signed years ago under significantly different market conditions. 
Third, while some employees are impacted by this restructuring, it is a relatively small number. This is not a major personnel reorganization. We are continuing to hire in selected franchise teams and our digital businesses. Once restructured, we expect that these deals will improve our long-term profitability, provide higher rates of return under current market conditions and provide us with downside protection should there be a league lockout. 
For full year guidance, we are reaffirming our non-GAAP revenue and EPS ranges for fiscal '11. The first topic I would like to address is why we are keeping full year revenue and EPS guidance unchanged despite $0.20 of non-GAAP EPS over performance in Q2 versus prior guidance. The answer is straightforward. First, we were able to bring the original Q3 launch of FIFA 11 in North America forward into Q2 for a simultaneous release with Europe. This is approximately $0.05 worth of EPS phased from the second half of the year into Q2. 
Second, we just announced the cancellation of NBA ELITE 11. This is a loss of approximately $0.05 of EPS in the second half of fiscal '11. Third, we're able to delay expenses for marketing, contracted services and other items out of Q2 into the second half of the year. This is approximately negative $0.05 worth of EPS moved from Q2 into the second half. That adds to $0.15, and we carry the remaining $0.05 of Q2 EPS upside into the second half of the year as additional buffer against title level performance in the key peak season. 
Currency exchange rates remain volatile, and rate changes impact our reported revenue more than non-GAAP EPS, thanks to natural hedges in our business. For the first half of fiscal '11, we did not experience any FX variance for non-GAAP EPS versus our original cross rate assumptions. On a full year basis, our earnings are mostly hedged versus the euro. Our R&D costs will increase if the Canadian dollar strengthens, and we have both revenue and earnings exposure should the British pound weaken.
Our updated guidance assumes the following FX rates for the balance of the fiscal year: USD $1.36 to the euro; USD $0.97 to the Canadian dollar; and USD $1.58 to the British pound. If spot rates as of October 29, 2010, persist during the fiscal year, we anticipate no impact to non-GAAP EPS and zero to $10 million benefit to non-GAAP revenue for the year. 
On a non-GAAP basis, we continue to expect a total of $3.65 billion to $3.9 billion in fiscal '11 revenue. Our packaged goods expectations call for publishing revenue ranging from $2.725 billion to $2.975 billion. Our distribution revenue expectations are for at least $175 million, and we expect approximately $750 million in Digital revenue.
The year-over-year dollar growth of $180 million in Digital is divided roughly as follows: approximately 30% from console full games and DLC; approximately 40% from PC and browser full games and DLC; approximately 30% from mobile, game services, subscriptions and advertising. 
We expect the worldwide market, inclusive of Packaged Goods and Digital, to grow 7% year-over-year in calendar 2010 based on the assumptions that total worldwide Packaged Goods will be down 5% and will be more than offset by Digital growth of approximately 25% to 30%. Analysts and investors should carefully examine the calendar '10 Western Packaged Goods software segment to understand our trends. 
High-level NPD data does not provide a complete picture of the games industry. Based on our data and industry reports, we expect software for High-Definition platforms, the Xbox 360 and PS3 consoles and the PC, to be up mid-teens for calendar 2010. We expect this growth will be offset by weak sales of packaged goods software for the Wii, PlayStation 2, PSP and NDS. 
Netting these subsegments results in an overall Packaged Goods decline of 5%, which is more than offset by growth on the Digital side. On a full year basis, our Packaged Goods business, excluding distribution, is expected to be approximately 85% on High-Definition platforms and approximately 15% on standard definition and handheld platform. 
Our title schedule now assumes 35 titles in the fiscal year versus 36 titles in our original plan. EA plans to release 14 titles in Q3 and eight titles in Q4. Our top 20 titles for fiscal '11 are expected to generate approximately 77% of total non-distribution Packaged Goods revenue. This compares to 76% in fiscal '10. 
In regards to full year non-GAAP operating expenses, of the approximately $2 billion, we expect 26% to 28% R&D, 18% to 19% marketing sales and 7% G&A for the year as a percent of total revenue. EA is incurring significant development costs for a major new massively multiplayer online game. This game is not expected to ship in fiscal '11. 
We expected to end fiscal 11 with total headcount of less than 8,000 and continue to move resources from high-cost to low-cost locations. Total low-cost location headcount is expected to increase to 24% by the end of fiscal '11. In terms of non-GAAP EPS, we are maintaining guidance for the full year at $0.50 to $0.70 per share on 334 million diluted shares. This corresponds to a non-GAAP operating income margin of approximately 6% to 8%, with approximately $5 million in other income and expense. 
We are maintaining the EPS range taking into account FIFA 11 North American Q2 launch timing, the cancellation of NBA ELITE 11 in Q3 and second-half expense phasing. On a non-GAAP basis, we are reaffirming our GAAP net revenue guidance of $3.35 billion to $3.6 billion and updating our GAAP EPS guidance to a loss of $0.85 to a loss of $0.55 per share. The GAAP guidance excludes second-half restructuring charges, which we are finalizing. 
For Q3 fiscal '11, we expect Q3 non-GAAP revenue between $1.375 billion and $1.5 billion, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 to $0.60. This reflects a shift of FIFA 11 North American units from Q3 to Q2 and the cancellation of NBA ELITE 11. Non-GAAP gross profit margin is expected to be approximately 58%. Operating expense is expected to be approximately $575 million to $590 million, and share count is an estimated 334 million. 
For Q4 fiscal '11, we expect non-GAAP revenue between $850 million and $975 million, and a non-GAAP EPS of $0.13 to $0.23, based on potential schedule risk at the end of the quarter. Non-GAAP gross profit margin is expected to be approximately 63% to 64%, operating expense is expected to be approximately $480 million to $500 million and share count is an estimated 335 million. 
This concludes our outlook and guidance. And now I'd like to turn the call over to John Schappert."

I'll finish with an update on our progress in mobile and online games and services. 
The segments of our industry where EA is investing are strong. As Eric mentioned, we expect the total software sector to be up 7% worldwide this year, driven by growth in digital and High-Definition and PC packaged goods. 
Total Packaged Goods have declined 4% in the calendar year-to-date. However, the High-Definition platforms, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, have grown by 23% in the same period. EA's portfolio strongly favors these growth platforms, and we now command a 25% segment share on HD consoles. 
Another positive for HD consoles is the introduction of new motion control technology from both Sony and Microsoft. We are encouraged by the early data we're seeing on Move and the prelaunch data on Kinect. EA is launching two titles for Kinect: EA SPORTS Active 2 and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1. For the Move, we have Dead Space Extraction, Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 11 and Create. We believe these innovations will grow the HD console market. 
The next point I want to make about the sector is that the impressive growth of the digital online business is largely invisible in the industry's retail tracking data. Today, we estimate that digital sales represent roughly 30% of revenue in Western markets, yet none of this is captured in retail tracking data. EA has the leading share on the high-growth digital portable platforms, iPad and iPhone, and a comparatively small exposure on traditional handhelds. 
So our overall take on the sector is that contrary to the headlines, there is a solid growth story for publishers that have invested in platforms where millions of consumers are choosing to play: HD consoles and online digital platforms. With that, I'll now go over some highlights of EA's retail performance. 
By now you're familiar with our mantra: fewer, bigger, better. We've dramatically reduced our SKU plan, improved our overall product quality and focused on hits we can take to the top of the charts. This strategy is working. 
On the spring, we released Battlefield: Bad Company 2, with a Metacritic index of 89. Today, Bad Company 2 is sold through almost 6 million units, more than double the sales of the original. Congratulations to the team at our DICE Studio in Stockholm for turning Battlefield: Bad Company into a new stand-alone franchise for EA. 
Medal of Honor was released just two weeks ago and has already sold through more than 2 million units. This is a game we are proud of, and the sales speak for themselves. Built with a superior multiplayer experience, Medal of Honor is a key element in our strategy to capture shooter-category leadership along with blockbusters like Battlefield: Vietnam, Bulletstorm, Crysis 2 and the much-anticipated Battlefield 3. 
Last week, we brought our flagship PC franchise, The Sims 3, to High-Definition console for the first time ever. The early read on sales looks good. EA SPORTS launched two new franchises: NBA JAM and MMA. NBA JAM is a great title for the Wii and will soon be available on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. MMA, or Mixed Martial Arts game, launched with a great roster of fighters and innovative online features. It's off to a slow start, but we are optimistic that this one will find an audience of fight fans over the holidays. Also, as Eric mentioned, we have elected to cancel NBA ELITE 11. Future development of that franchise will be handled at EA Tiburon in Orlando. 
Our soccer game, FIFA 11, is breaking worldwide sales records. The game has sold an almost 8 million units to date, up more than 20% over last year's great performance. FIFA 11 has captured a worldwide segment share of more than 80%. It remains the number one title in Europe and has sold almost twice as many units as the number two game in Europe. This is amazing growth from our largest franchise, which has sold, life-to-date, over 100 million units. Congratulations to the developers of EA Canada and the European publishing team who drove it to the top of the charts. 
Looking ahead, we are preparing for the launch of more holiday blockbusters, including EA SPORTS Active 2 and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1. Our biggest release for Q3 is Need for Speed Hot Pursuit. This is one of EA's greatest franchises and is back with action, cops, high-speed chases, crashes and a hugely new innovative online feature, Autolog. A suite of connected features that allows friends and competitors to set up match races, compare times and share their experiences. This one looks like a true holiday blockbuster. 
Our message on Packaged Goods is simple: our strategy is working. EA is delivering fewer titles, better quality and bigger hits. In Q2, we have six of the top 20 titles in the Western world, and we're the number one publisher with a 21% share. On HD consoles and PC, our share was 28% in Q2. We lead on the largest, most attractive platform. 
Now I'll turn to our Digital and Online business. Digital extensions to Packaged Goods software and a division we call EAI, which includes mobile, Pogo online games for the PC and Facebook and the Playfish social net gaming network. As Eric mentioned, we are on track to hit 750 million in total Digital revenue this fiscal year, and we're very excited about this side of our business. I'll start with the proliferation of smartphones, tablets and mobile operating systems. 
In recent weeks, we've seen great new products for Apple's iOS, Google's Android platform and Microsoft's Windows Phone 7. We've also seen a strong launch of commercial games for Amazon's Kindle. At EA, we're particularly proud of our leadership in this space. We are the number one publisher across the entire Apple App Store. Our recent acquisition, Chillingo, is the number three publisher, further strengthening our reach on this key platform.
Chillingo adds another dimension to our mobile leadership. EA Mobile has nailed this market with established brands like FIFA, Madden, The Sims and Tetris. Chillingo works with independent developers to bring their innovative, original creations to market. They provide the technology and expertise to turn a good indie game into a great big hit. And they approved it with great games like Angry Birds and Cut the Rope. Another asset they bring to EA is Chillingo's social gaming platform, which allows friends to challenge each other, earning achievements, compete on leaderboards and share their experiences on Facebook and Twitter. 
Other opportunities for growth in mobile, include Android and Windows Phone 7. Android is growing incredibly fast. And then there's the Kindle, where the Scrabble game we published in partnership with Hasbro outsold all other Kindle books to secure the number one position in the Kindle store. Yes, an EA game was the number one selling product, more than any book on the Kindle store for almost two straight weeks. Scrabble was knocked out of first place by another EA game, Solitaire for the Kindle. Each of these, Android, Windows Phone 7 and the Kindle, represent new platforms and opportunities for our games. 
Next, some big news from our casual online division, Pogo. Pogo has launched an initiative to grow beyond its strong PC base and reach millions of new players on new platforms. To start, a beta version of Pogo is now available on Facebook with about 20 of Pogo's favorite games, including Poppit!, Word Whomp, Turbo 21 and First Class Solitaire. Also, on Pogo for Facebook are popular Hasbro titles such as Scrabble, Monopoly, Boggle, Yahtzee Party!, and Trivial Pursuit. Watch for more Pogo news, games and exciting new platforms in the weeks ahead. 
Facebook continues to grow rapidly, with an estimated 250 million gamers each playing an average of 3.5 hours per month. In Q2, Playfish saw improved monetization thanks to the launch of Madden NFL Superstars and continued success of their top franchises. And today, we announced a five-year agreement with Facebook, a strategic partnership to establish a simplified experience for consumer transactions. Going forward, we will use Facebook credits as the exclusive play payment method for our transactions on that platform. 
And now I'll turn the call back to John Riccitiello."

So as an observation, mid-70s is generally perceived to be pretty good. I think ultimately, what happened there and pretty much as we'd expected, the game appeals really well to a mass market, your average gamer. There is a small minority of folks, sometimes well represented by core gamer reviewers or game magazine reviewers, where best I can tell they spend 80 or 90 hours a week playing first person shooters. They are very core to that segment, and some of them didn't like the title. Again, not on the kind of expected. So far, the title has outperformed our sales expectations, continues to outperform our expectations through to week three, which we didn't include in the numbers we just gave you. So it feels very good. As an aside, one of the things that we track very carefully is input to our customer service call-in lines and web question-and-answer from our service personnel. And it's interesting that Medal of Honor is getting some of the strongest positive reviews on fun to play and other positive attributes, more so than other shooters we've shipped in the past. So by and large, it feels like the game that we got on this one is from an exceptionally narrow demographic of reviewers that gave it a negative review, offset by a more overwhelming majority of people that are buying it and enjoying it.

The cash cost of the restructuring is essentially the same as what we otherwise would have paid out over time under existing commitments on license contracts and development agreements.

In regards to the PC business, packaged sales versus full-game PC digital download, we're seeing that increase over time.

And I think it bodes well as we go from a world where, if you think about it, a minority of consumers around the world have got a game-ready device connected to their plasma or otherwise High-Definition television to that being sort of a universal standard. What I like about EA is I think it's going to really present itself to the consumer in two ways. One is stuff that looks a lot like what we do in EAI with our more casual offerings, and I think a big part of it is going to feel more traditional. And I think we can participate in both. It's likely to promote more direct-to-consumer digital models, which, as we've indicated up until now, leave more of the money in our pockets as a business than they do of various folks taking a piece out of the middle. So I think it's a long-term positive. I think it supports both core and more casual offerings. I think it's a growth driver, and I think navigating the specifics is going to be tricky and interesting to watch."

So one observation and a comment I should have made earlier with respect to Medal of Honor. The game has exceeded our plan and expectations sell-through and sell-in, and those expectations were they went up as they went from plan to forecast and as we updated our forecast through the year. So in every possible gate of opportunity to increase the forecast we did, and then we exceeded those forecasts based on strong sell-in numbers. So it is absolutely a clear success as a business for us. And consumer feedback has been strong to suggest that we've got a franchise now, once again, that we can successfully and effectively sequel in the future. Now I think it's the first step with this franchise, sort of back into the marketplace where Battlefield: Bad Company is essentially on its fifth edition, alternating between Battlefield 1, Battlefield 2 and a couple of additions of various expansions in the Bad Company franchise. So that we had expected, and we realized greater sales on Battlefield: Bad Company 2 than Medal of Honor, but just slightly based on the first few weeks of sell-in. Battlefield: Bad Company 2 in its third week, as I recall, I don't have the numbers in front of me, spiked up in week three more than we thought. It actually decayed less in week three than we'd thought, and that was really strong word of mouth among gamer press. We started to see sort of a quality-driven rise, where Medal of Honor is following a slightly more traditional decay curve as what we would have expected this time of year."

We've got it on FIFA. We've built an exercise business in EA SPORTS Active. We've added nice line of products in the form, martial arts and boxing, and we've been growing Digital. I would say that one of the things that is true is we've been focused very much on making sure that they're not just a representation of what we are on the front of the magazine, but they're also in the front of the annual report, but they are big contributor in the back of the annual report relative to the profit contribution.  Without getting into specifics, it's a substantially profitable business comparable to our other businesses. It can do better over the years to come, which is why we've addressed some of the structural issues. This is not our first cut at some of those structural issues. We took some steps a few years ago to allow these businesses to be as profitable as the best of any packaged goods and digital business for us. I particularly see an opportunity in sports, in the EA SPORTS brand as casual and social and mobile continues to grow. It might be a stretch for imagining some franchises whether they be core RPG or RTS, sort of reaching 30 million or 40 million people in the United States. But sports is interesting to almost everybody. I live in San Francisco last night. And you could frankly hear the cheer rising out of the city at about 8:20 or 8:30, whatever the time was. So there's very little that unites consumers the way sports does, and we are the leading proponent and I think advocate and ultimately, beneficiary of all these platforms to go forward and that's based on profit growth."

In fact, we're going to a vendor where everyone on Facebook now actually can have Facebook credits and they can be used to purchase virtual items on all of their games. So what we think will happen is rather than pay one vendor, we're going to pay Facebook. And we're going to see a lot more of the 250 million gamers actually have Facebook credits in their account. In fact, I think they all may have Facebook credits in their account now as Facebook ceded them with Facebook credits to turn them into spenders.

First, with regard to the big MMO we've been talking a lot about, we're not trying to avoid your question on the call. But the fact is when we make our announcements for a consumer franchise like that, we'll make a consumer announcement as opposed to sort of a release through a financial review as we are doing today. Secondly, in my prepared comments, just one thing I wanted to highlight for you, I finished by encouraging you to take a look at Need for Speed. There was a reason I encouraged that. I think Autolog can do for driving and/or for Need for Speed what superior forms of multiplayer game play did for shooters a few short years ago. It's the first truly compelling online feature set for a driving game, and it's worth paying attention to. If you're looking for innovation-driving outcomes, it's a place to look for innovation."

The innovation is going to drive online play like we haven't seen in driving if it catches on. That's still to be proven, but I'm pretty confident that it should work. I think the second thing to remember is this holiday is fairly crowded with products that appeal quite richly to a very core audience.
