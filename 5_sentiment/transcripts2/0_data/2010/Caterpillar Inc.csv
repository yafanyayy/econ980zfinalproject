And good morning, and welcome to the Caterpillar Year End Earnings Conference Call. I'm Mike DeWalt, the Director of Investor Relations. And I'm pleased to have our Chairman and CEO, Jim Owens; our Vice Chairman and Chairman Elect, Do",2722,"Thank you very much. And good morning, and welcome to the Caterpillar Year End Earnings Conference Call. I'm Mike DeWalt, the Director of Investor Relations. And I'm pleased to have our Chairman and CEO, Jim Owens; our Vice Chairman and Chairman Elect, Doug Oberhelman; and our CFO, Dave Burritt, with me on the call today.As always, this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc., and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of this call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, you can go to the SEC Filings area of the Investor section of our cat.com website or to the SEC's website, where it will be filed as an 8-K.  In addition, certain information relating to projections of our result that we'll be discussing today is forward-looking and involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to materially differ from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that either individually or in the aggregate we believe could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A, Business Risk Factors, of our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 30, 2009. And it's also on our Safe Harbor language contained in today's release.  Earlier this morning, we reported results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2009, and we provided an outlook for 2010.  Sales and revenues were $7.9 billion for the quarter and $32.4 billion for the full year. And that was about in the middle of our $32 billion to $33 billion outlook for sales and revenues in 2009. So in general, sales and revenues were about as expected. Profit in the fourth quarter was $0.36 per share, and that included redundancy costs of $0.05 a share. Excluding redundancy, profit was $0.41 a share. Full year profit was $1.43 per share, including redundancy costs of $0.75.  Excluding redundancy, profit was $2.18 a share. At $2.18, profit was $0.13 higher than the top-end of our 2009 profit outlook, largely a result of favorable taxes. The $7.9 billion of sales and revenues in the fourth quarter was down about $5 billion or 39% compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. And similar to prior quarters this year, the decline was primarily due to significantly-lower end user demand and continued dealer inventory reductions and partially offset by favorable price realization. Currency was also favorable to sales in the fourth quarter.Fourth quarter profit per share of $0.36 was $0.72 lower than the $1.08 in the fourth quarter of 2008. But given the $5 billion drop in sales and revenues, the $0.72 per share drop in fourth quarter profit was relatively modest. Significant cost reduction and favorable price realization helped to offset a large portion of the impact of lower sales volume.Combined, our manufacturing, R&D and SG&A costs were $1.1 billion lower than the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year, sales and revenues of $32.4 billion, declined about $19 billion or 37% from $51.3 billion in 2008. Machinery volume was off $13.9 billion. Engine volume was down $5.1 billion. And currency impacts in Financial Products revenues were each negative, over $400 million.Dealer inventory changes contributed to a decline in year-over-year sales volume. And to fully understand the impact on the 2009 versus 2008 change in sales, we need to understand what actually happened to inventory in both 2008 and 2009. In 2008, dealers increased machine inventories by $1.5 billion and engines about $700 million. That means that our 2008 sales were higher than end user demand by about $2 billion. In contrast, dealers cut machine inventories $3.3 billion and engines about $600 million in 2009. That means that our sales of machines and engines were nearly $4 billion lower than end user demand in 2009.So there are two key points in here. First, when looking at the '08 to 2009 year-over-year change in our top line, dealer inventory changes drove about $6 billion of the $19 billion decline. The second key point is that we undersold end user demand in 2009, and that's a positive for 2010.Let's turn to profit. For the full year, profit declined from $5.66 in 2008 to $1.43 in 2009. Redundancy cost in 2009 were $706 million before tax, $471 million after tax and have an impact of $0.75 per share. So again, excluding redundancy cost, profit per share was $2.18.Without a doubt, the drop in sales volume was the major negative profit driver. However, the impact of lower volume was partially offset by several favorable factors. First, cost reduction was substantial. We had a strategy in place for the trough of the business cycle and executed it early and aggressively to lower costs. For the year, manufacturing costs were favorable, more than $600 million, and SG&A and R&D costs combined were favorable $1.3 billion.  In addition, taxes were favorable. Price realization was favorable about 3%, and that's a positive impact of over $900 million. Currency was a positive and product mix was favorable.Without a doubt, cost reduction was a major focus and a big success in 2009. And I think most of you know that, and we've talked about it throughout the year. But there were a number of other successes in 2009 besides cost reduction. And when you look at them in their totality, it paints a fuller picture of the hard work and success achieved by the entire Caterpillar Team in what was one of the most economically-difficult years in modern history. Here are some of the highlights.  First, despite the most significant percentage decline in our sales and revenues since the mid-1940s, we delivered solid profitability, $1.43 a share or $2.18, excluding redundancy. And that included the 3% improvement in price realization in 2009. And in this demand environment, that was remarkable.In addition to profit, it was a good year for cash flow. Machinery and Engines operating cash flow was about $3 billion in 2009. That's down from $3.6 billion in 2008, but considering the challenges that 2009 presented, it was a good year for cash flow. The balance sheet dramatically improved in 2009. The debt-to-capital ratio for Machinery and Engines improved from 57.5% at year end 2008 to 47.2% at year end 2009. On top of the debt-to-cap improvement, we added significantly to cash.  And on a consolidated basis, we held nearly $5 billion at year end 2009. Our financial position was helped by improvements in working capital, including a $2.4 billion inventory reduction. In addition, the net of accounts payable and accounts receivable was also favorable. Strong financial position, continued profitability and solid cash flow enabled us to maintain the dividend rate. The dividend was and is a high priority. We're pleased that we had the financial strength to maintain the dividend rate in such a difficult environment, a year that saw many companies eliminate or cut their dividends.Despite nearly-frozen debt markets in late 2008 and early 2009, Caterpillar and Cat Financial maintained good access to capital markets for both short-term commercial paper and long-term debt and without participating in government programs.  For both Caterpillar Inc. and Cat Financial, we maintained our mid-A credit rating in 2009. And speaking of Cat Financial, during a very tough year for banks and financial companies in general that so many of them fail or lose money, Cat Financial was solidly profitable in every quarter of 2009. And it's also noteworthy that Cap Financial's past dues improved during the fourth quarter. In addition, we funded pension plans by $1.1 billion in 2009 through a combination of Cat and Caterpillar stock. The Cat stock appreciated about 60% from the time it was contributed in May to year end 2009.  In addition, the funded status of our pension plans also improved from 61% at year end 2008 to 76% at the end of 2009.And in terms of investment for the future, we did reduce capital expenditures and R&D from record highs in 2008. However, we were still able to invest $1.3 billion in CapEx in 2009, and our R&D was the second-highest year on record.The highlights for the year wouldn't be complete without touching on the entire Caterpillar Team: our employees, our suppliers and our dealers. Cost reduction, while necessary to keep the company strong and positioned for long-term success, was painful. Many people lost their jobs, and many others endured rolling layoffs, cuts in compensation and uncertainty about the future. Throughout 2009's economic troubles, our employees pulled together to get the job done. Our accomplishments in 2009 are a result of a dedicated and engaged workforce. And for those employees listening to this call, thank you.Many of our suppliers had a tougher year than we did. In addition to weak end user demand and the impact of Cat dealer inventory reductions, they saw even deeper cuts as we reduced inventories in our factories. They responded, and we did not experience significant supply disruption from our supply base. And that's a testament to their ability to manage through a very tough year. Finally, it's appropriate to wrap up a summary of 2009 accomplishments and highlights with a comment on Cat dealers. The dealers are a significant competitive advantage. They're very well-ran businesses that are well established in their territories, and they have a strong reputation for customer service. It's partly because of the focus on service and aftermarket support that our dealers were able to weather a very tough year like 2009.And I'm pleased to report that the Caterpillar dealer network is intact. That should wrap up 2009. Let's look forward to 2010.  The good news is that both economic data and what we are seeing in our business points to a better 2010. From an economic standpoint, we expect that the world economy will grow more than 3% in 2010. We expect that interest rates will remain low. With unemployment rate high, inflation low and plenty of slack capacity in the economy, we don't think there's a need for higher interest rates. While we don't think inflation will become a problem, we do expect that some Central Banks may implement precautionary rate increases. And our outlook reflects an increase by the Federal Reserve to 1% and an increase by the European Central Bank to 2% by year end 2010.Most commodity prices that are important to our business improved during 2009 and are at levels that are above what we believe is needed to encourage increased production and investment. We also expect that improving economic conditions will add to world demand for most commodities.Recovery in the world economy is being led by developing economies, which are growing again. China is important, and we expect continued good growth. And in addition, we are expecting better growth in 2010 for most of the developing world. However, developed economies have performed poorly and recoveries have been slower to advance. We expect that developed economies will grow much slower, at about 2% in 2010, which should maintain significant excess capacity in the economy and should keep inflation subdued.  In that 2% number for developed economies, we expect U.S. growth of about 3 1/2%, with slower growth of about 1 1/2% in Japan and 1% in Europe. Now based on our economic outlook, we expect that our 2010 sales and revenues will be up 10% to 25% from 2009. And key elements of that forecast include, first, dealer inventory. In 2009, again, dealers reduced new machine inventories by $3.3 billion and engines by about $600 million. And again, that was negative for our sales last year of almost $4 billion. In 2010, we don't expect much change in dealer inventories, and so dealer inventory is the most significant year-over-year positive for sales.Growth in the world economy is driving improved demand for commodities. And that, along with favorable commodity prices, should be positive for mining-related sales in 2010. And over the past few months, mining-related order activity has increased substantially, and we expect increased production of mining-related equipment in 2010.Improved economic conditions, particularly in the developing economies, should also improve construction spending and increase end user demand for Machinery. While Machinery sales are expected to increase in 2010, at the midpoint of our outlook range, Engines sales are expected to decline. 2009 was a record year for turbine sales and large reciprocating engine sales were relatively strong through the first half of 2009. While we expect another good year for turbine sales, we are forecasting moderation from 2009's record level. In terms of profit, at the midpoint of the outlook range for 2010 sales and revenues, we expect that profit will be about $2.50 a share. The most significant positive for the 2010 profit outlook is sales volume.  Again, primarily driven by higher machine sales.  Redundancy costs should be favorable compared with 2009. While redundancy costs were $706 million in 2009, we do not expect significant charges in 2010.Material costs are expected to be favorable in 2010, and improved operating efficiency should also be a positive, a result of higher production volume and continuing improvement from the Cat Production System. Price realization is expected to be slightly favorable, but the improvement is anticipated to be small relative to 2009's improvement.  Financial Product's profit before tax is expected to be about flat compared with 2009, as the impact of improving economic conditions on the performance of that portfolio is expected to be about offset by the impact of lower earning assets.While we're encouraged by improving economic conditions in 2010, there are several important factors that are expected to mitigate the improvement in profit. And the most significant is income taxes. In 2009, if you exclude redundancy costs and the tax related to redundancy, income tax was actually favorable, about 3% of profit before tax. And again, that's excluding redundancy. That was a combination of a very favorable geographic mix of profits and losses from a tax perspective and $133 million of tax benefits, primarily related to the settlement of prior-year returns. Our 2010 outlook of $2.50 a share assumes a tax rate of 30%, which is more in line with historical levels.In addition to taxes, product mix is expected to be unfavorable. The impact of dealer inventory declines in 2009 had a more significant negative impact on smaller, low-margin machines. As a result, production and sales of smaller machines will likely be proportionately higher in 2010.In addition, while total sales and revenues are expected to be up 10% to 25% in 2010, sales of relatively higher-margin turbines and large reciprocating engines are expected to decline. In addition, LIFO inventory decrement benefits in 2009 were $300 million, and we're not forecasting additional LIFO decrement benefits in 2010.R&D expense is expected to increase about 20%, primarily to support product development programs related to EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] Tier 4 emission requirements.  Another unfavorable item is related to currency.  In 2009, in the other income and expense line on the income statement, we had favorable currency impacts that we're not expecting to repeat in 2010. And depreciation and pension expense are also expected to increase. Finally, earnings per share is being impacted somewhat by higher share count. And this is a result of the stock contributed to the pension plan in the second quarter of 2009 and some increase in dilution related to equity-based compensation.One final point about 2010, and that is we expect improvements to ramp up as we progress through the year. And that's just the opposite of what happened in 2009. The first quarter of 2009 was our highest quarter for sales and revenues in a year. In 2010, the first quarter will likely be the lowest. So on a year-over-year comparative basis, the first quarter will be the toughest comparison by far. We don't provide quarterly sales and profit guidance, and we don't plan to start. But it's safe to say that we expect that the first quarter of 2010 will be well less than a fourth of the year's outlook for sales and profit.That summarizes the outlook. We certainly had a roller coaster year in 2009, severely depressed demand and significant reductions in dealer inventories, partially offset by very good execution by the entire Caterpillar Team. And finally, we are optimistic about a return to growth in 2010. With that, we're ready to take your questions."

In the sales increase, if you think about what's driving the sales increase, there's a lot of small machine business improvement in there. And some of that is from end market demand, but a lot of it is because 2009 was hurt so bad with the dealer inventory reductions. And dealers would tend to inventory more of the smaller and midsized product rather than, say, the big mining product, for example. So a lot of the machine increase this year, not all of it but a lot of it, proportionally more of it would be smaller, low-margin machines. And so that is going to be a drag on overall incremental margins. We talked about Solar being down. We talked turbines. We talked about large Reciprocating Engine business being down. And if you look at Machines versus Engines operating margins this year, clearly, Engines are higher margin and big recips and turbines are a big driver. Most of [ph] them down, that's going to contribute to that negative mix. So mix is a pretty sizable negative driver. The flip side of that -- well, I should also say pension is going to be negative. I think the number will probably be less than $200 million. But definitely negative, like R&D. I think from a positive standpoint, and we mentioned this in the release but I will reiterate it here, we're looking for better operating efficiency next year. That ought to be a positive as we go into 2010. And material cost ought to be a positive as we go into 2010. Price, overall, not so much. I mean, we said less than 1%. I wouldn't count on price being a big driver next year. So positives: material cost, efficiency; negatives: R&D, product mix, pension, a little depreciation."

We did have a good quarter on cost in the fourth quarter, particularly compared to the fourth quarter a year ago, our costs were down about $1 billion versus fourth quarter a year ago. And again, I think the headwinds on incremental margin next year are definitely product mix, R&D costs, no LIFO benefits. But a lot of that is offset by operating improvement and material cost reductions. So on balance, there are items on both sides of the equation in terms of better or worse. By I wouldn't say 40% would be normal. That would be well above I think what our normal variable margin rate would be."

I don't think anything has changed that. I think the Chinese government is responding to very robust growth in the last six months. Going probably north of 10% and they're concerned about creating an inflationary bubble longer term. And I think it's probably pretty prudent on their part to at least tap on the brakes here. Hopefully, tap on the brakes not send their brakes [ph] through the windshield. But I think there's high probability they'll be able to sustain growth between 8% and 10%, while moderating a little bit, coming out of the very aggressive stance they took with monetary and fiscal policy, to stimulate growth in the face of a dramatic drop in their exports, to the rest of the world and sustain employment. So I think they've done rather masterfully in macroeconomic management through the cycle so far. But we still think that not only China but India, Southeast Asia, parts of the Middle East, Brazil, and now, even Russia's starting to come back in terms of their macroeconomic fundamentals. And there's a lot of monetary and fiscal stimulus awash in the global economy that gives us a lot of confidence that the recovery will continue to move forward next year, and actually should gain some steam particularly as the U.S. and other OECD countries gain steam towards the latter half of next year or this year. The key, I'll just stop on this one, the key I think for China and the emerging market theater is not so much the domestic demand for our equipment is the fact that they dropped commodity prices in a big way. And we think commodity prices -- there was a period where there's a lot of financial speculation in those markets that seems to have wrung itself out in order to increase capacity, there's investment required. And therefore, we're still pretty optimistic about long term prospects for energy development and mineral development capacity increases that are needed. And we still have a fleet of equipment out there that's pretty old. So that leaves us pretty optimistic about those sectors."

We had a great banner boom year for Solar. We had a solid year for our large recips that tailed off during the year as we reported. If you look at our operating margin though and pull out the redundancy in 2009, our operating margin was a bit self-serving on our part, was spectacular. Particularly with redundancies for the Seguin, Texas plant which is underway. The walls are up, some machine tools are installed and that's on plan for mid-year production. Particularly with continued heavy investments in '09 for Tier 4, which is coming up at the beginning of 2011. And then a continued headwind and drag from the residual of our Highway business, as we've talked about before particularly in August at the analyst meeting. As we work through those in '10, a lot of things are happening. Again, Solar is going to be down a bit. Large recips will be down a little bit in the early part of the year. But on the positive side, we've got a lot of tailwinds going for us as we get Seguin online and our Tier 4 goes into 2011. So I would just say on the Engine side, '09 was definitely the trough as we see it. We're very happy with solid margins we have. And I know many of you have asked how low do they go, I won't comment on that. But we're thinking that it is lot, more stable business going forward than in the past as we work through some of these structural changes that will come to fruition for the most part by the end of '10."

I think I'll start at the end of that with small machines. I think in this context, what I'm really trying to distinguish in the discussion here is that generally speaking, the bigger the machine usually the better we do in margins. It's not 100% but I think that's a reasonable rule of thumb. We're talking about a good environment this year for mining. We mentioned that in the release. But I think that if you look at what happened to dealer inventory, it did affect BCP products, it affected mid-size excavators, mid-size wheel loaders, not just BCP. And for the most part, big mining equipment would certainly be better margin than the lot. Another point here, I guess, I don't think we made, maybe strongly enough, and that is when we talk about Machinery and we talk about Engines, our Integrated Service businesses other than Financial Products are embedded in Machinery and embedded in Engines. And they tend to be higher margin than some of the Machines, particularly small machines. While we expect those businesses to be up, I think the dealer inventory impact on new machines is going to be a big driver in this year's sales. And new machines are generally lower margin in general than Engines. I mean you can look at the operating profit for Engines this year versus Machines this year. And then if you dig down deeper, it's BCP, small excavators, small wheel loaders. The kinds of things that dealers would inventory as opposed again to say, mining. So I think BCP is certainly wasn't the entire change in inventory. It was in probably most machine categories but I think if you were to look at mid-size and small machines, that's the kind of thing that dealers proportionately would inventory more of."

And we're not talking about so much building dealer inventory as the absence of declining dealer inventories next year. And a big ramp up in volumes there and therefore very attractive capacity utilization is very much a function as it always has been of the macroeconomic recovery in the world. So the big issue and question, and maybe range of -- the reason we have a range on our volumes is uncertainty about how strong this V recovery might be and what you think about that. I mean good people are going to disagree about how this economic recovery is going to look worldwide. And we're capacitized for a return to normal times.

That's a great kind of lead into discussion in oil and gas that you alluded to and asked about -- no question, gas particularly natural gas in North America, is depressed. I mean we've seen the shale gas come on in big way the last two or three years, which have added to the supplier, a remarkable turnaround in North America certainly. But we do see the oil business picking up, demand for our products that we use around petroleum. We see oil rates still flat to declining around gas. The wildcard though, as Jim mentioned is economic growth. If we see a V, we see growth picking up around the world later, as we go through to 2010, that gas and oil is going to go. It's remarkable to me that the gas is 20% up from a year ago, $5.5. And certainly most of our lifetime and certainly in the history of the industry, gas at 5.5 and oil at 75, 70, 80 are just very high prices. That drove a lot of investment. We'll work through, particularly with the drop in demand, but the long term forecast for energy consumption, if you look at it out through 2025 short, medium and long, is a growing rate. And we see that business going up. So it's question of when the turn is. And as Jim mentioned, a lot of that depends on the '10 GDP growth."

So if you would just answer that question that would be good. And then secondly and related to that, I'm trying to understand why, in response to the earlier question, with every commodity going up, steel, copper, tubes, hoses, why your material costs would go down in 2010?"

We think that demand will continue to grow and grow pretty rapidly as we're putting it through increasingly the Caterpillar rental store network in-country. We had made that product better, more robust. I would say we have reasonably attractive margins on it. It's lower cost, probably less long-lasting, but margins in line with the smaller end of our product line in profitability. We are looking at other mid-tier product which will be gradually introduced this year that will be sold primarily in emerging markets at a lower price point. That again, will have somewhat less features and somewhat less longevity, but which we think speaks to the customer needs in those countries. But again, I think margins in line with the smaller end of our mid-range in core machines. So that we're growing. And simultaneously we're growing the our Caterpillar branded and investing pretty heavily, particular our dealers in the region in dealer capacity. And these things, I think, we've been making those investments in our capacity in China and are continuing to grow our emerging market, manufacturing capability and capacity and supplier network. On the material cost side, we have had dedicated teams working with all of our product managers on ways to reduce material cost. Some of this is Engineering changes, standardization of specs, consolidation of suppliers on a worldwide basis, and just outright negotiations, and being sure that we are getting materials equal or better priced than any of our competitors could get it. We're the volume leader in our industry worldwide, so it's just gotten a tremendous amount of focus. And we have, we're pretty confident. A line of sight of having material cost decline slightly next year in spite of the fact that commodity prices are holding at pretty good levels. Doug, you want to add anything to that?"

Earlier this morning we reported results for the first quarter and we updated our outlook for the full year of 2010, and to start this morning, I’ll quickly summarize the quarter and updated outlook, then we’ll take your questions.
Let’s start with the quarter and what a difference a year makes. In the first quarter last year, we were seeing rapidly declining demand, order cancellations, turmoil in credit markets and declining economies across much of the world.
At Caterpillar, we were busy cutting production, costs, employment and working capital. Our major focus was on three goals; maintaining profitability, holding the dividend and maintaining our mid A credit rating, and we were successful at all three.
This year’s first quarter saw a very different picture. Capital markets are in much better shape than last year. Demand for our products is rising, and our we’re seeing it in most geographic regions, although it’s much more robust in the developing countries  of Asia, Latin America, Africa, Middle East and the CIS.
We’re also seeing a significant pick up in mining globally. In fact, we’ve already filled our available 2010 production slots for some of our large truck models and are taking orders for 2011. 
Demand for after-market service parts in our machinery and engine businesses is very strong and gained steam as we moved through the quarter, and this is usually a good indicator of how much work is getting done in the field, and the strength we’ve seen is encouraging. We’re working with our suppliers and within our own factories to ramp up production, and in some cases, to accelerate plant capacity additions. 
In terms of employment, we are able to absorb a portion of the production improvement with the existing work force by winding down the rolling plan shut downs that we used last year to manage production declines. However, we’re also selectively adding to employment to support increasing demand.
We’re seeing employment increases in our factories in Asia and Latin America where the demand improvement is the strongest, and also in key U.S. facilities that are seeing export demand, and the employees in those factories certainly understand the importance of free trade.
I think the contrast between last year and this year can be summed up by saying, last year we were rapidly ramping down and faced a very negative economic climate. This year, we’re rapidly ramping up and are seeing much better prospects for the world economy.
Sales and revenues in the first quarter were $8.2 billion, and that was down about $1 billion from the first quarter of last year. Now, given my positive comments about the economic environment, you may be asking why are sales and revenues lower than the first quarter last year when demand is improving and we’re ramping up production.
Well, there are two main reasons; first, we ended 2008 with a strong order book for mining productions and large engines, and while we saw cancellations, and very few new orders, we did continue to produce and ship mining products, large engines and turbines at relatively good levels throughout the first quarter of 2009.
The second reason is that it does take some time to ramp up, and not just in our factories. Our suppliers are seeing in many cases, dramatically higher demand from us. We’ve increased production schedules throughout the quarter and March was our best month for sales and revenues since the end of 2008.
One other point about sales, and that is, throughout 2009 we talked a lot about the impact of dealer inventory changes and the very negative impact that had on our full year 2009 sales as dealers shed inventory. This year, we’re expecting relatively flat dealer inventory and for the most part, that’s what happened in the first quarter.  Overall, dealers have new machine inventories about flat but took engine inventories down about $200 million.
While the midpoint of our outlook reflects relatively flat dealer inventories in 2010, in some regions, inventories are becoming lean, and the higher we are this year in our outlook range, the more likely it is that collectively, dealers may add some to their inventory later in the year.
Okay, let’s turn the first quarter profit. Profit in the quarter was $0.36 a share and during the quarter, we recorded a $90 million after tax charge related to Medicare Subsidy tax changes in the recently signed U.S. Health Care legislation.
Excluding that charge, profit was $0.50 a share. That compares with the first quarter of 2009 when we had a loss of 40.19 a share including redundancy costs of $558 million. Excluding the impact of redundancy, we earned a profit of $0.39 a share in the first quarter of last year.
Now again, that’s $0.50 a share in the first quarter this year, excluding the Medicare charge and $0.39 a share in the first quarter last year excluding redundancy.
Just a few key points about the quarter. Profit was higher despite lower sales volume and a negative product mix. Manufacturing costs were favorable $566 million and included in that, labor and overhead costs, warranty and material costs, were all favorable.
SG&A and R&D costs were close to being neutral despite added costs for incentive compensation and pension expense. Our machinery line of business was profitable for the first time since the third quarter of 2008 and engine operating profit as a percent of sales improved sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2009.
Cash flow was a positive and our machinery and engines debt to capital ratio improved from year end 2009. All in all, it was a good quarter. Demand in order rates have picked up. We’re ramping up production. Efficiency is improving. Costs were down and the balance sheet continues to improve.
That was a quick look at the quarter. Now let’s turn to the outlook. This morning we raised guidance for sales and revenues and for profit. Our original outlook reflected sales and revenues up 10% to 25% from 2009 and in dollars that was a range of $35.6 billion to $40.5 billion, with a midpoint of about $38 billion. The revised outlook we provided this morning has a top line range of $38 billion to $42 billion with a midpoint at $40 billion. 
In terms of profit, the original outlook expected $2.50 a share at the midpoint of the sales and revenues range. In our revised outlook this morning, reflects a range of $2.50 to $3.25 per share with a midpoint of $2.88.
A point of clarification, that outlook does include the negative impact of the first quarter tax charge related to the U.S. Health Care legislation. In other words, our profit expectation for the year would have been higher if the bill had not been enacted.
Now there are four main reasons for the improvement in our outlook this morning. First, while our original outlook for 2010 did expect growth in developing countries, it’s now looking even stronger. Engine sales, particularly for gas turbines are looking better than we expected.
Sales of aftermarket parts, which are integral to and included in our machinery and engine businesses are growing faster than expected, and finally, mining is increasing more than in our original outlook.
Now in terms of costs in the outlook, in general what we said in our original outlook, looks to be about on track, and some key elements include favorable material costs for the full year, favorable manufacturing labor and overhead costs driven by improving factory efficiency, SG&A costs should be up slightly excluding short term incentive pay, and as we sais in our original outlook we do expect higher R&D expense.
As a reminder, pension costs are up as well and included in manufacturing, SG&A and the R&D lines.
Also one other point, with profit improving, we do expect increased short term incentive pay, and that’s linked to improving financial results and is as a result, highly aligned with shareholder interests.
That’s the outlook. In summary, the first quarter was a very good start to the year. We’re seeing positive increases in demand. Our machine production is increasing and we raised the outlook for 2010. 
Just one more comment before we move on to the Q&A section, and that is, we’re going to hold our annual Analyst Meeting this year in New York City on August 19 in the afternoon. So mark your calendars. We’ll provide you more details on that over the next couple of weeks.
With that, we’re ready to take your questions.

It’s Doug Oberhelman speaking. As you know, I’ll become CEO in about two months time, and I thought given that this is Jim Owens’ last quarterly call, I would mention a few key statistics of Jim’s time in office here; what’s happened during what will no doubt be one of the most interesting runs as CEO in our history where sales mushroomed and then sales tanked and I’ll get into that in just a little bit.
Jim has done, we all think here, a wonderful job for our company, and let me tell you some of that. Jim became our CEO on February 1, 2004. That seems like many lifetimes ago, Jim but it went fast and here we are in 2010 already. That’s six years and 24 quarters for the record. 2003 earnings per share before Jim came in as CEO were $1.56 a share, and I know as I look back on some of these statistics, I had forgotten a lot of this history.
Of course we peaked at $5.66 a share in 2008, which was a record of any time in our history.  2003 sales were $23 billion and I can remember so well a couple of studies we did at that time wondering how we were going to ever break above $20 billion where we had been stuck for six or seven years or so at that number, and sure enough in 2008 we ballooned up to $51 billion and exceeded Jim’s strategic goal of $50 billion by 2010.
Unfortunately, in 2009 we cut that back by almost 40% and now as you can see from our outlook for 2010, we’re back up to $40 billion. This really gets interesting. During this period of time when Jim was our CEO and Chairman, our stock has risen almost 80% even with the ups and downs of 2009, a tremendously successful run as CEO and Chairman.
When Jim took over our quarterly dividend was $0.185 and today it’s $0.42. That’s 125% increase, and I will tell you that Jim was the main cheerleader, main arm twister of our Board and main driver of maintaining that dividend last year when everybody else was looking to cut around our industry and so many other companies.
He was forthright in his determination that we were going to make it through it. We were going to be profitable in ’09, which we were, maintained our dividend and our cash flow, which we did, and it paid off very well for shareholders.
Employment’s up about 25,000 during this period. It certainly was up more than up, but in the end, we’re still up over where he started, and I think what he’ll really be remembered for and all of you as shareholders and the sell side, probably don’t know a lot of this, but the internal things we changed on Vision 2020, which was his strategy plan that we are working on revising now again, it brought us to growth in China and emerging markets.
It brought us a cap reduction system. It brought us improvements in quality we’re seeing. It brought us efficiencies in our factories, set us up for the next few years, which will really see these things pay off, and we’re all pretty excited about that.
He set us up for the tier-four stage three B in Europe, emissions regulations, brought us the acquisition of Progress Rail which has turned out to be a real winner and one we’re extremely happy of, and I know Jim is very proud of his attendance and membership in the Economic Advisory Council under President Obama.
Another final cap on this, market cap when Jim took over was about $27 billion. Today’s I notice it’s right at $45 billion, and just a great run with this giant rollercoaster in the middle, but he got us through all that. 
So Jim, with that, and this will be the first of many - not the first - but the first of many farewells between now and November 1. But congratulations to you and these statistics you can hold up to anybody anywhere in history anytime.

Now the low end of your sales guidance is really only a couple billion less than $2 billion above that $36.3 billion, so that’s really only about a 5% increase at the low end if the dealer inventories are flat this year. Dealers would be up 5% at the low end of your sales range. That doesn’t seem like a lot considering what’s going on in Asia as you mentioned, so can you elaborate as to why it’s got such a low sales increase at the dealer level at the low end of the range.

The midpoint went up about $2 billion. The midpoint of our guidance is $40 billion. I think we provide a range around that because there are uncertainties in terms of what’s going forward.
Not everything in the year is positive. I mean there are some parts of the business that - engines for example - we see as being flat this year, not a big increase, at least at the midpoint. I think if you were to look at new machine production and look at the percentages around that, that would look better than the total overall.
I think you would find dealer sales are up more than what total sales are, again partly because engines are flat, and the services related businesses that were in the high 40’s in terms of percent of our total sales and revenues are much more stable than the machine and engine business.
So bottom line to that is I think just looking at new machine sales percentage wise, that’s where more of the increase is.

If you think back to last year, we had really high engine margins in the first quarter, relatively weak machine margins. If you look at the sales change quarter over quarter, machines held up pretty well. Most of the decline was in engines.
So in the first quarter, a bigger decline in higher margin engine business than machines. And then if you get within machines, and within engines, you see even more of it. We were producing large engines, turbines, mining product out of a backlog to a higher degree let’s say in the first quarter of a year ago, so we had a pretty good engine mix. We had a pretty good machine mix, and engines were relatively stronger than machines.
All of that kind of turned around here in the first quarter. So those are the negatives. The positives, there were some positives. On balance, it was negative for the quarter. There were a few positives though. We talked a little bit ago about aftermarket. That has seen good improvement and that helped offset some of the other declines. 
As you look out through the full year, partly because of the inventory declines, the dealer inventory declines last year, we’re going to have probably quite a rebound for much of the smaller product because it’s, it has more of an impact from the dealer inventory changes.
So our small BPC product production and sales on that is just going to up substantially this year, and a lot of that is from a dealer inventory impact. So I think as we progress through the year and the machines sales are up, we’ll continue to see this negative mix throughout the year. And we didn’t quantify it in the release separately, but it’s fairly significant.

You’ve got to remember, Tier Four 3B only applies to really Western Europe, Japan and America, and then it’s a phase in. the rest of the world has nothing to do with Tier Four at the moment which would be two-thirds of the business if not a little more.

With lane one for example, our target is about a ten day lead time, and except for a couple of products that are coming out of Japan, and we actually underestimated demand, except for those couple of products, generally speaking that’s about where we’re at.
So delivery time for the roughly 24% of machine sales that came out of lane in March, lead times are very, very short. Now, for product that dealers place on the factory and don’t get out of lane one, we’ve moved in terms of quota delivery time from 11 to 12 weeks to around 15 weeks. So it has moved out, and I think that really a function of again, being an inflection point where we are in process of moving production up to a higher level.
I would point out though, as a part of that, we are giving preferential treatment to dealer orders that have a customer attached. So if there’s a customer involved, those orders generally get shipped three or four weeks earlier than an inventory order, if the dealer is ordering to add t his inventory.

Capital goods are notoriously difficult to forecast. Three to six months ago, most of you, all of our dealers, many of our customers were very pessimistic about the global economy and I don’t think they saw the V-shaped recovery, particularly in a lot of commodity sectors and emerging markets that was unfolding even at that time.
So we’ve had a very sharp bounce back in enthusiasm here, and quite frankly, our economics’ group was well ahead of most marketing groups as well as even customers in forecasting the upturn and the strength of commodity markets.
So as early as October last year, we’ve been out working with suppliers, not only our direct suppliers, but our second tier suppliers helping them understand this inventory cycle and how it was going to impact their sales. I think we’re more ahead of it if you will certainly than we were coming into the ’04 cycle, and our ability to ramp up now, is really a function of how fast we can bring the supply chain along.
Our ability, we’re kind of capacitized for $55 billion or so top line sales and revenue, but we’ve got to bring our supply base up to get to that kind of level, and that’s going to take some time. And we’re working that issue very hard. Again, we had a road show in October, helping get them prepared for this eventuality.

Secondly of course, the greatest honor for me has been playing quarterback for what I think is one of the finer companies on the global stage; great people the world over and in terms of accomplishments, the people side of the equation, what we’ve done on the safety and engagement side, I think bodes very well for the future of our company. It’s just indicative of the kind of very positive change that we’ve made on a continuous and steady basis.
We’re very much focused on managing through the cycle. I think we were challenged certainly to get the pull through we would have liked with explosive growth from ’03 through ’08. I think we demonstrated a lot of capability, maybe surprising some of you, on our ability to manage a very troublesome and horrific recession in ’09.
I think it was one of our finest hours. We showed a lot of nimbleness in taking cost out in a hurry and did achieve what we consider a hat trick of sustaining profitability, sustaining our credit rating and our dividend. And, I think we continued to invest in key capacity bottlenecks and in research and engineering that bode very well for our future.
We’re very much focused on delivering results for long term shareholders, and sometimes I know that doesn’t square with the image of CEO’s that are focused on just quarterly pennies, but we’re very much focused on the long term shareholder.
I think we have our company exceptionally well positioned for growth on a global scale. I can’t tell you, I was honored with Doug’s opening comments, but I think the transition that we planned has been well laid out. It’s going exceptionally well. I’m confident you’re going to hear a strategy roll out in August which shows you exactly how the team is going to take our company to another level going forward for the next five or ten years.

Okay, earlier this morning, we reported results for the first quarter and we updated our outlook for the full year of 2010. And to start this morning, I'll quickly summarize the quarter and updated outlook. Then we'll take your questions. 
Okay, let's start with the quarter and what a difference a year makes. In the first quarter last year, we were seeing rapidly declining demand, order cancellations, turmoil in credit markets and declining economies across much of the world. At Caterpillar, we were busy cutting production, costs, employment and working capital. Our major focus was on three goals, maintaining profitability, holding the dividend and maintaining our midday credit rating, and we were successful at all three.
This year's first quarter saw a very different picture. Capital markets are in much better shape than last year. Demand for our products is rising, and we're seeing it in most geographic regions, although it's much more robust in the developing countries of Asia, Latin America, Africa/Middle East and the CIS.
We're also seeing a significant pickup in mining globally. In fact, we've already filled our available 2010 production slots for some of our large truck models and are taking orders for 2011. Demand for aftermarket service parts in our Machinery and Engine businesses is very strong and gained steam as we moved through the quarter. And this is usually a good indicator of how much work is getting done in the field, and the strength we've seen is encouraging.
While working with our suppliers and within our own factories to ramp up production and, in some cases, to accelerate planned capacity additions in terms of employment, what we are able to absorb, a portion of the production improvement with the existing workforce by winding down the rolling plant shutdowns that we used last year to manage production declines. However, we're also selectively adding to employment to support increasing demand. We're seeing employment increases in our factories in Asia, in Latin America, where the demand improvement is the strongest. And also in key U.S. facilities, they are seeing strong export demand. And employees in those factories certainly understand the importance of free trade.
I think the contrast between last year and this year can be summed up by saying last year, we were rapidly ramping down and faced a very negative economic climate. This year, we're rapidly ramping up and are seeing much better prospects for the world economy.
Sales in revenues in the first quarter were $8.2 billion, and that was down about $1 billion from the first quarter of last year. Now, given my positive comments about the economic environment, you may be asking why our sales and revenues were lower than the first quarter last year when demand is improving and we're ramping up production. Well, there were two main reasons. First, we ended 2008 with a strong order book for mining products and large engines. And while we saw cancellations and very few new orders, we did continue to produce and ship mining products, large engines and turbines at relatively good levels throughout the first quarter of 2009. The second reason is that it does take some time to ramp up, and not just in our factories. Our suppliers are seeing, in many cases, dramatically higher demand from us. We've increased production schedules throughout the quarter, and March was our best month for sales and revenues since the end of 2008. 
One other point about sales, and that is throughout 2009, we talked a lot about the impact of fewer inventory changes and the very negative impact that had on our full year 2009 sales as dealers shut inventory. This year, we're expecting relatively flat dealer inventory, and for the most part, that's what happened in the first quarter. Overall, dealers held new Machine inventories about flat, but took Engine inventories down about $200 million.
While the midpoint of our outlook reflects relatively flat dealer inventories in 2010, in some regions, inventories are becoming lean. And the higher we are this year in our outlook range, the more likely it is that, collectively, dealers may add some to their inventories later in the year. 
Okay, let's turn to the first quarter profit. Profit in the quarter was $0.36 a share, and during the quarter we recorded a $90 million after-tax charge related to Medicare subsidy tax changes in the recently signed U.S. healthcare legislation. Excluding that charge, profit was $0.50 a share. That compares with the first quarter of 2009 when we had a loss of $0.19 a share, including redundancy costs of $558 million. Excluding the impact of redundancy, we earned a profit of $0.39 a share in the first quarter last year. Now, again, that's $0.50 a share in the first quarter this year, excluding the Medicare charge, and $0.39 a share in the first quarter last year, excluding redundancy.
Okay, just a few key points about the quarter.  Profit was higher despite lower sales volume and a negative product mix. Manufacturing costs were favorable, $566 million. And included in that, labor and overhead costs, warranty and material costs were all favorable. SG&A and R&D costs were close to being neutral, despite added costs for incentive compensation and pension expense.
Our Machinery line of business was profitable for the first time since the third quarter of 2008, and engine operating profit, as a percent of sales, improved sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2009. Cash flow was a positive and our Machinery and Engines debt-to-capital ratio improved from year-end 2009. 
All in all, it was a good quarter. Demand and order rates have picked up. We're ramping up production. Efficiency is improving. Costs were down and the balance sheet continues to improve.
Okay.  That was a quick look at the quarter. Now let's turn to the outlook. This morning, we raised guidance for sales and revenues and for profit. Our original outlook reflected sales and revenues up 10% to 25% from 2009. And in dollars, that was a range of $35.6  billion to $40.5 billion, with the midpoint of about $38 billion. The revised outlook we've provided this morning has a top line range of $38 billion to $42 billion with the midpoint at $40 billion. In terms of profit, the original outlook expected $2.50 a share at the midpoint of the sales and revenues range. And our revised outlook this morning reflects a range of $2.50 to $3.25 per share, with the midpoint of $2.88. And a point of clarification, that outlook does include the negative impact of the first quarter tax charge related to the U.S. healthcare legislation. In other words, our profit expectation for the year would have been higher if the bill had not been enacted.
Now, there are four main reasons for the improvement in our outlook this morning. First, while our original outlook for 2010 did expect growth in developing countries, it's now looking even stronger. Engine sales, particularly for gas turbines, are looking better than we expected. Sales of aftermarket parts, which are integral to and included in our Machinery and Engine businesses are growing faster than expected. And, finally, mining is increasing more than in our original outlook.
Now, in terms of costs in the outlook, in general, what we said in our original outlook looks to be about on track, and some key elements include: Favorable material costs for the full year; favorable manufacturing, labor and overhead costs driven by improving factory efficiency; SG&A costs should be up slightly, excluding short-term incentive pay. And as we said in our original outlook, we do expect higher R&D expense. And as a reminder, pension costs are up as well and included in manufacturing, SG&A and the R&D lines. 
Also, one other point with profit improving, we do expect increased short-term incentive pay. And that's linked to improving financial results and is, as a result, highly aligned with shareholder interest. Okay, that's the outlook. 
In summary, the first quarter was a very good start for the year. We're seeing positive increases in demand, our machine production is increasing and we raised the outlook for 2010. Just one more comment before we move on to the Q&A section, and that is we're going to hold our annual analyst meeting this year in New York City on August 19 in the afternoon. So mark your calendars. We'll provide you more details on that over the next couple of weeks.  And with that, we're ready to take your questions."

This is Doug Oberhelman speaking. As you all know, I'll become CEO in about two months' time, and I thought given that this is Jim Owens' last quarterly call, I would mention a few key statistics of Jim's time in office here and what's happened during what will no doubt be one of the most interesting runs as CEO in our history where sales mushroomed and then sales tanked, and I'll get into that in just a little bit. Jim has done a-- we all think here, a wonderful job for our company, and let me tell you some of that. Jim became our CEO on February 1, 2004. That seems like many lifetimes ago, Jim, but it went fast and here we are in 2010 already.  That's six years and 24 quarters, for the record. 2003 earnings per share before Jim came in as CEO were $1.56 a share. And I know as I look back at some of these statistics, I had forgotten a lot of this history. Of course, we peaked at $5.66 a share in 2008, which was a record of any time in our history. 2003 sales were $23 billion, and I can remember so well a couple of studies we did at that time, wondering how we were going to ever break above $20 billion, where we had been stuck for six or seven years or so at that number. And sure enough, in 2008, we ballooned up to $51 billion and exceeded our – Jim's strategic goal of $50 billion by 2010. Unfortunately, in 2009, we cut that back by almost 40%. And now, as you can see from our outlook for 2010, we're back up to 40%. This is really – gets interesting. During this period of time, when Jim was our CEO and Chairman, our stock has risen almost 80%.  Even with the ups and downs of 2009, a tremendously successful run as CEO and Chairman. When Jim took over, our quarterly dividend was $18.5, today it's $0.42, that's 125% increase. And I will tell you that Jim was the main cheerleader, main arm twister of our board and main driver of maintaining that dividend last year when everybody else was looking to cut around our industry in so many other companies. He was forthright in his determination, that we were going to make it through it, we were going to be profitable in '09, which we were; maintained our dividend and our cash flow, which we did, and it paid off very well for shareholders. Employment's up about 25,000 during this period of time. It certainly was up more than that. But in the end, we're still up over where he started. And I think what he'll really be remembered for, and all of you on the – as shareholders and that sell side, probably don't know a lot of this, but the internal things we've changed on Vision 2020, which was his strategy plan that we are working on revising now again. It brought us the growth in China and emerging markets. It brought us the Cat production system. It brought us improvements in quality we're seeing. It brought us sufficiencies in our factories. Set us up for the next few years, which we'll really see these things pay off. And we're all pretty excited about that. We've set us up for the Tier 4, Stage IIIB in Europe, emissions regulations, brought us the acquisition of Progress Rail, which has turned out to be a real winner and one we're extremely happy of. And I know Jim is very proud of his attendance and membership in the Economic Advisory Council under President Obama. Another final cap on this, market cap when Jim took over was about $27 billion. Today, I notice it's right at $45 billion. And just a great run with this giant roller coaster in the middle, but he got us through all that. So, Jim, with that, and this will be the first of many -- not the first, but the first of many farewells between now and November 1. But congratulations to you.  And these statistics you can hold up with anybody, anywhere in the industry, any time."

Today, at the midpoint, it went up about $2 billion. The midpoint of our guidance is $40 billion. I think we provide a range around that because there are uncertainties in terms of what's going forward. And not everything in the year is positive. I mean, there are some parts of the business that – Engines, for example, we see as being flat this year, not a big increase, at least at the midpoint. I think if you were to look at new machine production and look at the percentages around that, that would look better than the total overall. I think you would find dealer sales, the users are up more than what total sales are, again, partly because engines are flat and the service-related businesses that were in the high 40s in terms of a percent of our total sales and revenues are much more stable than the Machine and Engine business. So the bottom line to that is I think you're just looking at new machine sales, percentage-wise, that's where more of the increase is, new machine sales."

If you think back to last year, we had really high Engine margins in the first quarter, relatively weak Machine margins. And if you look at the sales change quarter-over-quarter, Machines held up pretty well. Most of the decline was in Engines. So in the first quarter, a bigger decline in higher-margin Engine business than Machines. Then if you get within Machines and within Engines, you'd see even more of it. We were producing large engines, turbines, mining products out of the backlog to a higher degree, let's say, in the first quarter of a year ago. So we had a pretty good Engine mix, we had a pretty good Machine mix. And Engines were relatively stronger than Machines. And all of that kind of turned around here in the first quarter. So those are the negatives. The positives, there were some positives -- on balance, it was negative for the quarter. There were a few positives, though. We talked a little bit ago about aftermarket.  That has seen good improvement, and that helped to offset some of the declines. As you look out through the full year, partly because of the inventory declines, the dealer inventory declines last year, we're going to have probably quite a rebound from much of the smaller products, because it has more of an impact from the dealer inventory changes. So our small BCP product production and sales on that is just going to be up substantially this year, and a lot of that is from dealer inventory impacts. So I think as we progress through the year and the Machine sales are up, we'll continue to see this negative mix throughout the year.

I'm just curious, what is management's view of a comfortable level for the dealer inventory?

And it's now hard to handicap it, but what is the thought, either be you, Mike or Doug or Jim  on –  in '11, would it be logical that you're going to get half of the $3.3 billion back?

But we've got a view that between rentals, between dealer inventory and between our finished goods inventory in Lane 1, that entire -- the aggregate of that mix is what we're aiming for to improve on any prior cycle we've had. So it's a bit – even if we wanted to comment about 2011, which we don't, we would not be in a position just yet to talk about the full impact of the Lane Strategy. But I think it's coming.

But mining is, from a Machine standpoint, is definitely looking best. I think from Marine, things are looking up right now in oil and gas.  We talked about Solar a little bit ago, and Doug touched on the shale gas. Electric power is looking a little bit better. Marine still weak, and the MaK business is probably likely to decline.  So Marine is probably a weaker one. Actually, in the first quarter, we had good sales from industrial. That piece of it, I think, turns a little quicker. So that's looking more positive.

Depending on what the strength of the economy – when all of us in the industry announced 2011 strategies, I would expect some pressure from customers on some pre-buy. But, again, it's going to be spotty and dependent. You've got to remember, Tier 4 and IIIB only applies to really Western Europe, Japan and America, and then it's a phase-in. The rest of the world has nothing to do with Tier 4 at the moment, which should be 2/3 of the business, if not, a little more. But I would expect in some models, in some zones, geographically, we would see some heightened order activity midyear, third quarter, after they see how we're all going to come at this for 2011. As it rolls on out through '12 and '13, as more and more of the horsepower ratings and ranges come in,.  And depending on what happens with the January 11 early model adapters, you could see some of that. And I think we would expect something around that.

I think basically, with the Lane Strategy, you always have to look at this in pieces. It's not as simple as just what are lead times, because it really depends upon what channel they come out of. With Lane 1, for example, our target is about a 10-day lead time. And except for a couple of products that are coming out of Japan, and we actually underestimated demand -- except for those couple of products, generally speaking, that's about where we're at. So delivery time for roughly 24% of Machine sales that came out of Lane in March, lead times are very, very short. Now, for products that the dealers place on the factory and don't get out of Lane 1 we've moved, in terms of quoted delivery times, from sort of 11 to 12 weeks to around 15 weeks. So it has moved out. And I think that's really a function of, again, being in an inflection point, where we are in process of moving production up to a higher level. I would point out, though, as a part of that, we are giving preferential treatment to dealer orders that have a customer attached. So if there's a customer involved, those orders generally get shipped three or four weeks earlier than an inventory order if a dealer's ordering to add to his inventory. So I think in the scheme of things, delivery times are going out, but really aren't too bad."

Three to six months ago, most of you, all of our dealers, many of our customers were very pessimistic about the global economy. And I don't think they saw the V-shaped recovery, particularly in a lot of commodity sectors and emerging markets that was unfolding even at that time. So we've had a very sharp bounce back in enthusiasm here. And, quite frankly, our economics group was well ahead of most marketing groups, as well as even customers in forecasting the upturn and the strength of commodity markets. So as early as October last year, we've been out working with suppliers, not only our direct suppliers but our second tier suppliers, and helping them understand this inventory cycle and how it's going to impact their sales. I think we're more ahead of it, if you will, certainly, than we were coming into the '04 cycle. And our ability to ramp up now is really a function of how fast we can bring this supply chain along. Our ability -- we're kind of capacitized for $35 billion or so in top line sales and revenue. But we've got to bring our supply base up to get to that kind of level, and that's going to take some time. And we're working that issue very hard. Again, we had a roadshow in October, helping to get them prepared for this eventuality. We weren't certain it would happen, but we thought there was a high probability. So I think we're out in front of this to a reasonable extent, compared to where we were back in '04."

Secondly, of course, the greatest honor for me has been for me to play quarterback for what I think is one of the finer companies in the global stage, great people the world over. And in terms of accomplishments, the people side of the equation, what we've done on the safety and engagement side, I think bodes very well for the future of our company. It's just indicative of the kind of very positive changes that we've made on a continuous and steady basis. We're very much focused on managing through the cycle. I think we were challenged, certainly, to get [indiscernible] closer than we would have liked with explosive growth from '03 through '08. I think we demonstrated a lot of capability – maybe surprising some of you – on our ability to manage a very troublesome and horrific recession in '09. I think it was one of our finest hours. We showed a lot of nimbleness in taking costs out in a hurry, and did achieve what we considered the hat trick of sustaining profitability, sustaining our credit rating and our dividend. And I think we continued to invest in key capacity bottlenecks and in research and engineering that bode very well for our future. We're very much focused on delivering results for long-term shareholders. And sometimes I know that doesn't square with the image of CEOs that are focused on just quarterly pennies. But we're very much focused on the long-term shareholder. I think we have our company exceptionally well positioned for growth on a global scale. I can't tell you – I was honored with Doug's opening comments, but I think the transition that we've planned has been well laid out. It's going exceptionally well. I'm confident you're going to hear a strategy rolled out in August which shows you exactly how the team's going to take our company to another level going forward for the next 5 to 10 years. So, again, it's been an exciting time. I again appreciate all the work and rapport we've had. And good luck on these forecasts for the coming year."

Okay, earlier this morning, we reported results for the first quarter and we updated our outlook for the full year of 2010. And to start this morning, I'll quickly summarize the quarter and updated outlook. Then we'll take your questions.
Okay, let's start with the quarter and what a difference a year makes. In the first quarter last year, we were seeing rapidly declining demand, order cancellations, turmoil in credit markets and declining economies across much of the world. At Caterpillar, we were busy cutting production, costs, employment and working capital. Our major focus was on three goals, maintaining profitability, holding the dividend and maintaining our mid-A credit rating, and we were successful at all three.
This year's first quarter saw a very different picture. Capital markets are in much better shape than last year. Demand for our products is rising, and we're seeing it in most geographic regions, although it's much more robust in the developing countries of Asia, Latin America, Africa/Middle East and the CIS.
We're also seeing a significant pickup in mining globally. In fact, we've already filled our available 2010 production slots for some of our large truck models and are taking orders for 2011. Demand for aftermarket service parts in our Machinery and Engine businesses is very strong and gained steam as we moved through the quarter. And this is usually a good indicator of how much work is getting done in the field, and the strength we've seen is encouraging.
We're working with our suppliers and within our own factories to ramp up production and, in some cases, to accelerate planned capacity additions. In terms of employment, what we are able to absorb, a portion of the production improvement with the existing workforce by winding down the rolling plant shutdowns that we used last year to manage production declines. However, we're also selectively adding to employment to support increasing demand. We're seeing employment increases in our factories in Asia, in Latin America, where the demand improvement is the strongest, and also in key U.S. facilities that are seeing strong export demand. And then employees in those factories certainly understand the importance of free trade.
I think the contrast between last year and this year can be summed up by saying, last year, we were rapidly ramping down and faced a very negative economic climate. This year, we're rapidly ramping up and are seeing much better prospects for the world economy.
Sales and revenues in the first quarter were $8.2 billion, and that was down about $1 billion from the first quarter of last year. Now given my positive comments about the economic environment, you may be asking why our sales and revenues were lower than the first quarter last year when demand is improving and we're ramping up production. Well, there are two main reasons. First, we ended 2008 with a strong order book for mining products and large engines. And while we saw cancellations and very few new orders, we did continue to produce and ship mining products, large engines and turbines at relatively good levels throughout the first quarter of 2009. The second reason is that it does take some time to ramp up and not just in our factories. Our suppliers are seeing, in many cases, dramatically higher demand from us. We've increased production schedules throughout the quarter, and March was our best month for sales and revenues since the end of 2008.
One other point about sales, and that is throughout 2009, we talked a lot about the impact of fewer inventory changes and the very negative impact that had on our full year 2009 sales as dealers shut inventory. This year, we're expecting relatively flat dealer inventory, and for the most part, that's what happened in the first quarter. Overall, dealers held new Machine inventories about flat, but took Engine inventories down about $200 million.
While the midpoint of our outlook reflects relatively flat dealer inventories in 2010, in some regions inventories are becoming lean. And the higher we are this year in our outlook range, the more likely it is that, collectively, dealers may add some to their inventories later in the year.
Okay, let's turn to the first quarter profit. Profit in the quarter was $0.36 a share, and during the quarter we recorded a $90 million after-tax charge related to Medicare subsidy tax changes in the recently signed U.S. healthcare legislation. Excluding that charge, profit was $0.50 a share. That compares with the first quarter of 2009 when we had a loss of $0.19 a share, including redundancy costs of $558 million. Excluding the impact of redundancy, we earned a profit of $0.39 a share in the first quarter last year. Now again, that's $0.50 a share in the first quarter this year, excluding the Medicare charge, and $0.39 a share in the first quarter last year, excluding redundancy.
Okay, just a few key points about the quarter.  Profit was higher despite lower sales volume and a negative product mix. Manufacturing costs were favorable, $566 million. And included in that, labor and overhead costs, warranty and material costs were all favorable. SG&A and R&D costs were close to being neutral, despite added costs for incentive compensation and pension expense.
Our Machinery line of business was profitable for the first time since the third quarter of 2008, and engine operating profit, as a percent of sales, improved sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2009. Cash flow was a positive and our Machinery and Engines debt-to-capital ratio improved from year-end 2009.
All in all, it was a good quarter. Demand and order rates have picked up. We're ramping up production. Efficiency is improving. Costs were down and the balance sheet continues to improve.
Okay. That was a quick look at the quarter. Now let's turn to the outlook. This morning, we raised guidance for sales and revenues and for profit. Our original outlook reflected sales and revenues up 10% to 25% from 2009. And in dollars, that was a range of $35.6  billion to $40.5 billion, with the midpoint of about $38 billion. The revised outlook we've provided this morning has a top line range of $38 billion to $42 billion with the midpoint at $40 billion. In terms of profit, the original outlook expected $2.50 a share at the midpoint of the sales and revenues range. And our revised outlook this morning reflects a range of $2.50 to $3.25 per share, with the midpoint of $2.88. And a point of clarification, that outlook does include the negative impact of the first quarter tax charge related to the U.S. healthcare legislation. In other words, our profit expectation for the year would have been higher if the bill had not been enacted.
Now there are four main reasons for the improvement in our outlook this morning. First, while our original outlook for 2010 did expect growth in developing countries, it's now looking even stronger. Engine sales, particularly for gas turbines, are looking better than we expected. Sales of aftermarket parts, which are integral to and included in our Machinery and Engine businesses are growing faster than expected. And, finally, mining is increasing more than in our original outlook.
Now in terms of costs in the outlook, in general, what we said in our original outlook looks to be about on track, and some key elements include: Favorable material costs for the full year; favorable manufacturing, labor and overhead costs driven by improving factory efficiency; SG&A costs should be up slightly, excluding short-term incentive pay. And as we said in our original outlook, we do expect higher R&D expense. And as a reminder, pension costs are up as well and included in manufacturing, SG&A and the R&D lines.
Also, one other point with profit improving, we do expect increased short-term incentive pay. And that's linked to improving financial results and is, as a result, highly aligned with shareholder interest. Okay, that's the outlook.
In summary, the first quarter was a very good start for the year. We're seeing positive increases in demand, our machine production is increasing and we raised the outlook for 2010. Just one more comment before we move on to the Q&A section, and that is we're going to hold our annual analyst meeting this year in New York City on August 19 in the afternoon. So mark your calendars. We'll provide you more details on that over the next couple of weeks.  And with that, we're ready to take your questions."

This is Doug Oberhelman speaking. As you all know, I'll become CEO in about two months' time, and I thought given that this is Jim Owens' last quarterly call, I would mention a few key statistics of Jim's time in office here and what's happened during what will no doubt be one of the most interesting runs as CEO in our history where sales mushroomed and then sales tanked, and I'll get into that in just a little bit. Jim has done a-- we all think here, a wonderful job for our company, and let me tell you some of that. 
Jim became our CEO on February 1, 2004. That seems like many lifetimes ago, Jim, but it went fast and here we are in 2010 already.  That's six years and 24 quarters, for the record. 2003 earnings per share before Jim came in as CEO were $1.56 a share. And I know as I look back at some of these statistics, I had forgotten a lot of this history. Of course, we peaked at $5.66 a share in 2008, which was a record of any time in our history. 2003 sales were $23 billion, and I can remember so well a couple of studies we did at that time, wondering how we were going to ever break above $20 billion, where we had been stuck for six or seven years or so at that number. And sure enough, in 2008, we ballooned up to $51 billion and exceeded our – Jim's strategic goal of $50 billion by 2010. Unfortunately, in 2009, we cut that back by almost 40%. And now, as you can see from our outlook for 2010, we're back up to 40%. This is really – gets interesting. 
During this period of time, when Jim was our CEO and Chairman, our stock has risen almost 80%. Even with the ups and downs of 2009, a tremendously successful run as CEO and Chairman. When Jim took over, our quarterly dividend was $0.185, today it's $0.42, that's a 125% increase. And I will tell you that Jim was the main cheerleader, main arm twister of our board and main driver of maintaining that dividend last year when everybody else was looking to cut around our industry and so many other companies. 
He was forthright in his determination that we were going to make it through it, we were going to be profitable in '09, which we were. Maintained our dividend and our cash flow, which we did, and it paid off very well for shareholders. Employment's up about 25,000 during this period of time. It certainly was up more than that. But in the end, we're still up over where he started. And I think what he'll really be remembered for, and all of you on the – as shareholders and that sell side, probably don't know a lot of this, but the internal things we've changed on Vision 2020, which was his strategy plan that we are working on revising now again. It brought us the growth in China and emerging markets. It brought us the Cat Production System. It brought us improvements in quality we're seeing. It brought us efficiencies in our factories. Set us up for the next few years, which we'll really see these things pay off. And we're all pretty excited about that. We've set us up for the Tier 4, Stage IIIB in Europe, emissions regulations, brought us the acquisition of Progress Rail, which has turned out to be a real winner and one we're extremely happy of. And I know Jim is very proud of his attendance and membership in the Economic Advisory Council under President Obama. 
Another final cap on this, market cap when Jim took over was about $27 billion. Today, I notice it's right at $45 billion. And just a great run with this giant roller coaster in the middle, but he got us through all that. So, Jim, with that, and this will be the first of many -- not the first, but the first of many farewells between now and November 1. But congratulations to you.  And these statistics you can hold up with anybody, anywhere in the industry, any time."

So that  if sales were $36.3 billion this year for you, they would be flat at the dealer level. Now, your low end of your sales guidance is really only a couple of billion – less than $2 billion above that, $36.3 billion. So that's really only about 5% increase at the low end.  If the dealer inventories are flat this year, dealers should be up 5% at the low end of your sales range. That doesn't seem like a lot, considering what's going on in Asia as you mentioned. So can you sort of elaborate as to why you've got such a low sales increase at the dealer level, at the low end of the range?"

Today, at the midpoint, it went up about $2 billion. The midpoint of our guidance is $40 billion. I think we provide a range around that because there are uncertainties in terms of what's going forward. And not everything in the year is positive. I mean, there are some parts of the business that – Engines, for example, we see as being flat this year, not a big increase, at least at the midpoint. I think if you were to look at new machine production and look at the percentages around that, that would look better than the total overall. I think you would find dealer sales, the users are up more than what total sales are, again, partly because engines are flat and the service-related businesses that were in the high 40s in terms of a percent of our total sales and revenues are much more stable than the Machine and Engine business. So the bottom line to that is I think you're just looking at new machine sales, percentage-wise, that's where more of the increase is, new machine sales."

They did, and that really helped out the year in 2010. And then, secondly, the phenomena around shale gas in the U.S., which is growing everywhere, and you can read about that constantly. But that's driving lots of the new investment in drilling, and that's full compression, of course, into the mainline gas lines in the United States. So those two things have been a – one, in the case of Latin America, a very positive outcome we did not know about at that time. And shale gas has held up a lot more briskly than we thought.

If you think back to last year, we had really high Engine margins in the first quarter, relatively weak Machine margins. And if you look at the sales change quarter-over-quarter, Machines held up pretty well. Most of the decline was in Engines. So in the first quarter, a bigger decline in higher-margin Engine business than Machines. Then if you get within Machines and within Engines, you'd see even more of it. We were producing large engines, turbines, mining products out of the backlog to a higher degree, let's say, in the first quarter of a year ago. So we had a pretty good Engine mix, we had a pretty good Machine mix. And Engines were relatively stronger than Machines. And all of that kind of turned around here in the first quarter. So those are the negatives. The positives, there were some positives -- on balance, it was negative for the quarter. There were a few positives, though. We talked a little bit ago about aftermarket.  That has seen good improvement, and that helped to offset some of the declines. As you look out through the full year, partly because of the inventory declines, the dealer inventory declines last year, we're going to have probably quite a rebound from much of the smaller products, because it has more of an impact from the dealer inventory changes. So our small BCP product production and sales on that is just going to be up substantially this year, and a lot of that is from dealer inventory impacts. So I think as we progress through the year and the Machine sales are up, we'll continue to see this negative mix throughout the year. And it's a -- we didn't quantify it in the release separately, but it's fairly significant."

I think basically, with the Lane Strategy, you always have to look at this in pieces. It's not as simple as just what are lead times, because it really depends upon what channel they come out of. With Lane 1, for example, our target is about a 10-day lead time. And except for a couple of products that are coming out of Japan, and we actually underestimated demand -- except for those couple of products, generally speaking, that's about where we're at. So delivery time for roughly 24% of Machine sales that came out of Lane in March, lead times are very, very short. Now, for products that the dealers place on the factory and don't get out of Lane 1 we've moved, in terms of quoted delivery times, from sort of 11 to 12 weeks to around 15 weeks. So it has moved out. And I think that's really a function of, again, being in an inflection point, where we are in process of moving production up to a higher level. I would point out, though, as a part of that, we are giving preferential treatment to dealer orders that have a customer attached. So if there's a customer involved, those orders generally get shipped three or four weeks earlier than an inventory order if a dealer's ordering to add to his inventory. So I think in the scheme of things, delivery times are going out, but really aren't too bad."

Three to six months ago, most of you, all of our dealers, many of our customers were very pessimistic about the global economy. And I don't think they saw the V-shaped recovery, particularly in a lot of commodity sectors and emerging markets that was unfolding even at that time. So we've had a very sharp bounce back in enthusiasm here. And, quite frankly, our economics group was well ahead of most marketing groups, as well as even customers in forecasting the upturn and the strength of commodity markets. So as early as October last year, we've been out working with suppliers, not only our direct suppliers but our second tier suppliers, and helping them understand this inventory cycle and how it's going to impact their sales. I think we're more ahead of it, if you will, certainly, than we were coming into the '04 cycle. And our ability to ramp up now is really a function of how fast we can bring this supply chain along. Our ability -- we're kind of capacitized for $35 billion or so in top line sales and revenue. But we've got to bring our supply base up to get to that kind of level, and that's going to take some time. And we're working that issue very hard. Again, we had a roadshow in October, helping to get them prepared for this eventuality. We weren't certain it would happen, but we thought there was a high probability. So I think we're out in front of this to a reasonable extent, compared to where we were back in '04."

If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investor section of our cat.com website, and it'll be labeled in the section, Results Webcast.
In addition, we'll be discussing forward-looking information today that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A - Risk Factors of our Form 10-K for the year ended 2009 and Part 2 of our first quarter 2010 Form 10-Q, and also in the forward-looking statements language contained in today's release.
Okay, earlier this morning, we reported results for the second quarter, and we increased our outlook for the full year of 2010. And to start this morning, I'll summarize the quarter and the new outlook, and then Doug and Ed and I will take your questions. So let's start with the second quarter top line.  
Sales and revenues were $10,409,000,000, and that's up from $7,975,000,000 in the second quarter of 2009. And that's an increase of about $2.4 billion or 31%. The increase in the top line was primarily driven by the absence of 2009's dealer inventory reductions, coupled with improvement in end-user demand. And in terms of dealer inventory, our dealers cut their new machine inventories by about $1.2 billion during the second quarter of 2009, and as a result, Caterpillar essentially undersold end-user demand in last year's second quarter.
During the second quarter of 2010 this year, dealers held inventory about flat, meaning that our machine sales were about in line with end-user demand. We frequently hear comments and get questions about dealer restocking, and to be clear, overall, dealers have collectively not increased machine inventories yet. They've just stopped reducing them. 
In fact, that comment goes for the first half of 2010, not just the second quarter. Inventories have remained relatively flat all year long. Dealer inventories in terms of months of supply are below historic averages. That's a good thing, and it's in keeping with our Lane Strategy that includes Caterpillar holding finished inventory in regional distribution centers to serve our dealers and customers. That said, inventories are getting tight in some parts of the world. And the higher sales are in our outlook range, the more likely it is that dealers will want to add some inventory.  Okay, that's the situation with dealer inventory. 
The second major reason for the sales increase in the second quarter was better end-user demand. Demand has picked up substantially from the very depressed levels of last year. And that's because most of the world economies are in recovery after last year's severe economic decline. 
World growth is being led by the developing countries of Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. And we're seeing continuing strong growth in our businesses in the developing world. That economic growth is also driving demand for commodities like iron ore, copper, coal and oil. And that's helping our mining and energy-related businesses around the world.
The developed countries of the world, like the United States, in Europe and Japan, are also growing but more slowly. And while economic growth in developed countries has helped, we still have a very long way to go. Sales in North America and Europe, while better than the very low levels of 2009, are still depressed.
So the 31% increase in our top line was primarily due to the absence of last year's dealer inventory decline and improving end-user demand. Just one more point about the sales increase, the vast majority was related to Machinery. Compared with the second quarter of 2009, Machinery sales were up 55%, while Engines sales were up 3%.
Now let's turn to profit. Profit in the quarter was $707 million, a 91% increase from $371 million in the second quarter of 2009. Profit per share was $1.09, up $0.49 from $0.60 in the same quarter of 2009. Consolidating operating profit as a percent of sales was 9.4%, and that's up from 4.4% in the second quarter of last year. In Machinery and Engines, gross margin continued to improve and was 24.2% in the quarter. 
Higher sales volume was a significant positive factor driving the improvement in profit. That said, that positive impact was mitigated somewhat by a very negative sales mix. Our mix of sales in the second quarter as compared with the second quarter a year ago was negative because Machinery sales, remember I have 55% up, increased to the much faster pace than Engines sales, which were up 3%. And that's a negative because Machinery margins are lower than Engine margins.
In addition, the production in sale of smaller, lower-margin machines increased faster than large machines. And that's primarily because smaller machines were more depressed than large machines by the impact of the dealer inventory reductions in 2009. And also, the mix of engines that we sold was also somewhat negative. So that's volume. A major positive but mitigated somewhat by a negative sales mix.
In addition to higher sales volume, price realization also improved and was favorable to profit $187 million. Manufacturing costs were also favorable by $316 million. And if you exclude the LIFO inventory decrement benefit that we realized in the second quarter of 2009, the cost improvement was more. It was $426 million. And that was a result of better labor and overhead efficiency, lower warranty costs and favorable material costs.
Another positive in the quarter was the absence of $85 million of employee redundancy costs from the second quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting these positive items were higher income taxes. As a percent of profit before tax, rates went up in the second quarter of 2009, and that's primarily due to the geographic mix of where profits were earned. 
SG&A and R&D costs were also higher, and that was due to provisions for employee incentive compensation and some increase in R&D spending related to Tier 4 emissions. Overall, currency impacts were also negative. The impact of currency was $77 million unfavorable to operating profit, and currency impacts were the principal reason that the other income line, which is below operating profit, declined from the second quarter of 2009.
Before I move on to the full year outlook, I'd like to cover two items, employee incentive compensation and income taxes, in just a little more depth. As you may be aware, a portion of the compensation for our support and management and some production employees is variable and based on the financial performance of the company, and financial performance in 2010 has continued to improve. And based on the new outlook for 2010, we expect incentive compensation of about $600 million for the year. We provided about $90 million in the first quarter, and that was based on the full year outlook at that time. And we provided $210 million in the second quarter of 2010, and that was based on the new outlook that we released this morning.  
That means through the first half of the year, we provided for half of the full year estimate of about $600 million. So the provision in the second quarter at $210 million was $120 million higher than the provision from the first quarter. And again, that was based on the improvement in the full year outlook. 
The second thing I wanted to add color on was the provision for income taxes. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, taxes and the tax rate were unfavorable compared with the second quarter of 2009, so year-over-year unfavorable. However, our previous outlook for 2010 expected a 30% tax rate excluding the Medicare-related adjustment in the first quarter. Taxes in the second quarter were below that 30% estimate. We had favorable discrete tax adjustments in the quarter, and we lowered our estimated annual tax rate for 2010 from 30% to 29%.  As a result, taxes in the second quarter were favorable versus the 30% rate from the previous outlook. 
I hope you follow that discussion on incentive compensation and taxes. I know it's a bit complicated. But the punch line is incentive compensation expense in the quarter was probably higher than you might have thought because of the increase in our outlook, but taxes were probably more favorable than you expected.
In addition to profit, we've been very focused on cash flow this year. Through the first half of the year, our Machinery and Engines operating cash flow improved substantially from about $600 million during the first half of 2009 to about $2.4 billion to the first half of 2010. Our Machinery and Engines debt-to-capital ratio improved as well, and at the end of June 2010, it stood at 41.9%. And that's an improvement from 53.1% at the end of June 2009, and an improvement from 45.2% just three months ago at the end of the first quarter.
Okay, let's move on to the outlook. This morning, we raised guidance for sales and revenue and profit. Our previous outlook range for 2010 sales and revenues was $38 billion to $42 billion, and that was a midpoint of about $40 billion . The outlook we provided this morning is a range of $39 billion to $42 billion with a midpoint of $40.5 million. And in that, it's probably worth noting that the U.S. dollar has strengthened since the end of the first quarter, and that's had a negative impact on our sales forecast, as sales and other currencies translate into fewer dollars.
The full year impact on sales compared with the previous outlook is negative, about $500 million. So what that means is the underlying in volume improvement in the sales and revenues outlook is a little better than the headline numbers we'd indicate. 
We also raised our profit outlook this morning. We're expecting profit per share in the range of $3.15 to $3.85 with a midpoint of $3.50 a share. That's up from the previous outlook range, which was $2.50 to $3.25 a share with a $2.88 midpoint. Okay, that's the outlook.
In summary, the second quarter reflected continuing improvement. Dealer sales to end users continue to strengthen. And thanks to our suppliers and a lot of hard work in our factories, we were able to raise production significantly in the second quarter and do it with reasonable efficiency. Sales and profit were up. We raised the outlook for the year. 
And with that, we're ready to take your questions."

I think in general, we're moving along pretty well with Lane Strategy. At the end of the quarter, we had about 25% coming out of Lane 1. I think it's probably fair to say that our fill rate out of Lane 1 is not where we would like it to be. It's a little bit below that, although we've been working on it pretty hard. Sales to end users, end-user demand has just continued to be good. And in some parts of the world, it's outpaced to what we thought, and it's made it a little tough to get the fill rates out of Lane 1, maybe as high as we would like. I think overall, dealer inventories, right now, they've come down a lot. They're below the historical averages, as you said. It's not in our plan to take them down from here, but on kind of the increases in volume that we've seen for this year, the plan is actually to hold them kind of steady where they are right now."

So it's a bit of a mixed answer."

Mike, I know that you indicated that there is about an incremental $500 million of production that doesn't really show up in the increase to the midpoint of a revenue range. But clearly, it would seem that there are some other puts and takes there beyond just the increase in the revenue numbers. So can you talk about some of the other puts and takes there? Particularly, I'm interested in, has there been a change in point of view around how mix could impact the balance of the year, and then, in terms of changing point of view around some of the cost saving efforts, Lane Strategy, et cetera?"

So that helped a little bit. But most of the improvement was really three things with a partial offset. Sales volume was up, and again, the volume number is better than the outlook would appear because of the translation on the sales. So that was a positive. It might have been a subtlety in the language, but on price realization, we've moved the estimate from about 1% to above 1%. So price realization for the full year looks to be a little bit better than the prior forecast. And our manufacturing costs are better. We improved. Our efficiency levels look better, and we've reflected that in the forecast as well. The one thing that's an offset to all those improvements was incentive compensation. We increased the full year estimate from about $350 million to about $600 million, so that had a mitigating impact."

Then, if you look at lead times for the rest of the product, I'd say in general, lead times, just a generalization, have moved out. But again it's a little bit of a mixed bag story. If you are a dealer, and the product that you order from us is for your inventory, lead times are going out further. If it's for our customer, it gives priority. So again, as a generalization, I would say, as a result of pretty strong demand, lead times are going out a bit.

Remember, when you're looking at quarter-over-quarter, we had $110 million of LIFO decrement benefits a year ago, which, in the quarter, is kind of non-operational per se. And then with that incentive comp catch up, the increase of $120 million, effectively half of that is putting the first quarter on the same rate as the full year outlook. So you had $90 million in the first quarter, $210 million in the second quarter and then based on the outlook, it would be $150 million in each of the next two. So the second quarter got a little extra hit from incentive comp just above and beyond the impact of the outlook because we had to catch up to one and with LIFO decrement benefits from last year. And as I said earlier, sales mix was fairly negative. I mean, we had a very significant ramp up in small machines. So I think the underlying kind of rates is probably better than the headline number suggests. Manufacturing efficiency continued along at a very good pace. Price realization was decent, I think, considering the environment. And so yes, I think overall, we were pleased. I think the rest of the year, particularly when you look year-over-year, is going to be constrained a bit by incentive comp, and it's going to be constrained by the sales mix. I mean, last year, it was a really tough year. We set pretty tough targets. We didn't have any incentive comps last year, so everything this year is incremental. So I think between that and the sales mix, it'll keep the number probably lower than a lot of people would like. But I think the underlying performance on costs, sort of the blocking and tackling in the factories, is going pretty well."

The facilities where that's implemented, institutionalized and working so well and really pushed by our leadership, the benefits are obvious. And virtually every month in 2010 as schedules have been more ordinary than they were in '09, which, as you know, were chaos, we've seen continued benefits.

So I think as we work that through the system here this year and if retail demand continues to grow relatively modestly as it has, our availability in Lane Strategy ought to work just perfectly. We're just in this kind of middle of the year where we've had to digest all of this as supply chain ramp up from, really, from a dead stop in the last part of '09.

In other words, they like it. We got 14 of the five distribution centers up and running. We're going to continue to expand that. The other key thing is if you look at the first half of the year, we had no growth in dealer inventory, which means through Lane, we're actually able to feed product directly to end-user demand, whereas in the old days of a run up, you would have seen dealer inventory build, and we would have the wrong product in the wrong place.

Essentially, what happened there is we had continuing cost reduction, which was a positive. We had a little bit of price. That was essentially offset by incentive compensation. And so on balance, price and costs overall were fairly neutral. But sales mix was negative for engines quarter-over-quarter. What we had a year ago is sort of continuing strong sales of the big engines, out of the little bit longer of a backlog. They didn't really fall off significantly until the second half of the year.

I think versus the first quarter of this year, operating margins for engines were up, and sequentially, we had a volume increase. And that was, I think, a principal driver of the improvement in both operating profit. And we had incremental margins on engines between the two quarters that were certainly higher than the operating profit level, so that's what helped. Volume, really first to second, was a positive, and that helped. Quarter-over-quarter, though, mix was negative."

I am just really happy with both at this stage. The turnaround we're starting to see in the machine operating profit and engine operating profit, particularly if you adjust for the incentive pay and the items Mike talked about redundancy and so on, at this stage are gratifying. We did not see, as you well know, that the big tail off in engines, it's come back nicely as we just showed you and that is with a really weak Marine segment. I just returned from Europe last night and visited with a lot of the dealers and customers across the board, including the engine people, and the Marine business in Europe, which is a big piece of it, of course, is really weak. It's vastly overbuilt the last few years in terms of new ships, almost across the board in both segments anyway. And we're going to be seeing that for a while I think. But if you look at the smaller engines, our Smaller Machine businesses and look at those operating profit at this point in time, I'm pretty happy with that. But you have to adjust outlook beyond, as Mike has talked about, where we were. And I think we're coming along, and I really feel good about that.

First and foremost, it is growth of the company where we can find those growth pieces that add to our business. And certainly, Electro-Motive Diesel was a good one. I'm very happy about that. That's going to put us in a big way in the rail market that we're already in around the world, and I'm thrilled to be able to do that. We talked about Mining shovels. You know we were interested and have been interested in Mining shovels off and on over the years. We've decided that given the industry aspects over the last six months, it's time to go again. We announced that along with a fairly sizable Mining truck increase in both India and the U.S. That should help us well as that market continues to grow. We've quadrupled our excavator production in China and made that announcement in the last few weeks. And I think that really with the state of the industry, as well positioned as we are around the world today, it's time to be looking at growth in a different way because valuations are different than they've ever been in a long time. There are aspects of geographies that are growing like they never have. And as we talked about in our strategy announcement, we'll talk in great detail with all of you next month, we intend to be a leader in every way everywhere in the world. And that means China and India and elsewhere and a leader in a very profitable way as we also have talked about. So I would say that the use of cash priority number one being the growth of business has not changed, and we may have more opportunities based on one, just the playing field that's out there today; and two, some valuations. So we're looking in every corner and all of our businesses are concentrated on that today where we can do that. Secondly, your pension plans. Thirdly, our capital. And then finally, dividends and share buybacks, which has been our priority for a longtime. Strength of the balance sheet is improving. Mike talked about the debt-to-capital ratio. We have a hard and fast, I'm going to say, rule, certainly, it's a goal, but it's going to be a rule to maintain that mid-A credit rating with the agencies. We think we're pretty close to that today. I don't know. I don't have any intention of changing it that much, but we certainly intend to stay mid-A for as long as we can, and even in the downturn last year, we did pretty well with that. And as cash generation comes back, we'd intend to stay in that range. I think I got all your questions, Steve."

If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investor section of our cat.com website, and it'll be labeled in the section, Results Webcast.
In addition, we'll be discussing forward-looking information today that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A - Risk Factors of our Form 10-K for the year ended 2009 and Part 2 of our first quarter 2010 Form 10-Q, and also in the forward-looking statements language contained in today's release.
Okay, earlier this morning, we reported results for the second quarter, and we increased our outlook for the full year of 2010. And to start this morning, I'll summarize the quarter and the new outlook, and then Doug and Ed and I will take your questions. So let's start with the second quarter top line.  
Sales and revenues were $10,409,000,000, and that's up from $7,975,000,000 in the second quarter of 2009. And that's an increase of about $2.4 billion or 31%. The increase in the top line was primarily driven by the absence of 2009's dealer inventory reductions, coupled with improvement in end-user demand. And in terms of dealer inventory, our dealers cut their new machine inventories by about $1.2 billion during the second quarter of 2009, and as a result, Caterpillar essentially undersold end-user demand in last year's second quarter.
During the second quarter of 2010 this year, dealers held inventory about flat, meaning that our machine sales were about in line with end-user demand. We frequently hear comments and get questions about dealer restocking, and to be clear, overall, dealers have collectively not increased machine inventories yet. They've just stopped reducing them. 
In fact, that comment goes for the first half of 2010, not just the second quarter. Inventories have remained relatively flat all year long. Dealer inventories in terms of months of supply are below historic averages. That's a good thing, and it's in keeping with our Lane Strategy that includes Caterpillar holding finished inventory in regional distribution centers to serve our dealers and customers. That said, inventories are getting tight in some parts of the world. And the higher sales are in our outlook range, the more likely it is that dealers will want to add some inventory.  Okay, that's the situation with dealer inventory. 
The second major reason for the sales increase in the second quarter was better end-user demand. Demand has picked up substantially from the very depressed levels of last year. And that's because most of the world economies are in recovery after last year's severe economic decline. 
World growth is being led by the developing countries of Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. And we're seeing continuing strong growth in our businesses in the developing world. That economic growth is also driving demand for commodities like iron ore, copper, coal and oil. And that's helping our mining and energy-related businesses around the world.
The developed countries of the world, like the United States, in Europe and Japan, are also growing but more slowly. And while economic growth in developed countries has helped, we still have a very long way to go. Sales in North America and Europe, while better than the very low levels of 2009, are still depressed.
So the 31% increase in our top line was primarily due to the absence of last year's dealer inventory decline and improving end-user demand. Just one more point about the sales increase, the vast majority was related to Machinery. Compared with the second quarter of 2009, Machinery sales were up 55%, while Engines sales were up 3%.
Now let's turn to profit. Profit in the quarter was $707 million, a 91% increase from $371 million in the second quarter of 2009. Profit per share was $1.09, up $0.49 from $0.60 in the same quarter of 2009. Consolidating operating profit as a percent of sales was 9.4%, and that's up from 4.4% in the second quarter of last year. In Machinery and Engines, gross margin continued to improve and was 24.2% in the quarter. 
Higher sales volume was a significant positive factor driving the improvement in profit. That said, that positive impact was mitigated somewhat by a very negative sales mix. Our mix of sales in the second quarter as compared with the second quarter a year ago was negative because Machinery sales, remember I have 55% up, increased to the much faster pace than Engines sales, which were up 3%. And that's a negative because Machinery margins are lower than Engine margins.
In addition, the production in sale of smaller, lower-margin machines increased faster than large machines. And that's primarily because smaller machines were more depressed than large machines by the impact of the dealer inventory reductions in 2009. And also, the mix of engines that we sold was also somewhat negative. So that's volume. A major positive but mitigated somewhat by a negative sales mix.
In addition to higher sales volume, price realization also improved and was favorable to profit $187 million. Manufacturing costs were also favorable by $316 million. And if you exclude the LIFO inventory decrement benefit that we realized in the second quarter of 2009, the cost improvement was more. It was $426 million. And that was a result of better labor and overhead efficiency, lower warranty costs and favorable material costs.
Another positive in the quarter was the absence of $85 million of employee redundancy costs from the second quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting these positive items were higher income taxes. As a percent of profit before tax, rates went up in the second quarter of 2009, and that's primarily due to the geographic mix of where profits were earned. 
SG&A and R&D costs were also higher, and that was due to provisions for employee incentive compensation and some increase in R&D spending related to Tier 4 emissions. Overall, currency impacts were also negative. The impact of currency was $77 million unfavorable to operating profit, and currency impacts were the principal reason that the other income line, which is below operating profit, declined from the second quarter of 2009.
Before I move on to the full year outlook, I'd like to cover two items, employee incentive compensation and income taxes, in just a little more depth. As you may be aware, a portion of the compensation for our support and management and some production employees is variable and based on the financial performance of the company, and financial performance in 2010 has continued to improve. And based on the new outlook for 2010, we expect incentive compensation of about $600 million for the year. We provided about $90 million in the first quarter, and that was based on the full year outlook at that time. And we provided $210 million in the second quarter of 2010, and that was based on the new outlook that we released this morning.  
That means through the first half of the year, we provided for half of the full year estimate of about $600 million. So the provision in the second quarter at $210 million was $120 million higher than the provision from the first quarter. And again, that was based on the improvement in the full year outlook. 
The second thing I wanted to add color on was the provision for income taxes. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, taxes and the tax rate were unfavorable compared with the second quarter of 2009, so year-over-year unfavorable. However, our previous outlook for 2010 expected a 30% tax rate excluding the Medicare-related adjustment in the first quarter. Taxes in the second quarter were below that 30% estimate. We had favorable discrete tax adjustments in the quarter, and we lowered our estimated annual tax rate for 2010 from 30% to 29%.  As a result, taxes in the second quarter were favorable versus the 30% rate from the previous outlook. 
I hope you follow that discussion on incentive compensation and taxes. I know it's a bit complicated. But the punch line is incentive compensation expense in the quarter was probably higher than you might have thought because of the increase in our outlook, but taxes were probably more favorable than you expected.
In addition to profit, we've been very focused on cash flow this year. Through the first half of the year, our Machinery and Engines operating cash flow improved substantially from about $600 million during the first half of 2009 to about $2.4 billion to the first half of 2010. Our Machinery and Engines debt-to-capital ratio improved as well, and at the end of June 2010, it stood at 41.9%. And that's an improvement from 53.1% at the end of June 2009, and an improvement from 45.2% just three months ago at the end of the first quarter.
Okay, let's move on to the outlook. This morning, we raised guidance for sales and revenue and profit. Our previous outlook range for 2010 sales and revenues was $38 billion to $42 billion, and that was a midpoint of about $40 billion . The outlook we provided this morning is a range of $39 billion to $42 billion with a midpoint of $40.5 million. And in that, it's probably worth noting that the U.S. dollar has strengthened since the end of the first quarter, and that's had a negative impact on our sales forecast, as sales and other currencies translate into fewer dollars.
The full year impact on sales compared with the previous outlook is negative, about $500 million. So what that means is the underlying in volume improvement in the sales and revenues outlook is a little better than the headline numbers we'd indicate. 
We also raised our profit outlook this morning. We're expecting profit per share in the range of $3.15 to $3.85 with a midpoint of $3.50 a share. That's up from the previous outlook range, which was $2.50 to $3.25 a share with a $2.88 midpoint. Okay, that's the outlook.
In summary, the second quarter reflected continuing improvement. Dealer sales to end users continue to strengthen. And thanks to our suppliers and a lot of hard work in our factories, we were able to raise production significantly in the second quarter and do it with reasonable efficiency. Sales and profit were up. We raised the outlook for the year. 
And with that, we're ready to take your questions.

I think in general, we're moving along pretty well with Lane Strategy. At the end of the quarter, we had about 25% coming out of Lane 1. I think it's probably fair to say that our fill rate out of Lane 1 is not where we would like it to be. It's a little bit below that, although we've been working on it pretty hard. Sales to end users, end-user demand has just continued to be good. And in some parts of the world, it's outpaced to what we thought, and it's made it a little tough to get the fill rates out of Lane 1, maybe as high as we would like. I think overall, dealer inventories, right now, they've come down a lot. They're below the historical averages, as you said. It's not in our plan to take them down from here, but on kind of the increases in volume that we've seen for this year, the plan is actually to hold them kind of steady where they are right now.

So it's a bit of a mixed answer.

Mike, I know that you indicated that there is about an incremental $500 million of production that doesn't really show up in the increase to the midpoint of a revenue range. But clearly, it would seem that there are some other puts and takes there beyond just the increase in the revenue numbers. So can you talk about some of the other puts and takes there? Particularly, I'm interested in, has there been a change in point of view around how mix could impact the balance of the year, and then, in terms of changing point of view around some of the cost saving efforts, Lane Strategy, et cetera?

So that helped a little bit. But most of the improvement was really three things with a partial offset. Sales volume was up, and again, the volume number is better than the outlook would appear because of the translation on the sales. So that was a positive. It might have been a subtlety in the language, but on price realization, we've moved the estimate from about 1% to above 1%. So price realization for the full year looks to be a little bit better than the prior forecast. And our manufacturing costs are better. We improved. Our efficiency levels look better, and we've reflected that in the forecast as well. The one thing that's an offset to all those improvements was incentive compensation. We increased the full year estimate from about $350 million to about $600 million, so that had a mitigating impact.

So for a lot of our customers and dealers, particularly those who are able to utilize Lane 1, delivery times are actually very -- they're not where we'd like them to be, but compared to the past before the Lane Strategy, pretty good. Then, if you look at lead times for the rest of the product, I'd say in general, lead times, just a generalization, have moved out. But again it's a little bit of a mixed bag story. If you are a dealer, and the product that you order from us is for your inventory, lead times are going out further. If it's for our customer, it gives priority. So again, as a generalization, I would say, as a result of pretty strong demand, lead times are going out a bit. But in the scheme of things, particularly considering Lane 1, the average delivery time isn't too bad.

Remember, when you're looking at quarter-over-quarter, we had $110 million of LIFO decrement benefits a year ago, which, in the quarter, is kind of non-operational per se. And then with that incentive comp catch up, the increase of $120 million, effectively half of that is putting the first quarter on the same rate as the full year outlook. So you had $90 million in the first quarter, $210 million in the second quarter and then based on the outlook, it would be $150 million in each of the next two. So the second quarter got a little extra hit from incentive comp just above and beyond the impact of the outlook because we had to catch up to one and with LIFO decrement benefits from last year. And as I said earlier, sales mix was fairly negative. I mean, we had a very significant ramp up in small machines. So I think the underlying kind of rates is probably better than the headline number suggests. Manufacturing efficiency continued along at a very good pace. Price realization was decent, I think, considering the environment. And so yes, I think overall, we were pleased. I think the rest of the year, particularly when you look year-over-year, is going to be constrained a bit by incentive comp, and it's going to be constrained by the sales mix. I mean, last year, it was a really tough year. We set pretty tough targets. We didn't have any incentive comps last year, so everything this year is incremental. So I think between that and the sales mix, it'll keep the number probably lower than a lot of people would like. But I think the underlying performance on costs, sort of the blocking and tackling in the factories, is going pretty well.

But what we've seen so far this year as our facilities have brought people back, ramped up, worked with the supply chain, is a pull-through that we're pretty happy with. The question is, can we sustain that? And the answer to that is that is our goal. And if you'll look now at where Cat Production System is, it's really paying off. The facilities where that's implemented, institutionalized and working so well and really pushed by our leadership, the benefits are obvious. And virtually every month in 2010 as schedules have been more ordinary than they were in '09, which, as you know, were chaos, we've seen continued benefits. And we're, I would say, not where we want to be yet enterprise-wide on Cat Production System, but it's certainly coming along. And these operating profit, full rates, the absolute rates this year are evidence of that, and we have high expectations that this is what our team can do.

So I think as we work that through the system here this year and if retail demand continues to grow relatively modestly as it has, our availability in Lane Strategy ought to work just perfectly. We're just in this kind of middle of the year where we've had to digest all of this as supply chain ramp up from, really, from a dead stop in the last part of '09. So individually at our facilities, we're pretty happy with it. Overall, we're not happy with our availability in Lane 1 performance.

In other words, they like it. We got 14 of the five distribution centers up and running. We're going to continue to expand that. The other key thing is if you look at the first half of the year, we had no growth in dealer inventory, which means through Lane, we're actually able to feed product directly to end-user demand, whereas in the old days of a run up, you would have seen dealer inventory build, and we would have the wrong product in the wrong place.

If you look at quarter-over-quarter, the sales are actually fairly flat on engines, but the operating profit was down. Essentially, what happened there is we had continuing cost reduction, which was a positive. We had a little bit of price. That was essentially offset by incentive compensation. And so on balance, price and costs overall were fairly neutral. But sales mix was negative for engines quarter-over-quarter. What we had a year ago is sort of continuing strong sales of the big engines, out of the little bit longer of a backlog. They didn't really fall off significantly until the second half of the year. So what we have here now in the second quarter is some of those smaller engines have picked up faster. Those that got hurt earlier last year have picked up quicker like small industrial engines, for example. We have a lot of strength there. So product mix, I touched on product mix earlier, but I think that's the primary reason it's down sort of versus the second quarter a year ago. I think versus the first quarter of this year, operating margins for engines were up, and sequentially, we had a volume increase. And that was, I think, a principal driver of the improvement in both operating profit. And we had incremental margins on engines between the two quarters that were certainly higher than the operating profit level, so that's what helped. Volume, really first to second, was a positive, and that helped. Quarter-over-quarter, though, mix was negative.

I am just really happy with both at this stage. The turnaround we're starting to see in the machine operating profit and engine operating profit, particularly if you adjust for the incentive pay and the items Mike talked about redundancy and so on, at this stage are gratifying. We did not see, as you well know, that the big tail off in engines, it's come back nicely as we just showed you and that is with a really weak Marine segment. I just returned from Europe last night and visited with a lot of the dealers and customers across the board, including the engine people, and the Marine business in Europe, which is a big piece of it, of course, is really weak. It's vastly overbuilt the last few years in terms of new ships, almost across the board in both segments anyway. And we're going to be seeing that for a while I think. But if you look at the smaller engines, our Smaller Machine businesses and look at those operating profit at this point in time, I'm pretty happy with that. But you have to adjust outlook beyond, as Mike has talked about, where we were. And I think we're coming along, and I really feel good about that. And it's kind of I think a reaffirmation of how well Cat Production System can serve us.

First and foremost, it is growth of the company where we can find those growth pieces that add to our business. And certainly, Electro-Motive Diesel was a good one. I'm very happy about that. That's going to put us in a big way in the rail market that we're already in around the world, and I'm thrilled to be able to do that. We talked about Mining shovels. You know we were interested and have been interested in Mining shovels off and on over the years. We've decided that given the industry aspects over the last six months, it's time to go again. We announced that along with a fairly sizable Mining truck increase in both India and the U.S. That should help us well as that market continues to grow. We've quadrupled our excavator production in China and made that announcement in the last few weeks. And I think that really with the state of the industry, as well positioned as we are around the world today, it's time to be looking at growth in a different way because valuations are different than they've ever been in a long time. There are aspects of geographies that are growing like they never have. And as we talked about in our strategy announcement, we'll talk in great detail with all of you next month, we intend to be a leader in every way everywhere in the world. And that means China and India and elsewhere and a leader in a very profitable way as we also have talked about. So I would say that the use of cash priority number one being the growth of business has not changed, and we may have more opportunities based on one, just the playing field that's out there today; and two, some valuations. So we're looking in every corner and all of our businesses are concentrated on that today where we can do that. Secondly, your pension plans. Thirdly, our capital. And then finally, dividends and share buybacks, which has been our priority for a longtime. Strength of the balance sheet is improving. Mike talked about the debt-to-capital ratio. We have a hard and fast, I'm going to say, rule, certainly, it's a goal, but it's going to be a rule to maintain that mid-A credit rating with the agencies. We think we're pretty close to that today. I don't know. I don't have any intention of changing it that much, but we certainly intend to stay mid-A for as long as we can, and even in the downturn last year, we did pretty well with that. And as cash generation comes back, we'd intend to stay in that range. I think I got all your questions, Steve.

I'm Mike DeWalt, the Director of Investor Relations, and I'm pleased to have our CEO and Chairman-Elect, Doug Oberhelman; and our Group Vice Chairman and CFO, Ed Rapp, with me on the call today.
This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc., and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of this call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investor section of our cat.com website, and it'll be labeled in the section, Results Webcast.
In addition, we'll be discussing forward-looking information today that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A - Risk Factors of our Form 10-K for the year ended 2009 and Part 2 of our first quarter 2010 Form 10-Q, and also in the forward-looking statements language contained in today's release.
Okay, earlier this morning, we reported results for the second quarter, and we increased our outlook for the full year of 2010. And to start this morning, I'll summarize the quarter and the new outlook, and then Doug and Ed and I will take your questions. So let's start with the second quarter top line.  
Sales and revenues were $10,409,000,000, and that's up from $7,975,000,000 in the second quarter of 2009. And that's an increase of about $2.4 billion or 31%. The increase in the top line was primarily driven by the absence of 2009's dealer inventory reductions, coupled with improvement in end-user demand. And in terms of dealer inventory, our dealers cut their new machine inventories by about $1.2 billion during the second quarter of 2009, and as a result, Caterpillar essentially undersold end-user demand in last year's second quarter.
During the second quarter of 2010 this year, dealers held inventory about flat, meaning that our machine sales were about in line with end-user demand. We frequently hear comments and get questions about dealer restocking, and to be clear, overall, dealers have collectively not increased machine inventories yet. They've just stopped reducing them. 
In fact, that comment goes for the first half of 2010, not just the second quarter. Inventories have remained relatively flat all year long. Dealer inventories in terms of months of supply are below historic averages. That's a good thing, and it's in keeping with our Lane Strategy that includes Caterpillar holding finished inventory in regional distribution centers to serve our dealers and customers. That said, inventories are getting tight in some parts of the world. And the higher sales are in our outlook range, the more likely it is that dealers will want to add some inventory.  Okay, that's the situation with dealer inventory. 
The second major reason for the sales increase in the second quarter was better end-user demand. Demand has picked up substantially from the very depressed levels of last year. And that's because most of the world economies are in recovery after last year's severe economic decline. 
World growth is being led by the developing countries of Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. And we're seeing continuing strong growth in our businesses in the developing world. That economic growth is also driving demand for commodities like iron ore, copper, coal and oil. And that's helping our mining and energy-related businesses around the world.
The developed countries of the world, like the United States, in Europe and Japan, are also growing but more slowly. And while economic growth in developed countries has helped, we still have a very long way to go. Sales in North America and Europe, while better than the very low levels of 2009, are still depressed.
So the 31% increase in our top line was primarily due to the absence of last year's dealer inventory decline and improving end-user demand. Just one more point about the sales increase, the vast majority was related to Machinery. Compared with the second quarter of 2009, Machinery sales were up 55%, while Engines sales were up 3%.
Now let's turn to profit. Profit in the quarter was $707 million, a 91% increase from $371 million in the second quarter of 2009. Profit per share was $1.09, up $0.49 from $0.60 in the same quarter of 2009. Consolidating operating profit as a percent of sales was 9.4%, and that's up from 4.4% in the second quarter of last year. In Machinery and Engines, gross margin continued to improve and was 24.2% in the quarter. 
Higher sales volume was a significant positive factor driving the improvement in profit. That said, that positive impact was mitigated somewhat by a very negative sales mix. Our mix of sales in the second quarter as compared with the second quarter a year ago was negative because Machinery sales, remember I have 55% up, increased to the much faster pace than Engines sales, which were up 3%. And that's a negative because Machinery margins are lower than Engine margins.
In addition, the production in sale of smaller, lower-margin machines increased faster than large machines. And that's primarily because smaller machines were more depressed than large machines by the impact of the dealer inventory reductions in 2009. And also, the mix of engines that we sold was also somewhat negative. So that's volume. A major positive but mitigated somewhat by a negative sales mix.
In addition to higher sales volume, price realization also improved and was favorable to profit $187 million. Manufacturing costs were also favorable by $316 million. And if you exclude the LIFO inventory decrement benefit that we realized in the second quarter of 2009, the cost improvement was more. It was $426 million. And that was a result of better labor and overhead efficiency, lower warranty costs and favorable material costs.
Another positive in the quarter was the absence of $85 million of employee redundancy costs from the second quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting these positive items were higher income taxes. As a percent of profit before tax, rates went up in the second quarter of 2009, and that's primarily due to the geographic mix of where profits were earned. 
SG&A and R&D costs were also higher, and that was due to provisions for employee incentive compensation and some increase in R&D spending related to Tier 4 emissions. Overall, currency impacts were also negative. The impact of currency was $77 million unfavorable to operating profit, and currency impacts were the principal reason that the other income line, which is below operating profit, declined from the second quarter of 2009.
Before I move on to the full year outlook, I'd like to cover two items, employee incentive compensation and income taxes, in just a little more depth. As you may be aware, a portion of the compensation for our support and management and some production employees is variable and based on the financial performance of the company, and financial performance in 2010 has continued to improve. And based on the new outlook for 2010, we expect incentive compensation of about $600 million for the year. We provided about $90 million in the first quarter, and that was based on the full year outlook at that time. And we provided $210 million in the second quarter of 2010, and that was based on the new outlook that we released this morning.  
That means through the first half of the year, we provided for half of the full year estimate of about $600 million. So the provision in the second quarter at $210 million was $120 million higher than the provision from the first quarter. And again, that was based on the improvement in the full year outlook. 
The second thing I wanted to add color on was the provision for income taxes. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, taxes and the tax rate were unfavorable compared with the second quarter of 2009, so year-over-year unfavorable. However, our previous outlook for 2010 expected a 30% tax rate excluding the Medicare-related adjustment in the first quarter. Taxes in the second quarter were below that 30% estimate. We had favorable discrete tax adjustments in the quarter, and we lowered our estimated annual tax rate for 2010 from 30% to 29%.  As a result, taxes in the second quarter were favorable versus the 30% rate from the previous outlook. 
I hope you follow that discussion on incentive compensation and taxes. I know it's a bit complicated. But the punch line is incentive compensation expense in the quarter was probably higher than you might have thought because of the increase in our outlook, but taxes were probably more favorable than you expected.
In addition to profit, we've been very focused on cash flow this year. Through the first half of the year, our Machinery and Engines operating cash flow improved substantially from about $600 million during the first half of 2009 to about $2.4 billion to the first half of 2010. Our Machinery and Engines debt-to-capital ratio improved as well, and at the end of June 2010, it stood at 41.9%. And that's an improvement from 53.1% at the end of June 2009, and an improvement from 45.2% just three months ago at the end of the first quarter.
Okay, let's move on to the outlook. This morning, we raised guidance for sales and revenue and profit. Our previous outlook range for 2010 sales and revenues was $38 billion to $42 billion, and that was a midpoint of about $40 billion. The outlook we provided this morning is a range of $39 billion to $42 billion with a midpoint of $40.5 billion. And in that, it's probably worth noting that the U.S. dollar has strengthened since the end of the first quarter, and that's had a negative impact on our sales forecast, as sales and other currencies translate into fewer dollars.
The full year impact on sales compared with the previous outlook is negative, about $500 million. So what that means is the underlying in volume improvement in the sales and revenues outlook is a little better than the headline numbers we'd indicate. 
We also raised our profit outlook this morning. We're expecting profit per share in the range of $3.15 to $3.85 with a midpoint of $3.50 a share. That's up from the previous outlook range, which was $2.50 to $3.25 a share with a $2.88 midpoint. Okay, that's the outlook.
In summary, the second quarter reflected continuing improvement. Dealer sales to end users continue to strengthen. And thanks to our suppliers and a lot of hard work in our factories, we were able to raise production significantly in the second quarter and do it with reasonable efficiency. Sales and profit were up. We raised the outlook for the year. 
And with that, we're ready to take your questions."

I think it's probably fair to say that our fill rate out of lane one is not where we would like it to be. It's a little bit below that, although we've been working on it pretty hard. Sales to end users, end-user demand has just continued to be good. And in some parts of the world, it's outpaced to what we thought, and it's made it a little tough to get the fill rates out of lane one, maybe as high as we would like. I think overall, dealer inventories, right now, they've come down a lot. They're below the historical averages, as you said. It's not in our plan to take them down from here, but on kind of the increases in volume that we've seen for this year, the plan is actually to hold them kind of steady where they are right now."

So that helped a little bit. But most of the improvement was really three things with a partial offset. Sales volume was up, and again, the volume number is better than the outlook would appear because of the translation on the sales. So that was a positive. It might have been a subtlety in the language, but on price realization, we've moved the estimate from about 1% to above 1%. So price realization for the full year looks to be a little bit better than the prior forecast. And our manufacturing costs are better. We improved. Our efficiency levels look better, and we've reflected that in the forecast as well. The one thing that's an offset to all those improvements was incentive compensation. We increased the full year estimate from about $350 million to about $600 million, so that had a mitigating impact."

It's up in every region, Asia Pacific, North America, Latin America, Europe, Africa, Middle East, and it's up for the world. But we're coming off a pretty low base.

Remember, when you're looking at quarter-over-quarter, we had $110 million of LIFO decrement benefits a year ago, which, in the quarter, is kind of non-operational per se. And then with that incentive comp catch up, the increase of $120 million, effectively half of that is putting the first quarter on the same rate as the full year outlook. So you had $90 million in the first quarter, $210 million in the second quarter and then based on the outlook, it would be $150 million in each of the next two. So the second quarter got a little extra hit from incentive comp just above and beyond the impact of the outlook because we had to catch up to one and with LIFO decrement benefits from last year. And as I said earlier, sales mix was fairly negative. I mean, we had a very significant ramp up in small machines. So I think the underlying kind of rates is probably better than the headline number suggests. Manufacturing efficiency continued along at a very good pace. Price realization was decent, I think, considering the environment. And so yes, I think overall, we were pleased. I think the rest of the year, particularly when you look year-over-year, is going to be constrained a bit by incentive comp, and it's going to be constrained by the sales mix. I mean, last year, it was a really tough year. We set pretty tough targets. We didn't have any incentive comps last year, so everything this year is incremental. So I think between that and the sales mix, it'll keep the number probably lower than a lot of people would like. But I think the underlying performance on costs, sort of the blocking and tackling in the factories, is going pretty well."

The question is, can we sustain that? And the answer to that is that is our goal. And if you'll look now at where Cat Production System is, it's really paying off. The facilities where that's implemented, institutionalized and working so well and really pushed by our leadership, the benefits are obvious. And virtually every month in 2010 as schedules have been more ordinary than they were in '09, which, as you know, were chaos, we've seen continued benefits. And we're, I would say, not where we want to be yet enterprise-wide on Cat Production System, but it's certainly coming along.

So I think as we work that through the system here this year and if retail demand continues to grow relatively modestly as it has, our availability in Lane Strategy ought to work just perfectly. We're just in this kind of middle of the year where we've had to digest all of this as supply chain ramp up from, really, from a dead stop in the last part of '09. So individually at our facilities, we're pretty happy with it. Overall, we're not happy with our availability in Lane 1 performance.

If you look at quarter-over-quarter, the sales are actually fairly flat on engines, but the operating profit was down. Essentially, what happened there is we had continuing cost reduction, which was a positive. We had a little bit of price. That was essentially offset by incentive compensation. And so on balance, price and costs overall were fairly neutral. But sales mix was negative for engines quarter-over-quarter. What we had a year ago is sort of continuing strong sales of the big engines, out of the little bit longer of a backlog. They didn't really fall off significantly until the second half of the year. So what we have here now in the second quarter is some of those smaller engines have picked up faster. Those that got hurt earlier last year have picked up quicker like small industrial engines, for example. We have a lot of strength there. So product mix, I touched on product mix earlier, but I think that's the primary reason it's down sort of versus the second quarter a year ago. I think versus the first quarter of this year, operating margins for engines were up, and sequentially, we had a volume increase. And that was, I think, a principal driver of the improvement in both operating profit. And we had incremental margins on engines between the two quarters that were certainly higher than the operating profit level, so that's what helped.

The turnaround we're starting to see in the machine operating profit and engine operating profit, particularly if you adjust for the incentive pay and the items Mike talked about redundancy and so on, at this stage are gratifying. We did not see, as you well know, that the big tail off in engines, it's come back nicely as we just showed you and that is with a really weak Marine segment. I just returned from Europe last night and visited with a lot of the dealers and customers across the board, including the engine people, and the Marine business in Europe, which is a big piece of it, of course, is really weak. It's vastly overbuilt the last few years in terms of new ships, almost across the board in both segments anyway. And we're going to be seeing that for a while I think. But if you look at the smaller engines, our Smaller Machine businesses and look at those operating profit at this point in time, I'm pretty happy with that. But you have to adjust outlook beyond, as Mike has talked about, where we were. And I think we're coming along, and I really feel good about that. And it's kind of, I think, a reaffirmation of how well Cat Production System can serve us."

First and foremost, it is growth of the company where we can find those growth pieces that add to our business. And certainly, Electro-Motive Diesel was a good one. I'm very happy about that. That's going to put us in a big way in the rail market that we're already in around the world, and I'm thrilled to be able to do that. We talked about Mining shovels. You know we were interested and have been interested in Mining shovels off and on over the years. We've decided that given the industry aspects over the last six months, it's time to go again. We announced that along with a fairly sizable Mining truck increase in both India and the U.S. That should help us well as that market continues to grow. We've quadrupled our excavator production in China and made that announcement in the last few weeks. And I think that really with the state of the industry, as well positioned as we are around the world today, it's time to be looking at growth in a different way because valuations are different than they've ever been in a long time. There are aspects of geographies that are growing like they never have. And as we talked about in our strategy announcement, we'll talk in great detail with all of you next month, we intend to be a leader in every way everywhere in the world. And that means China and India and elsewhere and a leader in a very profitable way as we also have talked about. So I would say that the use of cash priority number one being the growth of business has not changed, and we may have more opportunities based on one, just the playing field that's out there today; and two, some valuations. So we're looking in every corner and all of our businesses are concentrated on that today where we can do that. Secondly, your pension plans. Thirdly, our capital. And then finally, dividends and share buybacks, which has been our priority for a longtime. Strength of the balance sheet is improving. Mike talked about the debt-to-capital ratio. We have a hard and fast, I'm going to say, rule, certainly, it's a goal, but it's going to be a rule to maintain that mid-A credit rating with the agencies. We think we're pretty close to that today. I don't know. I don't have any intention of changing it that much, but we certainly intend to stay mid-A for as long as we can, and even in the downturn last year, we did pretty well with that. And as cash generation comes back, we'd intend to stay in that range. I think I got all your questions, Steve."

I'm Mike DeWalt, the Director of Investor Relations, and I'm pleased to have our CEO and Chairman-Elect, Doug Oberhelman; and our Group Vice Chairman and CFO, Ed Rapp, with me on the call today.

If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investor section of our cat.com website, and it'll be labeled in the section, Results Webcast.
In addition, we'll be discussing forward-looking information today that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that individually or in the aggregate we believe could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A - Risk Factors of our Form 10-K for the year ended 2009 and Part 2 of our first quarter 2010 Form 10-Q, and also in the forward-looking statements language contained in today's release.
Okay, earlier this morning, we reported results for the second quarter, and we increased our outlook for the full year of 2010. And to start this morning, I'll summarize the quarter and the new outlook, and then Doug and Ed and I will take your questions. So let's start with the second quarter top line.  
Sales and revenues were $10,409,000,000, and that's up from $7,975,000,000 in the second quarter of 2009. And that's an increase of about $2.4 billion or 31%. The increase in the top line was primarily driven by the absence of 2009's dealer inventory reductions, coupled with improvement in end-user demand. And in terms of dealer inventory, our dealers cut their new machine inventories by about $1.2 billion during the second quarter of 2009, and as a result, Caterpillar essentially undersold end-user demand in last year's second quarter.
During the second quarter of 2010 this year, dealers held inventory about flat, meaning that our machine sales were about in line with end-user demand. We frequently hear comments and get questions about dealer restocking, and to be clear, overall, dealers have collectively not increased machine inventories yet. They've just stopped reducing them. 
In fact, that comment goes for the first half of 2010, not just the second quarter. Inventories have remained relatively flat all year long. Dealer inventories in terms of months of supply are below historic averages. That's a good thing, and it's in keeping with our Lane Strategy that includes Caterpillar holding finished inventory in regional distribution centers to serve our dealers and customers. That said, inventories are getting tight in some parts of the world. And the higher sales are in our outlook range, the more likely it is that dealers will want to add some inventory.  Okay, that's the situation with dealer inventory. 
The second major reason for the sales increase in the second quarter was better end-user demand. Demand has picked up substantially from the very depressed levels of last year. And that's because most of the world economies are in recovery after last year's severe economic decline. 
World growth is being led by the developing countries of Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. And we're seeing continuing strong growth in our businesses in the developing world. That economic growth is also driving demand for commodities like iron ore, copper, coal and oil. And that's helping our mining and energy-related businesses around the world.
The developed countries of the world, like the United States, in Europe and Japan, are also growing but more slowly. And while economic growth in developed countries has helped, we still have a very long way to go. Sales in North America and Europe, while better than the very low levels of 2009, are still depressed.
So the 31% increase in our top line was primarily due to the absence of last year's dealer inventory decline and improving end-user demand. Just one more point about the sales increase, the vast majority was related to Machinery. Compared with the second quarter of 2009, Machinery sales were up 55%, while Engines sales were up 3%.
Now let's turn to profit. Profit in the quarter was $707 million, a 91% increase from $371 million in the second quarter of 2009. Profit per share was $1.09, up $0.49 from $0.60 in the same quarter of 2009. Consolidating operating profit as a percent of sales was 9.4%, and that's up from 4.4% in the second quarter of last year. In Machinery and Engines, gross margin continued to improve and was 24.2% in the quarter. 
Higher sales volume was a significant positive factor driving the improvement in profit. That said, that positive impact was mitigated somewhat by a very negative sales mix. Our mix of sales in the second quarter as compared with the second quarter a year ago was negative because Machinery sales, remember I have 55% up, increased to the much faster pace than Engines sales, which were up 3%. And that's a negative because Machinery margins are lower than Engine margins.
In addition, the production in sale of smaller, lower-margin machines increased faster than large machines. And that's primarily because smaller machines were more depressed than large machines by the impact of the dealer inventory reductions in 2009. And also, the mix of engines that we sold was also somewhat negative. So that's volume. A major positive but mitigated somewhat by a negative sales mix.
In addition to higher sales volume, price realization also improved and was favorable to profit $187 million. Manufacturing costs were also favorable by $316 million. And if you exclude the LIFO inventory decrement benefit that we realized in the second quarter of 2009, the cost improvement was more. It was $426 million. And that was a result of better labor and overhead efficiency, lower warranty costs and favorable material costs.
Another positive in the quarter was the absence of $85 million of employee redundancy costs from the second quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting these positive items were higher income taxes. As a percent of profit before tax, rates went up in the second quarter of 2009, and that's primarily due to the geographic mix of where profits were earned. 
SG&A and R&D costs were also higher, and that was due to provisions for employee incentive compensation and some increase in R&D spending related to Tier 4 emissions. Overall, currency impacts were also negative. The impact of currency was $77 million unfavorable to operating profit, and currency impacts were the principal reason that the other income line, which is below operating profit, declined from the second quarter of 2009.
Before I move on to the full year outlook, I'd like to cover two items, employee incentive compensation and income taxes, in just a little more depth. As you may be aware, a portion of the compensation for our support and management and some production employees is variable and based on the financial performance of the company, and financial performance in 2010 has continued to improve. And based on the new outlook for 2010, we expect incentive compensation of about $600 million for the year. We provided about $90 million in the first quarter, and that was based on the full year outlook at that time. And we provided $210 million in the second quarter of 2010, and that was based on the new outlook that we released this morning.  
That means through the first half of the year, we provided for half of the full year estimate of about $600 million. So the provision in the second quarter at $210 million was $120 million higher than the provision from the first quarter. And again, that was based on the improvement in the full year outlook. 
The second thing I wanted to add color on was the provision for income taxes. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, taxes and the tax rate were unfavorable compared with the second quarter of 2009, so year-over-year unfavorable. However, our previous outlook for 2010 expected a 30% tax rate excluding the Medicare-related adjustment in the first quarter. Taxes in the second quarter were below that 30% estimate. We had favorable discrete tax adjustments in the quarter, and we lowered our estimated annual tax rate for 2010 from 30% to 29%.  As a result, taxes in the second quarter were favorable versus the 30% rate from the previous outlook. 
I hope you follow that discussion on incentive compensation and taxes. I know it's a bit complicated. But the punch line is incentive compensation expense in the quarter was probably higher than you might have thought because of the increase in our outlook, but taxes were probably more favorable than you expected.
In addition to profit, we've been very focused on cash flow this year. Through the first half of the year, our Machinery and Engines operating cash flow improved substantially from about $600 million during the first half of 2009 to about $2.4 billion to the first half of 2010. Our Machinery and Engines debt-to-capital ratio improved as well, and at the end of June 2010, it stood at 41.9%. And that's an improvement from 53.1% at the end of June 2009, and an improvement from 45.2% just three months ago at the end of the first quarter.
Okay, let's move on to the outlook. This morning, we raised guidance for sales and revenue and profit. Our previous outlook range for 2010 sales and revenues was $38 billion to $42 billion, and that was a midpoint of about $40 billion. The outlook we provided this morning is a range of $39 billion to $42 billion with a midpoint of $40.5 billion. And in that, it's probably worth noting that the U.S. dollar has strengthened since the end of the first quarter, and that's had a negative impact on our sales forecast, as sales and other currencies translate into fewer dollars.
The full year impact on sales compared with the previous outlook is negative, about $500 million. So what that means is the underlying in volume improvement in the sales and revenues outlook is a little better than the headline numbers we'd indicate. 
We also raised our profit outlook this morning. We're expecting profit per share in the range of $3.15 to $3.85 with a midpoint of $3.50 a share. That's up from the previous outlook range, which was $2.50 to $3.25 a share with a $2.88 midpoint. Okay, that's the outlook.
In summary, the second quarter reflected continuing improvement. Dealer sales to end users continue to strengthen. And thanks to our suppliers and a lot of hard work in our factories, we were able to raise production significantly in the second quarter and do it with reasonable efficiency. Sales and profit were up. We raised the outlook for the year. 
And with that, we're ready to take your questions."

It's dealer by dealer. It's not the same story everywhere in the world. In some places, dealer inventory is actually probably a little too tight right now. I think in general, we're moving along pretty well with Lane Strategy. At the end of the quarter, we had about 25% coming out of lane one. I think it's probably fair to say that our fill rate out of lane one is not where we would like it to be. It's a little bit below that, although we've been working on it pretty hard. Sales to end users, end-user demand has just continued to be good. And in some parts of the world, it's outpaced to what we thought, and it's made it a little tough to get the fill rates out of lane one, maybe as high as we would like. I think overall, dealer inventories, right now, they've come down a lot. They're below the historical averages, as you said. It's not in our plan to take them down from here, but on kind of the increases in volume that we've seen for this year, the plan is actually to hold them kind of steady where they are right now."

So that helped a little bit. But most of the improvement was really three things with a partial offset. Sales volume was up, and again, the volume number is better than the outlook would appear because of the translation on the sales. So that was a positive. It might have been a subtlety in the language, but on price realization, we've moved the estimate from about 1% to above 1%. So price realization for the full year looks to be a little bit better than the prior forecast. And our manufacturing costs are better. We improved. Our efficiency levels look better, and we've reflected that in the forecast as well. The one thing that's an offset to all those improvements was incentive compensation. We increased the full year estimate from about $350 million to about $600 million, so that had a mitigating impact."

If you are a dealer, and the product that you order from us is for your inventory, lead times are going out further. If it's for our customer, it gets priority.

Remember, when you're looking at quarter-over-quarter, we had $110 million of LIFO decrement benefits a year ago, which, in the quarter, is kind of non-operational per se. And then with that incentive comp catch up, the increase of $120 million, effectively half of that is putting the first quarter on the same rate as the full year outlook. So you had $90 million in the first quarter, $210 million in the second quarter and then based on the outlook, it would be $150 million in each of the next two. So the second quarter got a little extra hit from incentive comp just above and beyond the impact of the outlook because we had to catch up to one and with LIFO decrement benefits from last year. And as I said earlier, sales mix was fairly negative. I mean, we had a very significant ramp up in small machines. So I think the underlying kind of rates is probably better than the headline number suggests. Manufacturing efficiency continued along at a very good pace. Price realization was decent, I think, considering the environment. And so yes, I think overall, we were pleased. I think the rest of the year, particularly when you look year-over-year, is going to be constrained a bit by incentive comp, and it's going to be constrained by the sales mix. I mean, last year, it was a really tough year. We set pretty tough targets. We didn't have any incentive comps last year, so everything this year is incremental. So I think between that and the sales mix, it'll keep the number probably lower than a lot of people would like. But I think the underlying performance on costs, sort of the blocking and tackling in the factories, is going pretty well."

The question is, can we sustain that? And the answer to that is that is our goal. And if you'll look now at where Cat Production System is, it's really paying off. The facilities where that's implemented, institutionalized and working so well and really pushed by our leadership, the benefits are obvious. And virtually every month in 2010 as schedules have been more ordinary than they were in '09, which, as you know, were chaos, we've seen continued benefits. And we're, I would say, not where we want to be yet enterprise-wide on Cat Production System, but it's certainly coming along.

So I think as we work that through the system here this year and if retail demand continues to grow relatively modestly as it has, our availability in Lane Strategy ought to work just perfectly. We're just in this kind of middle of the year where we've had to digest all of this as supply chain ramp up from, really, from a dead stop in the last part of '09. So individually at our facilities, we're pretty happy with it. Overall, we're not happy with our availability in Lane 1 performance.

In other words, they like it. We got 14 of the five distribution centers up and running. We're going to continue to expand that. The other key thing is if you look at the first half of the year, we had no growth in dealer inventory, which means through Lane, we're actually able to feed product directly to end-user demand, whereas in the old days of a run up, you would have seen dealer inventory build, and we would have the wrong product in the wrong place.

If you look at quarter-over-quarter, the sales are actually fairly flat on engines, but the operating profit was down. Essentially, what happened there is we had continuing cost reduction, which was a positive. We had a little bit of price. That was essentially offset by incentive compensation. And so on balance, price and costs overall were fairly neutral. But sales mix was negative for engines quarter-over-quarter. What we had a year ago is sort of continuing strong sales of the big engines, out of the little bit longer of a backlog. They didn't really fall off significantly until the second half of the year. So what we have here now in the second quarter is some of those smaller engines have picked up faster. Those that got hurt earlier last year have picked up quicker like small industrial engines, for example. We have a lot of strength there. So product mix, I touched on product mix earlier, but I think that's the primary reason it's down sort of versus the second quarter a year ago. I think versus the first quarter of this year, operating margins for engines were up, and sequentially, we had a volume increase. And that was, I think, a principal driver of the improvement in both operating profit. And we had incremental margins on engines between the two quarters that were certainly higher than the operating profit level, so that's what helped.

I just returned from Europe last night and visited with a lot of the dealers and customers across the board, including the engine people, and the Marine business in Europe, which is a big piece of it, of course, is really weak. It's vastly overbuilt the last few years in terms of new ships, almost across the board in both segments anyway. And we're going to be seeing that for a while I think.

We have seen some signs of improvements relative to utilization. But with the increase in end-user demand that we've seen for the most part, the availability has been going to feed that end-user demand. So I'd say moving forward, it is one of the -- in addition to what we talked about on dealer inventory not increasing and rental fleets not increasing. It is something out there in the future that offers some upside opportunity."

First and foremost, it is growth of the company where we can find those growth pieces that add to our business. And certainly, Electro-Motive Diesel was a good one. I'm very happy about that. That's going to put us in a big way in the rail market that we're already in around the world, and I'm thrilled to be able to do that. We talked about Mining shovels. You know we were interested and have been interested in Mining shovels off and on over the years. We've decided that given the industry aspects over the last six months, it's time to go again. We announced that along with a fairly sizable Mining truck increase in both India and the U.S. That should help us well as that market continues to grow. We've quadrupled our excavator production in China and made that announcement in the last few weeks. And I think that really with the state of the industry, as well positioned as we are around the world today, it's time to be looking at growth in a different way because valuations are different than they've ever been in a long time. There are aspects of geographies that are growing like they never have. And as we talked about in our strategy announcement, we'll talk in great detail with all of you next month, we intend to be a leader in every way everywhere in the world. And that means China and India and elsewhere and a leader in a very profitable way as we also have talked about. So I would say that the use of cash priority number one being the growth of business has not changed, and we may have more opportunities based on one, just the playing field that's out there today; and two, some valuations. So we're looking in every corner and all of our businesses are concentrated on that today where we can do that. Secondly, your pension plans. Thirdly, our capital. And then finally, dividends and share buybacks, which has been our priority for a longtime. Strength of the balance sheet is improving. Mike talked about the debt-to-capital ratio. We have a hard and fast, I'm going to say, rule, certainly, it's a goal, but it's going to be a rule to maintain that mid-A credit rating with the agencies. We think we're pretty close to that today. I don't know. I don't have any intention of changing it that much, but we certainly intend to stay mid-A for as long as we can, and even in the downturn last year, we did pretty well with that. And as cash generation comes back, we'd intend to stay in that range. I think I got all your questions, Steve."

In addition, we'll be discussing forward-looking information today that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A - Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC back on February 19, and our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 3, 2010. And it's also on our forward-looking statements language contained in today's release. 
Okay, earlier this morning, we reported results for the third quarter. We increased our full year outlook for 2010 and we provided a preliminary outlook for 2011 sales and revenues. To start this morning, I'll summarize the quarter and the outlook, then Doug and Ed and I will take your questions.
Let's start with the third quarter top line. Sales and revenues were $11,134,000,000 and that's up from $7,298,000,000 in the third quarter of 2009., And that's an increase of about $3.8 billion or 53%. Now that includes about two months of sales at Electro-Motive Diesel and we'll be referring to that as EMD here today, which we acquired in the third quarter and added about $216 million in sales for the quarter. Excluding EMD, sales and revenues were up about 50%.
The increase in sales was primarily a result of improving end-user demand and the absence of 2009's dealer-machine inventory reductions, and I'll cover both of those this morning. First, in terms of end-user demand, good economic growth in the developing world has been positive for sales in Asia, Latin America, the CIS, and Africa/Middle East. In addition, the growth in those developing countries have improved demand for commodities and that's been good and positive for our Mining business worldwide. 
In addition, we are seeing growth in the developed countries of North America and Europe, albeit off depressed levels from 2009. With weak economic recoveries in the U.S. and Europe and with depressed construction activity, I know it's tough to understand why sales of CAT machines are up so much. And new machine sales in the United States are good example that illustrates the point. Here's what's happening: First, sales to users peaked in 2006, then declined in 2007, declined again in 2008 and then declined even more significantly in 2009. From the peak quarter in 2006 to the bottom in late 2009, dealer-machine sales to end users in the U.S. declined nearly 80%. Today, we're seeing improvement from those low levels as customers are buying some machines to slow the aging of their fleets. In addition, dealers have increased machine purchases for rental fleets. That said, rental fleets size hasn't improved much, the average age of dealer rental fleets haven't improved and it remains elevated. And rental inventory utilization rates have increased and are now higher than in 2007, 2008 and 2009.
In addition to better end-user demand, dealer inventory changes also affected the sales comparison with the third quarter of 2009. Last year, dealers reduced new machine inventories by about $1.1 billion in the third quarter. So far in 2010, dealers have held the machine inventories relatively flat. They were actually up about $100 million so far this year and that was in the third quarter.
Speaking of inventory levels, though, we frequently hear comments and get questions about dealer restocking. And just to be clear, other than the very small increase this quarter, that's not happened. Overall, dealer-machine inventories are within a few percent of the year in 2009 levels.
Dealer-machine inventories in terms of months of supply continued to decline and are below historic averages. That's a good thing, and it's in keeping with our Lane strategy that includes Caterpillar holding finished inventory and regional distribution centers to serve our dealers and customers. That said, dealer inventories are very tight in many parts of the world and dealers will probably need to add some inventory next year.
In summary on the topline, sales and revenues were up in all regions. North America was up 55%, Latin America, 95%; Europe, Africa/Middle East, 31%; and Asia/Pacific was up 51%.
Okay, let's turn to profit. Profit in the quarter was $792 million and that was a 96% increase from $404 million in the third quarter of 2009. Profit per share was $1.22, and that was up $0.58 from the $0.64 a share we earned in the third quarter last year. Consolidated operating profit rose from $277 million in the third quarter last year to $1,187,000,000 in the third quarter of 2010, and that's a 329% increase in operating profit. As a percent of sales, and this is on a consolidated basis, operating profit was 10.7% and that was up from 3.8% a year ago. In addition, Machinery and Engines gross margin continued to improve and was 25.8% in the quarter.
The increase in sales volume was the most significant factor driving the improvement in profit. That said, that positive impact was mitigated somewhat by a very negative sales mix compared with the third quarter of 2009. In addition to the higher volume, price realization improved and was favorable to profit, $262 million. Manufacturing costs were favorable by $142 million. And if you exclude the $120 million of LIFO inventory decrement benefits that we realized in the third quarter last year, the cost improvement was $262 million. And that was a result of a better labor and overhead efficiency, lower warranty costs and favorable material costs. Just one point on the material costs, while we've been favorable compared with 2009 in every quarter this year, the degree to which material costs were favorable has been declining as material costs have been trending up.
Okay, partially offsetting those positive items in terms of profit, income taxes were very unfavorable. In the third quarter of 2009, income taxes actually benefited  profit $139 million, of which $129 million was related to the settlement of tax returns for years prior to 2009. The third quarter of 2010 reflects tax expense at an estimated annual effective tax rate of 28%, less $14 million from a year-to-date adjustment and that was related to moving the estimated rate from 29% down to 28% in the quarter. SG&A and R&D costs were also higher and that was primarily due to provisions for employee incentive compensation and increased R&D spending, primarily related to U.S. and European emissions regulations, that applied beginning in 2011.
Overall, currency impacts were also negative. The impact on currency in operating profit was a negative $46 million. And currency was the principal reason that other income, which is below the operating profit line, declined $65 million from the third quarter of 2009. Before I move on to the full year outlook, I'd like to cover employee incentive compensation in just a little more depth.
As you maybe aware, a portion of the compensation for management, support and some of our hourly employees is at risk and it varies based on the financial performance of the company. Given the economic environment in 2009, the profit target related to our short-term incentive plan was aggressive and it did not trigger. And as a result, there was no incentive-related expense in 2009. Financial performance in 2010 has been much better. And based on the newly revised and higher profit outlook for 2010, we expect incentive compensation to be higher. Our practice is to accrue the expense as we go through the year based on our full year expectations. That means when we changed the outlook, we have a year-to-date catch-up in the provision and that happened this quarter. The outlook we've provided with our second quarter release included $600 million in incentive compensation, $300 million of that was in the first half and we had an expectation of about $150 million in each of the third and fourth quarters.
Because we raised the outlook in the third quarter, the full year estimate for incentive compensation rose from $600 million to $700 million, an increase of $100 million from our prior estimate. Since we are three quarters of the way through the year, we've provided for three quarters of the change in the full year estimate in the third quarter. As a result, we provided for about $225 million of incentive compensation in the quarter, compared with $150 million that was in our previous outlook. The punchline here is, incentive compensation expense was probably higher than you would have expected. It was higher than our previous outlook and that's because we took guidance up and needed to reflect the change in the third quarter.
One last thing before I'd move on to the outlook and that's incremental profit. For machines and engines sales were up $3,869,000,000 and operating profit was up $900 million. That's a 23% incremental margin rate. However, our results in the third quarter of 2010 included the acquisition of EMD. And the third quarter of last year included $120 million of LIFO decrement benefits. Excluding those two items, incremental profit was about 27%, and that by the way, does include the negative impacts of product mix, the $225 million in incentive compensation and the negative currency impacts. So all in all, it was a pretty good quarter operationally.
Okay, let's move on to the outlook. This morning, we raised 2010 guidance for sales and revenues and for profit. Our previous outlook range for sales and revenues was $39 billion to $42 billion, with the midpoint of $40.5 billion. The outlook we provided this morning is a range of $41 billion to $42 billion, with the midpoint of $41.5 billion. So at the midpoint of the range, sales and revenues are up about $1 billion for the year and about half of that improvement is related to the acquisition of EMD, again, which we completed in August.
We also raised the profit outlook this morning. We're expecting profits per share in the range of $3.80 to $4 a share, with the midpoint of $3.90. That's up from the previous outlook range of $3.15 to $3.85, with a $3.50 midpoint. While EMD is having a positive impact on sales, for the remainder of this year it's not expected to have much impact on profit. In addition to the 2010 outlook, we provided a preliminary top line look at 2011 and we expect sales and revenues to approach $50 billion next year.
That would reflect our current run rate for the second half of the year, which is about $46 billion, plus the full year impact of the acquisition of EMD, continued improvement in end-user demand, including some additions to the new rental fleets, some dealer-machine inventory additions and modest price realization. This morning, we did not provide profit guidance and we don't plan to do that in the call today. As usual, we're in the part of our planning process where we start with sales and we're working on our profit plan for next year. That's been the case for the last couple of years and that's where we are this year.
Okay, that's the outlook. In summary, the third quarter reflected continuing improvement in our financial results. We raised the sales and profit outlook for 2010 and provided a first look in 2011 sales and revenues, that approaches $50 billion. With that, we're ready to take your questions."

So, why so conservative especially with the North America market down so much, so if you can give me some of your assumptions there? And then, is there any reason to believe that for 2011, incrementals shouldn't it be at least within your targeted range of 25% to 27% with some of the headwinds you laid out in the press release?"

We're going to really try since we didn't provide profit guidance this morning. We're really in the process right now of working on our plans, so we're going to try to avoid giving profit guidance here this morning for next year. In terms of first part of your question, if you look at the sales increase next year, we still have a pretty weak recovery going in the developed world. I mean, that's improving but those percentage increases are off pretty low levels. Also, I would say most of the increase next year is more heavily skewed to machines. Engines have been a little bit later cycle. Oil and gas had been good, but it's slow down. You can see our retail statistics for today, oil and gas has flattened out. The engine increase over the last few months even versus last year is up 5%. Marine is continuing on the downside. So I think most of the increase next year is going to be probably related to machines, and again, we have modest economic growth built in to the U.S."

In terms of machine price realization, I think honestly, we've been pleasantly surprised as we've gone through the year. As you know, we started out the year with an outlook of machine from price realization being up less than a point. Then at the end of the second quarter, we said about 1%, and it's been more than that all year long. Effectively, the merchandising programs require  to sell the product, I mean, of all kinds have been less than we thought. We've not taken any price increases per se.

I can tell you that our approaching $50 billion next year does not have us back to '08 volume levels for kind of machine units. Remember, it has things like EMD in it, so it's not the same. Also, if you go back to the $51 billion that we had in '08, we only had Cat in Japan in for a quarter that year. So kind of the real underlying number with the companies that we have now was higher.

Capacity, unfortunately, is not fungible. It kind of depends upon what product your selling. If you look at big engines, for example, right now, out of Lafayette, it improved a lot since the depth of the recession. But as we talked about earlier, and if you look in today's retail sales, oil and gas has flattened out. So for products like that, we probably have a lot more capacity than we would need for next year. For mining product, on the other hand, we'll be capacity constraint probably throughout 2011. I mean,  business there is very good to the point that you made earlier, we are investing in capacity increases. We talked about that for mining trucks in India and mining trucks in the U.S. We talked about investing in shovels, although that's not from a sales standpoint next year. So I think the answer is, we wouldn't have put out a guidance for next year approaching $50 billion and sort of a summary answer, we wouldn't have said that if we didn't think we can make it, number one; and number 2, how much capacity we have and how much more we can do, I think, it really depends a lot on what we're actually selling. There are a lot of products right now where volumes are still very depressed. You look at compact products, a very small stuff, it's improved, but still way off the peak. So we have a lot of capacity there. So just really depends a lot on the product. I know that sounds like a bit of a non-answer, but it's just not -- we're not like a refinery, it's not uniform capacity."

In terms of going from sort of middle of the middle of this years guidance $41.5 billion, something approaching $50 billion, the point that we made earlier, we're already -- our second half of the year is operating at around $46 billion. We have amounts of capacity increases that should help next year. We talked about being able to produce more excavators in China, more mining product, for example, so some of the things that we did announce earlier this year should help next year and we are currently doing better than the full year average. So the -- as what's brought up earlier, the increase isn't maybe as dramatic as looking at $50 billion versus $41.5 billion. In terms of employment, even there, and again, I'm sorry if this sounds like a non-answer, but when you're looking at the production capability of employment, you got to look at not only our full times, we have a very large flexible workforce that we had actually going into the last downturn, which really allowed us to shed costs quickly. So you really have to add that to the employment number. There are also things like overtime that impact your kind of productive capacity out of people. So it in of itself is also not a perfect indicator. What I would tell you is, and we've said this a couple of times today, our labor productivity has improved a lot this year and that's been very good.

So you're right to say that a lot of the product will be affected in the year and the larger product in the U.S., in Europe, but you won't see it all change on January 1. You have the ability to take some flex credits and delay some of the introductions. So I think it's probably going to be a little bit less of a giant January 1 shotgun start. It'll be more of a phase and I think as it go through the year. In either point, it doesn't affect all our service related businesses. It doesn't affect most of our engine business, it doesn't affect small machines, it doesn't affect Latin America or Asia or Middle East or the CIS.

In addition, we'll be discussing forward-looking information today that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A - Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC back on February 19, and our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 3, 2010. And it's also on our forward-looking statements language contained in today's release. 
Okay, earlier this morning, we reported results for the third quarter. We increased our full year outlook for 2010 and we provided a preliminary outlook for 2011 sales and revenues. To start this morning, I'll summarize the quarter and the outlook, then Doug and Ed and I will take your questions.
Let's start with the third quarter top line. Sales and revenues were $11,134,000,000 and that's up from $7,298,000,000 in the third quarter of 2009. And that's an increase of about $3.8 billion or 53%. Now that includes about two months of sales at Electro-Motive Diesel and we'll be referring to that as EMD here today, which we acquired in the third quarter and added about $216 million in sales for the quarter. Excluding EMD, sales and revenues were up about 50%.
The increase in sales was primarily a result of improving end-user demand and the absence of 2009's dealer-machine inventory reductions, and I'll cover both of those this morning. First, in terms of end-user demand, good economic growth in the developing world has been positive for sales in Asia, Latin America, the CIS, and Africa/Middle East. In addition, the growth in those developing countries have improved demand for commodities and that's been good and positive for our Mining business worldwide. 
In addition, we are seeing growth in the developed countries of North America and Europe, albeit off depressed levels from 2009. With weak economic recoveries in the U.S. and Europe and with depressed construction activity, I know it's tough to understand why sales of CAT machines are up so much. And new machine sales in the United States are a good example that illustrates the point. Here's what's happening. First, sales to users peaked in 2006, then declined in 2007, declined again in 2008 and then declined even more significantly in 2009. From the peak quarter in 2006 to the bottom in late 2009, dealer-machine sales to end users in the U.S. declined nearly 80%. Today, we're seeing improvement from those low levels as customers are buying some machines to slow the aging of their fleets. In addition, dealers have increased machine purchases for rental fleets. That said, rental fleets size hasn't improved much, the average age of dealer rental fleets haven't improved and it remains elevated. And rental inventory utilization rates have increased and are now higher than in 2007, 2008 and 2009.
In addition to better end-user demand, dealer inventory changes also affected the sales comparison with the third quarter of 2009. Last year, dealers reduced new machine inventories by about $1.1 billion in the third quarter. So far in 2010, dealers have held the machine inventories relatively flat. They were actually up about $100 million so far this year and that was in the third quarter.
Speaking of inventory levels, though, we frequently hear comments and get questions about dealer restocking. And just to be clear, other than the very small increase this quarter, that's not happened. Overall, dealer-machine inventories are within a few percent of the year end 2009 levels.
Dealer-machine inventories in terms of months of supply continued to decline and are below historic averages. That's a good thing, and it's in keeping with our Lane strategy that includes Caterpillar holding finished inventory and regional distribution centers to serve our dealers and customers. That said, dealer inventories are very tight in many parts of the world and dealers will probably need to add some inventory next year.
In summary on the topline, sales and revenues were up in all regions. North America was up 55%, Latin America, 95%; Europe, Africa/Middle East, 31%; and Asia/Pacific was up 51%.
Okay, let's turn to profit. Profit in the quarter was $792 million and that was a 96% increase from $404 million in the third quarter of 2009. Profit per share was $1.22, and that was up $0.58 from the $0.64 a share we earned in the third quarter last year. Consolidated operating profit rose from $277 million in the third quarter last year to $1,187,000,000 in the third quarter of 2010, and that's a 329% increase in operating profit. As a percent of sales, and this is on a consolidated basis, operating profit was 10.7% and that was up from 3.8% a year ago. In addition, Machinery and Engines gross margin continued to improve and was 25.8% in the quarter.
The increase in sales volume was the most significant factor driving the improvement in profit. That said, that positive impact was mitigated somewhat by a very negative sales mix compared with the third quarter of 2009. In addition to the higher volume, price realization improved and was favorable to profit, $262 million. Manufacturing costs were favorable by $142 million. And if you exclude the $120 million of LIFO inventory decrement benefits that we realized in the third quarter last year, the cost improvement was $262 million. And that was a result of better labor and overhead efficiency, lower warranty costs and favorable material costs. Just one point on the material costs, while we've been favorable compared with 2009 in every quarter this year, the degree to which material costs were favorable has been declining as material costs have been trending up.
Okay, partially offsetting those positive items in terms of profit, income taxes were very unfavorable. In the third quarter of 2009, income taxes actually benefited profit $139 million, of which $129 million was related to the settlement of tax returns for years prior to 2009. The third quarter of 2010 reflects tax expense at an estimated annual effective tax rate of 28%, less $14 million from a year-to-date adjustment and that was related to moving the estimated rate from 29% down to 28% in the quarter. SG&A and R&D costs were also higher and that was primarily due to provisions for employee incentive compensation and increased R&D spending, primarily related to U.S. and European emissions regulations that applied beginning in 2011.
Overall, currency impacts were also negative. The impact on currency in operating profit was a negative $46 million. And currency was the principal reason that other income, which is below the operating profit line, declined $65 million from the third quarter of 2009. Before I move on to the full year outlook, I'd like to cover employee incentive compensation in just a little more depth.
As you may be aware, a portion of the compensation for management, support and some of our hourly employees is at risk and it varies based on the financial performance of the company. Given the economic environment in 2009, the profit target related to our short-term incentive plan was aggressive and it did not trigger. And as a result, there was no incentive-related expense in 2009. Financial performance in 2010 has been much better. And based on the newly revised and higher profit outlook for 2010, we expect incentive compensation to be higher. Our practice is to accrue the expense as we go through the year based on our full year expectations. That means when we changed the outlook, we had a year-to-date catch-up in the provision and that happened this quarter. The outlook we provided with our second quarter release included $600 million in incentive compensation; $300 million of that was in the first half and we had an expectation of about $150 million in each of the third and fourth quarters.
Because we raised the outlook in the third quarter, the full-year estimate for incentive compensation rose from $600 million to $700 million, an increase of $100 million from our prior estimate. Since we are three quarters of the way through the year, we've provided for three quarters of the change in the full year estimate in the third quarter. As a result, we provided for about $225 million of incentive compensation in the quarter, compared with $150 million that was in our previous outlook. The punchline here is, incentive compensation expense was probably higher than you would have expected. It was higher than our previous outlook and that's because we took guidance up and needed to reflect the change in the third quarter.
One last thing before I move on to the outlook and that's incremental profit. For machines and engines sales were up $3,869,000,000 and operating profit was up $900 million. That's a 23% incremental margin rate. However, our results in the third quarter of 2010 included the acquisition of EMD. And the third quarter of last year included $120 million of LIFO decrement benefits. Excluding those two items, incremental profit was about 27%, and that by the way, does include the negative impacts of product mix, the $225 million in incentive compensation and the negative currency impacts. So all in all, it was a pretty good quarter operationally.
Okay, let's move on to the outlook. This morning, we raised 2010 guidance for sales and revenues and for profit. Our previous outlook range for sales and revenues was $39 billion to $42 billion, with a midpoint of $40.5 billion. The outlook we provided this morning is a range of $41 billion to $42 billion, with the midpoint of $41.5 billion. So at the midpoint of the range, sales and revenues are up about $1 billion for the year and about half of that improvement is related to the acquisition of EMD, again, which we completed in August.
We also raised the profit outlook this morning. We're expecting profits per share in the range of $3.80 to $4 a share, with a midpoint of $3.90. That's up from the previous outlook range of $3.15 to $3.85, with a $3.50 midpoint. While EMD is having a positive impact on sales, for the remainder of this year it's not expected to have much impact on profit. In addition to the 2010 outlook, we provided a preliminary top line look at 2011 and we expect sales and revenues to approach $50 billion next year.
That would reflect our current run rate for the second half of the year, which is about $46 billion, plus the full year impact of the acquisition of EMD, continued improvement in end-user demand, including some additions to the new rental fleets, some dealer-machine inventory additions and modest price realization. This morning, we did not provide profit guidance and we don't plan to do that in the call today. As usual, we're in the part of our planning process where we start with sales and we're working on our profit plan for next year. That's been the case for the last couple of years and that's where we are this year.
Okay, that's the outlook. In summary, the third quarter reflected continuing improvement in our financial results. We raised the sales and profit outlook for 2010 and provided a first look at 2011 sales and revenues, that approaches $50 billion. With that, we're ready to take your questions."

One, when I think about your 2011 top line guidance of $50 billion, I guess I'm struggling with that number because if we take the back half of the year and you say you're annualizing $46 billion in revenue as an implied sort of 8% top line",112,"Two questions. One, when I think about your 2011 top line guidance of $50 billion, I guess I'm struggling with that number because if we take the back half of the year and you say you're annualizing $46 billion in revenue as an implied sort of 8% top line growth for 2011. So, why so conservative especially with the North America market down so much, so if you can give me some of your assumptions there? And then, is there any reason to believe that for 2011, incrementals shouldn't be at least within your targeted range of 25% to 27% with some of the headwinds you laid out in the press release?"

We're going to really try, since we didn't provide profit guidance this morning, we're really in the process right now of working on our plans, so we're going to try to avoid giving profit guidance here this morning for next year. In terms of the first part of your question, if you look at the sales increase next year, we still have a pretty weak recovery going in the developed world. I mean, it's improving but those percentage increases are off pretty low levels. Also, I would say most of the increase next year is more heavily skewed to machines. Engines have been a little bit later cycle. Oil and gas had been good, but it's slowed down. You can see our retail statistics for today, oil and gas has flattened out. The engine increase over the last few months even versus last year is up 5%. Marine is continuing on the downside. So I think most of the increase next year is going to be probably related to machines, and again, we have modest economic growth built in to the U.S."

I saw the statistics over the last couple of days where our performance has gone -- of the amount that we've missed, the performance has gone down by about 3/4 in terms of missing builds.

So it's in sort of the base period in comparison, if you will. So the machine price realization isn't maybe as high as it was earlier. In terms of machine price realization, I think honestly we've been pleasantly surprised as we've gone through the year. As you know, we started out the year with an outlook of machine – of price realization being up less than a point. Then at the end of the second quarter, we said about 1%, and it's been more than that all year long. Effectively, the merchandising programs required to sell the product, I mean, of all kinds, have been less than we thought. We've not taken any price increases per se. Generally, we do that most of the time just in January. Every once in a while, we do a mid-year. We didn't do that this year. So I think just in general, we've been, I'd say positively surprised on price all year long."

I can tell you that our approaching $50 billion next year does not have us back to '08 volume levels for kind of machine units. Remember, it has things like EMD in it, so it's not the same. Also, if you go back to the $51 billion that we had in '08, we only had Cat in Japan in for a quarter that year. So kind of the real underlying number with the companies that we have now was higher. So we're not back to that '08 level yet. We don't expect in this preliminary outlook this morning to be back to that '08 machine level in 2008 as yet. So with not giving any numbers on dealer inventory, but I would certainly think that we're not going to be back to the '08 volumes, plus we have Lane so we're not looking for that magnitude of an increase."

And I think, Doug, when you took over the range, you've ended up announcing a lot of capacity and I kind of wondered how much of that was just pure growth above that $50 billion level versus you weren't completely comfortable with the capacity you had put in from '06 to '08.

Capacity, unfortunately, is not fungible. It kind of depends upon what product you're selling. If you look at big engines, for example, right now, out of Lafayette, it improved a lot since the depth of the recession. But as we talked about earlier, and if you look in today's retail sales, oil and gas is flattened out. So for products like that, we probably have a lot more capacity than we would need for next year. For mining product, on the other hand, we'll be capacity constrained probably throughout 2011. I mean, business there is very good to the point that you made earlier, we are investing in capacity increases. We talked about that for mining trucks in India and mining trucks in the U.S. We talked about investing in shovels, although that's not from a sales standpoint next year. So I think the answer is, we wouldn't have put out a guidance for next year approaching $50 billion and sort of a summary answer, we wouldn't have said that if we didn't think we could make it, number one; and number 2, how much capacity we have and how much more we can do, I think, it really depends a lot on what we're actually selling. There are a lot of products right now where volumes are still very depressed. You look at compact products, really small stuff, it's improved, but still way off the peak. So we have a lot of capacity there. So it just really depends a lot on the product. I know that sounds like a bit of a non-answer, but it's just not -- we're not like a refinery, it's not uniform capacity."

In terms of going from sort of middle of this year's guidance $41.5 billion, something approaching $50 billion, the point that we made earlier, we're already -- our second half of the year is operating at around $46 billion. We have announced capacity increases that should help next year. We talked about being able to produce more excavators in China, more mining product, for example, so some of the things that we did announce earlier this year should help next year and we are currently doing better than the full year average. So the -- as was brought up earlier, the increase isn't maybe as dramatic as looking at $50 billion versus $41.5 billion. In terms of employment, even there, and again, I'm sorry if this sounds like a non-answer, but when you're looking at the production capability of employment, you got to look at not only our full times, we have a very large flexible workforce that we had actually going into the last downturn, which really allowed us to shed costs quickly. So you really have to add that to the employment number. There are also things like overtime that impact your kind of productive capacity out of people. So it in of itself is also not a perfect indicator. What I would tell you is, and we've said this a couple of times today, our labor productivity has improved a lot this year and that's been very good. We expected that from CPS and frankly, we would expect improvements to continue."

From an engine standpoint, it would affect also product in those kind of size ranges in the U.S. and Europe, except for emergency power or backup power and emergency and backup power is most of what we do. So you're right to say that a lot of the product will be affected in the year and the larger product in the U.S., in Europe, but you won't see it all change on January 1. You have the ability to take some flex credits and delay some of the introductions. So I think it's probably going to be a little bit less of a giant January 1 shotgun start. It'll be more of a phase in I think as you go through the year. And to your point, it doesn't affect all our service related businesses. It doesn't affect most of our engine business, it doesn't affect small machines, it doesn't affect Latin America or Asia or Middle East or the CIS.

In addition, we'll be discussing forward-looking information today that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion of some of the factors that individually or in the aggregate, we believe could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found in our cautionary statements under Item 1A - Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC back on February 19, and our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on May 3, 2010. And it's also on our forward-looking statements language contained in today's release. 
Okay, earlier this morning, we reported results for the third quarter. We increased our full year outlook for 2010 and we provided a preliminary outlook for 2011 sales and revenues. To start this morning, I'll summarize the quarter and the outlook, then Doug and Ed and I will take your questions.
Let's start with the third quarter top line. Sales and revenues were $11,134,000,000 and that's up from $7,298,000,000 in the third quarter of 2009. And that's an increase of about $3.8 billion or 53%. Now that includes about two months of sales at Electro-Motive Diesel and we'll be referring to that as EMD here today, which we acquired in the third quarter and added about $216 million in sales for the quarter. Excluding EMD, sales and revenues were up about 50%.
The increase in sales was primarily a result of improving end-user demand and the absence of 2009's dealer-machine inventory reductions, and I'll cover both of those this morning. First, in terms of end-user demand, good economic growth in the developing world has been positive for sales in Asia, Latin America, the CIS, and Africa/Middle East. In addition, the growth in those developing countries have improved demand for commodities and that's been good and positive for our Mining business worldwide. 
In addition, we are seeing growth in the developed countries of North America and Europe, albeit off depressed levels from 2009. With weak economic recoveries in the U.S. and Europe and with depressed construction activity, I know it's tough to understand why sales of CAT machines are up so much. And new machine sales in the United States are a good example that illustrates the point. Here's what's happening. First, sales to users peaked in 2006, then declined in 2007, declined again in 2008 and then declined even more significantly in 2009. From the peak quarter in 2006 to the bottom in late 2009, dealer-machine sales to end users in the U.S. declined nearly 80%. Today, we're seeing improvement from those low levels as customers are buying some machines to slow the aging of their fleets. In addition, dealers have increased machine purchases for rental fleets. That said, rental fleets size hasn't improved much, the average age of dealer rental fleets haven't improved and it remains elevated. And rental inventory utilization rates have increased and are now higher than in 2007, 2008 and 2009.
In addition to better end-user demand, dealer inventory changes also affected the sales comparison with the third quarter of 2009. Last year, dealers reduced new machine inventories by about $1.1 billion in the third quarter. So far in 2010, dealers have held the machine inventories relatively flat. They were actually up about $100 million so far this year and that was in the third quarter.
Speaking of inventory levels, though, we frequently hear comments and get questions about dealer restocking. And just to be clear, other than the very small increase this quarter, that's not happened. Overall, dealer-machine inventories are within a few percent of the year end 2009 levels.
Dealer-machine inventories in terms of months of supply continued to decline and are below historic averages. That's a good thing, and it's in keeping with our Lane strategy that includes Caterpillar holding finished inventory and regional distribution centers to serve our dealers and customers. That said, dealer inventories are very tight in many parts of the world and dealers will probably need to add some inventory next year.
In summary on the topline, sales and revenues were up in all regions. North America was up 55%, Latin America, 95%; Europe, Africa/Middle East, 31%; and Asia/Pacific was up 51%.
Okay, let's turn to profit. Profit in the quarter was $792 million and that was a 96% increase from $404 million in the third quarter of 2009. Profit per share was $1.22, and that was up $0.58 from the $0.64 a share we earned in the third quarter last year. Consolidated operating profit rose from $277 million in the third quarter last year to $1,187,000,000 in the third quarter of 2010, and that's a 329% increase in operating profit. As a percent of sales, and this is on a consolidated basis, operating profit was 10.7% and that was up from 3.8% a year ago. In addition, Machinery and Engines gross margin continued to improve and was 25.8% in the quarter.
The increase in sales volume was the most significant factor driving the improvement in profit. That said, that positive impact was mitigated somewhat by a very negative sales mix compared with the third quarter of 2009. In addition to the higher volume, price realization improved and was favorable to profit, $262 million. Manufacturing costs were favorable by $142 million. And if you exclude the $120 million of LIFO inventory decrement benefits that we realized in the third quarter last year, the cost improvement was $262 million. And that was a result of better labor and overhead efficiency, lower warranty costs and favorable material costs. Just one point on the material costs, while we've been favorable compared with 2009 in every quarter this year, the degree to which material costs were favorable has been declining as material costs have been trending up.
Okay, partially offsetting those positive items in terms of profit, income taxes were very unfavorable. In the third quarter of 2009, income taxes actually benefited profit $139 million, of which $129 million was related to the settlement of tax returns for years prior to 2009. The third quarter of 2010 reflects tax expense at an estimated annual effective tax rate of 28%, less $14 million from a year-to-date adjustment and that was related to moving the estimated rate from 29% down to 28% in the quarter. SG&A and R&D costs were also higher and that was primarily due to provisions for employee incentive compensation and increased R&D spending, primarily related to U.S. and European emissions regulations that applied beginning in 2011.
Overall, currency impacts were also negative. The impact on currency in operating profit was a negative $46 million. And currency was the principal reason that other income, which is below the operating profit line, declined $65 million from the third quarter of 2009. Before I move on to the full year outlook, I'd like to cover employee incentive compensation in just a little more depth.
As you may be aware, a portion of the compensation for management, support and some of our hourly employees is at risk and it varies based on the financial performance of the company. Given the economic environment in 2009, the profit target related to our short-term incentive plan was aggressive and it did not trigger. And as a result, there was no incentive-related expense in 2009. Financial performance in 2010 has been much better. And based on the newly revised and higher profit outlook for 2010, we expect incentive compensation to be higher. Our practice is to accrue the expense as we go through the year based on our full year expectations. That means when we changed the outlook, we had a year-to-date catch-up in the provision and that happened this quarter. The outlook we provided with our second quarter release included $600 million in incentive compensation; $300 million of that was in the first half and we had an expectation of about $150 million in each of the third and fourth quarters.
Because we raised the outlook in the third quarter, the full-year estimate for incentive compensation rose from $600 million to $700 million, an increase of $100 million from our prior estimate. Since we are three quarters of the way through the year, we've provided for three quarters of the change in the full year estimate in the third quarter. As a result, we provided for about $225 million of incentive compensation in the quarter, compared with $150 million that was in our previous outlook. The punchline here is, incentive compensation expense was probably higher than you would have expected. It was higher than our previous outlook and that's because we took guidance up and needed to reflect the change in the third quarter.
One last thing before I move on to the outlook and that's incremental profit. For machines and engines sales were up $3,869,000,000 and operating profit was up $900 million. That's a 23% incremental margin rate. However, our results in the third quarter of 2010 included the acquisition of EMD. And the third quarter of last year included $120 million of LIFO decrement benefits. Excluding those two items, incremental profit was about 27%, and that by the way, does include the negative impacts of product mix, the $225 million in incentive compensation and the negative currency impacts. So all in all, it was a pretty good quarter operationally.
Okay, let's move on to the outlook. This morning, we raised 2010 guidance for sales and revenues and for profit. Our previous outlook range for sales and revenues was $39 billion to $42 billion, with a midpoint of $40.5 billion. The outlook we provided this morning is a range of $41 billion to $42 billion, with the midpoint of $41.5 billion. So at the midpoint of the range, sales and revenues are up about $1 billion for the year and about half of that improvement is related to the acquisition of EMD, again, which we completed in August.
We also raised the profit outlook this morning. We're expecting profits per share in the range of $3.80 to $4 a share, with a midpoint of $3.90. That's up from the previous outlook range of $3.15 to $3.85, with a $3.50 midpoint. While EMD is having a positive impact on sales, for the remainder of this year it's not expected to have much impact on profit. In addition to the 2010 outlook, we provided a preliminary top line look at 2011 and we expect sales and revenues to approach $50 billion next year.
That would reflect our current run rate for the second half of the year, which is about $46 billion, plus the full year impact of the acquisition of EMD, continued improvement in end-user demand, including some additions to the new rental fleets, some dealer-machine inventory additions and modest price realization. This morning, we did not provide profit guidance and we don't plan to do that in the call today. As usual, we're in the part of our planning process where we start with sales and we're working on our profit plan for next year. That's been the case for the last couple of years and that's where we are this year.
Okay, that's the outlook. In summary, the third quarter reflected continuing improvement in our financial results. We raised the sales and profit outlook for 2010 and provided a first look at 2011 sales and revenues, that approaches $50 billion. With that, we're ready to take your questions.

In terms of the first part of your question, if you look at the sales increase next year, we still have a pretty weak recovery going in the developed world. I mean, it's improving but those percentage increases are off pretty low levels. Also, I would say most of the increase next year is more heavily skewed to machines. Engines have been a little bit later cycle. Oil and gas had been good, but it's slowed down. You can see our retail statistics for today, oil and gas has flattened out. The engine increase over the last few months even versus last year is up 5%. Marine is continuing on the downside. So I think most of the increase next year is going to be probably related to machines, and again, we have modest economic growth built in to the U.S.

Again, that said, it did go up about $100 million in the third quarter. The months of supply is pretty weak. So I think there's no doubt that it's going to go up it's just I think to what degree.

I saw the statistics over the last couple of days where our performance has gone -- of the amount that we've missed, the performance has gone down by about 3/4 in terms of missing builds. So working with the supply chain, all the discipline around standard work has helped a lot in meeting production schedules and that helps efficiency. Lane strategy has helped as well. We're producing a higher percentage of what we're doing are more standard products, which helps efficiency. So I think it's not just one thing, it's a combination of all the work on the supply chain, the standard work in the factory, Lane strategy, all kind of working together, to simplify.

As you know, we started out the year with an outlook of machine - of price realization being up less than a point. Then at the end of the second quarter, we said about 1%, and it's been more than that all year long. Effectively, the merchandising programs required to sell the product, I mean, of all kinds, have been less than we thought. We've not taken any price increases per se.

I can tell you that our approaching $50 billion next year does not have us back to '08 volume levels for kind of machine units. Remember, it has things like EMD in it, so it's not the same. Also, if you go back to the $51 billion that we had in '08, we only had Cat in Japan in for a quarter that year. So kind of the real underlying number with the companies that we have now was higher. So we're not back to that '08 level yet. We don't expect in this preliminary outlook this morning to be back to that '08 machine level in 2008 as yet. So with not giving any numbers on dealer inventory, but I would certainly think that we're not going to be back to the '08 volumes, plus we have Lane so we're not looking for that magnitude of an increase.

And I think, Doug, when you took over the range, you've ended up announcing a lot of capacity and I kind of wondered how much of that was just pure growth above that $50 billion level versus you weren't completely comfortable with the capacity you had put in from '06 to '08. So that's my first question, whether you feel like you can get to the $50 billion with what you've got.

Capacity, unfortunately, is not fungible. It kind of depends upon what product you're selling. If you look at big engines, for example, right now, out of Lafayette, it improved a lot since the depth of the recession. But as we talked about earlier, and if you look in today's retail sales, oil and gas is flattened out. So for products like that, we probably have a lot more capacity than we would need for next year. For mining product, on the other hand, we'll be capacity constrained probably throughout 2011. I mean, business there is very good to the point that you made earlier, we are investing in capacity increases. We talked about that for mining trucks in India and mining trucks in the U.S. We talked about investing in shovels, although that's not from a sales standpoint next year. So I think the answer is, we wouldn't have put out a guidance for next year approaching $50 billion and sort of a summary answer, we wouldn't have said that if we didn't think we could make it, number one; and number 2, how much capacity we have and how much more we can do, I think, it really depends a lot on what we're actually selling. There are a lot of products right now where volumes are still very depressed. You look at compact products, really small stuff, it's improved, but still way off the peak. So we have a lot of capacity there. So it just really depends a lot on the product. I know that sounds like a bit of a non-answer, but it's just not -- we're not like a refinery, it's not uniform capacity.

In terms of going from sort of middle of this year's guidance $41.5 billion, something approaching $50 billion, the point that we made earlier, we're already -- our second half of the year is operating at around $46 billion. We have announced capacity increases that should help next year. We talked about being able to produce more excavators in China, more mining product, for example, so some of the things that we did announce earlier this year should help next year and we are currently doing better than the full year average. So the -- as was brought up earlier, the increase isn't maybe as dramatic as looking at $50 billion versus $41.5 billion. In terms of employment, even there, and again, I'm sorry if this sounds like a non-answer, but when you're looking at the production capability of employment, you got to look at not only our full times, we have a very large flexible workforce that we had actually going into the last downturn, which really allowed us to shed costs quickly. So you really have to add that to the employment number. There are also things like overtime that impact your kind of productive capacity out of people. So it in of itself is also not a perfect indicator. What I would tell you is, and we've said this a couple of times today, our labor productivity has improved a lot this year and that's been very good. We expected that from CPS and frankly, we would expect improvements to continue.

Can you talk about the impact of what can we expect to see over the next year and the year after?

We do have a Q&A in the back of our release that talks a little bit more about Tier 4. But essentially, it's in the U.S. Tier 4, Europe Stage IIIB; it's for product for the most part in those regions above 165-horsepower this year, below 165-horsepower in 2012. So you're right, a lot of the product, particularly the smaller product's not going to be affected this year, it will be next year. From an engine standpoint, it would affect also product in those kind of size ranges in the U.S. and Europe, except for emergency power or backup power and emergency and backup power is most of what we do. So you're right to say that a lot of the product will be affected in the year and the larger product in the U.S., in Europe, but you won't see it all change on January 1. You have the ability to take some flex credits and delay some of the introductions. So I think it's probably going to be a little bit less of a giant January 1 shotgun start. It'll be more of a phase in I think as you go through the year. And to your point, it doesn't affect all our service related businesses. It doesn't affect most of our engine business, it doesn't affect small machines, it doesn't affect Latin America or Asia or Middle East or the CIS. So it is probably a bit more of a muted impact from the total company than most people might think.

Some of that's driven by the fact that availability has moved out, as we've seen the strong increase in demand. I think the other factor that's really out there is a certain degree especially in the U.S. of uncertainty amongst our customer base. We still don't have a highway bill. We still got uncertainty in terms of where we're going with tax legislation, and as you know a lot of these are small businesses. And so we really haven't had any, what I would consider, noticeable pre-buy on Tier 4 either.

As you look for leading indicators on new equipment demand, you look at rental fleet utilization, you look at used equipment prices. You can look at service parts business and actually all of those indicators right now look pretty positive. Again, we don't have a spare parts business per se. Parts are integral to each of our businesses, but certainly, demand has been very good this year. Used equipment prices have gone up and rental utilization has gone up. So that should actually be a very positive forward-looking group of indicators.

But particularly in China, we've been capacity constrained and that's one of the reasons why we announced fairly large capacity expansions, really starting in next year for China excavators because we think, if we can produce more, we can sell more. So I would say, particularly in that part of the business, we don't have the capacity all online yet so that will take a little bit more. Our business model is really based on field population, and field population is based on the strength of the industry and the share that we get. So it's a big deal to us to your point, we're really focused on it. Where we need to add capacity, we're trying to do that so yes, I'd say it's a big deal. But I won't quote numbers.

I don't know if maybe if you wouldn't even agree with that, but are we still sticking with our 2012 goals?

And I think the $50 billion, approaching $50 billion is a good step in that direction. And I think it really gets back to one of the earlier discussions some of the tailwinds that may be out there. While we have seen some good growth in the developed parts of the world, as you know, they are still way off the peaks. We talked earlier about rental inventory being down, dealer inventory being well below historical levels, engine business kind of a later cycle hasn't really started to pick up recently. So as I look out to that 2012 timeline and the goal that we established, I think there's still -- the underlying principles and fundamentals are still there.

We went over with everyone in some detail in August, 2012 numbers and how we constructed the path to get there. That's still our plan. We're still expecting that on out and beyond and as we talked about in August, and there's no change to that. If you look at the economic GDP growth next year, which is anemic worldwide, and maybe a little bit more anemic than we said in August, I view that as upside because the world cannot grow very long at these low rates, it's just untenable; something will happen at some point and it will go and pickup and that's ahead of us and turns into a tailwind. But we are absolutely still on the ballpark from what we said in August. And just while I've got the floor, I'm going to may be just comment a bit. Ed Rapp, of course is our new CFO in the executive office, and he's doing a great job. You may not see me on every one of these calls because he and Mike are doing so well, so before I get too far on that and I`m not here, it`s not because I don't want to be.
