As we detailed in this morning’s release, Reynolds American continued to exhibit strength and resilience in 2009, despite many economic and industry challenges. Our operating companies continued to demonstrate momentum, with volume and share gains on key brands and additional improvements in productivity.
Our earnings were down last year, driven by the negative impact of a significant increase in pension expense. Nonetheless, our strong underlying performance clearly shows that the fundamental strategies and strengths of RAI and its operating companies continue to serve us well. To understand where we are today, let’s look back at where we were, this time last year.
On the economic front, we started the year in a deep recession, with high unemployment that depressed consumer spending and specific to the Tobacco industry, we saw unprecedented increases in federal tobacco excise taxes, which led to the retail price of a pack of cigarettes increasing by about 25%.
In addition, the moist-snuff category underwent major changes. The acquisition of Conwood’s largest competitor resulted in significant price reductions on premium moist-snuff. There were also substantial increases in the competitive promotional levels for both premium and value priced products. In addition, the industry entered a new environment, and FDA regulation of Tobacco products has added complexity to our company’s operations.
Despite these challenges, RAI continued to return value to shareholders in 2009. We increased our dividend by 6%, and delivered a total shareholder return of 43%, far outpacing the S&P 500. Given the proven strength of RAI’s business model, our company’s key brands, and ongoing efforts to enhance productivity, we expect earnings growth to return to the mid-single digits in 2010.
Let’s take a closer look at some of the year’s highlights. R.J. Reynolds strengthened growth brand performance with Camels’ continued evolution into a total tobacco brand and Pall Mall becoming the fourth largest cigarette brand in the nation. The company also continued to improve productivity and strengthen margins.
However, adjusted operating income declined due to higher pension expense. Conwood again delivered outstanding performance in what was among the most challenging years it has ever faced. The company posted strong gains in moist-snuff volume and share with Grizzly enhancing its equity and increasing its lead as the number one moist-snuff brand and Santa Fe continue to deliver great results last year with double-digit volume growth in the super-premium segment, and the largest gain in cigarette share in the company’s history.
Also during 2009, RAI entered a new product category with the acquisition of Niconovum AB. Nicotine-Replacement therapy products are a small category with good potential for future growth. These products also align with public health objectives. Like RAI’s other companies, Niconovum strength is in its superior technology and innovative products that will offer more you appeal to consumers than existing products.
Over time Niconovum plans to expand its product line and enter additional markets. At Conwood, the company announced that its name would change to American Snuff Company at the beginning of this year. This returns the company to the name it started with in 1900, reinforcing American Snuff Rich Tobacco Heritage and its commitment to delivering the highest quality tobacco products to adult tobacco users.
Finally I would like to note that RAI again received independent recognition for its sustainability and responsibility initiatives. The company was awarded membership in the Dow Jones Sustainability North American index, for the second year running and RAI was ranked in the top half of the company’s featured in Newsweek’s first Annual Green Rankings. So those are some of the ways that RAI and its operating companies demonstrated strength and resilience in 2009.
Before I discuss our business performance in more detail, I’ll provide a brief update on the external front. RAI and its operating companies are making good progress to ensure compliance with the new FDA regulations. While we await additional details from the agency, we are prepared to compete effectively as new requirements take effect over the next several years.
As you know, R.J. Reynolds, Conwood and others sued the government over certain provisions of the new regulation on issues surrounding free speech. The judge in the case has since ruled that the ban on the use of color and graphics in marketing is unconstitutional. On the MPM adjustment, we currently have a total of $2 billion in dispute, covering 2003 through 2006. The arbitration process to resolve the dispute over R.J. Reynolds 2003 MSA payment is still underway.
So, now let’s take a more detailed look at our operating company’s performance for 2009. Although increased pension expense weighed on R.J. Reynolds earnings for the year, the company delivered strong underlying results. R.J. Reynolds increased its overall growth brand share, improved its cigarette volume performance and continued to improve productivity. The company’s total cigarette share has been relatively stable for the past two years, at just over 28%.
Contributing to that were additional combined gains on growth brands, which now represent almost half of the company’s total cigarette market share. During the year, R.J. Reynolds moderated its volume decline, bringing it inline with the industry rate. They achieved this even as the company eliminated a significant number of its non-core styles, and many low margin private label brands.
Camel, the company’s flagship brand, improved its marketplace position as a total tobacco brand with stable share in cigarettes, and gains in modern smoke free products. Camel continued its focus on building the brand’s core cigarette styles, discontinuing five additional non-core styles, without adding any new line extensions last year. Even so, Camel delivered steady share, significantly outpacing the overall share performance of the industry’s premium segment.
Camel Crush, the brand’s most recent cigarette innovation, performed well in its first full year, with relatively low levels of promotional support. Crush gives adult smokers the unique choice of regular or menthol with each cigarette. R.J. Reynolds focus on Camel in the menthol category increased the brand’s total menthol share, in this growing segment in 2009, and the company expects further growth from the recent expansion of its innovative capsule technology to Camel’s two core menthol styles and next month the company will add exciting new packaging to further raise awareness and competitive trial on these menthol styles.
Camel’s focus on strengthening its core cigarette business is a key part of the company’s strategy to grow Camel as a total tobacco brand. The strategy includes broadening the brand, to offer innovative modern smoke-free products like Camel Snus and Dissolvables as well as Conwood’s Camel Dip.
Camel’s first smoke-free innovation, Camel Snus was launched nationally early last year and it’s already contributing to Camel’s total tobacco share. Camel Snus significantly outsells competitive products in the markets where they compete. However, because this is a new category in the U.S., consumer education is a key to building awareness and trial, and this takes time.
Camel’s latest smoke-free innovation, Camel Dissolvables entered three lead markets this year and R.J. Reynolds is gaining valuable insights that are being incorporated to improve both the product and the packaging design. Camel Orbs, Sticks and Strips are made of finely-milled tobacco, that completely dissolved in the mouth and they offer adult consumers the most convenient way to enjoy tobacco today.
Turning to Pall Mall, R.J. Reynolds’ other growth brand. Pall Mall delivered outstanding growth in 2009, with strong gains in both volume and share. Like many other value brands, Pall Mall sells for an affordable price, but it differentiates itself by offering a high quality, longer lasting cigarette.
Because of that difference, Pall Mall retains about half of the adult smokers, who give it a try and Pall Mall’s promotional strategy has generated significant awareness and trial for the brand. Weakness in the economy also drove an increasing number of adult consumers to seek greater value in the products they buy, and this benefited Pall Mall.
Also during 2009, R.J. Reynolds continued to reap the benefits of its tight focus on productivity, cutting additional non-focus styles, eliminating non-essential activities, and outsourcing non-core business activities. In addition, the company streamlined its workforce to keep staffing and cost inline with business needs. These productivity initiatives helped R.J. Reynolds again increase its full year adjusted operating margin. R.J. Reynolds added strength in 2009, and I’m very pleased with its performance in a very challenging year.
Turning to Conwood, Conwood has delivered outstanding performance, since RAI acquired the company in 2006 and its performance in 2009 was no different. The company posted strong gains in moist-snuff volume and share, despite a very difficult environment.
The moist-snuff category saw major changes last year, with significant increases in both federal and state excise taxes. In addition, Conwood’s largest competitor significantly reduced the price of its premium products. Conwood’s competitors also heightened promotional spending on their premium and value price products. Even so, Conwood delivered impressive results, with Grizzly driving strong gains in moist-snuff volume and share. The company now commands almost 30% of the moist-snuff market.
While Conwood’s adjusted operating income was down for the year, this decline was primarily driven by lower margins on the company’s premium Kodiak brand. Conwood reduced the brand’s price in the second quarter to bring it inline with competitive premium brands. It’s also important to note that Conwood increased its adjusted operating margin for the year, as it benefited from higher volume and a price increase on Grizzly, as well as higher pricing on its other products.
Grizzly delivered exceptional performance in 2009, capturing almost 70% of total moist-snuff growth. Despite intense pricing and promotional pressures, the brand further enhanced its position as the nation’s leading and fastest growing moist-snuff brand, with a full year’s share of more than 25%.
Grizzly also strengthened its position in the growing pouch segment, which it entered in 2008. At the end of last year, Grizzly had introduced four successful pouch styles and Grizzly Wintergreen pouches became the category’s number one pouch style. In less than two years, Grizzly has gained almost 20% of the total pouch segment.
Conwood is focused on adding even more value and equity to the Grizzly brand, with embossed metal lids being introduced this month. The brand is also introducing Grizzly 1900 Long Cut, a natural product with a traditional cut that will broaden Grizzly’s appeal amongst moist-snuff consumers.
Conwood is also enhancing its strength in the premium moist-snuff segment. Reducing Kodiak’s price last year has helped to improve the brand’s performance and stabilize its share and Kodiak is now upgrading its image with new packaging that also features metal lids. Camel Dip, Conwood’s latest premium introduction, features product and packaging innovations. The brand is generated very encouraging consumer response since its mid year introduction into two week markets.
Camel Dip is being expanded to 10 additional states this month, along with the launch of the brand’s third style, Camel Wintergreen pouches. Given Conwood’s continued strength last year, I am confident that the company’s focus on building volume, share, brand equity and profitability positions them well for 2010. So that’s a look at Reynolds American’s many accomplishments in 2009, despite, an especially challenging year for both the industry and the economy.
Now, Tom will provide you some more details.

As you’ve heard today, RAI and its operating companies improved their underlying performance in many key areas in 2009. During my discussion, I’ll focus on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business. Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release, which is on our website.
First, I’d like to remind you, that our full year earnings include $189 million in higher year-over-year pension expense. Primarily at R.J. Reynolds, that comes to $0.10 per share for the fourth quarter and $0.40 per share for the full year. This additional cost drove a negative earnings comparison in 2009.
Let’s look in more detail at RAI’s results, starting with the fourth quarter. Reported EPS of $0.74 was down 15.9% from the prior year. This includes $0.36 in restructuring charges and cigarette trademark impairments at R.J. Reynolds.
On an adjusted basis, excluding restructuring and trademark impairment charges, fourth quarter EPS of $1.10 was down 13.4% from the prior year period. That was primarily due to increased pension expense as well as a decline in Conwood’s earnings due to lower premium margins and higher promotional expense.
Full year reported EPS was $3.30, down 27.6% from the prior year. This decline was primarily the result of net increase of $0.47 in restructuring and non-cash trademark impairment charges, as well as a prior year gain of $0.71 from the Gallaher joint venture termination.
On an adjusted basis, excluding restructuring and trademark impairment charges and the JV gain, full year EMS of $4.64 was at the midpoint of our guidance range of $4.60 to $4.70. Adjusted EPS was down 3.1% from the prior year, driven by higher pension expense.
Now, turning to R.J. Reynolds, in the fourth quarter, higher pricing and productivity were largely offset by lower cigarette volume. The company’s fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $487 million was down 9.8%, primarily driven by higher pension costs. For the full year, the benefit of higher pricing and productivity and lower promotion expense more than offset the impact of lower cigarette volume.
However, full year adjusted operating income of $2,034,000,000 was down 1.4%, again, driven by higher pension expense. R.J. Reynolds’ productivity initiatives contributed to a 1.1 percentage point increase in its adjusted operating margin. Full year adjusted operating margin was 27.7%. Cost savings from restructurings in 2008 and 2009 will grow to about $60 million this year, building to an annual savings of $75 million in 2011.
Now turning to volume, R.J. Reynolds’ total cigarette volume declined 8.7% last year, compared with the industry decline of 8.6%, a marked improvement from the company’s historical trend. With respect to cigarette market share, R.J. Reynolds’ full year share was essentially flat at 28.3%, as overall growth brand gains largely offset declines in support and non-support brands. R.J. Reynolds total market share has been relatively stable over the past two years, and 2009 performance was its best since the merger with Brown & Williamson in 2004. 
The company’s growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, delivered a combined full year cigarette share of 12.3%, up 1.9 share points from the prior year. This improved performance was driven by strong growth in Pall Mall. Camel cigarette market share for the full year was 7.5%, down one-tenth of a share point. However, Camel’s total tobacco market share grew to 7.8%, as cigarette equivalent share of 0.3% from Camel Snus more than offset the slight decline in Camel cigarettes.
Turning to Pall Mall, Pall Mall grew 2.1 share points to 4.8% in 2009, as the brand continued to retain roughly half of the volume it gained from its promotions. So those are the R.J. Reynolds key results.
Now, turning to Conwood, Conwood’s fourth quarter operating income was $83 million, down 16%. Grizzly’s volume and pricing gains were more than offset by lower margins on Kodiak, as well as support for the introduction of Grizzly Snuff Pouches, and increased promotional spending in several states. For the full year, Conwood’s adjusted operating income, excluding trademark impairments, was $352 million, down 6%, primarily due to lower premium moist-snuff margins. The company’s full year adjusted operating margin increased half a point to 52.3% from the prior year.
Turning to moist-snuff volume and share, Conwood’s total shipment volume grew 6.4% for the year, well ahead of the industry’s growth of 4.4%. Grizzly’s full year volume increased 8.9% despite significant pricing pressure from both premium and value brands and the brand also posted a strong share gain of two share points, bringing Grizzly’s share to 25.3% for the full year. Conwood’s total share was up 1.8 share points at 29.4%. So that’s a quick look at the considerable progress that R.J. Reynolds and Conwood made in 2009.
Now some additional details on RAI, Reynolds American maintained a strong balance sheet in 2009, ending the year with cash balances of $2.7 billion and that was after contributing $300 million to the pension plan, repaying debt of $200 million, and acquiring Niconovum for $43 million. Like many companies, our pension assets were negatively impacted by the market turmoil in 2008.
In addition to last year’s contribution to the pension plan, we added an additional $300 million in January of this year. These contributions, together with the return of almost 25% last year, have significantly increased the plan’s funded position. I would point out that our pension expense projections for this year are inline with 2009. Other uses of cash this year include repayment of debt and capital spending for the expansion of Conwood’s production facilities, to keep pace with growing demand and these new facilities will be FDA compliant.
With respect to our dividend, RAI increased its quarterly dividend by $0.05 per share to $0.90 or $3.60 on an annualized basis. This reaffirms our confidence in the business, and our commitment to our shareholders. The increase is also inline with RAI’s policy of returning about 75% of net income to its shareholders in the form of dividends. So looking ahead, we expect our operating companies to build additional strength this year, which supports our return to mid single-digit earnings per share growth in a range of $4.80 to $5. Thank you.
We’ll now turn to the Q-and-A portion of the call. Jennifer, would you please remind our callers how to get in the queue?

So I would say we remain very focused on Camel, and expanding Camel as a total tobacco brand. It has a strong demographic profile and we haven’t taken the pedal off of Camel in anyway.
With Pall Mall, I believe that we have said also for five years that having a strong value brand in the mix was appropriate in an industry and an environment at a point in time and if we think about what happened last year, the economy is in a significant recession, unemployment levels are still rising, and cigarette smokers experienced a 25% increase in their daily expenditures. Pall Mall differentiates itself in the value space.
As I said in my remarks, it is a high quality, longer lasting cigarette and we believe that growing Pall Mall, we saw the non-big three last year grow about six-tenths of the share point. “What would that sector have grown had Pall Mall not been in the arena?” Because consumers are clearly interested in honest value, despite that, R.J. Reynolds grew its operating margin year-over-year. We believe that our productivity will continue to deliver results in that operating margin area, and Pall Mall has been successful and we believe it still has more runways.

Grizzly I think performed very, very well. Our current view is that Grizzly is currently donating much less than half of its fair share to trial of Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen, but it’s very early days. I believe Grizzly’s product is superior. I believe its equity is exceptionally strong and I think it demonstrated that last year.
We are investing in that equity by upgrading the packaging for Grizzly as we speak, and we believe it has a very loyal franchise. So I think we’ll continue to see growth on Grizzly, and certainly Grizzly gets caught in the fray as any brand of 25 shares will, when there’s extensive competitive activity.

Now that’s changed, at least for a period of time. Presumably both because of your success with Pall Mall and the economy, and I’m just curious if you stepped back from what’s happening today, do you think that the premium category has reached a tipping point in the United States?
Do you think the discount segment, even as the economy improves, will be flat to up from here? Tied into that with higher cigarette prices, do you think that relative pricing gaps are becoming less important in consumers’ choice, that you need a now or relative pricing gap today to get someone to smoke a premium brand than may have been the case in the past?

Haven’t seen that in recent years, when the economy’s been booming, but it certainly can’t be surprising. I mean, we’ve had a very large premium segment here and with 25% price increases in a recession and growing unemployment, it’s not surprising that consumers desire honest value across all of their disposable income purchases.
It gets harder and harder to determine, what is a value brand? What is a premium brand? The segments are blurring. There is an awful lot of promotional activity in many of the premium brands and then of course there is the value brand segment, an everyday value like Pall Mall and then there’s the non-big three. So, I think that we have to see what happens as the economy improves, do consumers trade back up or do taxes and prices keep them searching for honest value.
I feel that our strategies in a good place, Pall Mall’s time is now and we will see that play out, but, I think the premium segment will always be very, very large, but I do believe consumers do have price points of which they won’t go beyond and as long as they’re under pressure economically, that we’re unlikely to see up trading in the near term.
Having said that, we look at Santa Fe this year who had double-digit volume growth in the super-premium segment because obviously the economy does not affect all people equally, but I think we have to watch this unfold for a while. We’ve not even lapped that tax increase.

I think on the overall cigarette share at Reynolds, that really we have seen stability over the last now seven quarters or whatever it is, and I feel very good that those lines have crossed and that we have met our objectives in terms of trying to stabilize a bit that support sector and then continue to grow the growth brands. When we look at Camel & Camel’s performance last year, I mentioned a little bit of this in my remarks, but we de-listed in the last two years 14 SKUs on Camel and we did that for strategic reasons.
We wanted to make the offer clearer to the consumer. We wanted to de-list some of the marginal styles and focus on its core. We’ve also significantly pulled back on the number of line extensions and of course that can show a pipeline and that can show growth in shipments that may or may not be real overtime.
Camel, with Crush being its really most recent innovation, we’re focused on relevant differentiation. Seven-tenths of a share point in a style, we feel very good about. We feel good that Camel gained a tenth of a share point in the premium segment and we feel good we reduced the promotion levels on Camel last year actually.
So when you take that and add to it, three times of a share equivalent from Camel Snus, we feel that Camel is progressing very well and its demographic profile remains very strong. So we will obviously, continue to invest in Camel to continue to watch those markers looking at Camel as a total tobacco brand, but we are happy with Camel’s performance.

399584,102271139,57562,"Reynolds American Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-22-2010",2010-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. As our results showed today, the continued strength of our operating company strategy and brand delivered higher first quarter earnings and total cigarette market share compared with the prior-year quarter. This represents a good s",1492,"Good morning, everyone. As our results showed today, the continued strength of our operating company strategy and brand delivered higher first quarter earnings and total cigarette market share compared with the prior-year quarter. This represents a good start to the year, especially considering that our company has achieved these results in a very challenging, competitive and economic environment.
The first quarter was marked by heightened competitive promotional activity and product introductions in both the cigarette and moist-snuff categories. And consumer spending patterns continue to be affected by higher tobacco taxes and the weak economy.
In addition, comparisons to last year's quarter were influenced by a number of factors. First, there was an unusually low cigarette and moist-snuff volume in the prior-year quarter. That was due to trade inventory reductions ahead of the unprecedented increases in federal tobacco excise taxes. In addition, during the past year, there have been significant shift in pricing and promotion strategy, especially in the moist-snuff category.
Even so, our company's focus on executing their strategy again delivered solid performance. Both of our reportable operating segments continued to impost important gains. R.J. Reynolds increased operating income and total cigarette market share. And American Snuff delivered double-digit moist-snuff volume growth and higher margins. I'm also pleased to report that our Santa Fe subsidiary posted double-digit volume and earnings growth in the quarter.
Before I provide more detail on our company's performance, I'd like to briefly comment on a few items. As we noted today, R.J. Reynolds and American Snuff are moving to a single field trade-marketing organization. R.J. Reynolds trade-marketing will be expanded to provide services to American Snuff.
Our companies have been evaluating this opportunity since last year, and we're excited by the many efficiencies and enhancements that this change offers. These include greater efficiency and speed to market, stronger support for the retail trade and enhanced retail presence for both companies' brands.
Both companies have worked hard to ensure smooth transition and to retain the extensive knowledge and skills of their current sales teams. To that end, we anticipate that nearly all of American Snuff field trade-marketing employees will be offered positions at R.J. Reynolds. This will enhance the new sales team's depth of expertise in both cigarette and moist-snuff categories. We expect the change to be essentially completed by the end of the third quarter.
Concerning the Canadian government settlement, as announced this month, R.J. Reynolds and its affiliate, Northern Brands International, have resolved civil claims and criminal charges related to cigarette smuggling in Canada in the 1980s and '90s. These settlements eliminate the uncertainties, expense and distraction that were associated with those claims.
On the regulatory front, RAI's operating companies continue to move forward in meeting their requirements under the new regulatory structure administered by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Our companies are well prepared to comply with the new federal regulations for successfully competing in this new environment.
Now let's take a closer look at the first quarter performance.
R.J. Reynolds' improvement in financial and marketplace results demonstrate the strength of the company's business strategy, product offerings and productivity initiative in a tough environment. R.J. Reynolds continues to benefit from its productivity initiative, including the reduction in its operation workforce that was announced in December. These initiatives keep the company's cost structure in line with its business needs. 
R.J. Reynolds total cigarette market share also increased in the first quarter as Pall Mall continued to post strong share gains. I'd like to point out that even as the company has discontinued many of its non-core cigarette styles, gains in growth brands have kept the company's overall share performance stable for the past two years.
R.J. Reynolds again delivered volume and performance in line with the industry. And it's important to note that most of the company's first quarter volume decline came from its low margin private-label brands, which the company continues to deemphasize as it strengthens its brand portfolio. Adjusting for trade-inventory reductions in the prior-year quarter, R.J. Reynolds' first quarter decline was significantly lower than that of the industry.
Camel, the company's leading premium brand, faced a tough quarter marked by heightened competitive activity as well as economic factors that affected all premium products. Camel's cigarette share was down from the prior-year period; however, its performance improved significantly through the quarter as R.J. Reynolds took measures to make the brand more competitive. And Camel ended the first quarter at the same level that it achieved in the preceding quarter.
R.J. Reynolds remained focused on balancing the brand share and profit performance, while ensuring that Camel is competitive in the marketplace. As part of that effort, R.J. Reynolds recently repositioned Camel's two core menthol styles, by adding bold new packaging that highlights their use of R.J. Reynolds capsule technology. This technology gives adult smokers the choice of more menthol on demand. The initial reaction to this unique Camel benefit has been very positive.
Camel Crush, which uses the same capsule technology, gives adult smokers the option of regular or menthol with each cigarette. The product continues to do well with broad appeal among those regular and menthol smokers. In fact, with the addition of capsule technology to the core menthol style, products featuring this innovative technology now represent the vast majority of Camel's menthol share.
Camel's focus on strengthening its core cigarette business is a key part of the strategy to grow Camel as a total tobacco brand. To that end, Camel is also leading the changing preferences of adults who enjoy tobacco by broadening the range of products that it offers.
Camel is leveraging its authentic rich heritage by offering innovative modern smoke-free products like R.J. Reynolds Camel Snus and Dissolvables as well as American Snuff Camel Dip.
Sales of Camel Snus have remained relatively stable since its national expansion last year. R.J. Reynolds is simplifying the pricing promotional strategy for Camel Snus and putting more emphasis on engaging and educating consumers about this relatively new product category. R.J. Reynolds believes that the national expansion of competitive Snus products will increase category awareness and will benefit Camel Snus.
Camel's dissolvable products, Orbs, Sticks and Strips, were introduced in three lead markets last year. And they are generating good consumer interest. The company is incorporating insights from consumer feedback to improve the products and their packaging and to better communicate the enjoyment and convenience that these new products offer.
Now turning to Pall Mall. Pall Mall continued to steadily build volume and share in the first quarter as consumers increasingly discover Pall Mall value as a high-quality, longer-lasting cigarette at an affordable price. The company continued to promote the brand through the first quarter in the face of significant competitive promotional activity. Pall Mall's promotional levels have moderated in the second quarter as the company continues to refine its strategic approach.
So that's a quick look at R.J. Reynolds. I think it's clear from the first quarter performance that the company's strong strategies and brands continued to deliver solid results.
Turning to American Snuff, American Snuff's first quarter performance also continued to show strength and resilience amid intensified competitive pricing and promotions. Despite these challenges, the company held adjusted operated income steady. In addition, they increased their adjusted operating margins. American Snuff also increased its moist-snuff shipment volume.
Grizzly, American Snuff's flagship brand, posted a significant increase in first quarter shipment volume despite intense competitive pricing and promotional pressures. Grizzly's share of shipments to retail declined in the first quarter due to distortions caused by substantially higher competitive promotional shipments. However, on a consumer off-take basis, which better reflects actual retail sales, Grizzly's share was up, reflecting the brand's strong value and equity. American Snuff further enhanced Grizzly's value and quality perceptions with the March introduction of embossed metal lids across the brand styles.
Grizzly also continued to post first quarter volume and share gains with its pouch products, delivering especially strong growth on Grizzly Wintergreen pouches. Adding to Grizzly's appeal among a broad base of moist-snuff consumers was the introduction of Grizzly 1900 Long Cut, a natural product with a traditional long cut. This product has performed very well in the first few months.
Later in the quarter, American Snuff improved its premium positioning with packaging upgrades, which further enhanced Kodiak's image. Kodiak's share remained steady in the first quarter, while generating double digit volume growth. And the company is also improving its premium position with Camel Dip, which leverages the brand's authentic heritage with packaging and product innovation.
Camel Dip was introduced into two states last June, and expanded to select outlets in ten additional states in the first quarter. The brand also introduced a third style, Camel Wintergreen pouches. Camel Dip is building good momentum in those 12 states, and the company expects the brand to continue to do well.
So those are the highlights of Reynolds American's solid first quarter performance.
And now, Tom will provide you some more details.

During my discussion, I will focus on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business. Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release, which is on our website.As you heard",1112,"Thank you, Susan, and good morning. During my discussion, I will focus on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business. Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release, which is on our website.
As you heard today, RAI and its operating companies are off to a good start, with first quarter results that keep us on track to meet our 2010 adjusted EPS guidance of $4.80 to $5.00. That forecast excludes charges related to changes in Federal Healthcare laws and the Canadian Government settlements.
Let's look in more detail at those results. Adjusted earnings per share increased 11% from the prior year quarter to $1.11. This excludes charges of $0.09 per share related to the changes in Federal HealthCare laws, and $0.74 per share for the Canadian Government settlements.
As announced on April 13, R.J. Reynolds and its affiliate Northern Brands, have agreed to pay a total of $400 million to settle civil claims and criminal charges brought by Canadian governments. This resulted in a first quarter charge of $216 million to discontinued operations.
On a reported basis, first quarter EPS was $0.28 per share, compared with $0.03 per share in the prior year quarter. I would remind you that the prior year quarter included substantial trademark impairments.
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds' performance, in the first quarter, higher cigarette pricing and productivity more than offset lower cigarette volume and higher promotional expense. The company's first quarter adjusted operating income, which excluded prior period trademark impairments, increased 2.4% from the prior year quarter to $470 million. R.J. Reynolds' first quarter adjusted operating margin was down slightly from the prior year quarter, but was up sequentially at 27.3%.
In the first quarter, R.J. Reynolds realized an additional $8 million in savings from ongoing productivity initiatives. That's in addition to the $35 million realized last year, and this keeps the company on track to achieve by the end of this year, the full $60 million in annualized savings from the 2008 and 2009 restructuring and outsourcing programs.
With respect to cigarette volume, R.J. Reynolds' first quarter shipment volume declined 2.5% from the prior year quarter, compared with the industry decline of 2.4%. Most of R.J. Reynolds' decline came from the company's low margin private label brands that continue to be deemphasized. Excluding those brands, R.J. Reynolds' first quarter volume declined just three-tenths of 1%.
As you know, there were significant trade inventory reductions in the prior year quarter ahead of the federal tobacco excise tax increase. Adjusting for this, the company's volume decline would have been 4.8%, significantly less than the industry decline of 7.3%. In addition, there was an increase in the industry's wholesale trade inventories during this year's first quarter, while R.J. Reynolds' inventories remained relatively stable.
Now, turning to cigarette market share, R.J. Reynolds' first quarter share increased two-tenths of a share point from the prior year quarter to 27.9%. The company achieved this growth even after absorbing a loss of four-tenths of a share point on its private label brands. The company's growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall increased their combined first quarter cigarette market share by 3.1 percentage points to 13.6%. Strong growth on Pall Mall more than offset Camel's decline.
Camel's first quarter cigarette market share at 7.1% was negatively affected by competitive and economic pressures. However, Camel's performance did improve through the quarter, as R.J. Reynolds refined Camel's promotional offers. Camel cigarette ended the quarter with market share at 7.4%.
I would like to point out that Camel has de-listed 13 non-core styles, and has not added a cigarette line extension since 2008. In the first quarter, Camel Snus remained relatively stable at two-tenths of a share on a cigarette-equivalent basis.
Turning to Pall Mall, Pall Mall continued to deliver substantial growth, with an increase of 3.6 share points from the prior year quarter, to 6.5%. That also represents a gain of half a share point from the preceding quarter. So those are R.J. Reynolds' key results.
Now, turning to American Snuff, American Snuff's first quarter adjusted operating income, excluding prior year trademark impairments was even with the prior year quarter at $84 million, as higher moist-snuff volume and pricing offset lower margins on Kodiak. The company's first quarter adjusted operating margin of 51.8% increased 1.3 percentage points and was driven by those same factors.
Turning to moist-snuff volume and share, American Snuff's total shipment volume grew 12.2% for the quarter, ahead of the category's growth of 8.9%. As we've noted, shipment volume comparisons for the company and the category benefited from the prior year quarter's trade inventory de-loading.
On a consumer off-take basis, which better reflects actual purchases, American Snuff's moist-snuff volume increased 6.7%. Grizzly's first quarter of shipment volume increased 11.7%. However, the brand's share, based on shipments to retail, was down seven-tenths of a point at 24%. That decline reflects distortions in the first quarter moist-snuff shipments, resulting from an inflated level of competitive promotional shipments.
On a consumer off-take basis, Grizzly's share was up 1.2 percentage points at 25%. Some of that growth was due to consumers returning to Grizzly. In the fourth quarter of 2009, Grizzly's share was negatively impacted as some of the brand's consumers tried heavily discounted line extensions of leading competitive brands. Grizzly's first quarter share increase reflects the return of the majority of those consumers. During the first quarter, Grizzly also gained strength with its pouch styles, growing 0.5 share point from the prior-year quarter to a 1.7% share.
American Snuff's premium Kodiak brand also made progress, with first quarter shipment volume up 12%. I will point out that Kodiak's share of shipment has remained steady at about 3.8% for well over a year.
So that's a quick look at R.J. Reynolds and American Snuff. Now I'll provide some additional details on RAI. Reynolds American ended the quarter with cash balances of $3.3 billion, after contributing $300 million to the pension plan.
With respect to the NPM adjustment, on April 15, R.J. Reynolds made this year's $2 billion MSA payment. $448 million of that went to the NPM disputed payment account. R.J. Reynolds now has a total of $2.4 billion in disputed payments covering the years 2003 through 2007. As you know, the arbitration process to resolve the dispute over the $615 million 2003 year adjustment is underway.
In closing, I would like to reiterate RAI's commitment to maintaining a strong balance sheet and our commitment to returning value to our shareholders including our 75% dividend payment policy.
Thank you. And now we'll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Jonathan, would you remind our callers how to get into the queue?

I would say we are just now lapping, of course, what was the reload last April. So I think our expectation, as we stated I guess in the last earnings call, is that the decline in the industry reworks to more historical levels. But I'd really like to wait till we get through the second quarter to give you a more accurate view of the rest of the year.
The other thing in terms of premium and discount is it's interesting, because it's becoming increasingly difficult to tell what is premium and what is discount as we look at different styles for different brands at different price one. So I would say that we have continued to see growth this quarter in value, to be honest, both value styles of premium brands and of course Pall Mall continued to gain share. It picked up 0.5 share point.
We've seen a little bit of decline in the non-big three, which I believe has gone kind of into the big three, but they were down about two-tenth if we look at sequentially.

Clearly, you've alluded this year softening on that brand with more competitive activity that you're seeing in the marketplace. Pall Mall is going to start a lot pretty good growth in the second quarter that you started to benefit from. So I'm just trying to figure out the brand performance going forward between Camel and Pall Mall for you guys.

Camel is very much a focus and we will continue to invest equity in Camel. We've been on a strategy to quite deliberately try to reduce the promoted volume on Camel obviously to balance its market share and its profitability. And we got a little bit out of sorts in the first couple of months of the year with extended competitive promotion. We will certainly defend Camel. We'll continue to invest in its equity.
And I guess we'll be making a lot of trade-offs between Camel and Pall Mall. They are both growth portfolio. I did state that we were moderating some of the promotional activities on Pall Mall. That is consistent with our strategy. So basically we've taken some pricing by reducing some discounting on Pall Mall, and we're very focused on balancing, sharing profitability as we consolidate the portfolio.
The growth brands now represent just about 50% of R.J. Reynolds' volume. As you know, over the past five years, we discontinued 70% of the original SKUs. And we're deemphasizing private label. We believe we are better served with several large big brands, and we will continue that focus and Pall Mall will continue to benefit from deemphasizing private-label.

R.J. Reynolds has done that. The competitive environment has changed. And the 350 strong sales force at Conwood doesn't play well against a couple of thousand on the street. And so we do expect to retain all of that expertise. We're very confident in our transition plan, and we believe we will start seeing the benefits in the fourth quarter.

399584,109111769,68560,"Reynolds American Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-22-2010",2010-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Reynolds American Inc.","Executives","Good morning everyone. As we reported today, RAI delivered strong second quarter performance. I’m very pleased with these results, especially in light of last year’s unusually strong second quarter.

I’m very pleased with these results, especially in light of last year’s unusually strong second quarter. Our operating companies key brand performance, productivity gains and promotional efficiencies drove RAI’s adjusted earnings and margin higher, demonstrating our continued momentum in delivering sustainable business growth. The strength of the second quarter results is especially impressive given the distortions in trade inventory levels in the prior year period. 
In last year’s second quarter, wholesalers and retailers rebuild inventories on cigarettes and moist-snuff after they significantly reduced first quarter inventory ahead of the federal tobacco excise-tax increases. Even so, both of our reportable business segments continued to benefit from the underlying strength of their business strategies and key brands. 
Based on this performance, we have increased our earnings guidance for the full year. RAI now expects 2010 adjusted EPS of $4.90 per share to $5.05 and increase from our previous guidance of $4.80 to $5 per share. This excludes second quarter charges related to the amounts closing of two cigarette factories and the expansion of R.J. Reynolds field trade-marketing organization to serve American Snuff to their services agreement, as well as first quarter charges related to changes in federal healthcare laws and Canadian government settlements.
Among the highlights of the second quarter, R.J. Reynolds posted higher adjusted operating income and a significant increase in adjusted operating margin, as well as further improvement in both of its growth brand, Camel and Pall Mall. And the American Snuff Company again increased moist-snuff volume led by growth on its powerful Grizzly brand. In addition, RAI’s Santa Fe subsidiary delivered excellent performance with second quarter gains in earnings, volume and share.
Before I provide more detail on our business performance, I would like to give you an update on a few additional items. The expansion of R.J. Reynolds field trade-marketing organization is going smoothly and exchange should be essentially completed by the end of the third quarter. As RAI announced in April, this strategic move offers us many efficiencies and enhancements, both internally and in our operating companies' ability to serve the retail trade. 
As we reported in May, RAI operating companies are also taking steps to improve cigarette manufacturing efficiency and expand moist-snuff production capacity. Two cigarette factories will be closed over the next year and American Snuff is expanding its smokeless tobacco, processing and manufacturing capacity. 
On the regulatory front, I’m pleased to report that RAI’s operating companies have fully met all requirements to date under the new regulatory structure administered by the US Food and Drug Administration. We now have structures in place across our operating companies to ensure comprehensive FDA compliance while effectively competing in this new environment. 
And on the legal front, as you are aware in late June, the US Supreme Court denied both the government and the tobacco companies' request to hear appeal on the Department of Justice Law Suite. While R.J. Reynolds was disappointed that its application was denied, the denial of the government's application was a positive development as it eliminated the risk of financial damages in this case.
With respect to the Engle progeny cases, R.J. Reynolds has had a number of losses in these cases thus far. Although we are disappointed with the losses, we are not surprised of the outcomes and the finest attorneys are bringing their best cases to trial first. The company is in the process of appealing these cases and we fully expect to ultimately prevail.
Now let's take a closer look at second quarter performance. R.J. Reynolds and American Snuff continued to build their key brands, while investing in innovative cigarette and smokeless tobacco products to meet the changing preference of adults who enjoy tobacco. R.J. Reynolds focus on its growth brand and ongoing productivity improvements continued to build strength throughout its operation in the second quarter. The company generated higher adjusted income, adjusted operating income and margin while delivering growth brand volume and share gain.
Despite a very strong prior year quarter, R.J. Reynolds increased earnings and the company's second quarter adjusted operating margin was significantly higher. R.J. Reynolds total cigarette market share was down from the prior year quarter, driven by losses on its private label brand, which the company continues to deemphasize, as well as some losses on support brand. In that context, I would point out that some of that volume decline on support and private label brands has shifted to Pall Mall. 
R.J. Reynolds' two growth brands Camel and Pall Mall delivered strong performance in the second quarter with gains in both cigarette volume and share. These brands now account for more than half of the company's total cigarette volume and share. 
I am pleased to report that Camel performed well in the second quarter with increases that reflect the recent packaging and product upgrades in the brand's menthol style. These styles now offer R.J. Reynolds innovative capsule technology, giving adult smokers the unique option of more fresh menthol flavor when they want it. And Camel Crush uses the same technology to offer adult smokers the choice of regular or menthol with each cigarette. And consumers say they like having a choice of fresh menthol whenever they want it. 
As a total tobacco brand, Camel is further improving and expanding its innovative offerings with the upcoming introduction of two new Camel Snus style as well as additional refinement to Camel Dissolvables.
Camel Snus, the company’s first smoke-free product, was expanded nationally last year and its share is holding steady. Camel Snus have moved away from its introductory promotional offers to a simplified pricing strategy, and this will help R.J. Reynolds to focus more on consumer engagement and education of the Snus proposition. This summer, Camel Snus is introducing two new styles, Robust and Winterchill. Packed in larger pouches, these new products offer tobacco consumers a richer, more full body tobacco taste. Robust and Winterchill have performed very well in their initial test markets and appeal to both current Snus users who want more will take and moist-snuff users who like the convenience of a spit-free product. 
R.J. Reynolds expects these new styles to strengthen the brand’s leaderships in this small but growing category. All four styles of Camel Snus have also been upgraded to feature bold new packaging and are being sold in stores nationwide.
Also building interest is Camel's new line of dissolvable products; Orbs, Sticks and Strips. Introduced in three lead markets last year, Camel Dissolvables are making further product and packaging improvements based on feedback from adult tobacco consumers. We’ve also learned that a broad range of adult tobacco consumers have a high level of interest in this new product concept.
So Camel is improving its overall demographics for long-term growth and I think it’s evident from Camel’s performance that the brand continues to build momentum. It’s clear that R.J. Reynolds' focus on leveraging the Camel brand to drive innovation in growth is delivering results.
Turning to Pall Mall. R.J, Reynolds’ second growth brand. Pall Mall continued to perform extremely well in the second quarter with strong volume and share gains from both the prior year quarter and this year's first quarter. As high unemployment continues to depress consumer spending, more adult smokers are finding great value in Pall Mall. 
Pall Mall sells at an affordable price but the brand offers much more than that. The cigarette differentiates itself from other value brands with high quality, longer lasting advantages. And more than half of those who try the brand stick with it. Even with more moderate promotion levels Pall Mall continued to generate strong trial and conversion. 
R.J. Reynolds continues to drive productivity improvements across its business. The company further streamlined its portfolio of cigarette products in the second quarter and has reduced its number of styles by almost 25% this year, with these reductions coming from its private label brand. And in R.J. Reynolds efforts to gain additional manufacturing efficiencies, the company will consolidate cigarette production from two older factories into its largest facility, over the next year. 
So as R.J. Reynolds enters the second half of the year, I think it’s clear that the company’s strong product offerings and strategies are serving it well, in this changing tobacco environment and it positions the company for long term sustainable growth. 
Turning to American Snuff. American Snuff made solid progress in the second quarter, increasing moist-snuff pricing and volume, despite continuing high levels of competitive promotional activity. It’s important to note that the company’s second quarter earnings and volume comparison were also somewhat distorted by the rebuild of trade inventories in the prior year quarter. American Snuff adjusted operating income and margin were down from the prior year quarter primarily from declines on roll-your-own and other non-core tobacco products that more than offset moist snuff gain. The company's total moist snuff shipment volume increased in both the second quarter and the first half of the year. Moist snuff category volumes were up about 9% in both the second quarter and the first half. However on the consumer off-take basis, we believe the moist snuff category volume was about 6%.
This is because moist snuff industry volumes were inflated by the high levels of competitive promotional shipments. Also contributing to this increase was a change in the way a competitor reports shipments which excludes return products. American Snuff share of shipments in the second quarter was in line with its prior year quarter and well ahead of this year's first quarter. 
Grizzly, American Snuff's flagship brand, again drove the mixed company's performance with strength on its core style as well as new product introduction. And Grizzly is delivering growth while continuing to maintain low promotional levels. Grizzly is also generating strong gains in the fast growing pouch segment. The brand now accounts for almost one quarter of all pouch sales after entering the segment only 2.5 years ago, and Grizzly now has the number one Wintergreen pouch product in the market today.
Also adding to Grizzly's appeal among a broad base of moist snuff consumers is the recently introduced Grizzly 1900 Long Cut. A natural product with a traditional long cut, Grizzly 1900 Long Cut has performed well since its introduction earlier this year. American Snuff continues to focus on enhancing Grizzly's brand equity and value to consumers. The recent addition of embossed metal lids is improving the brand's quality perceptions among moist snuff consumers. 
Turning to American Snuff's premium Kodiak brand, even though Kodiak share of shipments has experienced a modest decline in the first half of this year, the brand's volume has increased despite being significantly out promoted by other premium moist snuff competitors. Camel Dip the company's latest premium introduction is bringing innovation to the moist snuff category and is performing well. Camel Dip which leverages Camel's authentic heritage was expanded to selected outlets in 10 additional states earlier this year and continues to build momentum. Overall, American Snuff continues to show strength and resilience in a challenging environment and we expect that performance to continue to improve in the second half and beyond. 
So that's an overview of Reynolds American progress in the second quarter. Our operating companies remain intensely focused on driving a profitable growth by strengthening their key brands, improving efficiencies and investing in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco innovation, which will meet the changing preferences of adult tobacco consumers. And now, Tom will provide you with a few more details.

During my discussion, I'll focus primarily on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underline business. Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release which is on our website. I think i",1313,"Thank you, Susan and good morning. During my discussion, I'll focus primarily on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underline business. Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release which is on our website. I think it's clear from our results today that RAI and its operating companies have made substantial progress in the second quarter and first half. Let's look at those results in more detail. 
On a reported basis second quarter EPS was $1.17 per share, down 9.3% from the prior year quarter, due to charges of $0.15 per share related to the plant closings and expansion of R.J. Reynolds field trade marketing organization. Excluding those charges, RAI’s adjusted earnings per share increased 2.3% in the second quarter from the prior year quarter to $1.32. These results include charges of $0.03 per share related to the [Loop Tax] legal judgment. 
For the first half of 2010, adjusted EPS was $2.43 per share, up 5.7%. Adjusted operating income excludes second quarter charges related to the plant closings, and expansion of R.J. Reynolds field trade-marketing organization, as well as first quarter charges for the change in federal health care laws and Canadian government settlements. The adjusted results also exclude trademark impairment charges in the first quarter of last year. 
First half reported EPS was $1.45 per share, up 9.8% from the prior year period. I’m pleased to report that Reynolds American continued to see improvement in its adjusted operating margin, which was driven by gains in our operating companies pricing and productivity. For the second quarter, adjusted operating margin increased 1.3 percentage points to 30.1%, and for the first half it was up 0.7 percentage points to 29.4%. 
Now turning to R.J. Reynolds performance. R.J. Reynolds second quarter adjusted operating income increased 2.2% from the prior year quarter to $568 million, despite a very strong prior year quarter. This reflects higher cigarette pricing, productivity gains and lower promotional spending, which more than offset lower cigarette volume. For the first half, adjusted operating income rose 2.3% to $1 billion. Adjusted results exclude charges related to the plant closings and expansion of R.J. Reynolds field trade-marketing organization as well as trademark impairment charges in the first quarter of 2009.
R.J. Reynolds second quarter adjusted operating margin was significantly higher at 29.3% up 1.1 percentage points from the prior year quarter. This increase was mainly driven by higher pricing, productivity and promotional efficiencies.
Now turning to total cigarette market share, R.J. Reynolds' total second quarter cigarette market share of 27.9% was down 0.8 percentage points from the prior year quarter. This was largely driven by the losses on its de-emphasized private label brands which now represent a total of only six tenths of a share point.
Turning to cigarette shipment volume, R.J. Reynolds' second quarter cigarette shipment volume declined 9.5% compared with an industry decline of 7.1%. However, excluding private label brands, the company’s volume performance was better than that of the industry with the decline of 6.9% in the quarter and 3.9% for the half. R.J. Reynolds' first-half cigarette shipment volume was down 6.3% compared with an industry decline of 4.9%. Camel and Pall Mall each reported second quarter cigarette volume and share gains. Those two growth brands now account for more than half of the company’s total share and volume. Their combined second quarter market share was 14.8% up 2.1 percentage points. Camel's second quarter cigarette market share of 7.8% was up three tenths of a point from the prior year quarter. Camel’s menthol styles including Camel Crush increased half a share point to 1.8 share of market in the quarter. Camel also continues to make progress as a total tobacco brand. Camel Snus remained stable at three tenths of a share on a cigarette equivalent basis and on a moist snuff equivalent basis; Camel Snus had a second quarter share of 3.5%.
Now turning to Pall Mall, which continues to deliver excellent performance. Pall Mall increased its second quarter market share to 7% that was up 1.8 percentage points from the year ago period and up 0.5 share from the prior quarter. So that is our R.J. Reynolds key results.
Now turning to American Snuff. American Snuff's second quarter adjusted operating income was $85 million down 7.1% from the prior year quarter. That decline was due to lower volume on roll-your-own and other non-core tobacco products which more than offset higher moist snuff pricing and volume. American Snuff also had higher second quarter costs relating to the timing of promotional spending and FDA compliance.
First half adjusted operating income was $169 million down 3.8% from the prior year period. Adjusted operating income excludes second quarter charges primarily related to severance costs associated with field trade marketing changes as well as prior year trademark impairments.
Turning to moist snuff volume and share, American Snuff’s total moist snuff shipment volume grew 3% for the quarter, for the first half which eliminates the impact of trade inventory fluctuations; the company's moist snuff shipments increased 7.1%. As Susan mentioned, industry shipment were up about 9% for the quarter and the half while consumer off-take was up about 6%. 
American Snuff's share of shipments for the second quarter was in line with the prior year quarter at 29.4%. Grizzly's second quarter shipment volume increased by 4.2%. For the first half, the brand continued to outpace industry consumption with a 7.6% increase. And Grizzly's share of shipments increased slightly to 25.5% in the quarter. 
The brand also improved its position in the fast growing pouch segment, accounting for nearly 25% of all pouch sales in the second quarter. Share of shipments for American Snuff's premium Kodiak brand declined 0.2 percentage point from the prior year quarter, and Kodiak's volume was down 5.5% in the second quarter but up 2.6% for the half. So that's an overview of American Snuff. Now we'll take a look at productivity.
As part of our operating company's continued efforts to improve productivity, we announced in May that two older cigarette factories will be closed over the next year, and production will be transferred to R.J. Reynolds' tobacco manufacturing center. This will further increase the company's manufacturing utilization and efficiency. During the first half of this year, R.J. Reynolds generated $14 million in incremental cost savings from its 2008 and 2009 restructuring programs. That will build the $25 million for the full year. 
As Susan said, the company is also continuing to make great progress in streamlining its cigarette portfolio. Since 2004 R.J. Reynolds has reduced its portfolio by 75% to 180 brand styles. In addition, American Snuff is expanding its smokeless tobacco processing and manufacturing capacity by investing in new facilities in Memphis and Clarksville, Tennessee. We expect capital expenditures on these projects of about $130 million this year with an additional $70 million to complete them next year. 
Now turning to RAI’s balance sheet. Reynolds American ended the quarter with cash balances of $1.6 billion, after making its annual master settlement agreement payment of $2 billion in the second quarter. I would note that on July 15, the company repaid $300 million in debt from cash, bringing our leverage ratio to 1.6 times debt to EBIDTA. RAI is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and to returning value to shareholders. Our 75% dividend payout ratio currently stands are $3.60 per share on an annualized basis. 
So in closing, based on our solid operating and marketplace performance in the first half, Reynolds American has increased its forecast for the full year with an adjusted EPS range of $4.90 to $5.05. This excludes charges related to the plant closings, expansion of R.J. Reynolds field trade-marketing organization, changes in federal healthcare laws and Canadian government settlements. 
Thank you, and now we’ll turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Ally will you remind our callers how to get into the queue?

The capsule, giving people the opportunity to add menthol to their smoke, during the smoke, whenever they want to, is very appealing to competitive premium menthol smokers. And so, I really believe there is nothing else in the industry with that capability to deliver fresh menthol when you want it. And so I believe the market share gain, and certainly there have been introductory promotions. But I would say the market share gain and sort of the top value of the differentiation of the style is really driving that growth, because as you’ve identified half a share point in a quarter is substantial. 
And remember when we launched Camel Crush nationally, we saw about seven tenths of a share point move into that variant in the first couple of quarters and we do not see these new menthol styles cannibalizing Crush, so it is incremental. So we are pleased with the results so far.

You may have seen the 60 minutes program where there was some more consumer awareness about Snus. That drove an increase in shipment. We also have had a competitive national launch in the Snus category with heavy promotion in the Snus category. And what we start to see though is that Camel Snus is continuing to perform very well. The awareness of the category is growing and I believe Camel Snus will continue to grow. The simplified pricing makes it clearer for the consumer to understand the price and the price they should pay and it enables our trade marketing people to spend time talking to consumers and to retailers about Snus and how to use it, and the various styles in the category. 
So, we now have two major players in the Snus category in the United States. I believe the whole category will continue to grow and I believe that Camel’s growth will outpace the category, because we believe we have a stronger product offering in the category.

As we reported today, increases in adjusted earnings and margins were driven by gains in our operating company's powerful key brands, all of which posted record consumer uptake market share in the third quarter. 
It is clear that both of our reportable business segments continue to effectively execute their strategies in a changing tobacco environment, and we remain on track for a strong year.
I'd like to remind you of several significant recent developments at RAI. As we announced on October 15, RAI Board of Directors approved an increase of 8.9% in our dividend, reflecting RAI's strong financial performance and it is further evident of our deep commitment to returning value to our shareholders.
The Board also approved a two-for-one stock split that will be effective on November 15. We also announced last week that I plan to retire on February 28th. I've had a long and rewarding career in the tobacco industry, with the last ten years in the CEO role.
Dan Delen who has led R.J. Reynolds Tobacco for the past four years will succeed me as CEO. Dan and I have worked closely to develop the successful strategies that have helped to transform RAI's business model. With Dan's depth of knowledge and experience in the global tobacco industry and with Brown & Williamson and R.J. Reynolds' domestically, I believe that he is extremely well prepared to assume his new leadership role. Dan and I look forward to seeing all of you next month at our Investor Day presentation.
The expansion of R.J. Reynolds' field trade-marketing organization to serve American Snuff, through a services agreement has been largely completed. This change gives both companies greater speed to market, provides stronger support for the retail trade, and gives the company's brand a strong retail presence, and will significantly benefit American Snuff brand. The transition has been a very smooth one and we expect this strategic move to offer both operating companies substantial benefit and efficiencies.
Also, the move to consolidate cigarette manufacturing and expand moist-snuff production capacity, are progressing well. The Puerto Rico cigarette factory was closed this summer and the Whitaker Park factory is on schedule to close by the middle of next year. Production is being consolidated at R.J. Reynolds' Tobaccoville manufacturing facility. The construction of American Snuff facilities to increase their smokeless-tobacco processing and manufacturing capacity is well underway.
On the regulatory front, RAI's operating companies continue to be in compliance with the emerging requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration and our operating companies are demonstrating that they can effectively compete in this new regulatory environment.
Now turning to RAI's outlook, based on our results through the third quarter, the company has reaffirmed and tightened its earnings outlook for the full-year. And we now expect adjusted EPS of $4.95 to $5.05. 
I would note that, our guidance excludes charges related to cigarette plant closings, the expansion of R.J. Reynolds' field trade-marketing organization, changes in federal health-care laws and the Canadian governments' settlements.
And now I’d like to recap several highlights in the third quarter. R.J. Reynolds again delivered adjusted operating income and margin at higher levels. This was supported by gains in both volume and share on the company's two growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall, with continued pricing and promotional efficiencies and productivity improvement.
American Snuff also posted record adjusted operating income and margin, while delivering higher moist-snuff volume. With respect to RAI's Santa Fe subsidiary, Santa Fe continue to deliver excellent results in the third quarter, as its Natural American Spirit brand again drove gains in earnings and volume and posted record market share.
Another highlight worth mentioning is RAI's selection to the Dow Jones sustainability North American Index for the third consecutive year. This independent recognition of our growing sustainability efforts, which we have embedded across the organization and it, reflects our commitment to mitigating our business risk.
Now let's look at our operating companies in more detail. R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share was up slightly from the prior year quarter. Strong growth brand gains offset losses in support and non-support brands', including the private label brands, which the company continues to de-emphasize and to eliminate.
Excluding the impact of these de-emphasized private label brands, R.J. Reynolds' total cigarette market share actually increased by 1.2 share points. This performance is clear evidence that R.J. Reynolds' brand portfolio strategy is working well and the company's volume performance, excluding private label brand has been better than that of the industry this year.
R.J. Reynolds' growth brands, Camel and Pall Mall again delivered excellent performance in the third quarter. These two brands continue to play an increasing role in R.J. Reynolds progress and account for more than half of the company’s total cigarette volume and share. Camel further strengthened its market place position in the third quarter and is benefiting from strong performance on Camel’s menthol styles, the use of R.J. Reynolds' capsule technology on these styles offers adult menthol smokers fresh flavor when they chew.
Camel Crush which uses the same technology to offer the choice of regular or menthol with each cigarette also enhanced the brand's market share performance in this growing menthol segment. Camel increased its menthol market share by half a share point in the third quarter and Camel continues to see improvements in its overall brand demographics, which provides a good base for the brand's long-term growth.
Camel continues to improve its position as a total tobacco brand, by focusing on equity enhancements and consumer relevant innovation. Camel SNUS, R.J. Reynolds first modern smoke-free tobacco product continues to show steady volume performance with lower levels of promotional support this year.
During the third quarter, Camel SNUS introduced two new styles, Robust and Winterchill and they are attracting strong interest. These new products are packed in larger pouches and offer adult tobacco consumers a richer more full body tobacco taste as well as smoke-free and spit-free convenience. All four Camel SNUS styles are being sold in select stores nationwide.
Turning to Camel's new line of dissolvable tobacco products, Camel Orbs, Sticks and Strips are still is tracking [ph] consumer interest and feedback from adult tobacco consumer is helping the company refine the products and the packaging to better meet consumer preferences.
Now, turning to Pall Mall, our R.J. Reynolds second growth brand, Pall Mall is the nation's fourth largest and fastest growing major cigarette brand. In the third quarter, Pall Mall continue to deliver significant market share and volume gain when compared with the prior year quarter and the second quarter of this year.
Consumers continue to seek even greater value because of the weak economy and adult smokers are no exception. They are increasingly discovering that Pall Mall is a high-quality longer lasting cigarette that delivers the great value that they are seeking and as a result, trial and conversion to Pall Mall continues to increase.
R.J. Reynolds also continues to make progress on the productivity front with improvements across its operation. During the quarter, the company further streamlined its portfolio of cigarette products, including its private label brands.
R.J. Reynolds has made great strides on this front, and expects to end the year with a 135 style, with further reductions expected next year. This is down dramatically from its more than 800 styles in 2004. R.J. Reynolds will also see additional manufacturing efficiencies as cigarette production is consolidated into its largest facility by the middle of next year. This focus on improving efficiency as well as strengthening the growth brands is essential for R.J. Reynolds growth, both now and into the future.
So, I am extremely pleased with R.J. Reynolds achievements through the third quarter. The company has a powerful product portfolio with a wide range of choices for all adult tobacco consumers and this strategic crafting of strong brand at a variety of price point is proving to be very effective.
Turning to American Snuff, as expected the company significantly improved its financial performance in the third quarter, reporting record adjusted operating income and margin. American Snuff continues to face a challenging environment, with high-levels of competitive promotional activity and line extension. Even so, the company's brands have proved to be very resilient with higher moist-snuff pricing and volume in the third quarter.
The company's total moist snuff shipment volume increased in both the third quarter and the first nine months of the year. American Snuff totaled moist-snuff share of shipments was down in the third quarter. However, on a consumer off-take basis which better reflects actual consumer purchases, the company's share was in line with the prior year quarter. 
Levels of competitive promotional shipment, as well as changes in the reporting of returned good, and value priced line extensions by the competitors continued to distort industry moist-snuff shipment.
Grizzly, American Snuff's flagship brand, continued to perform well in this competitive environment. The brand which has maintained low promotional levels, increased third quarter shipment volume, but its share of shipments was slightly lower. But again, when you look at it on a consumer off-take basis, Grizzly's share increased.
In fact, Grizzly's share of consumer off-take reached a new high-level of 25.8% in the third quarter. This growth follows the company's recent packaging upgrade to embossed metal lids, which is improving the equity of the Grizzly family. Within the fast-growing pouch segment, Grizzly again gained market share, with the brand holding the number one Wintergreen pouch product in the marketplace.
So, overall, American Snuff is making great progress, despite a challenging environment and they are focused on delivering additional volume and earnings gains for the full-year. So that's a look at some of Reynolds Americans achievements in the third quarter. 
And now, Tom will give you a few more details.

As usual during my discussion, I'll focus primarily on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business.

As usual during my discussion, I'll focus primarily on adjusted results to provide perspective on our underlying business. Reconciliations of adjusted to reported results are in our press release, which is on our website. As our results show today, RAI is firmly on track to deliver earnings growth in the high single-digits this year.
Now let's look at the third quarter and nine months in more detail. On a reported basis, RAI's third quarter EPS was $1.30 per share, up 4.8% from the prior year quarter, including charges of $0.05 per share related to the cigarette plant closings and expansion of R.J. Reynolds' field trade-marketing organization. Excluding those charges RAI's adjusted earnings per share increased 8.9% in the third quarter to $1.35.
For the first nine months of 2010, adjusted EPS was $3.78 per share, up 6.8%. Adjusted earnings excludes second and third quarter charges related to the plant closings and expansion of R.J. Reynolds' field trade-marketing organization, as well as the first quarter charges for the change in federal health care laws and Canadian governments' settlements.
The adjusted results also exclude trademark impairment charges in the first quarter of last year. Nine months reported EPS was $2.75 per share, up 7.4% from the prior year period. Higher pricing and productivity at our operating companies also drove Reynolds American’s adjusted operating margins higher. 
For the third quarter, adjusted operating margin increased 1 percentage point to 30.6% and for the nine months it was up eight-tenths of the percentage point to 29.8%.
Turning to R.J. Reynolds' performance; R.J. Reynolds' third quarter adjusted operating income increased 7.5% from the prior year quarter to $572 million, as higher cigarette pricing, promotional and pricing efficiencies and productivity gains more than offset lower cigarette volume. For the nine months, adjusted operating income rose 4.1% to $1.6 billion. R.J. Reynolds' third quarter adjusted operating margin was significantly higher at 29.8%, up 1.3 percentage points from the prior year quarter.
Now turning to total cigarette market share, R.J. Reynolds' total third quarter cigarette market share was up slightly at 28.2%. As you’ve heard from Susan, total cigarette market share excluding private label brand was up by 1.2 share points driven by strong growth in Camel and Pall Mall.
R.J. Reynolds' private label brands now account for only three-tenths of the share point. With respect to cigarette shipment volume, R.J. Reynolds' third quarter cigarette shipment volume declined 2.6% from the prior year quarter, but excluding private label brands, volumes increased 1.2%. That compares with an industry volume decline of eight-tenths of 1%. Adjusting for wholesale inventory changes, industry volume was down 3.2% for the quarter.
Looking across the nine months, the company’s cigarette shipment volume was down 5.1%. Again, if we exclude the private label brand, volume was down only 2.2%, a better performance than that of the industry declined as 3.5%.
Camel and Pall Mall, each reported higher cigarette volume and share. Camel's third quarter cigarette market share of 8% was up four-tenths of a point from the prior year quarter and Pall Mall continued its strong growth momentum increasing its third quarter market share to 7.8%; that was up 2.8 percentage points from the year-ago quarter and up eight-tenths of a share point from the prior quarter. So, that’s a quick look at R.J. Reynolds' key results.
Now let’s take a look at American Snuff. Third quarter adjusted operating income was a record $102 million, up 9% from the prior year quarter. That increase was driven by higher moist-snuff pricing and volume. Nine months adjusted operating income of $271 million was up seven-tenths of 1% from the prior year period.
Adjusted results exclude 2010 charges related to the field trade-marketing changes and first quarter 2009 trademark impairments. The company’s third quarter adjusted operating margin was 54.9%, up 2.2 percentage points.
Turning to moist-snuff volume and share, American Snuff’s total moist-snuff shipment volume grew 1.2% in the third quarter and was up 5% for the first nine months. Total moist-snuff share of shipments for the third quarter was 29.2% down seven-tenths of 1%. 
However on a consumer off-take basis the company's share was in line with the prior year quarter at 30.3%. Industry shipments were up 8.6% in the third quarter, but on a consumer off-take basis they were up 6%.
Grizzly's third quarter shipment volume increased by 2.3% and for the nine months volumes increased 5.7%. Grizzly's share of shipments were slightly lower by three-tenth of 1% at 25.3% in the quarter. However, on a consumer off-take basis, Grizzly's share increased three-tenth of 1% to a new high at 25.8% in the third quarter. So, American Snuff is doing very well and it is positioned to deliver additional gains this year.
Now, I’d like to give you some additional details on Reynolds American. As part of RAI's commitment to maintaining a 75% dividend payout target and returning value to our shareholders, we announced last week that the dividend will increase 8.9%. This equates to an annualized increase of $0.32 per share from $3.60 to $3.92. I would note that RAI has paid the dividend every quarter, since becoming a publicly traded company in 2004 and this is our sixth dividend increase.
With respect to our balance sheet, Reynolds American ended the quarter with cash balances at $2.3 billion, after the company repaid $300 million in debt on July 15. As a result our leverage ratio is now 1.5 times debt to EBITDA.
In the fourth quarter, the company plans to contribute an additional $500 million to our pension plans. We also continue to evaluate additional opportunities to effectively use our cash and return value to our shareholders.
So to close, based on our strong performance through the third quarter, Reynolds American has reaffirmed and tightened its forecast for the full year, with an adjusted EPS range of $4.95 to $5.05. That's an earnings increase of 6.7% to 8.8% from 2009. This guidance excludes charges related to the plant closings, expansion of R.J. Reynolds' field trade-marketing organization, changes in federal health care laws, and the Canadian governments' settlement.
Thank you. And we'll now turn to the Q&A portion of the call. Ally, would you remind our callers how to get in the queue.

But even in your own portfolio, there were point in time where a GPC or a Doral had reached a particular level of share, and then as you tried to or move to maximize and enhance profitability, as you took pricing, those brands subsequently lost share, in some instances substantial share. So, how do you think about the capacity over time to put through pricing and enhance Pall Mall's margin?

And so, when we take a look at our recent history, during 2010, we actually were able to take pricing on the brands. We were able to take more pricing than the category and throughout that period, we were actually able to continue our rate of growth. So, based on some of the inherent proposition and recent experience, I'm extremely confident that we can continue the growth on that brand, for the foreseeable future.
