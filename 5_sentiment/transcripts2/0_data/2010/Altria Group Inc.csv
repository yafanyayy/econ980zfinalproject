I think that Altria continued delivering excellent results last year in what was, I think everybody would agree as, a very challenging environment, challenges included, weak economic conditions, high unemployment",1585,"Thanks, Cliff, and good morning, everyone. I think that Altria continued delivering excellent results last year in what was, I think everybody would agree as, a very challenging environment, challenges included, weak economic conditions, high unemployment, significant increases in the excise taxes at the federal state levels, which had impacts on the category volume trends of our Tobacco businesses, as well as the FDA assuming regulatory oversight over Tobacco. In the face of these challenges, Altria delivered strong financial results. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 6.1% to $1.75, which met our increased guidance. In addition, we increased our dividend by 6.3% to an annualized rate of $1.36 per share. Solid fundamentals of Altria's operating businesses enabled these financial results. Cigarette segment's adjusted operating companies income increased by 5.5%,  $5.3 billion, as PM USA implemented a profitable strategy around the significant FET increase in the marketplace disruptions that followed. These disruptions caused dislocations on the retail share performances of the company's brands, but Marlboro displayed resiliency in what was an intensely competitive promotional environment.The UST integration is substantially complete, and USSTC's retail share returned to growth. We are particularly pleased with the strong share growth of Copenhagen in the fourth quarter of the year behind the successful launch of Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the combined volume of Copenhagen and Skoal grew 7.8% versus the prior-year period, which was ahead of the Smokeless category's volume growth rate. And the Cigar segment grew its adjusted operating companies income by 1.6% behind the continued retail share growth of Black & Mild and despite significant one-time reductions in wholesale inventories.The four leading premium brands of Altria's tobacco operating companies display a great strength in the challenging economic and competitive environment, given the significant marketplace dislocations following the FET increase. Altria's tobacco operating companies focused on profitably managing their brands through the highly-competitive business environment while still leaving them well-positioned for a continued success in 2010 and beyond. We are particularly pleased with Marlboro's performance. Marlboro's full-year 2009 retail share was down only a tenth of a share point versus 2008 despite competitive spending on discount brands, which followed the increase in the federal excise tax. This comparatively stable retail share result from Marlboro was accomplished without compromising its profitability as the brand grew its margins on a year-over-year basis.Copenhagen and Skoal continued to benefit from USSTC's actions to return them to growth. Copenhagen's retail share growth was quite impressive as it grew 1.5 share points from the third to the fourth quarter behind the successful launch of Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen. Skoal also displayed a relatively strong retail share of stability in the fourth quarter when compared to some competitive brands, which appeared to be impacted by Copenhagen's new product launch.To build on this successful launch, Copenhagen plans to introduce two new Smokeless Products in the first quarter of 2010. Copenhagen Long Cut Straight will expand the brand into the Straight segment, which the brand has historically underserved; and Copenhagen Extra Long Cut Natural [Copenhagen Long Cut Natural] will strengthen the brand's position in the core Natural segment.  Skoal also has a number of initiatives planned to strengthen its position in the Smokeless Products category, which will unfold as the year progresses.Black & Mild also continued its strong share performance in 2009, growing 1.3 share points versus the prior-year period. Share growth was driven by the successful new product launches of Black & Mild Wood Tip, Black & Mild Wood Tip Wine and the equity campaign introduced at the beginning of the year, Enjoy Black & Mild. We are also pleased with the initial results for Black & Mild's new untipped product, Black & Mild Cigarillo, and expect to continue expanding the geographies with this product that sold. The Altria family of companies delivered these strong results as it completed a significant internal restructuring, which we believe positions us well for future success. The creation of three central support organizations: Altria Client Services, Altria Sales & Distribution and Altria Consumer Engagement Services, allows the delivery of services to the operating companies in a financially-disciplined and effective manner. The internal changes also encompass the continuation of significant cost reduction initiatives, including PM USA's closure of its Cabarrus North Carolina cigarette manufacturing facility. Across the Altria family of companies, $398 million in cost savings were delivered in 2009. Since 2006, over $1 billion in cost savings against the $1.5 billion cost reduction program have been delivered, and we expect to complete the program in 2011.Altria's business model of focusing on the strong premium brands of its tobacco operating companies, which are supported by highly-efficient and effective internal service providers, proved its strength last year. This business model allowed us to absorb significant external impacts on the Tobacco business while continuing to grow profits. Tobacco excise taxes at the federal and state levels increased substantially in 2009. The federal excise tax on a pack of cigarettes increased by 158% to $1.1 per pack, and there were correspondingly large percentage increases on Smokeless Tobacco and Machine-Made Large Cigar products. The state level, the year-end weighted average excise tax on cigarettes, increased by 12%, which is at the high end of the annual increases of 10% to 12% over the past several years.Continuing pressure on state budgets, mainly the excise tax,, increased proposals in many states in 2010. These tax increases had significant and expected impacts on category volume trends. PM USA believes that the Cigarette category declined an estimated 8% in 2009, in line with historical price elasticity. USSTC believes that Smokeless category's volume grew at an estimated range of 7% in 2009, while Middleton [John Middleton] believes that the Machine-Made Large Cigar category's growth slowed after the FET increase resulting in a category that slightly declined in 2009.There were also large declines in trade inventories across Tobacco categories during the year, which had a disproportionate impact on the shipment volumes of our tobacco operating companies. PM USA estimates the trade inventories for its cigarettes declined by 17% from the beginning to the end of the year. This decline disproportionately impacted PM USA's high-volume brands. We expect that 2009 Cigarette trade inventory fluctuations are likely to impact quarterly shipment comparisons for the Cigarette segment in 2010. In the first quarter of last year, the trade significantly reduced Cigarette inventories in anticipation of the FET increase on April 1. PM USA believes the trade inventory levels were reduced towards the end of the first quarter of 2009 to minimize poor tax payments. In the second quarter of 2009, the trade rebuilt their inventories but reduced them again in the second half of the year, as they adjusted the lower Cigarette category volume and the higher costs associated with maintaining Cigarette inventories. There were also significant declines in the trade inventories of the Smokeless Tobacco products of USSTC and the Machine-Made Large Cigars of Middleton. USSTC believes there were trade inventory declines on its products due to a number of factors including the discontinuation of multi-can promotional deals and its Rooster brand and the change in the shipping unit from 10 to five can rolls. Middleton believes that trade inventory declines on its products were due partially to the movement to the more efficient Altria sales and distribution system which significantly reduced wholesale delivery lead times.Although Altria's tobacco operating companies cannot predict what will happen with trade inventories in 2010, we believe that many of the significant changes that occurred in 2009 were likely one-time events as they we're largely caused by significant external events or changes in the practices of Altria's tobacco operating companies.The business environment for 2010 is likely to remain challenging, as adult consumers continue to be under economic pressure, face high unemployment. In addition, we are cautious about the outlook for state excise tax increases as well as the competitive environment. Given these uncertainties, our guidance for 2010 is prudent and what will likely be another challenging year. Altria forecast 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share will increase to a range of $1.85 to $1.89. This represents a 6% to 8% growth rate from an adjusted base of $1.75 per share in 2009.Due to PM USA's profitable FET-related pricing strategies last year, we expect the first and second quarters of this year to be more challenging for income growth comparison purposes than the back half of 2010. We, therefore, expect adjusted earnings per share growth to build in the second half of this year. Altria's financial success in the challenging environment of 2009 proves strength of our business model. It gives us confidence that we can continue delivering strong recurrence to our shareholders, which we expect will include future dividend growth. Beginning with our next declared dividend, we are changing the dividend payout ratio target to approximately 80% of adjusted earnings per share. This change re-affirms our commitment to delivering cash returns to our shareholders in the form of dividends and is reflective of the underlying financial strength of the company. This financial strength is anchored by our strong balance sheet, which includes our investment in SABMiller. All future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of Altria's Board of Directors.We are very pleased that in 2009 Altria delivered a total shareholder return of 39.1%. Altria has exceeded the total shareholder return of the S&P 500 every year for the last 10 years. I'll now turn the call over to Dave Beran, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's business segment results."

PM USA's objective last year was to maximize income while maintaining Marlboro's strong position in the Cigaret",1571,"Thank you, Mike. I'll start with the Cigarette segment which promptly managed its way to the FET-related marketplace dislocations of last year. PM USA's objective last year was to maximize income while maintaining Marlboro's strong position in the Cigarette segment. For the full-year 2009, reported operating companies income for the Cigarette segment increased by 3.9% to $5.1 billion, due primarily to higher list prices and cost savings, partially offset by lower volume and higher pretax charges related to the previously announced closure of its Cabarrus manufacturing  facility. When adjusted for restructuring charges, adjusted Cigarette segment's operating companies income grew by a strong 5.5% to $5.3 billion, despite significant Cigarette volume decline.PM USA's reported Cigarette shipment volume declined 12.2% for the full year, but was down an estimated 10.5% when adjusted for changes in trade inventories and calendar differences. PM USA estimates that total Cigarette industry volume declined an estimated 8% in 2009 when adjusted for changes in trade inventories and calendar differences.Marlboro performed well in 2009, as it nearly maintained its retail share position when compared to 2008 despite deliberate decisions to maximize earnings by moderately spending targeted promotional money in response to heightened competitive spending. We are also pleased that Marlboro Menthol maintained its position as the fastest-growing brand in the Menthol category, helped by the successful launch of Marlboro Blend 54 [Marlboro Blend No. 54]. PM USA also promptly reset the retail share position of the balance of its brand portfolio in the post-FET environment. These portfolio brands held a relatively stable-combined retail share position of just under eight share points for the back half of the year at a higher profit level in prior to the FET increase.The Cigarette segment also delivered strong results in the fourth quarter. Reported operating companies income increased 2.9% to $1.2 billion, due primarily to higher list prices and cost savings partially offset by lower volume. When adjusted for restructuring charges, adjusted operating companies income grew by 2.8%.Fourth quarter volume declined versus the year-ago period, reflecting the effects of the FET increases on April 1, but it continued to perform in line with historical price elasticity of negative 0.3. PM USA estimates that Cigarette industry volume declined by 10% in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus a year-ago period when adjusted for changes in trade inventories. PM USA's reported Cigarette shipment volume declined by 11.4%.Marlboro's fourth quarter retail share of 41.7% was down 2/10 of a share point from the third quarter. Marlboro's quarter-to-quarter share variability was driven primarily by fluctuations in competitive promotional spending, which increased in the fourth quarter. During the back half of 2009, Marlboro's retail share of 41.8% was essentially the same as the first half of the year and significantly higher than its share in the initial period of dislocation following the FET increase. Marlboro also grew its margins in the fourth quarter from the year-ago period as it benefited from a disciplined approach to promotional spending. Marlboro is well-positioned for success in 2010 and has a strong campaign plan to continue building its position in the Cigarette category. In the first quarter of 2010, PM USA began shipping two new variants of Marlboro called Marlboro Special Blend, to build up on its strong position in the core Non-Menthol business. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of the Cigarette segment in 2009. Income growth was strong despite significant volume declines and an intense competitive environment. Marlboro also showed strength as it profitably and successfully managed the pricing dislocations following the FET increase.The goal for the Smokeless segment last year was to return USSTC's premium retail share to growth and the company to successfully accomplish this objective. USSTC implemented a methodical plan, which unfolded throughout the year, that first enhanced the value equation with Copenhagen and Skoal and was then followed with brand-building equity programs, such as the launch of Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen. As a result, our Smokeless Products segments retail share grew by 9/10 of a share point from the third to the fourth quarter of 2009. Copenhagen drove this retail share increase as it grew its share in the Smokeless category by 1.5 share points to 24.7%, which was the highest quarterly retail share achieved for the brand in 2009. Skoal's retail share also performed comparatively well versus competitive brands in the fourth quarter as the brand achieved a retail share of 23.4%, a decline of 2/10 of a share point versus the third quarter. Smokeless Products volume in the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 3.6% from the prior-year period, driven by  a 7.8% increase in Copenhagen and Skoal's combined volume. After adjusting for trade inventory changes, pipeline volume for the expansion of Marlboro's news and the discontinuation of its Rooster brand, USSTC estimates that Smokeless Products shipment volume increase to approximately 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year of 2009, Smokeless Products volume decreased 2.4% versus the full-year 2008 but was up about 1% when adjusted for the same factors.Reported operating companies income for the Smokeless Products segments was $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $381 million for the full year. When adjusted for asset impairment, exit and integration costs and acquisition-related charges, fourth quarter operating companies income was $137 million, and for the full-year of 2009, it was $632 million.We are very pleased that our Smokeless Products segment retail share and volume returned to growth in the fourth quarter, and that the UST integration went smoothly and is substantially complete. We expect these accomplishments, combined with USSTC's future plans and strategies, to lead to continued success in 2010.In 2009, Middleton accomplished its objective of growing earnings in Black & Mild's retail share of the Machine-Made Large Cigar category. Reported operating companies income for the full year of 2009 grew by 7.3% to $176 million, but when adjusted for integration costs, operating companies income grew by 1.6% to $185 million. Black & Mild delivered another year of strong retail share results, growing its share of the Machine-Made Large Cigar category by 1.3 share points as it benefited from the successful launch of two new Wood Tip products.Middleton's Cigar volume for 2009 was down 3.6% versus the prior year. But when adjusted for changes in trade inventories, volume was estimated to be up slightly. The Cigar segment's fourth quarter reported operating companies income grew 2.8% to $37 million. When adjusted for integration costs, adjusted operating companies income declined 7.1% to $39 million. Black & Mild increased its retail share of the Machine-Made Large Cigar category by 1.2 share points to 30.6%, while Middleton's Cigar volume in the fourth quarter of 2009 declined by 2.7% due primarily to trade inventory reductions.We remain encouraged by St. Michelle's performance in a particularly challenging environment for the Wine business. Overall, the Wine retail industry volume, as measured by Nielson Total Wine Database for U.S. Food and Drug, increased 2% in 2009. In addition, adult consumers continued down trading to less expensive wines and reduced their own [ph] premise purchases at restaurants and bars. Despite these marketplace dynamics, St. Michelle's full-year 2009 retail volume, as measured by Nielson, grew by 10% as adult consumers increasingly chose its high-quality and affordable wines. St. Michelle's full-year 2009 Wine shipments were down 2.1% versus year-ago period to 6 million cases. Reported full-year operating companies income for the Wine segment was $43 million, but was $73 million when adjusted for acquisition-related charges of $30 million.St. Michelle's fourth quarter Wine shipments were 1.9 million cases, down 2.2% versus the year-ago period. The Wine segment's reported operating companies income was $21 million. But when adjusted for acquisition-related charges of $9 million, was $30 million. Let me conclude with Financial Services. Reported operating companies income for the full year of 2009 increased $199 million versus the prior-year period to $270 million due primarily to higher gains on asset sales and a lower increase to the allowance for losses in 2009, partially offset by a lower leased revenues as a result of lower investment balances. For the fourth quarter of 2009, Financial Services reported operating companies income increased $36 million versus the prior-year period due primarily to an increase in the allowance for losses in the fourth quarter of 2008. The allowance for losses at the end of 2009 was $266 million, reflecting a net decrease of $38 million for the year. Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping numbers. Marlboro's price GAAP, versus the lowest effective price cigarette, was 33% in the quarter. Marlboro's net pack price was $5.41, and the lowest effective price cigarette pack price was $4.05. The Cigarette discount categories fourth quarter retail share was 27.9%. The estimated weighted average Cigarette state excise tax at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.26 per pack. The 14 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico increased their Cigarette excise taxes in 2009 with an average increase of $0.52 per pack in those 14 states and D.C. Copenhagen's retail price was $4.21. And its net price GAAP, versus the leading discount brand, was approximately 48% in the fourth quarter. Our reported 2009 full-year tax rate was 34.2%. We anticipate that Altria's 2010 full-year effective tax rate on operations will be approximately 35.5%, and CapEx was $273 million in 2009. And the ongoing depreciation and amortization was $291 million.Operator, do we have any questions?"

You're going to lap up pre-FET quarter although, as I pointed out in my remarks, there were some inventory implications relative to that first quarter. And in the second quarter, you're likely to see, I think, a takeaway that's pretty consistent with historical projections. I can't guarantee that but we don't have any doubt that would tell us something to the contrary, although once again there were some pretty significant inventory adjustments that took place in the second quarter. So I think history is still the best guide here. But there are nuances and that's why I'm kind of forewarning people that we're going to see some effects on comparisons quarter-to-quarter in 2010. The nuances, both from an inventory point of view and from a tax point of view that came out of the activities in 2009."

I mean, they do make decisions about inventory that are based on their business model for a particular point in time. But I do think it's fair to say that the overall volume in the Cigarette category went down. And so I think that, in general, it's fair to say that you're going to see a kind of a one-time permanent reduction in the wholesale inventories and a corresponding reduction in retail inventories. That doesn't mean there won't be inventory fluctuations to take place quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month relative to other things that the trade is considering. I think you have had a similar occurrence take place in the Cigar business, largely though in our case driven by the fact that we changed the system by which we deliver and that the old system encouraged more building and carrying of higher levels of inventory. And that the new system, which is the same as the Cigarette delivery system, doesn't necessitate that because we are able to provide much better delivery service and so there's no need to make the investment. And, again, the tax rate went up so the cost-occurring inventory for wholesalers and retailers went up and that typically caused people to adjusted down on what they're going to carry in inventory. So I think, again, that's a couple of events that are permanent events, but they're not to have permanent implications all the time on the inventory. I can't tell you, but I would think that the overall system for our products would result in a lower level of inventory. In the Smokeless business, we have also made lots of adjustments in that business, both from a kind of packing sizes that we ship out, the whole promotion system has changed dramatically. We had spoil situations that were higher. And now we're in a situation, in particular with Copenhagen Wintergreen, which just taken off very nicely, where we have higher out of stocks that we'd like to have, so inventories will catch up there. So I think it's kind of a mixed bag that you're going to see in the 2010 relative to inventory in the Smokeless business. And we're going to expect to see growth in our Smokeless business and in the category overall. That may have some effects on inventory that will be positive, so I think that was a little bit different position."

And if you look at it for the nine months following the FET till the end of 2009, it averaged 41 6 or a 1% decline. And if you look at it in December it was actually up over 42 in the month of December. So it took a little bit of an adjustment. I would describe that as primarily due to the economic circumstance the country find itself in [ph], but not much. And still is showing good resiliency relative to demographics, Marlboro's demographic profile actually remains quite strong. We look at it in the 21 to 29 bracket in the 30 to 39 bracket in both of those situations. It has some substantially greater share, figure the difference between its national average share and its share on both of those demographics is bigger than most brands. So it remains quite strong with the demographic profile before it. And some of that is what fixed up the slack for business that it may lose in older demographics to discounted products. So it is done quite nicely. Its loyalty factor remains high, demographics actually looked quite good. And I think it ended the year in pretty good shape. So we want to keep it that way and I also think that as we see the economy improve, we'll also have the chance to as we have done in the past, regain some of the folks that might have lost to discounted products. So we feel pretty good about Marlboro."

I think that Altria continued delivering excellent results last year in what was, I think everybody would agree, as a very challenging environment. Challenges included, weak economic conditions, high unemployment, significant increases in the excise taxes at the federal state levels, which had impacts on the category volume trends of our Tobacco businesses, as well as the FDA assuming regulatory oversight over Tobacco. In the face of these challenges, Altria delivered strong financial results. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 6.1% to $1.75, which met our increased guidance. In addition, we increased our dividend by 6.3% to an annualized rate of $1.36 per share. Solid fundamentals of Altria's operating businesses enabled these financial results. Cigarette segment's adjusted operating companies income increased by 5.5%, $5.3 billion, as PM USA implemented a profitable strategy around the significant FET increase in the marketplace disruptions that followed. These disruptions caused dislocations on the retail share performances of the company's brands, but Marlboro displayed resiliency in what was an intensely competitive promotional environment.The UST integration is substantially complete, and USSTC's retail share returned to growth. We are particularly pleased with the strong share growth of Copenhagen in the fourth quarter of the year behind the successful launch of Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the combined volume of Copenhagen and Skoal grew 7.8% versus the prior-year period, which was ahead of the Smokeless category's volume growth rate. And the Cigar segment grew its adjusted operating companies income by 1.6% behind the continued retail share growth of Black & Mild and despite significant one-time reductions in wholesale inventories.The four leading premium brands of Altria's tobacco operating companies display great strength in the challenging economic and competitive environment, given the significant marketplace dislocations following the FET increase. Altria's tobacco operating companies focused on profitably managing their brands through the highly-competitive business environment, while still leaving them well-positioned for continued success in 2010 and beyond. We are particularly pleased with Marlboro's performance. Marlboro's full year 2009 retail share was down only a tenth of a share point versus 2008 despite competitive spending on discount brands, which followed the increase in the federal excise tax. This comparatively stable retail share result from Marlboro was accomplished without compromising its profitability as the brand grew its margins on a year-over-year basis.Copenhagen and Skoal continued to benefit from USSTC's actions to return them to growth. Copenhagen's retail share growth was quite impressive as it grew 1.5 share points from the third to the fourth quarter behind the successful launch of Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen. Skoal also displayed relatively strong retail share of stability in the fourth quarter when compared to some competitive brands, which appeared to be impacted by Copenhagen's new product launch.To build on this successful launch, Copenhagen plans to introduce two new Smokeless Products in the first quarter of 2010. Copenhagen Long Cut Straight will expand the brand into the Straight segment, which the brand has historically underserved; and Copenhagen Extra Long Cut Natural [Copenhagen Long Cut Natural] will strengthen the brand's position in the core Natural segment. Skoal also has a number of initiatives planned to strengthen its position in the Smokeless Products category, which will unfold as the year progresses.Black & Mild also continued its strong share performance in 2009, growing 1.3 share points versus the prior-year period. Share growth was driven by the successful new product launches of Black & Mild Wood Tip, Black & Mild Wood Tip Wine and the equity campaign introduced at the beginning of the year, Enjoy Black & Mild. We are also pleased with the initial results for Black & Mild's new untipped product, Black & Mild Cigarillo, and expect to continue expanding the geographies where this product is sold. The Altria family of companies delivered these strong results as it completed a significant internal restructuring, which we believe positions us well for future success. The creation of three central support organizations: Altria Client Services, Altria Sales & Distribution and Altria Consumer Engagement Services, allows the delivery of services to the operating companies in a financially-disciplined and effective manner. The internal changes also encompass the continuation of significant cost reduction initiatives, including PM USA's closure of its Cabarrus North Carolina cigarette manufacturing facility. Across the Altria family of companies, $398 million in cost savings were delivered in 2009. Since 2006, over $1 billion in cost savings against the $1.5 billion cost reduction program have been delivered, and we expect to complete the program in 2011.Altria's business model of focusing on the strong premium brands of its tobacco operating companies, which are supported by highly-efficient and effective internal service providers, proved its strength last year. This business model allowed us to absorb significant external impacts on the Tobacco business while continuing to grow profits. Tobacco excise taxes at the federal and state levels increased substantially in 2009. The federal excise tax on a pack of cigarettes increased by 158% to $1.01 per pack, and there were correspondingly large percentage increases on Smokeless Tobacco and Machine-Made Large Cigar products. The state level, the year-end weighted average excise tax on cigarettes, increased by 12%, which is at the high end of the annual increases of 10% to 12% over the past several years.Continuing pressure on state budgets, mainly the excise tax,, increased proposals in many states in 2010. These tax increases had significant and expected impacts on category volume trends. PM USA believes that the Cigarette category declined an estimated 8% in 2009, in line with historical price elasticity. USSTC believes that Smokeless category's volume grew at an estimated rate of 7% in 2009, while Middleton [John Middleton] believes that the Machine-Made Large Cigar category's growth slowed after the FET increase, resulting in a category that slightly declined in 2009.There were also large declines in trade inventories across Tobacco categories during the year, which had a disproportionate impact on the shipment volumes of our tobacco operating companies. PM USA estimates that trade inventories for its cigarettes declined by 17% from the beginning to the end of the year. This decline disproportionately impacted PM USA's high-volume brands. We expect that 2009 Cigarette trade inventory fluctuations are likely to impact quarterly shipment comparisons for the Cigarette segment in 2010. In the first quarter of last year, the trade significantly reduced Cigarette inventories in anticipation of the FET increase on April 1. PM USA believes the trade inventory levels were reduced towards the end of the first quarter of 2009 to minimize poor tax payments. In the second quarter of 2009, the trade rebuilt their inventories, but reduced them again in the second half of the year as they adjusted the lower Cigarette category volume and the higher costs associated with maintaining Cigarette inventories. There were also significant declines in the trade inventories of the Smokeless Tobacco products of USSTC and the Machine-Made Large Cigars of Middleton. USSTC believes there were trade inventory declines on its products due to a number of factors including the discontinuation of multi-can promotional deals and its Rooster brand and the change in the shipping unit from 10 to five can rolls. Middleton believes that trade inventory declines on its products were due partially to the movement to the more efficient Altria sales and distribution system, which significantly reduced wholesale delivery lead times.Although Altria's tobacco operating companies cannot predict what will happen with trade inventories in 2010, we believe that many of the significant changes that occurred in 2009 were likely one-time events as they we're largely caused by significant external events or changes in the practices of Altria's tobacco operating companies.The business environment for 2010 is likely to remain challenging, as adult consumers continue to be under economic pressure, face high unemployment. In addition, we are cautious about the outlook for state excise tax increases as well as the competitive environment. Given these uncertainties, our guidance for 2010 is prudent and what will likely be another challenging year. Altria forecast 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share will increase to a range of $1.85 to $1.89. This represents a 6% to 8% growth rate from an adjusted base of $1.75 per share in 2009.Due to PM USA's profitable FET-related pricing strategies last year, we expect the first and second quarters of this year to be more challenging for income growth comparison purposes than the back half of 2010. We, therefore, expect adjusted earnings per share growth to build in the second half of this year. Altria's financial success in the challenging environment of 2009 proves strength of our business model. It gives us confidence that we can continue delivering strong recurrence to our shareholders, which we expect will include future dividend growth. Beginning with our next declared dividend, we are changing the dividend payout ratio target to approximately 80% of adjusted earnings per share. This change re-affirms our commitment to delivering cash returns to our shareholders in the form of dividends and is reflective of the underlying financial strength of the company. This financial strength is anchored by our strong balance sheet, which includes our investment in SABMiller. All future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of Altria's Board of Directors.We are very pleased that in 2009 Altria delivered a total shareholder return of 39.1%. Altria has exceeded the total shareholder return of the S&P 500 every year for the last 10 years. I'll now turn the call over to Dave Beran, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's business segment results."

I'll start with the Cigarette segment which promptly managed its way to the FET-related marketplace dislocations of last year. PM USA's objective last year was to maximize income while maintaining Marlboro's strong position in the Cigarette segment. For the full-year 2009, reported operating companies income for the Cigarette segment increased by 3.9% to $5.1 billion, due primarily to higher list prices and cost savings, partially offset by lower volume and higher pretax charges related to the previously announced closure of its Cabarrus manufacturing  facility. When adjusted for restructuring charges, adjusted Cigarette segment's operating companies income grew by a strong 5.5% to $5.3 billion, despite significant Cigarette volume decline.PM USA's reported Cigarette shipment volume declined 12.2% for the full year, but was down an estimated 10.5% when adjusted for changes in trade inventories and calendar differences. PM USA estimates that total Cigarette industry volume declined an estimated 8% in 2009 when adjusted for changes in trade inventories and calendar differences.Marlboro performed well in 2009, as it nearly maintained its retail share position when compared to 2008 despite deliberate decisions to maximize earnings by moderately spending targeted promotional money in response to heightened competitive spending. We are also pleased that Marlboro Menthol maintained its position as the fastest-growing brand in the Menthol category, helped by the successful launch of Marlboro Blend 54 [Marlboro Blend No. 54]. PM USA also promptly reset the retail share position of the balance of its brand portfolio in the post-FET environment. These portfolio brands held a relatively stable-combined retail share position of just under eight share points for the back half of the year at a higher profit level in prior to the FET increase.The Cigarette segment also delivered strong results in the fourth quarter. Reported operating companies income increased 2.9% to $1.2 billion, due primarily to higher list prices and cost savings partially offset by lower volume. When adjusted for restructuring charges, adjusted operating companies income grew by 2.8%.Fourth quarter volume declined versus the year-ago period, reflecting the effects of the FET increases on April 1, but it continued to perform in line with historical price elasticity of negative 0.3. PM USA estimates that Cigarette industry volume declined by 10% in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus a year-ago period when adjusted for changes in trade inventories. PM USA's reported Cigarette shipment volume declined by 11.4%.Marlboro's fourth quarter retail share of 41.7% was down 2/10 of a share point from the third quarter. Marlboro's quarter-to-quarter share variability was driven primarily by fluctuations in competitive promotional spending, which increased in the fourth quarter. During the back half of 2009, Marlboro's retail share of 41.8% was essentially the same as the first half of the year and significantly higher than its share in the initial period of dislocation following the FET increase. Marlboro also grew its margins in the fourth quarter from the year-ago period as it benefited from a disciplined approach to promotional spending. Marlboro is well-positioned for success in 2010 and has a strong campaign plan to continue building its position in the Cigarette category. In the first quarter of 2010, PM USA began shipping two new variants of Marlboro called Marlboro Special Blend, to build up on its strong position in the core Non-Menthol business. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of the Cigarette segment in 2009. Income growth was strong despite significant volume declines and an intense competitive environment. Marlboro also showed strength as it profitably and successfully managed the pricing dislocations following the FET increase.The goal for the Smokeless segment last year was to return USSTC's premium retail share to growth and the company to successfully accomplish this objective. USSTC implemented a methodical plan, which unfolded throughout the year, that first enhanced the value equation with Copenhagen and Skoal and was then followed with brand-building equity programs, such as the launch of Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen. As a result, our Smokeless Products segments retail share grew by 9/10 of a share point from the third to the fourth quarter of 2009. Copenhagen drove this retail share increase as it grew its share in the Smokeless category by 1.5 share points to 24.7%, which was the highest quarterly retail share achieved for the brand in 2009. Skoal's retail share also performed comparatively well versus competitive brands in the fourth quarter as the brand achieved a retail share of 23.4%, a decline of 2/10 of a share point versus the third quarter. Smokeless Products volume in the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 3.6% from the prior-year period, driven by  a 7.8% increase in Copenhagen and Skoal's combined volume. After adjusting for trade inventory changes, pipeline volume for the expansion of Marlboro's news and the discontinuation of its Rooster brand, USSTC estimates that Smokeless Products shipment volume increase to approximately 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year of 2009, Smokeless Products volume decreased 2.4% versus the full-year 2008 but was up about 1% when adjusted for the same factors.Reported operating companies income for the Smokeless Products segments was $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $381 million for the full year. When adjusted for asset impairment, exit and integration costs and acquisition-related charges, fourth quarter operating companies income was $137 million, and for the full-year of 2009, it was $632 million.We are very pleased that our Smokeless Products segment retail share and volume returned to growth in the fourth quarter, and that the UST integration went smoothly and is substantially complete. We expect these accomplishments, combined with USSTC's future plans and strategies, to lead to continued success in 2010.In 2009, Middleton accomplished its objective of growing earnings in Black & Mild's retail share of the Machine-Made Large Cigar category. Reported operating companies income for the full year of 2009 grew by 7.3% to $176 million, but when adjusted for integration costs, operating companies income grew by 1.6% to $185 million. Black & Mild delivered another year of strong retail share results, growing its share of the Machine-Made Large Cigar category by 1.3 share points as it benefited from the successful launch of two new Wood Tip products.Middleton's Cigar volume for 2009 was down 3.6% versus the prior year. But when adjusted for changes in trade inventories, volume was estimated to be up slightly. The Cigar segment's fourth quarter reported operating companies income grew 2.8% to $37 million. When adjusted for integration costs, adjusted operating companies income declined 7.1% to $39 million. Black & Mild increased its retail share of the Machine-Made Large Cigar category by 1.2 share points to 30.6%, while Middleton's Cigar volume in the fourth quarter of 2009 declined by 2.7% due primarily to trade inventory reductions.We remain encouraged by St. Michelle's performance in a particularly challenging environment for the Wine business. Overall, the Wine retail industry volume, as measured by Nielson Total Wine Database for U.S. Food and Drug, increased 2% in 2009. In addition, adult consumers continued down trading to less expensive wines and reduced their own [ph] premise purchases at restaurants and bars. Despite these marketplace dynamics, St. Michelle's full-year 2009 retail volume, as measured by Nielson, grew by 10% as adult consumers increasingly chose its high-quality and affordable wines. St. Michelle's full-year 2009 Wine shipments were down 2.1% versus year-ago period to 6 million cases. Reported full-year operating companies income for the Wine segment was $43 million, but was $73 million when adjusted for acquisition-related charges of $30 million.St. Michelle's fourth quarter Wine shipments were 1.9 million cases, down 2.2% versus the year-ago period. The Wine segment's reported operating companies income was $21 million. But when adjusted for acquisition-related charges of $9 million, was $30 million. Let me conclude with Financial Services. Reported operating companies income for the full year of 2009 increased $199 million versus the prior-year period to $270 million due primarily to higher gains on asset sales and a lower increase to the allowance for losses in 2009, partially offset by a lower leased revenues as a result of lower investment balances. For the fourth quarter of 2009, Financial Services reported operating companies income increased $36 million versus the prior-year period due primarily to an increase in the allowance for losses in the fourth quarter of 2008. The allowance for losses at the end of 2009 was $266 million, reflecting a net decrease of $38 million for the year. Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping numbers. Marlboro's price GAAP, versus the lowest effective price cigarette, was 33% in the quarter. Marlboro's net pack price was $5.41, and the lowest effective price cigarette pack price was $4.05. The Cigarette discount categories fourth quarter retail share was 27.9%. The estimated weighted average Cigarette state excise tax at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.26 per pack. The 14 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico increased their Cigarette excise taxes in 2009 with an average increase of $0.52 per pack in those 14 states and D.C. Copenhagen's retail price was $4.21. And its net price GAAP, versus the leading discount brand, was approximately 48% in the fourth quarter. Our reported 2009 full-year tax rate was 34.2%. We anticipate that Altria's 2010 full-year effective tax rate on operations will be approximately 35.5%, and CapEx was $273 million in 2009. And the ongoing depreciation and amortization was $291 million.Operator, do we have any questions?"

And in the second quarter, you're likely to see, I think, a takeaway that's pretty consistent with historical projections. I can't guarantee that but we don't have any doubt that would tell us something to the contrary, although once again there were some pretty significant inventory adjustments that took place in the second quarter. So I think history is still the best guide here. But there are nuances and that's why I'm kind of forewarning people that we're going to see some effects on comparisons quarter-to-quarter in 2010. The nuances, both from an inventory point of view and from a tax point of view that came out of the activities in 2009."

I mean, they do make decisions about inventory that are based on their business model for a particular point in time. But I do think it's fair to say that the overall volume in the Cigarette category went down. And so I think that, in general, it's fair to say that you're going to see a kind of a one-time permanent reduction in the wholesale inventories and a corresponding reduction in retail inventories. That doesn't mean there won't be inventory fluctuations to take place quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month relative to other things that the trade is considering. I think you have had a similar occurrence take place in the Cigar business, largely though in our case driven by the fact that we changed the system by which we deliver and that the old system encouraged more building and carrying of higher levels of inventory. And that the new system, which is the same as the Cigarette delivery system, doesn't necessitate that because we are able to provide much better delivery service and so there's no need to make the investment. And, again, the tax rate went up so the cost-occurring inventory for wholesalers and retailers went up and that typically caused people to adjusted down on what they're going to carry in inventory. So I think, again, that's a couple of events that are permanent events, but they're not to have permanent implications all the time on the inventory. I can't tell you, but I would think that the overall system for our products would result in a lower level of inventory. In the Smokeless business, we have also made lots of adjustments in that business, both from a kind of packing sizes that we ship out, the whole promotion system has changed dramatically. We had spoil situations that were higher. And now we're in a situation, in particular with Copenhagen Wintergreen, which just taken off very nicely, where we have higher out of stocks that we'd like to have, so inventories will catch up there. So I think it's kind of a mixed bag that you're going to see in the 2010 relative to inventory in the Smokeless business. And we're going to expect to see growth in our Smokeless business and in the category overall. That may have some effects on inventory that will be positive, so I think that was a little bit different position."

I really do think, since I've been around long enough to have gone through a couple of recessions on the brand, I really do think that the brand's performance for the last year has been quite remarkable compared to the situation that it found itself in on the prior two occasions that I can remember that I was involved with. Because what's happened here is, that if you look at Marlboro's share for the 12 months ending in March of 2009 right prior to the FET, it was averaging monthly, about 42. And if you look at it for the nine months following the FET till the end of 2009, it averaged 41 6 or a 1% decline. And if you look at it in December, it was actually up over 42 in the month of December. So it took a little bit of an adjustment. I would describe that as primarily due to the economic circumstance the country finds itself in, but not much and still is showing good resiliency relative to demographics. Marlboro's demographic profile actually remains quite strong. We look at it in the 21 to 29 bracket, in the 30 to 39 bracket in both of those situations. It has a substantially greater share, figure the difference between its national average share and its share on both of those demographics is bigger than most brands. So it remains quite strong with the demographic profile before it. And some of that is what picks up the slack for business that it may lose in older demographics to discounted products. So it is done quite nicely. Its loyalty factor remains high, demographics actually look quite good. And I think it ended the year in pretty good shape. So we want to keep it that way, and I also think that as we see the economy improve, we'll also have the chance to, as we have done in the past, regain some of the folks that we have might have lost to discounted products. So we feel pretty good about Marlboro."

I think that Altria continued delivering excellent results last year in what was, I think everybody would agree, as a very challenging environment. Challenges included, weak economic conditions, high unemployment, significant increases in the excise taxes at the federal state levels, which had impacts on the category volume trends of our Tobacco businesses, as well as the FDA assuming regulatory oversight over Tobacco. In the face of these challenges, Altria delivered strong financial results.  Adjusted earnings per share increased by 6.1% to $1.75, which met our increased guidance. In addition, we increased our dividend by 6.3% to an annualized rate of $1.36 per share. Solid fundamentals of Altria's operating businesses enabled these financial results.  Cigarette segment's adjusted operating companies income increased by 5.5%, $5.3 billion, as PM USA implemented a profitable strategy around the significant FET increase in the marketplace disruptions that followed. These disruptions caused dislocations on the retail share performances of the company's brands, but Marlboro displayed resiliency in what was an intensely competitive promotional environment.  The UST integration is substantially complete, and USSTC's retail share returned to growth. We are particularly pleased with the strong share growth of Copenhagen in the fourth quarter of the year behind the successful launch of Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the combined volume of Copenhagen and Skoal grew 7.8% versus the prior-year period, which was ahead of the Smokeless category's volume growth rate. And the Cigar segment grew its adjusted operating companies income by 1.6% behind the continued retail share growth of Black & Mild and despite significant one-time reductions in wholesale inventories.  The four leading premium brands of Altria's tobacco operating companies display great strength in the challenging economic and competitive environment, given the significant marketplace dislocations following the FET increase. Altria's tobacco operating companies focused on profitably managing their brands through the highly-competitive business environment, while still leaving them well-positioned for continued success in 2010 and beyond.  We are particularly pleased with Marlboro's performance. Marlboro's full year 2009 retail share was down only a tenth of a share point versus 2008 despite competitive spending on discount brands, which followed the increase in the federal excise tax. This comparatively stable retail share result from Marlboro was accomplished without compromising its profitability as the brand grew its margins on a year-over-year basis.  Copenhagen and Skoal continued to benefit from USSTC's actions to return them to growth. Copenhagen's retail share growth was quite impressive as it grew 1.5 share points from the third to the fourth quarter behind the successful launch of Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen. Skoal also displayed relatively strong retail share of stability in the fourth quarter when compared to some competitive brands, which appeared to be impacted by Copenhagen's new product launch.  To build on this successful launch, Copenhagen plans to introduce two new Smokeless Products in the first quarter of 2010. Copenhagen Long Cut Straight will expand the brand into the Straight segment, which the brand has historically underserved; and Copenhagen Extra Long Cut Natural [Copenhagen Long Cut Natural] will strengthen the brand's position in the core Natural segment. Skoal also has a number of initiatives planned to strengthen its position in the Smokeless Products category, which will unfold as the year progresses.  Black & Mild also continued its strong share performance in 2009, growing 1.3 share points versus the prior-year period. Share growth was driven by the successful new product launches of Black & Mild Wood Tip, Black & Mild Wood Tip Wine and the equity campaign introduced at the beginning of the year, Enjoy Black & Mild. We are also pleased with the initial results for Black & Mild's new untipped product, Black & Mild Cigarillo, and expect to continue expanding the geographies where this product is sold.  The Altria family of companies delivered these strong results as it completed a significant internal restructuring, which we believe positions us well for future success. The creation of three central support organizations: Altria Client Services, Altria Sales & Distribution and Altria Consumer Engagement Services, allows the delivery of services to the operating companies in a financially-disciplined and effective manner. The internal changes also encompass the continuation of significant cost reduction initiatives, including PM USA's closure of its Cabarrus North Carolina cigarette manufacturing facility.  Across the Altria family of companies, $398 million in cost savings were delivered in 2009. Since 2006, over $1 billion in cost savings against the $1.5 billion cost reduction program have been delivered, and we expect to complete the program in 2011.  Altria's business model of focusing on the strong premium brands of its tobacco operating companies, which are supported by highly-efficient and effective internal service providers, proved its strength last year. This business model allowed us to absorb significant external impacts on the Tobacco business while continuing to grow profits. Tobacco excise taxes at the federal and state levels increased substantially in 2009. The federal excise tax on a pack of cigarettes increased by 158% to $1.01 per pack, and there were correspondingly large percentage increases on Smokeless Tobacco and Machine-Made Large Cigar products. The state level, the year-end weighted average excise tax on cigarettes, increased by 12%, which is at the high end of the annual increases of 10% to 12% over the past several years.  Continuing pressure on state budgets, mainly the excise tax,, increased proposals in many states in 2010. These tax increases had significant and expected impacts on category volume trends. PM USA believes that the Cigarette category declined an estimated 8% in 2009, in line with historical price elasticity. USSTC believes that Smokeless category's volume grew at an estimated rate of 7% in 2009, while Middleton [John Middleton] believes that the Machine-Made Large Cigar category's growth slowed after the FET increase, resulting in a category that slightly declined in 2009.  There were also large declines in trade inventories across Tobacco categories during the year, which had a disproportionate impact on the shipment volumes of our tobacco operating companies. PM USA estimates that trade inventories for its cigarettes declined by 17% from the beginning to the end of the year. This decline disproportionately impacted PM USA's high-volume brands.  We expect that 2009 Cigarette trade inventory fluctuations are likely to impact quarterly shipment comparisons for the Cigarette segment in 2010. In the first quarter of last year, the trade significantly reduced Cigarette inventories in anticipation of the FET increase on April 1. PM USA believes the trade inventory levels were reduced towards the end of the first quarter of 2009 to minimize poor tax payments.  In the second quarter of 2009, the trade rebuilt their inventories, but reduced them again in the second half of the year as they adjusted the lower Cigarette category volume and the higher costs associated with maintaining Cigarette inventories. There were also significant declines in the trade inventories of the Smokeless Tobacco products of USSTC and the Machine-Made Large Cigars of Middleton.  USSTC believes there were trade inventory declines on its products due to a number of factors including the discontinuation of multi-can promotional deals and its Rooster brand and the change in the shipping unit from 10 to five can rolls. Middleton believes that trade inventory declines on its products were due partially to the movement to the more efficient Altria sales and distribution system, which significantly reduced wholesale delivery lead times.  Although Altria's tobacco operating companies cannot predict what will happen with trade inventories in 2010, we believe that many of the significant changes that occurred in 2009 were likely one-time events as they we're largely caused by significant external events or changes in the practices of Altria's tobacco operating companies. The business environment for 2010 is likely to remain challenging, as adult consumers continue to be under economic pressure, face high unemployment. In addition, we are cautious about the outlook for state excise tax increases as well as the competitive environment. Given these uncertainties, our guidance for 2010 is prudent and what will likely be another challenging year. Altria forecast 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share will increase to a range of $1.85 to $1.89. This represents a 6% to 8% growth rate from an adjusted base of $1.75 per share in 2009.  Due to PM USA's profitable FET-related pricing strategies last year, we expect the first and second quarters of this year to be more challenging for income growth comparison purposes than the back half of 2010. We, therefore, expect adjusted earnings per share growth to build in the second half of this year.  Altria's financial success in the challenging environment of 2009 proves strength of our business model. It gives us confidence that we can continue delivering strong recurrence to our shareholders, which we expect will include future dividend growth.  Beginning with our next declared dividend, we are changing the dividend payout ratio target to approximately 80% of adjusted earnings per share. This change re-affirms our commitment to delivering cash returns to our shareholders in the form of dividends and is reflective of the underlying financial strength of the company. This financial strength is anchored by our strong balance sheet, which includes our investment in SABMiller. All future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of Altria's Board of Directors.  We are very pleased that in 2009 Altria delivered a total shareholder return of 39.1%. Altria has exceeded the total shareholder return of the S&P 500 every year for the last 10 years.  I'll now turn the call over to Dave Beran, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's business segment results."

I'll start with the Cigarette segment which promptly managed its way to the FET-related marketplace dislocations of last year. PM USA's objective last year was to maximize income while maintaining Marlboro's strong position in the Cigarette segment.  For the full year 2009, reported operating companies income for the Cigarette segment increased by 3.9% to $5.1 billion, due primarily to higher list prices and cost savings, partially offset by lower volume and higher pretax charges related to the previously announced closure of its Cabarrus manufacturing  facility. When adjusted for restructuring charges, adjusted Cigarette segment's operating companies income grew by a strong 5.5% to $5.3 billion, despite significant Cigarette volume decline.  PM USA's reported Cigarette shipment volume declined 12.2% for the full year, but was down an estimated 10.5% when adjusted for changes in trade inventories and calendar differences. PM USA estimates that total Cigarette industry volume declined an estimated 8% in 2009 when adjusted for changes in trade inventories and calendar differences.  Marlboro performed well in 2009, as it nearly maintained its retail share position when compared to 2008 despite deliberate decisions to maximize earnings by moderately spending targeted promotional money in response to heightened competitive spending. We are also pleased that Marlboro Menthol maintained its position as the fastest-growing brand in the Menthol category, helped by the successful launch of Marlboro Blend 54 [Marlboro Blend No. 54].  PM USA also promptly reset the retail share position of the balance of its brand portfolio in the post-FET environment. These portfolio brands held a relatively stable-combined retail share position of just under eight share points for the back half of the year at a higher profit level in prior to the FET increase.  The Cigarette segment also delivered strong results in the fourth quarter. Reported operating companies income increased 2.9% to $1.2 billion, due primarily to higher list prices and cost savings partially offset by lower volume. When adjusted for restructuring charges, adjusted operating companies income grew by 2.8%.  Fourth quarter volume declined versus the year-ago period, reflecting the effects of the FET increases on April 1, but it continued to perform in line with historical price elasticity of negative 0.3. PM USA estimates that Cigarette industry volume declined by 10% in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus a year-ago period when adjusted for changes in trade inventories. PM USA's reported Cigarette shipment volume declined by 11.4%.  Marlboro's fourth quarter retail share of 41.7% was down 2/10 of a share point from the third quarter. Marlboro's quarter-to-quarter share variability was driven primarily by fluctuations in competitive promotional spending, which increased in the fourth quarter. During the back half of 2009, Marlboro's retail share of 41.8% was essentially the same as the first half of the year and significantly higher than its share in the initial period of dislocation following the FET increase. Marlboro also grew its margins in the fourth quarter from the year-ago period as it benefited from a disciplined approach to promotional spending.  Marlboro is well-positioned for success in 2010 and has a strong campaign plan to continue building its position in the Cigarette category. In the first quarter of 2010, PM USA began shipping two new variants of Marlboro called Marlboro Special Blend, to build up on its strong position in the core Non-Menthol business. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of the Cigarette segment in 2009. Income growth was strong despite significant volume declines and an intense competitive environment. Marlboro also showed strength as it profitably and successfully managed the pricing dislocations following the FET increase.  The goal for the Smokeless segment last year was to return USSTC's premium retail share to growth and the company to successfully accomplish this objective. USSTC implemented a methodical plan, which unfolded throughout the year, that first enhanced the value equation with Copenhagen and Skoal and was then followed with brand-building equity programs, such as the launch of Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen. As a result, our Smokeless Products segments retail share grew by 9/10 of a share point from the third to the fourth quarter of 2009. Copenhagen drove this retail share increase as it grew its share in the Smokeless category by 1.5 share points to 24.7%, which was the highest quarterly retail share achieved for the brand in 2009.  Skoal's retail share also performed comparatively well versus competitive brands in the fourth quarter as the brand achieved a retail share of 23.4%, a decline of 2/10 of a share point versus the third quarter. Smokeless Products volume in the fourth quarter of 2009 increased 3.6% from the prior-year period, driven by  a 7.8% increase in Copenhagen and Skoal's combined volume.  After adjusting for trade inventory changes, pipeline volume for the expansion of Marlboro's news and the discontinuation of its Rooster brand, USSTC estimates that Smokeless Products shipment volume increase to approximately 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year of 2009, Smokeless Products volume decreased 2.4% versus the full-year 2008 but was up about 1% when adjusted for the same factors.  Reported operating companies income for the Smokeless Products segments was $79 million in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $381 million for the full year. When adjusted for asset impairment, exit and integration costs and acquisition-related charges, fourth quarter operating companies income was $137 million, and for the full-year of 2009, it was $632 million.  We are very pleased that our Smokeless Products segment retail share and volume returned to growth in the fourth quarter, and that the UST integration went smoothly and is substantially complete. We expect these accomplishments, combined with USSTC's future plans and strategies, to lead to continued success in 2010.  In 2009, Middleton accomplished its objective of growing earnings in Black & Mild's retail share of the Machine-Made Large Cigar category. Reported operating companies income for the full year of 2009 grew by 7.3% to $176 million, but when adjusted for integration costs, operating companies income grew by 1.6% to $185 million. Black & Mild delivered another year of strong retail share results, growing its share of the Machine-Made Large Cigar category by 1.3 share points as it benefited from the successful launch of two new Wood Tip products.  Middleton's Cigar volume for 2009 was down 3.6% versus the prior year. But when adjusted for changes in trade inventories, volume was estimated to be up slightly. The Cigar segment's fourth quarter reported operating companies income grew 2.8% to $37 million. When adjusted for integration costs, adjusted operating companies income declined 7.1% to $39 million. Black & Mild increased its retail share of the Machine-Made Large Cigar category by 1.2 share points to 30.6%, while Middleton's Cigar volume in the fourth quarter of 2009 declined by 2.7% due primarily to trade inventory reductions.  We remain encouraged by St. Michelle's performance in a particularly challenging environment for the Wine business. Overall, the Wine retail industry volume, as measured by Nielson Total Wine Database for U.S. Food and Drug, increased 2% in 2009. In addition, adult consumers continued down trading to less expensive wines and reduced their own [ph] premise purchases at restaurants and bars. Despite these marketplace dynamics, St. Michelle's full-year 2009 retail volume, as measured by Nielson, grew by 10% as adult consumers increasingly chose its high-quality and affordable wines.  St. Michelle's full-year 2009 Wine shipments were down 2.1% versus year-ago period to 6 million cases. Reported full-year operating companies income for the Wine segment was $43 million, but was $73 million when adjusted for acquisition-related charges of $30 million.  St. Michelle's fourth quarter Wine shipments were 1.9 million cases, down 2.2% versus the year-ago period. The Wine segment's reported operating companies income was $21 million. But when adjusted for acquisition-related charges of $9 million, was $30 million.  Let me conclude with Financial Services. Reported operating companies income for the full year of 2009 increased $199 million versus the prior-year period to $270 million due primarily to higher gains on asset sales and a lower increase to the allowance for losses in 2009, partially offset by a lower leased revenues as a result of lower investment balances.  For the fourth quarter of 2009, Financial Services reported operating companies income increased $36 million versus the prior-year period due primarily to an increase in the allowance for losses in the fourth quarter of 2008. The allowance for losses at the end of 2009 was $266 million, reflecting a net decrease of $38 million for the year.  Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping numbers. Marlboro's price GAAP, versus the lowest effective price cigarette, was 33% in the quarter. Marlboro's net pack price was $5.41, and the lowest effective price cigarette pack price was $4.05.  The Cigarette discount categories fourth quarter retail share was 27.9%. The estimated weighted average Cigarette state excise tax at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.26 per pack. The 14 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico increased their Cigarette excise taxes in 2009 with an average increase of $0.52 per pack in those 14 states and D.C. Copenhagen's retail price was $4.21. And its net price GAAP, versus the leading discount brand, was approximately 48% in the fourth quarter.  Our reported 2009 full year tax rate was 34.2%. We anticipate that Altria's 2010 full-year effective tax rate on operations will be approximately 35.5%, and CapEx was $273 million in 2009. And the ongoing depreciation and amortization was $291 million.  Operator, do we have any questions?"

And in the second quarter, you're likely to see, I think, a takeaway that's pretty consistent with historical projections. I can't guarantee that but we don't have any doubt that would tell us something to the contrary, although once again there were some pretty significant inventory adjustments that took place in the second quarter. So I think history is still the best guide here. But there are nuances and that's why I'm kind of forewarning people that we're going to see some effects on comparisons quarter-to-quarter in 2010.

That doesn't mean there won't be inventory fluctuations to take place quarter-to-quarter or month-to-month relative to other things that the trade is considering. I think you have had a similar occurrence take place in the Cigar business, largely though in our case driven by the fact that we changed the system by which we deliver and that the old system encouraged more building and carrying of higher levels of inventory. And that the new system, which is the same as the Cigarette delivery system, doesn't necessitate that because we are able to provide much better delivery service and so there's no need to make the investment. And, again, the tax rate went up so the cost-occurring inventory for wholesalers and retailers went up and that typically caused people to adjusted down on what they're going to carry in inventory. So I think, again, that's a couple of events that are permanent events, but they're not to have permanent implications all the time on the inventory. I can't tell you, but I would think that the overall system for our products would result in a lower level of inventory. In the Smokeless business, we have also made lots of adjustments in that business, both from a kind of packing sizes that we ship out, the whole promotion system has changed dramatically. We had spoil situations that were higher. And now we're in a situation, in particular with Copenhagen Wintergreen, which just taken off very nicely, where we have higher out of stocks that we'd like to have, so inventories will catch up there. So I think it's kind of a mixed bag that you're going to see in the 2010 relative to inventory in the Smokeless business. And we're going to expect to see growth in our Smokeless business and in the category overall. That may have some effects on inventory that will be positive, so I think that was a little bit different position."

I really do think since I've been around long enough to have gone through a couple of recessions on the brand, I really do think that the brand's performance for the last year has been quite remarkable compared to the situation that it found itself in on the prior two occasions that I can remember that I was involved with. Because what's happened here is that if you look at Marlboro's share for the 12 months ending in March of 2009 right prior to the FET, it was averaging monthly about 42. And if you look at it for the nine months following the FET to the end of 2009, it averaged 41.6% or a 1% decline. And if you look at it in December, it was actually up over 42 in the month of December. So it took a little bit of an adjustment. I would describe that as primarily due to the economic circumstance the country finds itself in, but not much, and still is showing good resiliency. Relative to demographics, Marlboro's demographic profile actually remains quite strong. We look at it in the 21 to 29 bracket and the 30 to 39 bracket in both of those situations. It has a substantially greater share, bigger. The difference between its national average share and its share on both of those demographics is bigger than most brands. So it remains quite strong with a good demographic profile before it, and some of that is what picks up the slack for business that it may lose in the older demographics to discounted products. So it is done quite nicely. It's a loyalty factor remains high, demographics actually look quite good, and I think it ended the year in pretty good shape. So we want to keep it that way, and I also think that as we see the economy improve, we'll also have the chance to, as we have done in the past, regain some of the folks that we have might have lost to discounted brands. So we feel pretty good about Marlboro."

We are pleased with the performance of Altria and its operating companies in the first quarter of 2010. Altria delivered strong adjusted earnings per share growth of 7.7%.

Altria delivered strong adjusted earnings per share growth of 7.7%. In addition, we increased our dividend by 2.9% on an annualized rate of $1.40 per share. Reflecting our new dividend payout ratio target of approximately 80% of adjusted earnings per share.
Despite the continuing challenges of high unemployment and low consumer confidence as well as intensely competitive environment Altria’s operating companies continue to perform well.
Cigarettes segment’s adjusted operating companies income increased by 6.4% over the comparable year ago period to $1.3 billion. Marlboro achieved record retail share results as the brand grew its quarterly retail share both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis.
We are particularly pleased with the Cigarettes segment results considering that the prior year comparison period included cigarette segment’s adjusted operating companies’ income growth of 10.7% and a previous Marlboro retail share record high of 42.4%.
The smokeless products segment reported very strong adjusted operating companies’ income growth of 49.2% to $188 million. Copenhagen and Skoal’s combined retail share increased both on a sequential and comparable year-over-year basis and the brands combined shipment volume grew faster than the smokeless categories growth rate for the second straight quarter. Importantly, Copenhagen reestablished itself as the largest smokeless brand as measured by retail share in the quarter.
The Cigar segment’s adjusted operating companies’ income declined by 15.8% to $48 million. Middleton have very difficult income comparison against the first quarter of 2009 when its adjusted operating companies’ income grew by a very strong 32.6% due to the timing of trade purchases around the 2009 FET increase.
Wine segment’s adjusted operating companies’ income grew 33.3% to $12 million. Ste. Michelle reported strong volume growth versus the prior year period led by the 44.9% shipment growth of a Chateau Ste. Michelle wines.
Ste. Michelle continues to be recognized as a producer of a broad portfolio of high quality wines as wine industry publications had given over 30 of its wines ratings of 90 or better already this year.
The four premium brands of Altria’s tobacco operating companies perform well in a challenging environment. Marlboro had a particularly strong performance as I mentioned. The brand launched two Special Blend non-Menthol products in the quarter which contributed to the brand strong retail share performance.
The strength of these two new products help Marlboro grow its retail share one share point from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of this year, despite continued heavy competitive spending on non-Menthol discount products.
PM USA plans to broaden the availability of two more variances. Special Blend in a hundreds length in the second quarter of 2010 to build on this success.
Marlboro also launched Marlboro’s Snus nationally, is a spitless, smokeless tobacco alternative. Since the products did not shift nationally to wholesale until late in the first quarter of 2010 it is premature to talk about retail share and adult consumer feedback. However, based on our test markets we believe Marlboro Snus has a good opportunity for future growth.
Copenhagen continued its strong retail share performance behind long cut Wintergreen which was successfully launched in the fourth quarter of 2009. USSTC began shipping Copenhagen Long Cut straight and extra Long Cut natural at the end of the first quarter of 2010. We anticipate that these products will contribute to Copenhagen’s growth this year and beyond.
Skoal showed solid momentum as it grew retail share each month throughout the first quarter behind a slim can pouch initiative. The brand will begin its Skoal up the summer campaign later this quarter which is an integrated program of enhanced products and marketing activities to strengthen the brand’s position in the marketplace.
Black & Mild continued growing its retail share versus the first quarter of last year despite a challenging environment due to an increase in competitive promotional activities. Middletown is monitoring the competitive environment and plans to respond appropriately to defend Black & Mild’s marketplace position.
New products will play in an important role in the brand strong retail share growth. And in the second quarter Middleton plans to introduce Black & Mild Royale to continue building its strong position in the machine-made large cigar category.
As expected, trade inventory changes last year caused by the April 1, 2009 FET increase impacted shipment comparisons across all the tobacco segments for the first quarter of 2010 versus the comparable year ago period.
Last year, the trade significantly reduced cigarette inventories in advance of the FET increase. And in the second quarter they rebuild these inventories. In the first quarter of this year the trade increased their inventory levels from the beginning to the end of the quarter.
Due to these inventory dynamics PM USA’s reported 2010 first quarter cigarette shipment volume was down only 0.7% when compared to the first quarter of 2009. However, when adjusted for these inventory changes PM USA estimates that its shipments declined approximately 11% versus the year ago period and that the cigarette category declined approximately 10% in line with historical price elasticity.
Smokeless product shipment comparisons were also impacted by trade inventory completions in the first quarter of 2009 in advance of the FET increase, as well as the timing of PM USA and USSTC’s new smokeless product launched in the first quarter of this year.
Reported first quarter smokeless shipments were up 21.9% versus the comparable year ago period. But when adjusted for the timing of new product launches trade inventory movements, the discontinuation of Rooster and other factors smokeless shipments were often estimated 5%.
Copenhagen and Skoal’s combined first quarter adjusted shipment volume increase and estimated 11% when adjusted for the new product pipeline volume and trade inventory changes as well as other factors. The company’s estimate that the smokeless category continue to grow at a rate of about 7% in the first quarter of 2010.
Cigar shipment comparisons were also impacted by advance in the first quarter of 2009. The trade increase cigar inventories and advance of the FET increase since there was no floor tax on machine-made cigars. And the initial shipments of Black & Mild Wood Tip also occurred in the first quarter of last year.
For the balance of 2009 and into the first quarter of 2010 the trade reduced inventories of Middleton’s machine-made large cigars. The combination of all of these year-over-year dynamics had a substantial impact on Middleton’s first quarter reported shipments.
Middleton’s reported shipments were down 18% versus the first quarter of last year. But when adjusted for trade inventory changes were estimated to be essentially flat. Middleton believes that when adjusted for FET related impacts the machine-made large cigar category was essentially flat.
The Altria family of companies continues to make excellent progress on its $1.5 billion cost reduction program. $43 million of cost savings were achieved across the enterprise on the first quarter of 2010 for 1.1 billion in total savings since the program inception of the 2006 cost base. We remain confident that we will realize the $419 million an additional cost savings by the end of 2011.
We continue to believe that the UST acquisition will be accretive to Altria’s adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2010. First quarter financial results for the smokeless product segment are in line with our year-to-date expectations. These segment results are not comparable to U.S. SEC’s reported results prior to Altria’s acquisition as they now include smokeless product results for PM USA.
In addition, we remain on track to realize the $300 million in cost savings resulting from the acquisition. The impact of these cost savings is reflected partially in the smokeless product segment operating companies’ income performance. With the balance reflected in other business areas across the Altria family of companies due to our new more efficient corporate structure.
We expect the second quarter of this year to be particularly challenging for income growth comparison purposes. Due to different trade inventory dynamics in 2009 versus 2010 we continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share growth to build in the second half of this year.
For the full year, Altria reaffirms that its guidance for 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $1.85 to $1.89, which represents a 6% to 8% growth rate from an adjusted base of $1.75 per share in 2009.
Now, I will now turn the call over to Dave Beran, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's business segment results.

296308,86395613,56875,"Altria Group Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-21-2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you Mike. I'll begin by discussing our cigarette segment results. During the quarter PM USA successfully executed its objective of maximizing income while maintaining Marlboro's strong position in the cigarette segment.For the first quarter of 201",1213,"Thank you Mike. I'll begin by discussing our cigarette segment results. During the quarter PM USA successfully executed its objective of maximizing income while maintaining Marlboro's strong position in the cigarette segment.
For the first quarter of 2010, reported operating companies’ income for the cigarette segment increased by 7.6% to $1.2 billion, due primarily to higher list prices and lower pretax charges related to the previously announced closure of its Cabarrus manufacturing facility, partially offset by lower volume.
When adjusted for restructuring charges, first quarter adjusted cigarette segment's operating companies’ income grew by a strong 6.7% to $1.3 billion versus the same year ago period.
Trade inventory increases in the first quarter of 2010 help cigarette segment volume and income results for the period. We expect that the trade will return inventories to more normal levels which will have a corresponding impact on PM USA's business results when it occurs.
After adjusting for trade inventory changes PM USA’s first quarter cigarette shipment volume declined by approximately 11% which is greater than the estimated industry decline rate of approximately 10%, primarily due to retail share losses when its portfolio brands of 1 share point.
PM USA possibly reset the retail share positions of these brands after the FET increase last year. And we therefore expect that PM USA’s comparable year-over-year retail share results will improve over subsequent quarters as we begin to lap these resets retail share positions.
Marlboro had a record retail share of 42.7% in the first quarter of 2010. Marlboro achieved this result with sequential retail share growth on both the Menthol and non-Menthol components of the brand.
While launch support for the Marlboro’s Special Blend products played a role in the strong retail share results the share growth did not come at the expense of profits as Marlboro grew its margins in the first quarter of 2010 versus the first quarter of 2009.
We are also pleased that Marlboro Menthol achieved a record retail share results in the first quarter of 2010 with a six share. Overall, we are very pleased with a performance of the cigarette segment. Income growth was strong ad Marlboro displayed great strength in a challenging environment.
We are similarly pleased with a smokeless products segment results in the first quarter. Reported operating companies income was $178 million, an increase of $180 million from the comparable year ago period.
When adjusted for exit and integration costs and acquisition-related charges adjusted first quarter operating companies’ income was $188 million, an increase of 49.2% from the prior year. This strong income performance occurred despite costs associated with three national new product introductions in the first quarter of 2010.
Smokeless product shipment volume in the first quarter increased 21.9% versus a prior year period, driven primarily by Copenhagen and Skoal. And the national expansion of Marlboro Snus.
Both Copenhagen and Skoal has solid underlying shipment performances. After adjusting for the timing of new product launches wholesale inventory changes and other factors both Copenhagen and Skoal grew their first quarter shipment volumes versus the prior year period.
Copenhagen and Skoal’s combined retail share performance was also very strong as it grew both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis by 8/10th and one share point respectively.
Copenhagen’s first quarter retail share of 25.6% was particularly impressive as it brand share grew one share point on a sequential basis and 1.9 share points on a year-over-year basis. Now that Copenhagen and Skoal’s combined retail share has been growing sequentially for the past couple of quarters we expect that total smokeless products retail share will also return to growth on a year-over-year basis as the year progresses.
The Cigar segment reported first quarter operating companies’ income of $47 million, down 13% from the prior year period. When adjusted for integration costs adjusted operating companies income declined 15.8% to $48 million.
As Mike noted Middleton’s first quarter income and volume comparisons were particularly challenging due to the trade inventory build, a machine-made cigars in the first quarter of 2009 prior to the FET increase.
Black & Mild increased its first quarter retail share of the machine-made large cigar category by 3/10th of a share point versus the first quarter of last year to 28.2% behind the continuing momentum of last year’s new product launches.
Middleton has a strong pipeline of new products for 2010 including Black & Mild Royale and plans to respond as appropriate to the competitive dynamics in the marketplace.
Ste. Michael also reported solid business results in the first quarter of 2010. Overall, reported operating companies’ income for the wine segment increased $6 million versus the prior year period to $7 million.
When adjusted for exit, integration and acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating companies income increased 33.3% versus a prior year period to $12 million.
The wine segment shipment volume in the first quarter increased 22% to 1.4 million cases versus the year ago period. Overall, the wine industry’s retail unit volume has measured by Nielsen Total Wine Database for US Food, Drug and Liquor, increased 3.9% in the first quarter of 2010 and Ste. Michael’s retail unit volume grew faster than the industry at 6.1%.
Reported operating companies income for the financial services segment, in the first quarter of 2010, increased $99 million versus the prior year period to $21 million, due primarily to lower gains on asset sales.
At the end of the first quarter the allowance for losses was $202 million reflecting a net increase of $64 million due primarily to write-offs on leases with General Motors.
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping numbers. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 33% in the quarter. Marlboro's net pack price was $5.42 and the lowest effective price cigarette pack price was $4.08.
The cigarette discount category's first quarter retail share was 27.5%. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the first quarter was $1.26 per pack. There were no state excise tax increases in the first quarter of 2010. However, New Mexico and Utah enacted legislation to increase their cigarette excise taxes on July 1.
Additionally, legislatures in Washington State, NY sent bills to respective governors that include cigarette excise tax increases.
Copenhagen's retail price was $4.15, and its net price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 45% in the first quarter. At the end of the first quarter the District of Columbia and 18 states used a weight based exercise tax system representing 27% of a smokeless categories volume.
Our 2010 reported first quarter tax rate was 36.5%. We anticipate that Altria's 2010 full year effective tax rate on operations will be approximately 35.5%. On April 15, 2010, PM USA made its full 2009 MSA payment of approximately $3.6 billion. The MSA payment included approximately $209 million that PM USA disputes it owes as a result of 2007 non-participating manufacturer adjustment.
In the first quarter, Altria recognized a one-time $12 million non-cash charge due to the elimination of tax deductions for retiree prescription drug subsidies under the 2010 healthcare legislation. And CapEx was $38 million in the first quarter and ongoing depreciation and amortization was $69 million.
Operator, do we have any questions?

Overall, I think that transition was handled about as well as you could expect something like that to be handled. It was done quickly, it’s been fully integrated in the places like our sales force and our consumer engagement activities and we’re collecting the savings that have been accrued from that process. So I think we feel very good about that platform. And we also feel very good about the brand opportunities that we’ve been able to identify to use to grow these businesses going forward into the future. So we see plenty of opportunity there. This is not an acquisition where the games where simply short-term opportunities, this is one where there is an opportunity to build and grow and continue to get momentum out of this business going forward for an extended period of time and that’s what we expect to happen and we’re on the way to do it.

And so based on the fact that I think we have a better understanding of that now than we did within the test markets we should see some more positive results from this as it kind of unfolds over the next few years, but it’s very early for us to be able to read anything on this.

Since Altria acquired UST and its Smokeless Tobacco and Wine subsidiaries on January 6, 2009, U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company and St. Michelle Wine Estate's financial results from January 6, 2009 are included in the 2009 first quarter consolidated and segment results. For a detailed review of Altria's first quarter business results, please review the earnings release that is available on our website, www.altria.com.
Altria reports its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Today's call may contain various operating results on both a reported and on an adjusted basis, which excludes items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these measures, as well as reconciliations, are included in the earnings press release.

296308,86395613,56931,"Altria Group Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-21-2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Cliff, and good morning to everyone. We're very pleased with the performance of Altria and its operating companies in the first quarter of 2010. Altria’s delivered strong adjusted earnings per share growth of 7.7%. In addition, we increased our",1421,"Thanks, Cliff, and good morning to everyone. We're very pleased with the performance of Altria and its operating companies in the first quarter of 2010. Altria’s delivered strong adjusted earnings per share growth of 7.7%. In addition, we increased our dividend by 2.9% on an annualized rate of $1.40 per share, reflecting our new dividend payout ratio target of approximately 80% of adjusted earnings per share.
Despite the continuing challenges of high unemployment and low consumer confidence, as well as an intensely competitive environment, Altria's operating companies continue to perform well. The Cigarette segment’s adjusted operating companies income increased by 6.7% over the comparable year-ago period to $1.3 billion. Marlboro achieved a record retail share results as the brand grew its quarterly retail share, both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. 
We're particularly pleased with the Cigarette segment results, considering that the prior-year comparison period included Cigarette segment’s adjusted operating companies income growth of 10.7% and a previous Marlboro retail share record high of 42.4%. The Smokeless Products segment reported very strong adjusted operating companies income growth of 49.2% to $188 million. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share increased both on a sequential and comparable year-over-year basis, and the brands combined shipment volume grew faster than the Smokeless category’s growth rate for the second straight quarter. Importantly, Copenhagen reestablished itself as the largest smokeless brand, as measured by retail share in the quarter.
The Cigar segment’s adjusted operating companies income declined by 15.8% to $48 million. Middleton had very difficult income comparison against the first quarter of 2009 when its adjusted operating companies income grew by a very strong 32.6% due to the timing of trade purchases around the 2009 FET increase.
The Wine segment’s adjusted operating companies income grew 33.3% to $12 million. Ste. Michelle reported strong volume growth versus the prior-year period led by the 44.9% shipment growth of its Château Ste. Michelle wines. Ste. Michelle continues to be recognized as a producer of a broad portfolio of high-quality wines, as wine industry publications have given over 30 of its wines ratings of 90 or better already this year.
The four Premium Brands of Altria's tobacco operating companies performed well in a challenging environment. Marlboro had a particularly strong performance, as I mentioned. The brand launched two special blend non-menthol products in the quarter, which contributed to the brand's strong retail share performance. The strength of these two new products helped Marlboro grow its retail share one share point from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of this year, despite continued heavy competitive spending on non-menthol discount products.
PM USA plans to broaden the availability of two more variants of Special Blend in a hundreds link in the second quarter of 2010 to build on this success. Marlboro also launched Marlboro's Snus nationally.  It’s a spitless smokeless tobacco alternative. Since the products did not ship nationally to wholesale until late in the first quarter of 2010, it is premature to talk about retail share and adult consumer feedback. However, based on our test markets, we believe Marlboro's Snus has a good opportunity for future growth.
Copenhagen continued its strong retail share performance behind Long Cut Wintergreen, which was successfully launched in the fourth quarter of 2009. USSTC began shipping Copenhagen Long Cut Straight and Extra Long Cut Natural at the end of the first quarter of 2010, and we anticipate that these products will contribute to Copenhagen's growth this year and beyond.
Skoal showed solid momentum as it grew retail share each month throughout the first quarter behind the Slim Can pouch initiative. The brand will begin its Skoal Up To Summer campaign later this quarter, which is an integrated program of enhanced products and marketing activities to strengthen the brand's position in the marketplace.
Black & Mild continued growing its retail share versus the first quarter of last year, despite a challenging environment due to an increase in competitive promotional activities. Middleton is monitoring the competitive environment and plans to respond appropriately to defend Black & Mild’s marketplace position.
New products have played an important role in the brand's strong retail share growth. And in the second quarter, Middleton plans to introduce Black & Mild Royale to continue building its strong position in the machine-made Large Cigar category.
As expected, trade inventory changes last year caused by the April 1, 2009 FET increase impacted shipment comparisons across all the Tobacco segments for the first quarter of 2010 versus the comparable year-ago period. Last year, the trade significantly reduced cigarette inventories in advance of the FET increase. And in the second quarter, they rebuilt these inventories. In the first quarter of this year, the trade increased their inventory levels from the beginning to the end of the quarter.
Due to these inventory dynamics, PM USA's reported 2010 first quarter cigarette shipment volume was down only 0.7% when compared to the first quarter of 2009. However, when adjusted for these inventory changes, PM USA estimates that its shipments declined approximately 11% versus the year-ago period, and that the Cigarette category declined approximately 10% in line with historical price elasticity.
Smokeless Products shipment comparisons were also impacted by trade inventory depletions in the first quarter of 2009 in advance of the FET increase, as well as the timing of PM USA and USSTC's new smokeless product launches in the first quarter of this year. Reported first quarter smokeless shipments were up 21.9% versus the comparable year-ago period. But when adjusted for the timing of new product launches, trade inventory movements, the discontinuation of Rooster and other factors, smokeless shipments were up an estimated 5%. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined first quarter adjusted shipment volume increased an estimated 11% when adjusted for the new product pipeline volume and trade inventory changes, as well as other factors. The companies estimate that the Smokeless category continued to grow at a rate of about 7% in the first quarter of 2010. 
Cigar shipment comparisons were also impacted by events in the first quarter of 2009. The trade increased cigar inventories in advance of the FET increase since there was no floor tax on machine-made cigars, and the initial shipments of Black & Mild Wood Tip also occurred in the first quarter of last year. For the balance of 2009, and into the first quarter of 2010, the trade reduced inventories of Middleton's machine-made large cigars. The combination of all of these year-over-year dynamics had a substantial impact on Middleton's first quarter reported shipments. Middleton's reported shipments were down 18% versus the first quarter of last year. But when adjusted for trade inventory changes, we're estimated to be essentially flat. Middleton believes that when adjusted for FET-related impacts, the Machine-Made Large Cigar category was essentially flat.
The Altria family of companies continue to make excellent progress on its $1.5 billion cost reduction program. $43 million in cost savings were achieved across the enterprise in the first quarter of 2010 or $1.1 billion in total savings since the program's inception off the 2006 cost base. We remain confident that we will realize the $419 million in additional cost savings by the end of 2011.
We continue to believe that the UST acquisition will be accretive to Altria's adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2010. First quarter financial results for the Smokeless Products segment are in line with our year-to-date expectations. These segment results are not comparable to USSTC's reported results prior to Altria's acquisition as they now include smokeless product results for PM USA. In addition, we remain on track to realize the $300 million in cost savings resulting from the acquisition. The impact of these cost savings is reflected partially in the Smokeless Products segment operating companies income performance with the balance reflected in other business areas across the Altria family of companies, due to our new more efficient corporate structure.
We expect the second quarter of this year to be particularly challenging for income growth comparison purposes due to different trade inventory dynamics in 2009 versus 2010. We continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share growth to build in the second half of this year.
For the full year, Altria reaffirms that its guidance for 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $1.85 to $1.89, which represents a 6% to 8% growth rate from an adjusted base of $1.75 per share in 2009. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Dave Beran, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's business segment results."
296308,86395613,56931,"Altria Group Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-21-2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I will begin by discussing our Cigarette segment results. During the quarter, PM USA successfully executed its objective of maximizing income while maintaining Marlboro's strong position in the Cigarette segment. For the first quarter of",1205,"Thank you, Mike. I will begin by discussing our Cigarette segment results. During the quarter, PM USA successfully executed its objective of maximizing income while maintaining Marlboro's strong position in the Cigarette segment. For the first quarter of 2010, reported operating companies income for the Cigarette segment increased by 7.6% to $1.2 billion, due primarily to higher list prices and lower pretax charges related to previously announced closure of its Cabarrus manufacturing facility, partially offset by lower volume.
When adjusted for restructuring charges, first quarter adjusted Cigarette segment's operating companies income grew by a strong 6.7% to $1.3 billion versus the same year-ago period. Trade inventory increases in the first quarter of 2010 helped Cigarette segment volume and income results for the period. We expect that the trade will return inventories to more normal levels, which will have a corresponding impact on PM USA's business results when it occurs.
After adjusting for trade inventory changes, PM USA's first quarter cigarette shipment volume declined by approximately 11%, which is greater than the estimated industry decline rate of approximately 10%, primarily due to retail share losses on its portfolio brands of one share point. PM USA profitably reset the retail share positions of these brands after the FET increase last year. And we therefore expect that PM USA's comparable year-over-year retail share results will improve over subsequent quarters as we begin to lap these reset retail share positions.
Marlboro had a record retail share of 42.7% in the first quarter of 2010. Marlboro achieved this result with sequential retail share growth on both the menthol and non-menthol components of the brand. While launch support for the Marlboro Special Blend products played a role in the strong retail share results, this share growth did not come at the expense of profits as Marlboro grew its margins in the first quarter of 2010 versus the first quarter of 2009.
We are also pleased that Marlboro Menthol achieved record retail share results in the first quarter of 2010 with a sixth share. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of the Cigarette segment. Income growth was strong and Marlboro displayed great strength in a challenging environment.
We are similarly pleased with the Smokeless Products segment results in the first quarter. Reported operating companies income was $178 million, an increase of $180 million from the comparable year-ago period. When adjusted for exit and integration costs and acquisition-related charges, adjusted first quarter operating companies income was $188 million, an increase of 49.2% from the prior year.
This strong income performance occurred despite cost associated with three national new product introductions in the first quarter of 2010. Smokeless product shipment volume in the first quarter increased 21.9% versus a prior-year period, driven primarily by Copenhagen and Skoal and the national expansion of Marlboro's Snus. Both Copenhagen and Skoal had solid underlying shipment performances. After adjusting for the timing of new product launches, wholesale inventory changes and other factors, both Copenhagen and Skoal grew their first quarter shipment volumes versus the prior-year period. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share performance was also very strong as it grew both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis by 0.08 and one share point, respectively. Copenhagen's first quarter retail share of 25.6% was particularly impressive as the brand share grew one share point on a sequential basis and 1.9 share points on a year-over-year basis.
Now that Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share has been growing sequentially for the past couple of quarters, we expect that total Smokeless Products retail share will also return to growth on a year-over-year basis as the year progresses.
The Cigars segment reported first operating companies income of $47 million, down 13% from the prior-year period. When adjusted for integration costs, adjusted operating companies income declined 15.8% to $48 million. As Mike noted, Middleton's first quarter income and volumes comparisons were particularly challenging due to the trade inventory build of machine-made cigars in the first quarter of 2009 prior to the FET increase. 
Black & Mild increased its first quarter retail share of the Machine-Made Large Cigar category by three tenths of a share point versus the first quarter of last year to 28.2% behind the continuing momentum of last year's new product launches. Middleton has a strong pipeline of new products for 2010, including Black & Mild Royale and plans to respond as appropriate to the competitive dynamics in the marketplace.
Ste. Michelle also reported solid business results in the first quarter of 2010. Overall reported operating companies income for the line segment increased $6 million versus the prior-year period to $7 million. When adjusted for exit, integration and acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating companies income increased 33.3% versus the prior-year period to $12 million. 
The Wine segment shipment volume in the first quarter increased 22% to $1.4 million cases versus the year-ago period. Overall, the wine industry's retail unit volume, as measured by Nielsen Total Wine Database for U.S. Food, Drug & Liquor, increased 3.9% in the first quarter of 2010 and Ste. Michelle's retail unit volume grew faster than the industry at 6.1%.
Reported operating companies income for the Financial Services segment in the first quarter of 2010 decreased $99 million versus the prior-year period to $21 million, due primarily to lower gains on asset sales. At the end of the first quarter, the allowance for losses was $202 million, reflecting a net decrease of $64 million, due primarily to write-offs on leases with General Motors. 
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping numbers.  Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 33% in the quarter. Marlboro's net pack price was $5.42, and the lowest effective priced cigarette pack price was $4.08. The Cigarette Discount category's first quarter retail share was 27.5%. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the first quarter was $1.26 per pack. There were no state excise tax increases in the first quarter of 2010. However, New Mexico and Utah enacted legislation to increase their cigarette excise taxes on July 1. Additionally, legislatures in Washington State and Hawaii sent bills to their respective governors that include cigarette excise tax increases.
Copenhagen's retail price was $4.15, and it's net price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 45% in the first quarter. At the end of the first quarter, the District of Columbia and 18 states used a weight-based excise tax system representing 27% of the Smokeless categories volume.
Our 2010 reported first quarter tax rate was 36.5%. We anticipate that Altria's 2010 full year effective tax rate on operations will be approximately 35.5%. On April 15, 2010, PM USA made its full 2009 MSA payment of approximately $3.6 billion. The MSA payment included approximately $209 million that PM USA disputes it owes as a result of the 2007 non-participating manufacturer adjustment.
In the first quarter, Altria recognized a one-time $12 million non-cash charge due to the elimination of tax deductions for retiree prescription drug subsidies under the 2010 healthcare legislation. And CapEx was $38 million in the first quarter, and ongoing depreciation and amortization was $69 million. Operator, do we have any questions?"

So we're just in the stage of gaining distribution and getting it positioned on the shelf broadly.

We've said for a long time we think this will be kind of a methodical development of our business rather than something that happens rapidly. And so based on the fact that I think we have a better understanding of that now than we did when we went into test markets, we should see some more positive results from this as it kind of unfolds over the next few years.

We're very pleased with the performance of Altria and its operating companies in the first quarter of 2010. Altria’s delivered strong adjusted earnings per share growth of 7.7%. In addition, we increased our",1424,"Thanks, Cliff, and good morning to everyone. We're very pleased with the performance of Altria and its operating companies in the first quarter of 2010. Altria’s delivered strong adjusted earnings per share growth of 7.7%. In addition, we increased our dividend by 2.9% on an annualized rate of $1.40 per share, reflecting our new dividend payout ratio target of approximately 80% of adjusted earnings per share.
Despite the continuing challenges of high unemployment and low consumer confidence, as well as an intensely competitive environment, Altria's operating companies continue to perform well. The Cigarette segment’s adjusted operating companies income increased by 6.7% over the comparable year-ago period to $1.3 billion. Marlboro achieved a record retail share results as the brand grew its quarterly retail share, both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis.
We're particularly pleased with the Cigarette segment results, considering that the prior-year comparison period included Cigarette segment’s adjusted operating companies income growth of 10.7% and a previous Marlboro retail share record high of 42.4%. The Smokeless Products segment reported very strong adjusted operating companies income growth of 49.2% to $188 million. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share increased both on a sequential and comparable year-over-year basis, and the brands combined shipment volume grew faster than the Smokeless category’s growth rate for the second straight quarter. Importantly, Copenhagen re-established itself as the largest smokeless brand as measured by retail share in the quarter.
The Cigar segment’s adjusted operating companies income declined by 15.8% to $48 million. Middleton had very difficult income comparison against the first quarter of 2009 when its adjusted operating companies income grew by a very strong 32.6% due to the timing of trade purchases around the 2009 FET increase.
The Wine segment’s adjusted operating companies income grew 33.3% to $12 million. Ste. Michelle reported strong volume growth versus the prior-year period led by the 44.9% shipment growth of its Château Ste. Michelle wines. Ste. Michelle continues to be recognized as a producer of a broad portfolio of high quality wines, as wine industry publications have given over 30 of its wines ratings of 90 or better already this year.
The four premium brands of Altria's tobacco operating companies performed well in a challenging environment. Marlboro had a particularly strong performance, as I mentioned. The brand launched two special blend non-menthol products in the quarter, which contributed to the brand's strong retail share performance. The strength of these two new products helped Marlboro grow its retail share one share point from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the first quarter of this year, despite continued heavy competitive spending on non-menthol discount products.
PM USA plans to broaden the availability of two more variants of Special Blend in a hundreds length in the second quarter of 2010 to build on this success. Marlboro also launched Marlboro Snus nationally.  It’s a spitless, smokeless tobacco alternative. Since the products did not ship nationally to wholesale until late in the first quarter of 2010, it is premature to talk about retail share and adult consumer feedback. However, based on our test markets, we believe Marlboro Snus has a good opportunity for future growth.
Copenhagen continued its strong retail share performance behind Long Cut Wintergreen, which was successfully launched in the fourth quarter of 2009. USSTC began shipping Copenhagen Long Cut Straight and Extra Long Cut Natural at the end of the first quarter of 2010, and we anticipate that these products will contribute to Copenhagen's growth this year and beyond.
Skoal showed solid momentum as it grew retail share each month throughout the first quarter behind the Slim Can pouch initiative. The brand will begin its Skoal up to summer campaign later this quarter, which is an integrated program of enhanced products and marketing activities to strengthen the brand's position in the marketplace.
Black & Mild continued growing its retail share versus the first quarter of last year, despite a challenging environment due to an increase in competitive promotional activities. Middleton is monitoring the competitive environment and plans to respond appropriately to defend Black & Mild’s marketplace position.
New products have played an important role in the brand's strong retail share growth. And in the second quarter, Middleton plans to introduce Black & Mild Royale [ph] (20:06) to continue building its strong position in the machine-made Large Cigar category.
As expected, trade inventory changes last year caused by the April 1, 2009 FET increase impacted shipment comparisons across all the Tobacco segments for the first quarter of 2010 versus the comparable year-ago period. Last year, the trade significantly reduced cigarette inventories in advance of the FET increase. And in the second quarter, they rebuilt these inventories. In the first quarter of this year, the trade increased their inventory levels from the beginning to the end of the quarter.
Due to these inventory dynamics, PM USA's reported 2010 first quarter cigarette shipment volume was down only 0.7% when compared to the first quarter of 2009. However, when adjusted for these inventory changes, PM USA estimates that its shipments declined approximately 11% versus the year-ago period, and that the Cigarette category declined approximately 10% in line with historical price elasticity.
Smokeless Products shipment comparisons were also impacted by trade inventory depletions in the first quarter of 2009 in advance of the FET increase, as well as the timing of PM USA and USSTC's new smokeless product launches in the first quarter of this year. Reported first quarter smokeless shipments were up 21.9% versus the comparable year-ago period. But when adjusted for the timing of new product launches, trade inventory movements, the discontinuation of Rooster and other factors, smokeless shipments were up an estimated 5%. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined first quarter adjusted shipment volume increased an estimated 11% when adjusted for the new product pipeline volume and trade inventory changes, as well as other factors. The companies estimate that the Smokeless category continued to grow at a rate of about 7% in the first quarter of 2010.
Cigar shipment comparisons were also impacted by events in the first quarter of 2009. The trade increased cigar inventories in advance of the FET increase since there was no floor tax on machine-made cigars, and the initial shipments of Black & Mild Wood Tip also occurred in the first quarter of last year. For the balance of 2009, and into the first quarter of 2010, the trade reduced inventories of Middleton's machine-made large cigars. The combination of all of these year-over-year dynamics had a substantial impact on Middleton's first quarter reported shipments. Middleton's reported shipments were down 18% versus the first quarter of last year. But when adjusted for trade inventory changes, we're estimated to be essentially flat. Middleton believes that when adjusted for FET-related impacts, the Machine-Made Large Cigar category was essentially flat.
The Altria family of companies continue to make excellent progress on its $1.5 billion cost reduction program. $43 million in cost savings were achieved across the enterprise in the first quarter of 2010 or $1.1 billion in total savings since the program's inception off the 2006 cost base. We remain confident that we will realize the $419 million in additional cost savings by the end of 2011.
We continue to believe that the UST acquisition will be accretive to Altria's adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2010. First quarter financial results for the Smokeless Products segment are in line with our year-to-date expectations. These segment results are not comparable to USSTC's reported results prior to Altria's acquisition as they now include smokeless product results for PM USA. In addition, we remain on track to realize the $300 million in cost savings resulting from the acquisition. The impact of these cost savings is reflected partially in the Smokeless Products segment operating companies income performance with the balance reflected in other business areas across the Altria family of companies, due to our new more efficient corporate structure.
We expect the second quarter of this year to be particularly challenging for income growth comparison purposes due to different trade inventory dynamics in 2009 versus 2010. We continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share growth to build in the second half of this year.
For the full year, Altria reaffirms that its guidance for 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in a range of $1.85 to $1.89, which represents a 6% to 8% growth rate from an adjusted base of $1.75 per share in 2009.
Now I'll turn the call over to Dave Beran, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's business segment results."
296308,86395613,57127,"Altria Group Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-21-2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. I will begin by discussing our Cigarette segment results. During the quarter, PM USA successfully executed its objective of maximizing income while maintaining Marlboro's strong position in the Cigarette segment. For the first quarter of",1207,"Thank you, Mike. I will begin by discussing our Cigarette segment results. During the quarter, PM USA successfully executed its objective of maximizing income while maintaining Marlboro's strong position in the Cigarette segment. For the first quarter of 2010, reported operating companies income for the Cigarette segment increased by 7.6% to $1.2 billion, due primarily to higher list prices and lower pretax charges related to the previously announced closure of its Cabarrus manufacturing facility, partially offset by lower volume.
When adjusted for restructuring charges, first quarter adjusted Cigarette segment's operating companies income grew by a strong 6.7% to $1.3 billion versus the same year-ago period. Trade inventory increases in the first quarter of 2010 helped Cigarette segment volume and income results for the period. We expect that the trade will return inventories to more normal levels, which will have a corresponding impact on PM USA's business results when it occurs.
After adjusting for trade inventory changes, PM USA's first quarter cigarette shipment volume declined by approximately 11%, which is greater than the estimated industry decline rate of approximately 10%, primarily due to retail share losses on its portfolio brands of one share point. PM USA profitably reset the retail share positions of these brands after the FET increase last year. And we therefore expect that PM USA's comparable year-over-year retail share results will improve over subsequent quarters as we begin to lap these reset retail share positions.
Marlboro had a record retail share of 42.7% in the first quarter of 2010. Marlboro achieved this result with sequential retail share growth on both the menthol and non-menthol components of the brand. While launch support for the Marlboro Special Blend products played a role in the strong retail share results, this share growth did not come at the expense of profits as Marlboro grew its margins in the first quarter of 2010 versus the first quarter of 2009.
We are also pleased that Marlboro Menthol achieved record retail share results in the first quarter of 2010 with a sixth share. Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of the Cigarette segment. Income growth was strong and Marlboro displayed great strength in a challenging environment.
We are similarly pleased with the Smokeless Products segment results in the first quarter. Reported operating companies income was $178 million, an increase of $180 million from the comparable year-ago period. When adjusted for exit and integration costs and acquisition-related charges, adjusted first quarter operating companies income was $188 million, an increase of 49.2% from the prior year.
This strong income performance occurred despite cost associated with three national new product introductions in the first quarter of 2010. Smokeless product shipment volume in the first quarter increased 21.9% versus a prior-year period, driven primarily by Copenhagen and Skoal and the national expansion of Marlboro Snus. Both Copenhagen and Skoal had solid underlying shipment performances. After adjusting for the timing of new product launches, wholesale inventory changes and other factors, both Copenhagen and Skoal grew their first quarter shipment volumes versus the prior-year period. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share performance was also very strong as it grew both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis by 0.08 and one share point, respectively. Copenhagen's first quarter retail share of 25.6% was particularly impressive as the brand share grew one share point on a sequential basis and 1.9 share points on a year-over-year basis.
Now that Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share has been growing sequentially for the past couple of quarters, we expect that total Smokeless Products retail share will also return to growth on a year-over-year basis as the year progresses.
The Cigars segment reported first operating companies income of $47 million, down 13% from the prior-year period. When adjusted for integration costs, adjusted operating companies income declined 15.8% to $48 million. As Mike noted, Middleton's first quarter income and volumes comparisons were particularly challenging due to the trade inventory build of machine-made cigars in the first quarter of 2009 prior to the FET increase.
Black & Mild increased its first quarter retail share of the machine-made Large Cigar category by three tenths of a share point versus the first quarter of last year to 28.2% behind the continuing momentum of last year's new product launches. Middleton has a strong pipeline of new products for 2010, including Black & Mild Royale [ph] and plans to respond as appropriate to the competitive dynamics in the marketplace.
Ste. Michelle also reported solid business results in the first quarter of 2010. Overall reported operating companies income for the line segment increased $6 million versus the prior-year period to $7 million. When adjusted for exit, integration and acquisition-related costs, adjusted operating companies income increased 33.3% versus the prior-year period to $12 million.
The Wine segment shipment volume in the first quarter increased 22% to $1.4 million cases versus the year-ago period. Overall, the wine industry's retail unit volume, as measured by Nielsen Total Wine Database for U.S. Food, Drug & Liquor, increased 3.9% in the first quarter of 2010 and Ste. Michelle's retail unit volume grew faster than the industry at 6.1%.
Reported operating companies income for the Financial Services segment in the first quarter of 2010 decreased $99 million versus the prior-year period to $21 million, due primarily to lower gains on asset sales. At the end of the first quarter, the allowance for losses was $202 million, reflecting a net decrease of $64 million, due primarily to write-offs on leases with General Motors.
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping numbers. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 33% in the quarter. Marlboro's net pack price was $5.42, and the lowest effective priced cigarette pack price was $4.08. The Cigarette Discount category's first quarter retail share was 27.5%. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the first quarter was $1.26 per pack. There were no state excise tax increases in the first quarter of 2010. However, New Mexico and Utah enacted legislation to increase their cigarette excise taxes on July 1. Additionally, legislatures in Washington State and Hawaii sent bills to their respective governors that include cigarette excise tax increases.
Copenhagen's retail price was $4.15, and it's net price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 45% in the first quarter. At the end of the first quarter, the District of Columbia and 18 states used a weight-based excise tax system representing 27% of the Smokeless categories volume.
Our 2010 reported first quarter tax rate was 36.5%. We anticipate that Altria's 2010 full year effective tax rate on operations will be approximately 35.5%. On April 15, 2010, PM USA made its full 2009 MSA payment of approximately $3.6 billion. The MSA payment included approximately $209 million that PM USA disputes it owes as a result of the 2007 non-participating manufacturer adjustment.
In the first quarter, Altria recognized a one-time $12 million non-cash charge due to the elimination of tax deductions for retiree prescription drug subsidies under the 2010 healthcare legislation. And CapEx was $38 million in the first quarter, and ongoing depreciation and amortization was $69 million. Operator, do we have any questions?"

296308,109056104,68137,"Altria Group Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Cliff. We are very pleased with the performance of Altria and its operating companies in the second quarter and the first half 2010. Our business results over both of these time periods exceeded our expectations comin",1326,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Cliff. We are very pleased with the performance of Altria and its operating companies in the second quarter and the first half 2010. 
Our business results over both of these time periods exceeded our expectations coming into the year. The fundamentals of our business remain strong and the premium brands of our operating companies performed very well, in what continues to be a challenging business environment. 
As anticipated, the second quarter of this year was challenging from an income growth comparison point of view due to the FET-related trade inventory movements in the prior-year period. Altria's adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were the same as the second quarter of 2009. 
Last year's first and second quarter income results were impacted by trade inventory movements related to the FET increase. Because the FET increase included a floor tax on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products, the trade depleted these inventories in the first quarter of last year prior to the increase, and then rebuilt them in the second quarter. 
Since the FET increase did not include a floor tax on machine-made large cigars, the trade built these inventories prior to the increase and depleted them in the second quarter of last year. Due to these FET-related volume impacts, separate first and second quarter income comparisons for 2010 versus 2009 are not particularly meaningful. A look at our first half performance offers more insight into the underlying strengths of our businesses.
Last year's first half results included one quarter prior to and one quarter after the April 1, 2009, FET increase. For the first half of 2010, Altria grew adjusted earnings per share by 3.4%, and this growth occurred against last year's strong first half adjusted earnings per share growth of 8.5%. This solid adjusted earnings per share growth also occurred despite PMCC's first half operating companies' income decline of $143 million due to lower gains on asset sales. 
Strong adjusted operating companies' income growth from our Adult Consumer Product businesses more than offset PMCC's income decline. Through the first half of the year, our Adult Consumer Product businesses combined adjusted operating companies' income grew 5.3% versus a year ago. 
We are further encouraged that the premium brands of our operating companies are maintaining strong positions in the marketplace, in what remains a very challenging economic environment. We, thus, feel very good about the fundamentals of our Adult Consumer Product businesses. 
We were pleased with the progress towards our objective of maximizing cigarette income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro. Marlboro reached a record retail share in the second quarter as it grew its overall share by an impressive 1.6 share points versus the comparable year-ago period to 42.8%, while also continuing to expand its margins. Marlboro's strong retail share performance also enabled PM [Philip Morris] U.S.A.'s overall Cigarette segment retail share to return to growth, as it grew 7/10 of a share point versus the second quarter of last year to 50.2%.
Cigarette segment income performance was also strong. The Cigarette segment grew second quarter adjusted operating companies' income by 1.5% versus the year-ago period and 3.8% for the first half of this year. We are very pleased with this first half income result since in the first half of 2009, adjusted Cigarette segment operating companies' income grew by a strong 8.8% versus the comparable prior-year period. Adjusted cigarette operating companies' income margins expanded 1.7 percentage points to 38.6% for the first half of the year versus the comparable year-ago period. 
The Smokeless Product segment also reported strong results. Overall Smokeless Products segment retail share for the second quarter grew by 1.8 share points versus the prior-year period to 56%. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share of the smokeless category grew by 1.3 share points versus the comparable year-ago period to 48.1%. 
The Smokeless Product segment second quarter adjusted operating companies' income declined 5.2% versus the comparable year-ago period, primarily due to costs associated with the national expansion of Marlboro Snus. On a six-month basis, however, adjusted operating companies' income is up by a strong 15%. Given the solid first half adjusted operating companies' income performance from the Smokeless Product segment and the cost savings realized as a result of the acquisition across the Altria family of companies, we remain confident the UST acquisition will be accretive to Altria's 2010 adjusted earnings per share. 
In the second quarter, Black & Mild’s retail share with the machine-made large cigar category declined versus the year-ago period as it faced a challenging environment, due in part to an increase in competitive promotional spending. However, the Cigar segment's income growth has been solid as Middleton's second quarter and first half adjusted operating companies' income grew by 40% and 7.2%, respectively, versus comparable prior-year periods. 
In the Wine segment, we are encouraged that the wine categories volume growth rate for the first half of 2010 appears to have returned to the pre-recessionary levels of about 3%. Ste. Michelle grew its volume faster than the category behind the strong shipment results of Chateau Ste. Michelle and Columbia Crest. This volume performance helped second quarter Wine segment adjusted operating companies' income increase by 13.3% versus the prior-year period and 20.8% for the first half of 2010 versus the comparable year-ago period. 
Altria's continuing progress against the $1.5 billion cost savings program contributed to these solid operating companies' income results. In the second quarter, $129 million of savings were achieved across the Altria family of companies, and $172 million were achieved through the first half of the year.
We realized a total of $1.2 billion in cost savings since the program's inception off the 2006 cost base, and remain confident that we will realize the $290 million in additional cost savings by the end of 2011. The second quarter of 2010 is the first one that can be compared to a post-FET increase order in 2009. Although second quarter volume comparisons for the tobacco categories were impacted by trade inventory movements around this increase, after adjusting for these movements and other factors, we are pleased with the underlying volume trends of the tobacco categories.
In PM U.S.A.'s reported second quarter cigarette shipment volumes declined 10.2% versus comparable year-ago periods. But when adjusted primarily for the FET-related trade inventory build last year and the reductions in trade inventories this year, following PM U.S.A.'s second quarter cigarette, this price increase, volume was estimated to be down approximately 3.5% versus the prior-year period. PM U.S.A. estimates the overall cigarette category declined about 4.5% versus the prior-year period, which is in line with historical price elasticity.
Reported second quarter smokeless product shipment volume was up 9.2% versus the year-ago period and was estimated to be up approximately 9%, when adjusted for trade inventory changes, as well as the timing of USSTC [U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company] and PM U.S.A.'s new product launches and other factors. The companies estimate that the smokeless category continued to grow at a rate of 7% in the second quarter versus the comparable year-ago period.
Finally, Middleton's second quarter cigar shipment volumes grew 19.7% versus the prior-year period. After adjusting for trade inventory changes, Middleton estimates its second quarter shipments were down moderately versus the prior-year period, and that the machine-made large cigar categories' volume grew slightly. 
We are very pleased by the performance of Altria and its operating companies through the first half of the year. Adjusted earnings per share continue to grow, driven by solid income performance across all of our Tobacco and Wine businesses. It is primarily because of these first half results that Altria is increasing its guidance for 2010 full year adjusted diluted earnings per share for a range of $1.87 to $1.91, which represents a 7% to 9% growth rate from an adjusted base of $1.75 per share in 2009.
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Beran, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's Business segment results in more detail."

In the second quarter of 2010, reported operating companies' income for the Cigarette segment exceeded our expectations and increased by $24 million to $1.5 billion, due primarily to higher list prices and lower promotional spending, partially offset by lower volume and higher FDA user fees. 
Marlboro had a record retail share result of 42.8% in the second quarter as the brand grew 1.6 share points versus the prior-year period. Marlboro's retail share results in a comparable year-ago period were impacted by the marketplace pricing dislocations following the FET increase. 
Retail share growth was particularly strong for Marlboro non-menthol products, which grew 1.3 share points versus the second quarter of last year. The Marlboro Special Blend line extensions launched earlier this year were important contributors to this strong retail share performance. 
PM U.S.A. expanded both Marlboro's and overall adjusted Cigarette segment margins in the second quarter. Adjusted Cigarette segment margins grew by a strong 2.9 percentage points versus the comparable year-ago period.
The Smokeless Products segment reported operating companies' income increased $21 million versus the prior-year period to $198 million. Excluding restructuring and acquisition-related costs, adjusted Smokeless segment operating companies' income decreased by $11 million to $202 million. 
Year-over-year income results were impacted by the trade inventory dynamics and costs associated with the national launch of Marlboro Snus that Mike discussed, as well as activities to restructure and integrate USSTC's business into the Altria family of companies.
Second quarter reported smokeless product shipments increased 9.2% versus the prior-year period. Combined second quarter shipments for Copenhagen and Skoal, which grew 7.1%, helped drive these results. We were very pleased that overall Smokeless Products segment's retail share grew in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. Our primary driver of this retail share performance was Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share performance, which grew a very strong 1.3 share points in the second quarter on a comparable year-over-year basis. 
Product initiatives contributed to Copenhagen and Skoal's strong combined retail share performance. Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen, Long Cut Straight and Extra Long Cut Natural helped drive the brand's strong second quarter retail share growth of 2.6 share points. Skoal introduced brand-building programs on a Wintergreen, Straight and Mint variants in the second quarter, which in conjunction with the Skoal up-to-summer [ph] equity-building campaign, helped strengthen the brand's retail share performance as the second quarter progressed.
The national launch of Marlboro Snus, which occurred at the end of the first quarter of 2010 was also an important contributor to the Smokeless Product segment's volume and retail share results. Marlboro Snus, which is available in four different variants, has had good initial awareness and trial and is meeting our expectations. We have an integrated marketing plan for the balance of the year to continue building awareness and trial among adult tobacco consumers for these new products.
The Cigars segment reported second quarter operating companies' income increased $20 million versus the prior-year period to $56 million. Black & Mild's second quarter retail share of the machine-made large cigar category declined by 2.4 share points versus the prior-year period to 27.9%. Black & Mild continued to meet evolving adult cigar consumers' preferences for a variety by introducing Black & Mild Royale in both plastic and wood tip variants. 
Middleton intends to strengthen the brand's position in the marketplace through additional brand-building activities. Ste. Michelle reported strong business results in the second quarter of 2010. Reported operating companies' income for the Wine segment increased $3 million versus the prior-year period to $12 million. When adjusted for restructuring and acquisition-related costs, second quarter adjusted operating companies' income increased by 13.3% versus the prior-year period to $17 million.
Wine segment shipment volumes versus the second quarter and first half of last year increased by 10% and 15.4%, respectively. Overall, the wine industry's retail unit volume, as measured by Nielsen Total Wine Database for U.S. Food, Drug and Liquor increased by 2% in the second quarter and 2.7% in the first half of 2010 versus the year-ago periods. Ste. Michelle's second quarter and first half retail unit volume grew faster than the industry's at 5.7% and 5.5%, respectively.
The Financial Services segment's reported second quarter operating companies' income decreased $44 million versus the prior-year period to $39 million, due to lower gains on asset sales. In the second quarter, Altria executed a closing agreement with the IRS with respect to its 2000 to 2003 Federal income tax returns.In this Closing Agreement, we agreed to pay approximately $945 million in taxes and related interests associated with disallowance of certain leverage-leasing transactions entered into by PMCC in 1996 through 2003. We made this payment to the IRS yesterday, and we intend to contest these disallowances vigorously.
The tax component of this payment represents an acceleration of taxes that Altria otherwise would have paid over the lease terms of these transactions. As we have previously disclosed, if the IRS in the future similarly disallows the tax benefits from these transactions for the period from 2004 until the end of 2010, the net additional tax and interest due would be approximately $1 billion, excluding any potential penalties. 
The closing of the 2000 and 2003 Federal income tax audit, as well as other state income tax matters, impacted the reported tax rate for Altria in the second quarter. Altria's reported tax rate for the second quarter was 22.9% due to the following: The closing of the Federal audit resulted in a tax benefit of $47 million, primarily attributable to the reversal of tax reserves and associated interests related to Altria and its current subsidiaries. The closing of this audit also resulted in a tax benefit of $169 million due to the reversal of tax reserves and interests related to Altria's former subsidiaries: Kraft and PMI. This $169 million tax benefit was completely offset by a reduction in receivables from Kraft and PMI, resulting in no impact on Altria's reported net earnings for the second quarter. This tax event is similar to the one, which occurred in the third quarter of 2009. 
And finally, there was an $11 million tax benefit due primarily to the reversal of tax reserves and interests associated with the resolution of several state income tax audits. Excluding the net tax benefits recorded during the first half of 2010, Altria's income tax rates for the three- and six-month periods are consistent with its 2010 forecasted full year effective tax rate on operations of approximately 35.4%. 
In the second quarter, Altria issued $800 million in 5.25-year notes with a coupon of 4 1/8%. This opportunistic financing enabled the company to take advantage of the historically low interest rates and tightening corporate credit spreads. In the second quarter, we also paid off $775 million in notes with a coupon of 7 1/8%. This refinancing is consistent with our strategy of reducing the company's overall financing costs. 
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 34% in the quarter. Marlboro's net pack price was $5.50, and the lowest effective priced cigarette pack price was $4.09. The cigarette discount category's second quarter retail share was 26.9%, a decline of 4/10 of a share point versus the year-ago period. 
The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the beginning of the third quarter was $1.36 per pack and includes the five states that increased their excise taxes on July 1. Copenhagen's retail price was $4.12, and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 41% in the second quarter. 
At the end of the second quarter, the District of Columbia and 18 states used a weight-based excise tax system, representing about 27% of the smokeless category's volume. CapEx was $31 million in the quarter, and ongoing depreciation and amortization was $68 million.

So whether it's 4.5% or not, I think depends somewhat on factors outside of our control, like, state excise taxes and so on and so forth. But certainly, I think it's fair to say that it's begun to stabilize post the FET into, kind of, a more normalized level. And we'll kind of see how that maintains itself as we move on through the balance of the year, but it looks pretty normal at this point in time. Relative to smokeless, it looks over recent history that it's been growing at about 7%, and that's what it did this quarter. I think that's pretty healthy growth rate. So we don't see anything new or different occurring that would cause us to believe the differences is going to occur moving ahead. But that again is based on whatever outside factors, we can't project it but pretty stable 7% right now."

Cigarettes and Smokeless have been historically particularly competitive. And they went through a lot of pricing disruption last year and have kind of settled down from that disruption, but they remain competitive. And there are some states where it's more competitive than it is in other states, and in some areas of the country where some brands that have more development are more competitive than they are than other areas of the country. There's nothing new about that. That tends to be the basic market dynamic that exists in cigarettes. So I would say we're seeing a pretty normal competitive environment in the Cigarette business versus what we would have historically expected to see. And that the exception was the period during the change in the FET, which really disrupted marketplace pricing quite a bit. And much is true, Smokeless, it's a competitive marketplace, but I can't point out any particular anomalies relative to what would be a normal competitive marketplace for you. What's a bit different in the Cigar business is that there's been some very aggressive activity in the Cigar business in the first half of the year from some competitors. That's, I'd say, more aggressive than we have seen at least in the time we've owned the business, and so there's been some impact based on that. That's okay. We know how to address that, but I think that's what we are trying to point out in our press release."

And then there's an allocation back-up costs, so it's kind of hard to go directly from here's how much of the cost savings winds up being attributed to each place because that's not how we do it. We don't dole out the cost savings to the operating companies. We charge the operating companies for services. The costs of the overall services that we provide today is less because we'd added UST to the equation, taken a whole bunch of SG&A expense out of the system and put together a more efficient system to deliver the services. So it's pretty complicated. I guess that's a long way of answering your question by saying, no, I can't do it. But at least that's an explanation."

So I think we have to have patience with our expectations in the Snus business, but we're out there now. We got good distribution on the product.

We are very pleased with the performance of Altria and its operating companies in the second quarter and the first half 2010. 
Our business results over both of these time periods exceeded our expectations coming into the year. The fundamentals of our business remain strong and the premium brands of our operating companies performed very well, in what continues to be a challenging business environment. 
As anticipated, the second quarter of this year was challenging from an income growth comparison point of view due to the FET-related trade inventory movements in the prior-year period. Altria's adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were the same as the second quarter of 2009. 
Last year's first and second quarter income results were impacted by trade inventory movements related to the FET increase. Because the FET increase included a floor tax on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products, the trade depleted these inventories in the first quarter of last year prior to the increase, and then rebuilt them in the second quarter. 
Since the FET increase did not include a floor tax on machine-made large cigars, the trade built these inventories prior to the increase and depleted them in the second quarter of last year. Due to these FET-related volume impacts, separate first and second quarter income comparisons for 2010 versus 2009 are not particularly meaningful. A look at our first half performance offers more insight into the underlying strengths of our businesses.
Last year's first half results included one quarter prior to and one quarter after the April 1, 2009, FET increase. For the first half of 2010, Altria grew adjusted earnings per share by 3.4%, and this growth occurred against last year's strong first half adjusted earnings per share growth of 8.5%. This solid adjusted earnings per share growth also occurred despite PMCC's first half operating companies' income decline of $143 million due to lower gains on asset sales. 
Strong adjusted operating companies' income growth from our Adult Consumer Product businesses more than offset PMCC's income decline. Through the first half of the year, our Adult Consumer Product businesses combined adjusted operating companies' income grew 5.3% versus a year ago. 
We are further encouraged that the premium brands of our operating companies are maintaining strong positions in the marketplace, in what remains a very challenging economic environment. We, thus, feel very good about the fundamentals of our Adult Consumer Product businesses. 
We were pleased with the progress towards our objective of maximizing cigarette income while maintaining momentum on Marlboro. Marlboro reached a record retail share in the second quarter as it grew its overall share by an impressive 1.6 share points versus the comparable year-ago period to 42.8%, while also continuing to expand its margins. Marlboro's strong retail share performance also enabled PM [Philip Morris] U.S.A.'s overall Cigarette segment retail share to return to growth, as it grew 7/10 of a share point versus the second quarter of last year to 50.2%.
Cigarette segment income performance was also strong. The Cigarette segment grew second quarter adjusted operating companies' income by 1.5% versus the year-ago period and 3.8% for the first half of this year. We are very pleased with this first half income result since in the first half of 2009, adjusted Cigarette segment operating companies' income grew by a strong 8.8% versus the comparable prior-year period. Adjusted cigarette operating companies' income margins expanded 1.7 percentage points to 38.6% for the first half of the year versus the comparable year-ago period. 
The Smokeless Product segment also reported strong results. Overall Smokeless Products segment retail share for the second quarter grew by 1.8 share points versus the prior-year period to 56%. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share of the smokeless category grew by 1.3 share points versus the comparable year-ago period to 48.1%. 
The Smokeless Product segment second quarter adjusted operating companies' income declined 5.2% versus the comparable year-ago period, primarily due to costs associated with the national expansion of Marlboro Snus. On a six-month basis, however, adjusted operating companies' income is up by a strong 15%. Given the solid first half adjusted operating companies' income performance from the Smokeless Product segment and the cost savings realized as a result of the acquisition across the Altria family of companies, we remain confident the UST acquisition will be accretive to Altria's 2010 adjusted earnings per share. 
In the second quarter, Black & Mild’s retail share with the machine-made large cigar category declined versus the year-ago period as it faced a challenging environment, due in part to an increase in competitive promotional spending. However, the Cigar segment's income growth has been solid as Middleton's second quarter and first half adjusted operating companies' income grew by 40% and 7.2%, respectively, versus comparable prior-year periods. 
In the Wine segment, we are encouraged that the wine categories volume growth rate for the first half of 2010 appears to have returned to the pre-recessionary levels of about 3%. Ste. Michelle grew its volume faster than the category behind the strong shipment results of Chateau Ste. Michelle and Columbia Crest. This volume performance helped second quarter Wine segment adjusted operating companies' income increase by 13.3% versus the prior-year period and 20.8% for the first half of 2010 versus the comparable year-ago period. 
Altria's continuing progress against the $1.5 billion cost savings program contributed to these solid operating companies' income results. In the second quarter, $129 million of savings were achieved across the Altria family of companies, and $172 million were achieved through the first half of the year.
We realized a total of $1.2 billion in cost savings since the program's inception off the 2006 cost base, and remain confident that we will realize the $290 million in additional cost savings by the end of 2011. The second quarter of 2010 is the first one that can be compared to a post-FET increase order in 2009. Although second quarter volume comparisons for the tobacco categories were impacted by trade inventory movements around this increase, after adjusting for these movements and other factors, we are pleased with the underlying volume trends of the tobacco categories.
In PM U.S.A.'s reported second quarter cigarette shipment volumes declined 10.2% versus comparable year-ago periods. But when adjusted primarily for the FET-related trade inventory build last year and the reductions in trade inventories this year, following PM U.S.A.'s second quarter cigarette, this price increase, volume was estimated to be down approximately 3.5% versus the prior-year period. PM U.S.A. estimates the overall cigarette category declined about 4.5% versus the prior-year period, which is in line with historical price elasticity.
Reported second quarter smokeless product shipment volume was up 9.2% versus the year-ago period and was estimated to be up approximately 9%, when adjusted for trade inventory changes, as well as the timing of USSTC [U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company] and PM U.S.A.'s new product launches and other factors. The companies estimate that the smokeless category continued to grow at a rate of 7% in the second quarter versus the comparable year-ago period.
Finally, Middleton's second quarter cigar shipment volumes grew 19.7% versus the prior-year period. After adjusting for trade inventory changes, Middleton estimates its second quarter shipments were down moderately versus the prior-year period, and that the machine-made large cigar categories' volume grew slightly. 
We are very pleased by the performance of Altria and its operating companies through the first half of the year. Adjusted earnings per share continue to grow, driven by solid income performance across all of our Tobacco and Wine businesses. It is primarily because of these first half results that Altria is increasing its guidance for 2010 full year adjusted diluted earnings per share for a range of $1.87 to $1.91, which represents a 7% to 9% growth rate from an adjusted base of $1.75 per share in 2009.
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Beran, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's Business segment results in more detail."

In the second quarter of 2010, reported operating companies' income for the Cigarette segment exceeded our expectations and increased by $24 million to $1.5 billion, due primarily to higher list prices and lower promotional spending, partially offset by lower volume and higher FDA user fees. 
Marlboro had a record retail share result of 42.8% in the second quarter as the brand grew 1.6 share points versus the prior-year period. Marlboro's retail share results in a comparable year-ago period were impacted by the marketplace pricing dislocations following the FET increase. 
Retail share growth was particularly strong for Marlboro non-menthol products, which grew 1.3 share points versus the second quarter of last year. The Marlboro Special Blend line extensions launched earlier this year were important contributors to this strong retail share performance. 
PM U.S.A. expanded both Marlboro's and overall adjusted Cigarette segment margins in the second quarter. Adjusted Cigarette segment margins grew by a strong 2.9 percentage points versus the comparable year-ago period.
The Smokeless Products segment reported operating companies' income increased $21 million versus the prior-year period to $198 million. Excluding restructuring and acquisition-related costs, adjusted Smokeless segment operating companies' income decreased by $11 million to $202 million. 
Year-over-year income results were impacted by the trade inventory dynamics and costs associated with the national launch of Marlboro Snus that Mike discussed, as well as activities to restructure and integrate USSTC's business into the Altria family of companies.
Second quarter reported smokeless product shipments increased 9.2% versus the prior-year period. Combined second quarter shipments for Copenhagen and Skoal, which grew 7.1%, helped drive these results. We were very pleased that overall Smokeless Products segment's retail share grew in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. Our primary driver of this retail share performance was Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share performance, which grew a very strong 1.3 share points in the second quarter on a comparable year-over-year basis. 
Product initiatives contributed to Copenhagen and Skoal's strong combined retail share performance. Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen, Long Cut Straight and Extra Long Cut Natural helped drive the brand's strong second quarter retail share growth of 2.6 share points. Skoal introduced brand-building programs on Wintergreen, Straight and Mint variants in the second quarter, which in conjunction with the Skoal up to summer equity-building campaign, helped strengthen the brand's retail share performance as the second quarter progressed.
The national launch of Marlboro Snus, which occurred at the end of the first quarter of 2010 was also an important contributor to the Smokeless Product segment's volume and retail share results. Marlboro Snus, which is available in four different variants, has had good initial awareness and trial and is meeting our expectations. We have an integrated marketing plan for the balance of the year to continue building awareness and trial among adult tobacco consumers for these new products.
The Cigars segment reported second quarter operating companies' income increased $20 million versus the prior-year period to $56 million. Black & Mild's second quarter retail share of the machine-made large cigar category declined by 2.4 share points versus the prior-year period to 27.9%. Black & Mild continued to meet evolving adult cigar consumers' preferences for variety by introducing Black & Mild Royale in both plastic and wood tip variants. 
Middleton intends to strengthen the brand's position in the marketplace through additional brand-building activities. Ste. Michelle reported strong business results in the second quarter of 2010. Reported operating companies' income for the Wine segment increased $3 million versus the prior-year period to $12 million. When adjusted for restructuring and acquisition-related costs, second quarter adjusted operating companies' income increased by 13.3% versus the prior-year period to $17 million.
Wine segment shipment volumes versus the second quarter and first half of last year increased by 10% and 15.4%, respectively. Overall, the wine industry's retail unit volume, as measured by Nielsen Total Wine Database for U.S. Food, Drug and Liquor increased by 2% in the second quarter and 2.7% in the first half of 2010 versus the year-ago periods. Ste. Michelle's second quarter and first half retail unit volume grew faster than the industry's at 5.7% and 5.5%, respectively.
The Financial Services segment's reported second quarter operating companies' income decreased $44 million versus the prior-year period to $39 million, due to lower gains on asset sales. In the second quarter, Altria executed a closing agreement with the IRS with respect to its 2000 to 2003 Federal income tax returns. In this Closing Agreement, we agreed to pay approximately $945 million in taxes and related interests associated with the disallowance of certain leveraged leasing transactions entered into by PMCC in 1996 through 2003. We made this payment to the IRS yesterday, and we intend to contest these disallowances vigorously.
The tax component of this payment represents an acceleration of taxes that Altria otherwise would have paid over the lease terms of these transactions. As we have previously disclosed, if the IRS in the future similarly disallows the tax benefits from these transactions for the period from 2004 until the end of 2010, the net additional tax and interest due would be approximately $1 billion, excluding any potential penalties. 
The closing of the 2000 and 2003 Federal income tax audit, as well as other state income tax matters, impacted the reported tax rate for Altria in the second quarter. Altria's reported tax rate for the second quarter was 22.9% due to the following: The closing of the Federal audit resulted in a tax benefit of $47 million, primarily attributable to the reversal of tax reserves and associated interests related to Altria and its current subsidiaries. The closing of this audit also resulted in a tax benefit of $169 million due to the reversal of tax reserves and interests related to Altria's former subsidiaries: Kraft and PMI. This $169 million tax benefit was completely offset by a reduction in receivables from Kraft and PMI, resulting in no impact on Altria's reported net earnings for the second quarter. This tax event is similar to the one which occurred in the third quarter of 2009. 
And finally, there was an $11 million tax benefit due primarily to the reversal of tax reserves and interests associated with the resolution of several state income tax audits. Excluding the net tax benefits recorded during the first half of 2010, Altria's income tax rates for the three- and six-month periods are consistent with its 2010 forecasted full year effective tax rate on operations of approximately 35.4%. 
In the second quarter, Altria issued $800 million in 5 1/4-year notes with a coupon of 4 1/8%. This opportunistic financing enabled the company to take advantage of the historically low interest rates and tightening corporate credit spreads. In the second quarter, we also paid off $775 million in notes with a coupon of 7 1/8%. This refinancing is consistent with our strategy of reducing the company's overall financing costs. 
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the calls are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 34% in the quarter. Marlboro's net pack price was $5.50, and the lowest effective priced cigarette pack price was $4.09. The cigarette discount category's second quarter retail share was 26.9%, a decline of 4/10 of a share point versus the year-ago period. 
The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the beginning of the third quarter was $1.36 per pack and includes the five states that increased their excise taxes on July 1. Copenhagen's retail price was $4.12, and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 41% in the second quarter. 
At the end of the second quarter, the District of Columbia and 18 states used a weight-based excise tax system, representing about 27% of the smokeless category's volume. CapEx was $31 million in the quarter, and ongoing depreciation and amortization was $68 million.

So whether it's 4.5% or not, I think depends somewhat on factors outside of our control, like, state excise taxes and so on and so forth. But certainly, I think it's fair to say that it's begun to stabilize post the FET into, kind of, a more normalized level. And we'll kind of see how that maintains itself as we move on through the balance of the year, but it looks pretty normal at this point in time. Relative to smokeless, it looks over recent history that it's been growing at about 7%, and that's what it did this quarter. I think that's pretty healthy growth rate. So we don't see anything new or different occurring that would cause us to believe the differences is going to occur moving ahead. But that again is based on whatever outside factors, we can't project it but pretty stable 7% right now."

Cigarettes and Smokeless have been historically particularly competitive. And they went through a lot of pricing disruption last year and have kind of settled down from that disruption, but they remain competitive. And there are some states where it's more competitive than it is in other states, and in some areas of the country where some brands that have more development are more competitive than they are than other areas of the country. There's nothing new about that. That tends to be the basic market dynamic that exists in cigarettes. So I would say we're seeing a pretty normal competitive environment in the Cigarette business versus what we would have historically expected to see. And that the exception was the period during the change in the FET, which really disrupted marketplace pricing quite a bit. And much is true, Smokeless, it's a competitive marketplace, but I can't point out any particular anomalies relative to what would be a normal competitive marketplace for you. What's a bit different in the Cigar business is that there's been some very aggressive activity in the Cigar business in the first half of the year from some competitors. That's, I'd say, more aggressive than we have seen at least in the time we've owned the business, and so there's been some impact based on that. That's okay. We know how to address that, but I think that's what we are trying to point out in our press release."

We don't dole out the cost savings to the operating companies. We charge the operating companies for services. The costs of the overall services that we provide today is less because we'd added UST to the equation, taken a whole bunch of SG&A expense out of the system and put together a more efficient system to deliver the services.

The price gap hasn't changed much over the quarters. So it's in the mid-30s. It's been pretty stable. I would attribute it more to things like new products like Special Blend, I think, has had a good impact for the brand. It's been a good place for people to go and found some of the other premium brands to be priced more than they want to pay. They can move to a nice premium brand like Marlboro. And during the period of time that we've been launching that, there've been some promotional offers on it and some news related to it. And also, we've seen just some, I think, general health in the Marlboro brand in terms of the strength of its business in various geographies. And that's just indicative of, I think, the fact that we've been pretty much on target the way we've managed price gaps and the brand as we've been going through an economic recession. So it's not one factor. Most of the time, I think price gap really is something you can get wrong, and then it becomes an impediment to your ability to build your business with other things. That's more the way we look at it. It's not a business building technique. It's just something that has to be right relative to the economic circumstances and other circumstances in the marketplace. So that then the other things that we do relative to the brand and its equity have the opportunity to work with the consumer."

Our remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. And I direct you to the forward-looking and cautionary statements at the end of our earnings release, for the review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.
Since Altria acquired UST and its smokeless tobacco and wine subsidiaries on January 6, 2009, U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company's and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates financial results from January 6 through June 30th, 2009 are included in Altria's 2009 consolidated and segment results. For a detailed review of Altria's business results, please review the earnings release that is available on our website, www.altria.com. Altria reports its financial results in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles.
Today's call may contain various operating results on both a reported and on an adjusted basis, which excludes items that affect the comparability of reported results. Descriptions of these measures and reconciliations are included in the earnings press release.

The Altria family of companies delivered excellent financial results in the third quarter of 2010, as adjusted diluted earnings per share in the quarter grew by 12.5% versus the year-ago period.
This strong third quarter earnings per share grow builds on our solid business results from the first half of the year. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share are up 6.6%, giving us confidence that we can achieve our earnings per share growth objectives for the year.
This strong business performance occurred in what remains a very challenging and competitive business environment. Despite these challenges though, we delivered solid business results across our reigning companies, particularly for our cigarettes and smokers products businesses, and the four premium brands of our tobacco operating companies continued performing well in the marketplace.
We believe that the strengths of our adult consumer product business has well positioned us to continue delivering superior returns to our shareholders for the foreseeable future. These returns include a commitment to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. 
In August, Altria increased its dividend by 8.6%, which when combined with the 2.9% dividend increase earlier this year results in a total dividend increase of 11.8% since the beginning of 2010. As of October 15, Altria’s annualized dividend yield was 6.1% versus the S&P 500’s annualized dividend yield of 2.1%. 
We are particularly pleased with the performance of the cigarette segment. In the third quarter, the cigarette segment suggested operating companies’ income grew by 9% versus the prior-year period and increased by 5.6% for the first nine months of the year. PM USA delivered the strong income growth with margin expansion, while continuing to build Marlboro’s position in the marketplace.
Third quarter adjusted cigarette segment’s operating companies’ income margins grew by 1.9 percentage points versus the year-ago period to 40.2%, and by 1.8 percentage points on a nine-month basis. Marlboro continue to perform very well as it grew its retail share for the three and nine-month periods by a strong seven-tenths and eight-tenths of a share point respectively versus the comparable year-ago periods.
The smokeless products segment also reported strong results. Adjusted operating companies’ income grew by 36.5% in the third quarter of 2010 versus the same year-ago period and by 21.8% through the end of the quarter on a year-to-date basis. These income results when combined with the cost savings achieved across the Altria family of companies resulting from the UST acquisition lead to our continued belief that the UST acquisition will be accretive to Altria’s 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share.
Smokeless products retail share also continued to show growth on a year-over-year basis. USSTC and PM USA’s combined retailed share of the smokeless products category for the three and nine-month periods increased by 1.9 and 0.9 share points respectively. Copenhagen and Skoal’s combined third quarter retail share growth of 1.4 share points versus the year-ago period and retail share gains resulting from the national launch of Marlboro Snus drove the strong retail share results.
Copenhagen grew its third quarter retail share by 2.3 share points versus the year-ago period to 25.5% behind continuing momentum from its new products of Long Cut Wintergreen Straight and Extra Long Cut Natural and other brand building programs.
Skoal’s third quarter retail share was essentially the same as the second quarter of 2010, behind brand building initiatives launched earlier this year.
Marlboro Snus also strengthened its position in the marketplace after its national expansion earlier this year. PM USA continues to build awareness and trial for these new products and we are seeing increased interest among adult tobacco consumers. We are optimistic about the long-term prospects for these kinds of tobacco products.
We are pleased with our smokeless products business results as well as the underlying dynamics of the smokeless tobacco category, both of which are showing growth in a challenging environment. You’ve taken a number of successful actions since we have acquired UST, which have significantly strengthened PM USA’s and USSTC’s positions in the smokeless tobacco category.
Altria’s sales and distribution is now implementing a new retail platform to support plan future smokeless products initiatives. We believe that the smokeless tobacco category historically has not received the necessary space and merchandizing attention in retail stores, particularly in light of the strong category growth of the recent past. By offering fixtures to thousands of smokeless tobacco stores, retailers can improve category, merchandizing, reduce out-of-stocks, improve product freshness and help achieve the non-self service retail merchandizing objective of our tobacco companies.
In many cases, this new retail platform is also expected to benefit the machine-made large cigar category and help support continued growth in Middleton cigar businesses. We remain confident about Middleton’s long-term growth prospects, although the company’s third quarter adjusted operating companies’ income declined 12.2% versus the year-ago period. Middleton defended its position in a very competitive environment with brand building initiatives on Black & Mild. These initiatives successfully strengthen the brand’s position in the marketplace as it grew sequential retail share of the machine-made large cigar category from the second to the third quarter of 2010.
We remain pleased with the underlying volume dynamics across the three major tobacco categories. PM USA estimates that the cigarette category continued to decline inline with historical price elasticity at a rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2010. USSTC and PM USA estimate that the smokeless products category continued to grow at a 7% rate in the third quarter. In the machine-made large cigar category’s estimated growth rate for the third quarter of 2010 appears to have accelerated from the levels seen in the immediate post-FET increase environment. 
Middleton estimates that the categories of volume grew approximately 2% in the third quarter, which is closer to the historical 3% category growth rate observed prior to the FET increase in April 2009.
In the wine segment, third quarter adjusted operating companies’ income declined 10.5% versus the year-ago period, but was up 7% on a nine-month basis. In the third quarter, there was some indications that wholesale inventories declined as wholesalers depleted inventories built earlier this year, despite this trade inventory decline, Ste. Michelle grew its reported wine shipment volumes by 4.5%.
Altria’s continuing progress against the $1.5 billion cost savings program contributed to the strong earnings per share growth in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. In the third quarter, $80 million of savings were achieved across the Altria family of companies and $252 million were achieved on a year-to-date basis. We have realized total of $1.3 billion in cost savings since the program’s inception off the 2006 cost base. And remain confident that we will realize the $200 million in additional cost savings by the end of 2011.
Overall, we are very pleased by the performance of Altria and its operating companies through the first three quarters of the year. Adjusted earnings per share are up 6.6% versus the year-ago period driven by solid performances across all our adult consumer products businesses. We, thus, are confident that Altria can grow its 2010 full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share through a range of a $1.87 to a $1.91, which represents a 7% to 9% growth rate from an adjusted base of a $1.75 per share in 2009.
I’ll now turn the call over to Dave Beran, Altria’s Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria’s business segment results in more detail.

In the third quarter of 2010, reported operating companies’ income for the cigarette segment increased by $200 million to $1.5 billion, due primarily to higher list prices, cost savings, and lower promotional spending, partially offset by lower volume and higher FDA user fees.
When adjusted for charges primarily related to the closure of PM USA’s Cabarrus manufacturing facility, adjusted operating companies’ income increased by $128 million in the third quarter versus the prior-year period. On a year-to-date basis, reported and adjusted cigarette segment operating companies’ income results are up by a strong 8% and 5.6% respectively.
PM USA’s reported third quarter cigarette shipment volumes declined 2.4% from the prior-year period. When adjusted primarily for changes in trade inventories, PM USA estimates that its third quarter cigarette shipment volumes declined inline with the estimated cigarette category’s declined rate of 4%. PM USA estimates that the cigarette category declined inline with historical price elasticity by 6% to the first three quarters of 2010.
PM USA’s reported cigarette shipments declined by 4.7% to the first three quarters of this year versus the comparable prior-year period. And when adjusted primarily for changes in trade inventories are estimated to be down 6%.
Marlboro reached a retail share of 42.6% in the third quarter of this year, an increase of seven-tenths of a share point from the prior-year period. Marlboro non-menthol had another strong quarter growing seven-tenths of a share point in the third quarter from the year-ago period behind the continuing momentum of the special blend product launches earlier this year.
PM USA launched Marlboro Skyline Menthol earlier this month to continue building its position in the menthol segment. PM USA’s overall retail share was 49.6% in the third quarter, down one-tenth of a share point from the comparable year-ago period as Marlboro share gains were offset by share losses among PM USA’s non-support brands.
The smokeless products segment’s reported operating companies’ income increased $83 million to $210 million in the third quarter versus the prior-year period. Excluding restructuring and acquisition related cost, adjusted smokeless product segment operating companies’ income increased by $57 million to $213 million.
Through the first nine months of the year, reported operating companies’ income was up 94% from their prior-year period to $586 million and grew 21.8% on an adjusted basis to $603 million. Strong smokeless product shipments contributed to these third quarter and year-to-date income results. Smokeless products shipments volume increased 16.4% in the third quarter and 15.6% on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable prior-year periods.
When adjusted for trade inventory changes, volume for both the third quarter and year-to-date periods increased by an estimated 10% and grew faster than the smokeless category’s estimated growth rate of 7%. 
The cigar segment’s reported third quarter operating companies’ income decreased $6 million versus the prior-year period to $43 million, due primarily to investments Middleton made in response to competitive dynamics in the marketplace. On a year-to-date basis, reported cigar segment operating companies’ income of $146 million was up 5% versus the prior-year period and increased seven-tenths of a percent versus a comparable year-ago period on adjusted for integration cost.
Black & Mild’s third quarter retail share of the machine-made large cigar category declined by 1.4 share points versus the prior-year period to 29.1%, but increased sequentially from the second to the third quarter of 2010, by 1.4 share points behind the successful introduction of Black & Mild Royale and other brand building initiatives. Middleton’s third quarter reported cigar shipments were down eight-tenths of a percent from the comparable year-ago period and declined 1.4% on a year-to-date basis. 
Third quarter reported operating companies’ income for the wine segment was unchanged versus prior-year period at $12 million. When adjusted for exit integration and acquisition related charges, adjusted operating companies’ income for the wine segment decreased by $2 million versus the prior-year period.
For the first nine months of the year, reported operating companies’ income for the wine segment grew by 40.9% versus a comparable prior-year period and by 7% when adjusted for integration and acquisition related charges. Wine shipment volumes grew by 4.5% in the third quarter and 11.5% on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable prior-year periods. Ste. Michelle estimates that its shipment volumes in the third quarter were negatively impacted by moderate trade inventory reductions in the quarter.
The financial services segment’s reported third quarter operating companies’ income decreased $30 million versus the prior-year period to $27 million due to lower gains on asset sales. Through the first three quarters of this year, the financial services segment’s operating companies’ income was down $173 million on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable year-ago period.
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items. Marlboro’s price gap versus the lowest effective price cigarette was 34% in the quarter. Marlboro’s net pack price was $5.63 and the lowest effective price cigarette was $4.19. The cigarette discount category’s third quarter retail share was unchanged versus the prior-year period at 27.4%.
The estimated weighted average cigarette state exercise tax at the end of the third quarter was a $1.36 per pack. Copenhagen’s net retail price was $4.24 and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 40% in the third quarter. 
As of October 1st, 2010 the District of Columbia and 19 states used a weight-based smokeless tobacco exercise tax system representing approximately 29% of the smokeless category’s volume. 
CapEx was $47 million in the quarter and ongoing depreciation and amortization was $71 million.
Operator, do we have any questions?

This is a category that it’s grown pretty substantially here over the last few years. But in retail stores, there hasn’t been any significant movement in the space at the same time the cigarette category is declined in volume, and while inventories have come down in the cigarette business, the actual physical space devoted to cigarettes hasn’t meaningfully changed as well. So there’s a good opportunity to play catch-up here and that’s what we’re doing in the second half of the year. 
We’re helping retailers redistribute their space, so it’s more consistent with their sales, and that will allow for better performance I think in the smokeless business regarding out-of-stocks and products, things like that, while at the same time continuing to present the cigarette category in appropriate way in the stores. And we also expect to see the cigar business drives and benefits from that because as well because that’s being accommodated as a part of this work. So that remains ongoing. 
I would say we’re about halfway through what we want to get accomplished this year. So we’re pretty much on target with what we expected to get done. And it’s an important thing to get done, because we have initiatives in the smokeless business that we want to bring to the marketplace, but we want to bring into the marketplace in a way that they can be presented properly in retail stores, so it’s important work.

The brand needs to be able or had historically grown share at higher price gaps than currently exist versus price value brands in the marketplace. And I’m curious with - with higher cigarette prices overall because of higher taxes and so forth, do you think that those historical benchmarks of where the brand can grow are still relevant? And, if so, what’s the limiting factor or the principle limiting factor and getting back to those levels of price gaps? Is it more the economy or the competitive dynamics in the marketplace or both?

But if you also look at that history in a little more detail what you’ll see is that there is a very real relationship between unemployment and consumer confidence and the ability to sustain higher gaps. 
And so, right now, you continue to have high unemployment than you continue to have low consumer confidence. So the brand is performing quite nicely with gaps in the mid 30s. And I think as the economy improves which inevitably I think will the possibility exist for the brand to withstand lighter gaps. But I think you have to be sensitive to the fact that our history tells us that unemployment numbers and the confidence numbers have a bearing on what the consumer is willing to pay at any given point in time, and so we try to be sensitive to that. 
And I’d also say there is a - the US market is not one big market, it’s a market that’s broken down into pieces, and so there’s variability between states, between tax jurisdictions, between areas of higher unemployment versus lower unemployment, and there is variation in gaps, because our pricing is managed not just on a national list price basis, but also on a state and region basis and it considers other factors that’s one of the reasons why we’re able to show margin expansion is because we can be more surgical in the way we manage gaps across the country.

So we’ll see how that plays out here overtime, but we’re - our interest is in having a brand grow with equity building activities and so somewhat what we’ve done in the second half is launched Royale another SKU of Black & Mild, and we’re seeing some early-on positive momentum from that as well. So we have other initiatives beyond that that we think will help support this business and also will allow us to from the margin back up a bit following this kind of spat of extraordinary competitive activity.

But, nonetheless, Copenhagen Wintergreen has performed pretty well.
Relative to your first question, we haven’t seen a lot of change pretty stable this year relationship between the discount - overall discount segment, premium segments with movement between brands within each segments. 
So all brands come in and they some particularly in the deep discount into the business you see some brands come in and they grow and then something happens and somebody else starts to grow. So the business moves around somewhat between brands, so I that’s gone on for while. 
And, frankly, the fact that some people exit probably doesn’t have much impact on the overall dynamic in the category, it just continues to facilitate that movement between different brands within the discount segment.

In many cases, it’s really a reallocation of the space, so that the fixtures that are in the stores can accommodate the necessary inventory levels on smokeless tobacco to meet the sales requirements in those stores and in some of those cases that space is coming from cigarette rack space, because the inventory necessary to meet the sales demand of the cigarette business can be accommodated with less footage of space. 
So I don’t know that that is a what I would describe as a huge change in the presentation of the world tobacco in the retail store as much as it is a better management of inventory for the retailer, so that they can meet their consumer demand, and maintain appropriate inventory positions in their stores. I think that’s the way to look at it. 
There are situations where the categories are not presented together or they’re not efficiently displayed in the store and so there is some opportunity for retailers to improve that situation as well. But in think in most cases it really is a reallocation of space to meet changing dynamics that have occurred over the last couple of years in the categories.

Our remarks contained forward-looking statements and projections of future results. And I direct you to the forward-looking and cautionary statements at the end of our earnings release for the review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.
Since Altria acquired UST and the Smokeless Tobacco and Wine subsidiaries on January 6, 2009, U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Companies and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates financial results from January 6 through September 30, 2009, are included in Altria's 2009 consolidated and segment results.

296308,114166994,80426,"Altria Group Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Altria Group, Inc.","Executives","Thanks,  Cliff, and good morning to everyone. The Altria family of companies delivered excellent financial results in the third quarter of 2010, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the quarter grew by 12.5% versus the year-ago period. This strong t",1239,"Thanks,  Cliff, and good morning to everyone. The Altria family of companies delivered excellent financial results in the third quarter of 2010, and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the quarter grew by 12.5% versus the year-ago period. This strong third quarter earnings per share growth builds on our solid business results from the first half of the year. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share are up 6.6%, giving us confidence that we can achieve our earnings per share growth objectives for the year.
This strong business performance occurred in what remains a very challenging and competitive business environment. Despite these challenges though, we delivered solid business results across our operating companies, particularly for our Cigarettes and Smokeless Products businesses, and the four premium brands of our tobacco operating companies continued performing well on the marketplace.
We believe that the strengths of our Adult Consumer Product businesses well position us to continue delivering superior returns to our shareholders for the foreseeable future. These returns include a commitment to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. In August, Altria increased its dividend by 8.6%, which when combined with the 2.9% dividend increase earlier this year results in a total dividend increase of 11.8% since the beginning of 2010.
As of October 15, Altria's annualized dividend yield was 6.1% versus the S&P 500's annualized dividend yield of 2.1%. We are particularly pleased with the performance of the Cigarette segment. In the third quarter, the Cigarette segment's adjusted operating companies income grew by 9% versus the prior-year period and increased by 5.6% for the first nine months of the year. PM U.S.A. delivered the strong income growth with margin expansion while continuing to build Marlboro's position in the marketplace.
Third quarter adjusted Cigarette segment's operating companies income margins grew by 1.9 percentage points versus the year-ago period to 40.2% and by 1.8 percentage points on a nine-month basis. Marlboro continued to perform very well, as it grew its retail share for the three- and nine-month periods by a strong 0.7 and 0.8 of a share point, respectively, versus the comparable year-ago periods. 
The Smokeless Products segment also reported strong results. Adjusted operating companies income grew by 36.5% in the third quarter of 2010 versus the same year-ago period and by 21.8% through the end of the quarter on a year-to-date basis. This income results, when combined with the cost savings achieved across the Altria family of companies resulting from the UST acquisition, lead to our continued belief that the UST acquisition will be accretive to Altria's 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share.
Smokeless products retail share also continued to show growth on a year-over-year basis. USSTC and PM U.S.A's combined retail share of the Smokeless Product category for the three- and nine-month periods increased by 1.9 and 0.9 share points, respectively. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined third quarter retail share growth of 1.4 share points versus the year-ago period and retail share gains resulting from the national launch of Marlboro Snus drove this strong retail share results. 
Copenhagen grew its third quarter retail share by 2.3 share points versus the year-ago period to 25.5% behind continuing momentum from its new products of Long Cut Wintergreen, Straight and Extra Long Cut Natural and other brand-building programs. Skoal's third quarter retail share was essentially the same as the second quarter of 2010 behind brand-building initiatives launched earlier this year.
Marlboro's Snus also strengthened its position in the marketplace after its national expansion earlier this year. PM U.S.A. continues to build awareness and trial for these new products, and we are seeing increased interest among adult tobacco consumers. We are optimistic about the long-term prospects for these kinds of tobacco products.
We are pleased with our Smokeless Products business results, as well as the underlying dynamics of the smokeless tobacco category, both of which are showing growth in a challenging environment. We have taken a number of successful actions since we have acquired UST, which have significantly strengthened PM U.S.A.'s and USSTC's positions in the smokeless tobacco category. Altria sales and distribution is now implementing a new retail platform to support planned future smokeless product initiatives.
We believe that the Smokeless Tobacco category historically has not received the necessary space and merchandising attention in retail stores, particularly in light of the strong category growth of the recent past. By offering fixtures to thousands of smokeless tobacco stores, retailers can improve category merchandising, reduce out of stocks, improve product freshness and                                                                      help achieve the non-health sale service retail merchandising objective of our tobacco companies.
In many cases, this new retail platform is also expected to benefit the Machine-Made Large Cigar category and help support continued growth in Middleton's cigar businesses. We remain confident about Middleton's long-term growth prospects,  although the company's third quarter adjusted operating companies income declined 12.2% versus the year-ago period. Middleton defended its position in a very competitive environment with brand-building initiatives on Black & Mild. These initiatives successfully strengthened the brand's position in the marketplace, as it grew sequential retail share of the Machine-Made Large Cigar category from the second to the third quarter of 2010.
We remain pleased with the underlying volume dynamics across the three major tobacco categories. PM U.S.A. estimates that the cigarette category continued to decline in line with historical price elasticity at a rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2010. USSTC and PM U.S.A. estimate that the Smokeless Products category continued to grow in a 7% rate in the third quarter. And the Machine-Made Large Cigar categories estimated growth rate for the third quarter of 2010 appears to have accelerated from a level seen in the immediate post-FET increased environment. Middleton estimates that the categories volume grew approximately 2% in the third quarter, which is closer to the historical 3% category growth rate observed prior to the FET increase in April 2009.
In the Wine segment. Third quarter adjusted operating companies income declined 10.5% versus the year-ago period but was up 7% on a nine-month basis. In the third quarter, there were some indications that wholesale inventories declined as wholesalers depleted inventories built earlier this year. Despite this trade inventory decline, Ste. Michelle grew its reported wine shipment volume by 4.5%.
Altria's continuing progress against the $1.5 billion cost savings program contributed to the strong earnings per share growth in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. In the third quarter, $80 million in savings were achieved across the Altria family of companies, and $252 million were achieved on a year-to-date basis. We have realized total of $1.3 billion in cost savings since the program's inception off the 2006 cost base, and remain confident that we would realize the $200 million in additional cost savings by the end of 2011.
Overall, we are very pleased by the performance of Altria and its operating companies through the first three quarters of the year. Adjusted earnings per share are up 6.6% versus the year-ago period, driven by solid performances across all our adult consumer product businesses. We, thus, are confident that Altria can grow its 2010 full year adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $1.87 to $1.91, which represents a 7% to 9% growth rate from an adjusted base of $1.75 per share in 2009.
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Beran, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's business segment results in more detail."

In the third quarter of 2010, reported operating companies income for the Cigarette segment increased by $200 million to $1.5 billion, due primarily to higher list prices, cost savings and lower promotional spending, partially offset by lower volume and higher FDA user fees.
When adjusted for charges primarily related to the closure of PM U.S.A's various manufacturing facility, adjusted operating companies income increased by $128 million in the third quarter versus the prior-year period.
On a year-to-date basis, reported and adjusted Cigarette segment operating companies income results are up by a strong 8% and 5.6%, respectively.
PM U.S.A.'s reported third quarter cigarette shipment volumes declined 2.4% from the prior-year period. When adjusted primarily for changes in trade inventories, PM U.S.A. estimates that its third quarter cigarette shipment volumes declined in line with the estimated cigarette categories decline rate of 4%. PM U.S.A. estimates that the cigarette category declined in line with historical price elasticity by 6% through the first three quarters of 2010.
PM U.S.A's reported cigarette shipments declined by 4.7% for the first three quarters of this year versus the comparable prior-year period and when adjusted primarily for changes in trade inventories or estimated to be down 6%.
Marlboro reached a retail share of 42.6% in the third quarter of this year, an increase of 0.7 of a share point from the prior-year period. Marlboro non-Menthol had another strong quarter growing 0.7 of a share point in the third quarter from a year-ago period behind the continuing momentum of the Special Blend product launches earlier this year. 
PM U.S.A. launched Marlboro Skyline Menthol earlier this month to continue building its position in the Menthol segment. PM U.S.A.'s overall retail share was 49.6% in the third quarter, down 0.1 a share point from the comparable year-ago period, as Marlboro share gains were offset by share losses among PM U.S.A.'s non-support brands.
The Smokeless Products segments reported operated companies income increased $83 million to $210 million in the third quarter versus the prior-year period. Excluding restructuring and acquisition-related cost, adjusted Smokeless Products segment operating companies income increased by $57 million to $213 million. Through the first nine months of the year, reported operating companies income was up 94% from the prior-year period to $586 million and grew 21.8% on an adjusted basis to $603 million. 
Strong smokeless products shipments contributed to this third quarter and year-to-date income results. Smokeless products shipments volume increased 16.4% in the third quarter and 15.6% on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable prior-year periods. When adjusted for trade inventory changes, volume for both the third quarter and year-to-date periods increased by an estimated 10% and grew faster than the smokeless category's estimated growth rate of 7%.
The Cigars segments reported third quarter operating companies income decreased $6 million versus the prior-year period to $43 million, due primarily to investments Middleton made in response to competitive dynamics in the marketplace. 
On a year-to-date basis, reported Cigar segment operating companies income of $146 million was up 5% versus the prior-year period and increased 0.7% versus the comparable year-ago period when adjusted for integration cost.
Black & Mild's third quarter retail share of the Machine-Made Large Cigar category declined by 1.4 share points versus the prior-year period to 29.1% but increased sequentially from the second to the third quarter of 2010 by 1.4 share points behind the successful introduction of Black & Mild Royale and other brand-building initiatives.
Middleton's third quarter reported cigar shipments were down 0.8% from the comparable year-ago period and declined 1.4% on a year-to-date basis.
Third quarter reported operating companies income for the Wine segment was unchanged versus prior-year period at $12 million. When adjusted for exit integration and acquisition-related charges, adjusted operating companies income for the Wine segment decreased by $2 million versus the prior-year period. 
For the first nine months of the year, reported operating companies income for the Wine segment grew by 40.9% versus the comparable prior-year period and by 7% when adjusted for integration and acquisition-related charges.
Wine shipment volumes grew by 4.5% in the third quarter and 11.5% on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable prior-year periods. Ste. Michelle estimates that its shipment volumes in the third quarter were negatively impacted by moderate trade inventory reductions in the quarter.
The Financial Services segments reported third quarter operating companies income decreased $30 million versus the prior-year period to $27 million, due to lower gains on asset sales. Through the first three quarters of this year, the Financial Services segment's operating companies income was down $173 million on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable year-ago period.
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the callers are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 34% in the quarter. Marlboro's net pack price was $5.63 and the lowest effective priced cigarette pack price was $4.19. The cigarette discount category's third quarter retail share was unchanged versus the prior-year period at 27.4%. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the third quarter was $1.36 per pack. Copenhagen's net retail price was $4.24, and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 40% in the third quarter.
As of October 1, 2010, the District of Columbia in 19 states used a weight-based, smokeless tobacco excise tax system, representing approximately 29% of the smokeless category's volume.
CapEx was $47 million in the quarter, and ongoing depreciation and amortization was $71 million. Operator, do we have any questions?"

But in retail stores, there has been a significant movement in the space. At the same time, the Cigarette category has declined in volume. And while inventories have come down to the Cigarette business, the actual physical space devoted to cigarettes hasn't meaningfully changed as well. So this is a good opportunity to play catch-up here, and that's what we're doing in the second half of the year. We're helping retailers redistribute their space. So it's more consistent with their sales and that will allow for better performance, I think, in the Smokeless business regarding out of stocks and products and things like that, while at the same time, continuing to present the cigarette category in an appropriate way. 
We also expect to see the Cigar business to derive some benefits from that as well because that's being accommodated as a part of this work. So that remains ongoing. I would say we're about half way through what we want to get accomplished this year. So we're pretty much on target with what we expected to get done. And it's important thing to get done because we have initiatives in the Smokeless business that we want to bring to the marketplace. But we want to bring to the marketplace in a way that they could be presented properly in retail stores. So it's important work."

But if you also look at that history in more detail, what you see is that there's a very real relationship between unemployment and consumer confidence and the ability to sustain higher gaps. And so right now, you continue to have high unemployment and you continue to have low consumer confidence. So the brand is performing quite nicely with gaps in the mid-30s. 
And I think as the economy improves, which inevitably I think will, the possibility exists for the brand that withstand wider gaps. But I think you have to be sensitive to the fact that our history tells us that unemployment numbers and the confidence numbers has a bearing on what the consumer is willing to pay at any given point in time, and so we try to be sensitive to that. I'd also say the U.S. market is not one big market. It's a market that's broken down into pieces, and so there's variability between states, between tax jurisdictions, between areas of higher unemployment versus lower unemployment. And there's variation in gaps because our pricing is managed, not just on a national list price basis but also on a state and region basis. And it considers other factors, that's one of the reasons why we're able to show margin expansions because we can be more surgical in the way we manage gaps across the country."

Relative to your first question, we haven't seen a lot of change. It's pretty stable this year -- relationship between the overall Discount segment, Premium segment with movement between brands within each segment. So the old brands coming in and some particularly in the deep discounts into the business, you see some brands come in. And they grow and then, something happens and somebody else starts to grow. So the business moves around somewhat between brands. That's going on for a while. And frankly, the fact that some people exit probably doesn't have much impact on the overall dynamics in the category.

So I don't know that, that is what I would describe as a huge change in the presentation of overall tobacco in the retail store, as much as it is a better management of inventory for the retailer, so that they can meet their consumer demand and maintain appropriate inventory positions in their stores. I think that's the way to look at it. There are situations where the categories are not presented together, or they're not efficiently displayed in the store.

Its adjusted diluted earnings per share in the quarter grew by 12.5% versus the year-ago period. This strong third quarter earnings per share growth builds on our solid business results from the first half of the year. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share are up 6.6%, giving us confidence that we can achieve our earnings per share growth objectives for the year.
This strong business performance occurred in what remains a very challenging and competitive business environment. Despite these challenges though, we delivered solid business results across our operating companies, particularly for our Cigarettes and Smokeless Products businesses, and the four premium brands of our tobacco operating companies continued performing well in the marketplace.
We believe that the strengths of our Adult Consumer Product businesses well position us to continue delivering superior returns to our shareholders for the foreseeable future. These returns include a commitment to return cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. In August, Altria increased its dividend by 8.6%, which when combined with the 2.9% dividend increase earlier this year results in a total dividend increase of 11.8% since the beginning of 2010.
As of October 15, Altria's annualized dividend yield was 6.1% versus the S&P 500's annualized dividend yield of 2.1%. We are particularly pleased with the performance of the Cigarette segment. In the third quarter, the Cigarette segment's adjusted operating companies income grew by 9% versus the prior-year period and increased by 5.6% for the first nine months of the year. PM U.S.A. delivered this strong income growth with margin expansion while continuing to build Marlboro's position in the marketplace.
Third quarter adjusted Cigarette segment's operating companies income margins grew by 1.9 percentage points versus the year-ago period to 40.2% and by 1.8 percentage points on a nine-month basis. Marlboro continued to perform very well, as it grew its retail share for the three- and nine-month periods by a strong 0.7 and 0.8 of a share point respectively versus the comparable year-ago periods. 
The Smokeless Products segment also reported strong results. Adjusted operating companies income grew by 36.5% in the third quarter of 2010 versus the same year-ago period and by 21.8% through the end of the quarter on a year-to-date basis. These income results, when combined with the cost savings achieved across the Altria family of companies resulting from the UST acquisition lead to our continued belief that the UST acquisition will be accretive to Altria's 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share.
Smokeless products retail share also continued to show growth on a year-over-year basis. USSTC and PM U.S.A's combined retail share of the Smokeless Product category for the three- and nine-month periods increased by 1.9 and 0.9 share points respectively. Copenhagen and Skoal's combined third quarter retail share growth of 1.4 share points versus the year-ago period and retail share gains resulting from the national launch of Marlboro Snus drove these strong retail share results. 
Copenhagen grew its third quarter retail share by 2.3 share points versus the year-ago period to 25.5% behind continuing momentum from its new products of Long Cut Wintergreen, Straight and Extra Long Cut Natural and other brand-building programs. Skoal's third quarter retail share was essentially the same as the second quarter of 2010 behind brand-building initiatives launched earlier this year.
Marlboro's Snus also strengthened its position in the marketplace after its national expansion earlier this year. PM U.S.A. continues to build awareness and trial for these new products and we are seeing increased interest among adult tobacco consumers. We are optimistic about the long-term prospects for these kinds of tobacco products.
We are pleased with our Smokeless Products business results as well as the underlying dynamics of the smokeless tobacco category, both of which are showing growth in a challenging environment. We have taken a number of successful actions since we have acquired UST, which have significantly strengthened PM U.S.A.'s and USSTC's positions in the smokeless tobacco category. Altria sales and distribution is now implementing a new retail platform to support planned future smokeless product initiatives.
We believe that the Smokeless Tobacco category historically has not received the necessary space and merchandising attention in retail stores, particularly in light of the strong category growth of the recent past. By offering fixtures to thousands of smokeless tobacco stores, retailers can improve category merchandising, reduce out of stocks, improve product freshness and help achieve the non-self-service retail merchandising objective of our tobacco companies.
In many cases, this new retail platform is also expected to benefit the Machine-Made Large Cigar category and help support continued growth in Middleton's cigar businesses. We remain confident about Middleton's long-term growth prospects, although the company's third quarter adjusted operating companies income declined 12.2% versus the year-ago period. 
Middleton defended its position in a very competitive environment with brand-building initiatives on Black & Mild. These initiatives successfully strengthened the brand's position in the marketplace, as it grew sequential retail share of the Machine-Made Large Cigar category from the second to the third quarter of 2010.
We remain pleased with the underlying volume dynamics across the three major tobacco categories. PM U.S.A. estimates that the cigarette category continued to decline in line with historical price elasticity at a rate of 4% in the third quarter of 2010. USSTC and PM U.S.A. estimate that the Smokeless Products category continued to grow at a 7% rate in the third quarter. And the Machine-Made Large Cigar categories estimated growth rate for the third quarter of 2010 appears to have accelerated from a level seen in the immediate post-FET increased environment. Middleton estimates that the categories volume grew approximately 2% in the third quarter, which is closer to the historical 3% category growth rate observed prior to the FET increase in April 2009.
In the Wine segment third quarter adjusted operating companies income declined 10.5% versus the year-ago period but was up 7% on a nine-month basis. In the third quarter, there were some indications that wholesale inventories declined as wholesalers depleted inventories built earlier this year. Despite this trade inventory decline, Ste. Michelle grew its reported wine shipment volume by 4.5%.
Altria's continuing progress against the $1.5 billion cost savings program contributed to the strong earnings per share growth in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. In the third quarter, $80 million in savings were achieved across the Altria family of companies and $252 million were achieved on a year-to-date basis. We have realized a total of $1.3 billion in cost savings since the program's inception off the 2006 cost base, and remain confident that we will realize the $200 million in additional cost savings by the end of 2011.
Overall, we are very pleased by the performance of Altria and its operating companies through the first three quarters of the year. Adjusted earnings per share are up 6.6% versus the year-ago period, driven by solid performances across all our Adult Consumer Product businesses. We thus are confident that Altria can grow its 2010 full year adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $1.87 to $1.91, which represents a 7% to 9% growth rate from an adjusted base of $1.75 per share in 2009.
I'll now turn the call over to Dave Beran, Altria's Executive Vice President and CFO, who will discuss Altria's business segment results in more detail."

PM U.S.A.'s reported third quarter cigarette shipment volumes declined 2.4% from the prior-year period. When adjusted primarily for changes in trade inventories, PM U.S.A. estimates that its third quarter cigarette shipment volumes declined in line with the estimated cigarette categories decline rate of 4%. PM U.S.A. estimates that the cigarette category declined in line with historical price elasticity by 6% through the first three quarters of 2010.
PM U.S.A's reported cigarette shipments declined by 4.7% for the first three quarters of this year versus the comparable prior-year period and when adjusted primarily for changes in trade inventories are estimated to be down 6%.
Marlboro reached a retail share of 42.6% in the third quarter of this year, an increase of 0.7 of a share point from the prior-year period. Marlboro non-Menthol had another strong quarter growing 0.7 of a share point in the third quarter from a year-ago period behind the continuing momentum of the Special Blend product launches earlier this year. 
PM U.S.A. launched Marlboro Skyline Menthol earlier this month to continue building its position in the Menthol segment. PM U.S.A.'s overall retail share was 49.6% in the third quarter, down 0.1 a share point from the comparable year-ago period, as Marlboro share gains were offset by share losses among PM U.S.A.'s non-support brands.
The Smokeless Products segments reported operated companies income increased $83 million to $210 million in the third quarter versus the prior-year period. Excluding restructuring and acquisition-related cost, adjusted Smokeless Products segment operating companies income increased by $57 million to $213 million. Through the first nine months of the year, reported operating companies income was up 94% from the prior-year period to $586 million and grew 21.8% on an adjusted basis to $603 million. 
Strong smokeless products shipments contributed to this third quarter and year-to-date income results. Smokeless products shipments volume increased 16.4% in the third quarter and 15.6% on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable prior-year periods. When adjusted for trade inventory changes, volume for both the third quarter and year-to-date periods increased by an estimated 10% and grew faster than the smokeless category's estimated growth rate of 7%.
The Cigars segments reported third quarter operating companies income decreased $6 million versus the prior-year period to $43 million due primarily to investments Middleton made in response to competitive dynamics in the marketplace. 
On a year-to-date basis, reported Cigar segment operating companies income of $146 million was up 5% versus the prior-year period and increased 0.7% versus the comparable year-ago period when adjusted for integration cost.
Black & Mild's third quarter retail share of the Machine-Made Large Cigar category declined by 1.4 share points versus the prior-year period to 29.1% but increased sequentially from the second to the third quarter of 2010 by 1.4 share points behind the successful introduction of Black & Mild Royale and other brand-building initiatives.
Middleton's third quarter reported cigar shipments were down 0.8% from the comparable year-ago period and declined 1.4% on a year-to-date basis.
Third quarter reported operating companies income for the Wine segment was unchanged versus prior-year period at $12 million. When adjusted for exit integration and acquisition-related charges, adjusted operating companies income for the Wine segment decreased by $2 million versus the prior-year period. 
For the first nine months of the year, reported operating companies income for the Wine segment grew by 40.9% versus the comparable prior-year period and by 7% when adjusted for integration and acquisition-related charges.
Wine shipment volumes grew by 4.5% in the third quarter and 11.5% on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable prior-year periods. Ste. Michelle estimates that its shipment volumes in the third quarter were negatively impacted by moderate trade inventory reductions in the quarter.
The Financial Services segments reported third quarter operating companies income decreased $30 million versus the prior-year period to $27 million, due to lower gains on asset sales. Through the first three quarters of this year, the Financial Services segment's operating companies income was down $173 million on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable year-ago period.
Mike and I will now be happy to take your questions. While the callers are compiled, let me cover a few housekeeping items. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was 34% in the quarter. Marlboro's net pack price was $5.63 and the lowest effective priced cigarette pack price was $4.19. The cigarette discount category's third quarter retail share was unchanged versus the prior-year period at 27.4%. The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the third quarter was $1.36 per pack. Copenhagen's net retail price was $4.24, and its price gap versus the leading discount brand was approximately 40% in the third quarter.
As of October 1, 2010, the District of Columbia and 19 states used a weight-based, smokeless tobacco excise tax system, representing approximately 29% of the Smokeless category's volume.
CapEx was $47 million in the quarter and ongoing depreciation and amortization was $71 million. Operator, do we have any questions?"

But in retail stores, there hasn’t been any significant movement in the space. At the same time the Cigarette category has declined in volume. And while inventories have come down to the Cigarette business, the actual physical space devoted to cigarettes hasn't meaningfully changed as well. So this is a good opportunity to play catch-up here, and that's what we're doing in the second half of the year, we're helping retailers redistribute their space so it's more consistent with their sales and that will allow for better performance, I think in the Smokeless business regarding out of stocks and products and things like that, while at the same time continuing to present the Cigarette category in an appropriate way in stores. 
And we also expect to see the Cigar business derive some benefits from that as well because that's being accommodated as a part of this work. So that remains ongoing. I would say we're about half way through what we want to get accomplished this year. So we're pretty much on target with what we expected to get done. And it's important thing to get done because we have initiatives in the Smokeless business that we want to bring to the marketplace but we want to bring to the marketplace in a way that they could be presented properly in retail stores.

And so right now, you continue to have high unemployment and you continue to have low consumer confidence. So the brand is performing quite nicely with gaps in the mid-30s. And I think as the economy improves, which it inevitably I think will, the possibility exists for the brand to withstand wider gaps. But I think you have to be sensitive to the fact that our history tells us that the unemployment numbers and the confidence numbers has a bearing on what the consumer is willing to pay at any given point in time, and so we try to be sensitive to that. I'd also say the U.S. market is not one big market, it’s a market that's broken down into pieces, and so there's variability between states, between tax jurisdictions, between areas of higher unemployment versus lower unemployment. And there's variation in gaps because our pricing is managed not just on a national list price basis but also on a state and region basis. And it considers other factors, that's one of the reasons why we're able to show margin expansion, it’s because we can be more surgical in the way we manage gaps across the country."

So we have and I think Black & Mild has responded well. The share has turned a corner and started back up. So I think we're getting the kind of effect that we wanted, although there's some cost associated with that. And so let's see how that plays out here over time. But our interest is in having the brand grow with equity-building activities and so some of what we've done in the second half is launched Royale, another SKU of Black & Mild, and we're seeing some early-on positive momentum from that as well. So we have other initiatives beyond that, that think we will help support this business and also allow us to grow the margin back up a bit following this kind of spate of extraordinary competitive activity."

Have you seen any of this play out in the marketplace, in terms of where those consumers are migrating or what retailers are doing? Because by my estimation, some of the few that have gone belly up are at least one share point of the market, which is a pretty big number. Same perspective on that would be helpful. And then my second is, I estimate that Copenhagen Wintergreen has been about half of the growth of the overall Smokeless business. Is that insane of a number, or do you think that's kind of in the ballpark?"

I just haven't examined it from that perspective. I think it's more complicated than that, when you start looking at growth in the category. But nonetheless, Copenhagen Wintergreen has performed pretty well. 
Relative to your first question, we haven't seen a lot of change. It's pretty stable this year, relationship between the overall Discount segment, Premium segment with movement between brands within each segment. So the old brands coming in and some, particularly in the deep discount end of the business you see some brands come in and they grow and then something happens and somebody else starts to grow. So the business moves around somewhat between brands. That's gone on for a while. And frankly, the fact that some people exit probably doesn't have much impact on the overall dynamic in the category, it just continues to facilitate that movement between different brands within the discount segment."

So I don't know that, that is what I would describe as a huge change in the presentation of overall Tobacco in the retail store, as much as it is a better management of inventory for the retailer so that they can meet their consumer demand and maintain appropriate inventory positions in their stores. I think that's the way to look at it. There are situations where the categories are not presented together or they're not efficiently displayed in the store. And so there's some opportunity for retailers to improve that situation as well. But I think in most cases, it really is a reallocation of space to meet changing dynamics that have occurred over the last couple of years in the categories."
