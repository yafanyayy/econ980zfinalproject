But before Nancy and I detail our third quarter results, let me first give you some insight on how I got to be the CEO o",1004,"Thanks, Kelsey, and good afternoon, everyone. I am very pleased to speak with you in my new role as the Chief Executive Officer at CA. But before Nancy and I detail our third quarter results, let me first give you some insight on how I got to be the CEO of CA. Earlier this week, Gary Fernandes, CA's Lead Independent Director and Head of the CEO Search Committee, asked me if I would consider continuing to lead CA as the CEO. I can tell you this. I was humbled by the Search Committee's confidence in me if I had to make some tough decisions during my 40-year career. But to be honest, this was not one of them. I told Gary and the committee that I would be honored to be considered. Let me tell you why. I have had the privilege of leading this company as Executive Chairman for the past five months. After serving on the Board since 2005 and as its Chairman since 2007, I've gotten to know this management team much better, met many of the CA's 13,000 employees and seen first hand their passion for CA and its customers.I've seen the outstanding work that has gone into our aggressive new strategy, which positions CA in the emerging world of cloud computing and virtualization. I have seen this team realign the entire company around our strategy. We invigorate EMEA and our services organizations with new talent, and inject a new winning attitude across our company. And I worked alongside them as they delivered the strong quarter we're discussing with you today.Throughout it all, I have seen what this team can do. What it is capable of achieving. And most importantly, the commitment to building the market's best enterprise management products, to serving our customers and to building a great company. So when the Board offered me the job, I accepted. With that, let's get into the overview of the third quarter results.Obviously, we are very pleased. Revenue for the period was up, cash flow was strong and we again improved operating margins. Another important indicator, revenue backlog was up, both total revenue backlog and short term. Non-GAAP EPS was flat with the prior year, which I realized seems a bit odd, given that we increased both revenue and operating margin. This is a result of a lower third quarter fiscal 2009 non-GAAP tax rate, setting us up for a difficult year-over-year comparison. That difference netted out to approximately $0.04, and Nancy will talk about that in more detail in a moment.So for the highlights of the quarter. First, while still in early stages, we made progress getting our EMEA and Services business back on track. With the help of a strong renewal base, EMEA reported good growth, while services bookings are improving and were the strongest since we rearchitected that business. In both cases, we made management changes, brought on new talent and more tightly aligned the sales models. Second, security. Our Identity and Access Management business reported record new product sales. Last fall's product releases in access control and data loss prevention contributed to these results. We continue to view the issues of identity and access management faced by our customers, as significant gating factors to successful migration to virtualization and the cloud. CA's expertise in this area will give us a competitive advantage in helping our customers solve these complex issues. Third, Clarity. Our project and portfolio management solution had one of its best quarters ever, with more than 40 new customers added in North America alone. What excites me even more about the impressive number of wins, was the success we had with our Clarity Software-as-a-Service offering, which accounted for just under 50% of the new North America Clarity customers. This progress in Software-as-a-Service clearly opens up new customers for CA and expands our reach. We're definitely starting to see an upward trend here.Fourth, Mainframe 2.0 and our initiatives designed to change Mainframe management continues to drive momentum in the business. Since its introduction in May, Mainframe Software Manager, the first deliverable in the Mainframe 2.0 initiative, has been deployed by more than 150 customers such as ANZ Bank and BNP Paribas.And finally, our Application Performance Management business recorded the strongest quarterly performance ever. CA Wily now manages the world's most mission-critical business services, including nine of the world's top 10 banks, the world's top 10 telecoms and the world's top four entertainment companies. We also made significant progress during the quarter in building out our virtualization and cloud computing capabilities, both in acquiring technology that increases the depth of our offerings and forging strategic relationships. In November, we've closed the acquisition of NetQoS, a leading provider in network performance and service delivery management solutions. Not only did we receive technology vital to successful delivery of cloud services, we also got an immediate contribution to the top-line growth. Two weeks ago, we also announced our acquisition of Oblicore, a leading provider of service level management software for enterprises and service providers. Oblicore supports and strengthens CA's ability to set, measure and optimize service levels to meet business expectations across enterprise and cloud environments. Our approach makes sense to customers like QUALCOMM, the world leader in next-generation mobile technologies, where CA is providing technology in support of QUALCOMM's virtualization strategy. We will continue to make acquisitions, and develop organic technology to build out our capabilities in this quickly-developing market.On the business side, we announced a strategic partnership with the salesforce.com to deliver agile development management in the cloud on the force.com platform. These initial solutions are part of the strategy to extend leadership in the IT governance market, by delivering solutions as a service. As you can see, we have accomplished a great deal this quarter, and are quickly moving ahead as we look to CA World in May, to showcase our best in new technology and thought leadership. Let me now turn the call over to Nancy, who will provide details on the third quarter results. Nancy?"

As Bill mentioned, we had a very good third quarter. Many of you have asked me about bookings as an indicator of the business.

Many of you have asked me about bookings as an indicator of the business. At this point, roughly 2/3 of CA's bookings are renewals of contracts with various durations. This is a carefully-managed portfolio that does not usually lend itself to year-over-year comparisons. This quarter, the renewal bookings came in as scheduled. We are pleased with the metrics underlying those transactions, and we had very strong sales of new products. Let me give you some details. Our renewal yield, essentially the same-store sales metric that indicates whether we are holding pricing, was in the low 90% range. While renewal yields fluctuate slightly, this number, before we add new capacity and new license sales, is exactly where we would expect it to be at this point in the fiscal year. Next, new software licenses. We are working to provide more visibility into our new product sales, as we roll out SAP globally. What I can say is that new product sales, including capacity, grew single digits year over year, both in constant currency and as reported.Our distributed new sales grew double digits, led by application performance management, infrastructure management and identity and access management. While on a smaller base, sales of new mainframe products outpaced distributed growth. This was offset by mainframe capacity, which was down year over year, driven by the mix of business in our renewal portfolio. And finally, new stand-alone transactions. How successful was our sales force in selling new software licenses that were not linked to renewal? The number of stand-alone transactions this quarter increased by low double digits year over year. This is very encouraging. As I mentioned, renewals from multi-year contracts can be lumpy. While we are  pleased with total bookings, which were up 5% in constant currency and 10% as reported, this lumpiness is reflected in our geographic results.We had a lighter renewal portfolio in North America, and a stronger renewal portfolio in EMEA and Latin America, which affected these regions. North American bookings were down 12% in constant currency and as reported, while international bookings were up 38% in constant currency and 52% as reported. EMEA renewals included three deals for more than $190 million. Average duration of subscription and maintenance bookings was 3.2 years. Annualized subscription and maintenance bookings were $373 million, down 1% in constant currency and up 4% as reported. Finally, and most importantly, our revenue backlog is the best means of determining future revenue estimates, and the most useful metric for modeling our results. So let me give you the backlog details. year over year, total revenue backlog of $7.9 billion increased 9% in constant currency and 13% as reported. Both the current and non-current portions of backlog grew on a constant currency and as-reported basis.Turning to revenue, total revenue was $1.128 billion, up 4% in constant currency and 8% as reported. Subscription and maintenance revenue was $1 billion, up 4% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Revenue from professional services was $74 million, down 20% in constant currency and 15% as reported. Overall, this third quarter decline in professional services negatively affected year-over-year total revenue growth by just over 100 basis points. Revenue from software fees and other was $54 million, up 45% in constant currency and 50% as reported. This growth reflects a strong quarter in application performance management and revenue from NetQoS. From a geographic perspective, North American revenue was $655 million, up 7% in constant currency and 8% as reported. International revenue was $473 million, down 1% in constant currency and up 9% as reported. We recorded a positive foreign exchange impact on international revenue of approximately $48 million during the quarter. Third quarter results include approximately $10 million in revenue from the acquisition of NetQoS. Now I'd like to turn to the remainder of the income statement, starting with our non-GAAP results. Operating expenses were $754 million, up 1% on a constant currency basis and up 7% as reported. This year-over-year variance in as-reported results was driven by a weakening of the U.S. dollar, strategic initiatives and increased commissions. Operating income before interest and taxes was $374 million, up 9% on a constant currency basis and 11% as reported. For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 33%, an increase of one percentage point year over year. Excluding a two percentage points of stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP operating margin was 35%. Earnings per share were $0.43, down 2% in constant currency and flat as reported. As Bill mentioned, we had a difficult year-over-year comparison from a tax perspective. Our non-GAAP tax rate fluctuated quarter by quarter last fiscal year, reflecting the impact of discrete tax items. This fiscal year, our improved visibility allows us to apply a consistent 35 1/2% non-GAAP tax rate quarter to quarter. When compared to the prior year, third quarter non-GAAP EPS was adversely affected by approximately $0.04, due to the low non-GAAP tax rate in the prior-year period. Turning to GAAP results, which as presented, include purchase software, intangible amortization, restructuring and other, and gains and losses on hedges that do not mature in the quarter. GAAP operating margin was 31%. GAAP operating income was $351 million, up 11% in constant currency and 14% as reported. While earnings per diluted common share were $0.49, up 22% in constant currency and 26% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the third quarter was 21.6%. When compared to the prior year, third quarter GAAP earnings per share were positively affected by the low rate this quarter by approximately $0.04.As we discussed on prior occasions, the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates apply different methodologies to reflect the impact of discrete items, resulting in a divergence quarter to quarter between the two rates. However, we believe the full year GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates continue to be aligned between 35% and 36% for this fiscal year. In addition, we believe that longer term, we are on a path to a tax rate aligned with industry norms, which is in the lower 30% range. Turning to cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $342 million, compared to $292 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. This was up 36% in constant currency and 17% as reported. For the third quarter, gross receipts related to single installments for the entire or a substantial portion of the contract value were $74 million, compared with $89 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Year over year, total billings backlog of $4.6 billion grew 14% in constant currency and 18% as reported. DSOs were essentially flat year over year. Now I would like to turn to a review of our balance sheet. CA ended the quarter with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and $1.5 billion of total debt, bringing our net cash position to approximately $1.1 billion. During the quarter, we closed the acquisition of NetQoS for approximately $200 million. We also successfully issued $750 million of 10-year senior notes at 5 3/8%, and utilized the proceeds to pay down $500 million of the $750 million drawn on the company's $1 billion revolving credit facility. The company also paid down approximately $636 million of debt, which matured in December, with cash on hand. Included in this debt payment was approximately $460 million in convertible debt, which when settled in cash, reduce the company's diluted shares outstanding. Finally, we purchased approximately 1.8 million shares of stock for a total of $40 million. This leaves just under $160 million in remaining approval, and we continue to be in the market. With that, I'd like to reaffirm our guidance for fiscal year 2010. We continue to provide guidance on a constant-currency basis, which we believe best illustrates the operational performance of the company. The guidance range presented this afternoon reflects the following factors: The first of these is currency fluctuations. In addition, we anticipate incremental fourth quarter expenses of approximately $20 million to $25 million related to real estate and other costs. These expenses will be included in both our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We believe we have the potential to reduce costs, to broader adoption of alternative work strategies and work-from-home programs. We recently closed two acquisitions. For the remainder of fiscal year '10, we expect the combination of NetQoS and Oblicore to be approximately $0.01 dilutive to both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS. For fiscal year '11, our expectation is that both acquisitions will be approximately $0.02 dilutive to GAAP and $0.01 dilutive to non-GAAP EPS. And finally, please note that we anticipate increased interest expense, following the debt placed in the third quarter. Guidance for fiscal year 2010 is as follows: Total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 2% to 4% in constant currency. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenue of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion. The range on non-GAAP operating margins is expected to be 32% to 33%, or 34% to 35% when adjusted for stock-based compensation.We continue to expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to range between 35% and 36% in this fiscal year. This represents a 100 to 200 basis point improvement over fiscal year 2009. GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 18% to 26%. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.46 to $1.57. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 7% to 15%. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.60 to $1.71. And cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 12% to 19% in constant currency. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. Except as previously stated, guidance reflects December foreign exchange rates and includes a partial hedge of operating income. Guidance does not include the impact of any future material acquisitions. We expect approximately $513 million actual shares outstanding, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 533 million shares. Please note that share guidance provided this afternoon reflects the impact of our convertible notes, which were paid down in December and will reduce our fourth quarter weighted average diluted share count by approximately 18 million shares from the third quarter calculation. Guidance does not include any impact from future stock repurchases. So once again, thank you for joining us this afternoon. I am pleased with our third quarter results, and we look forward to taking your questions. Now I will turn the call over to Kelsey."

And as that incorporates into the significant development organization we've put in place over the last three years, we're able to take advantage of that capability, those people, and put together that capability along with the code we build into the marketplace that allows us to grow, where the real opportunities are starting to emerge."

As many of you know, I am just entering my fourth month in the CEO role, and it has been very busy. I have traveled extensively to Asia, Europe and across the U.S., meeting with our team and spending time with customers, talking to them about CA, our solutions and our strategic vision. 
I remain more convinced than ever that the direction we have chose to take this company is the right one. While I will get into our strategy and vision, I first want to talk about our fourth quarter performance. I want you to understand how I view our results, and there are few puts and takes unique to the fourth quarter that I would like to highlight. 
So let me start with revenue. Revenue of $1.1 billion was up 3% in constant currency and 7% as reported. North American revenue was $670 million, up 6% in constant currency and 7% as reported. International revenue was $433 million, down 3% in constant currency and up 6% as reported. 
Weaker performance in EMEA earlier in fiscal 2010 contributed to this quarter's constant currency decrease in international revenue.  As you know, revenue is a lagging indicator in CA's business model. To address our execution challenges in EMEA, we made some changes in the fall, appointing new leadership and bringing on new sales talent. I am encouraged that the fourth quarter sales of new software, excluding capacity, were the strongest we have seen in EMEA and more than a quarters. However, this story is not over, and we can do better. 
We continued to upgrade talent in that region and refine our approach. Over time, I know we can increase the revenue contribution from our international markets. EMEA will be an important part of that evolution. 
I want to note that we expect the lagging impact from EMEA week sales in the first half of fiscal 2010 to affect revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. With first quarter revenue growth expected to be the trough for fiscal year 2011. The guidance Nancy will provide later indicates that we also expect revenue to accelerate in the back half of fiscal 2011. 
Now let me turn to the operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $846 million, up 9% on a constant-currency basis, and up 17% as reported. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23%, down from our low 30% range. The biggest driver of this non-GAAP expense increase was the $50 million restructuring we announced in early April. This equates to $0.06 per share in the quarter. This restructuring was necessary to reposition the company's operational capabilities to pursue our growth strategy, including virtualization management and cloud computing. Step like this allow us to invest in new products, new talent, new channels or to do so while preserving profitability. 
The next largest driver of expense was sales and marketing. Some of this increase was commissions due to year-over-year growth in new license sales and incentives to promote the sales of our new technologies. A piece of this investment was in people. We were hiring into year end. To grow, we are going to have to change the DNA of this organization as it relates to new channels to market, and we have accomplished some of that through bringing talented people to CA, both through acquisition and recruiting. 
I would like to talk about our tax rate for a minute, one of the puts and takes I referenced before. We improved our tax rate. Our non-GAAP rate for the quarter was 28% and 34% for the full year. We continued to refine our tax structure, and we believe we are on a path aligned with industry norms, which is in the lower 30% range. So for the fourth quarter, this yield an $0.08 year-over-year benefit to non-GAAP earnings per share. Given all the progress we have made in our strategy, we are pleased with these overall results. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.34 for the quarter was up 13% in constant currency and 10% as reported. On a GAAP basis, our operating margin was 21%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.19, up 54% in constant currency and 46% as reported. 
And finally, cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $636 million, a slight decrease year-over-year due to the timing of a single installment payments. We ended the year with $1.4 billion in cash flow from operations, which place us at the high end of our expected range. 
Now I would like to turn to the business that was closed in the fourth quarter, which will drive future revenue and profit. As we indicated in January, contract renewals in the back half of fiscal 2010 were roughly evenly split between the third and fourth quarter. For the quarter, total bookings were down 4% in constant currency and 1% as reported, reflecting lumpiness in our renewed portfolio, a difficult compare in Latin America and ongoing weakness in our Internet Security business unit. 
Sales of new software, including capacity, were low-single digits. Although there were bright spots in our performance, obviously, I am not satisfied with those results and believe we can accelerate that growth and here's why. First, our foundation, the Mainframe, a market that is forecasted to grow at just over 1% compounded annually through 2013, exceeded our expectations in fiscal 2010. While the large portion of our Mainframe business is maintenance, new Mainframe product sales are essential to growth. Excluding capacity, these were up more than 20% in fiscal 2010. 
We are number one or number two in every significant Mainframe management product category in which we compete. We are winning because of our strong commitment to the platform, which focuses on innovation and a continuing and expanded role for the Mainframe. We call this Mainframe 2.0. 
Then there is the growth part of our portfolio, which features market growth rates at range from the high-single digits to more than 20% compounded annually over the next few years. These markets are where we are focusing our investment and we are seeing progress. The first of these growth businesses are Identity and Access Management business reported on another quarter of record new product sales. 
During the fourth quarter, we saw strong sales of both our flagship SiteMinder product and CA Access Control. We added more than 45 new Identity Access Management customers. Some of these were existing customers. Some were completely new. 
Here is what is behind our strong results. We talked to customers everyday who want to take advantage of the cloud but have concerns about security. Our Identity and Access Management portfolio enables them to confidently move forward with adoption. CA SiteMinder authenticates and federates users to cloud-based applications and CA Identity Manager provisions users to cloud applications such as salesforce.com. Our next growth business is Service Management and Assurance, CA's monitoring and performance management technology. 
In the fourth quarter, Service Assurance, which includes application performance management, eHealth and Spectrum, grew new product sales low double digits year-over-year, excluding NetQoS. Including NetQoS, Service Assurance sales grew more than 25% year-over-year. In its first full quarter with CA, NetQoS new product sales accelerated sequentially and more than doubled year-over-year. 
And finally, our Cloud portfolio. We closed the acquisition of three tier on March 25. Three tier's app logic allows CA customers to provision, deploy and scale both public and private cloud services. Customers range from large telcos offering cloud-computing services to e-commerce applications such as jewelry.com. We plan to extend support of three tier to both VMware ESX and Microsoft Hyper-V in the back half of this fiscal year. And on March 17, we closed the acquisition of Nimsoft, IT management solutions, particularly suited for emerging markets and emerging enterprises. Nimsoft new product sales grew more than 75% year-over-year with more than half of that business completed after the close of the acquisition. 
We also introduced Nimsoft On Demand, our new Software-as-a-Service unified monitoring solution. In a few weeks since it was launched, more than 100 customers have requested trials of Nimsoft On Demand. We believe infrastructure management as a service will be an important software delivery model for CA. 
With a successful fiscal year 2010 behind us, we now turn our attention to 2011 and beyond. The technology market is at an inflection point. Recognized by our customers and industry analyst, creating what I believe as a significant opportunity. I also believe CA is well positioned to capitalize on this evolution. Our customers want to leverage emerging technologies, while also getting the most of their existing investments. 
This convergence of requirements is well suited for CA. Customers wants CA's platform independence. Our heterogeneous approach, let's them choose any combination of hardware vendors right for their needs. They want CA's decades of experience and expertise across multiple platforms, from mainframe, to physical, to virtual and cloud. They want CA's global presence with 24-hour support. They can call on us anytime of the day or night to solve problems if and when they arise. And they want technologies to help them keep pace with business demands.  
We will continue to invest in our products and solutions, driving for market leadership in the key markets that underlie our strategy: Mainframe, Service Assurance, Identity Access Management, Virtualization and Cloud. We feel good about our strategic direction, and we believe 2011 will be a good step towards achieving our longer-term financial objectives of high single-digit revenue growth. 
As you may have read in the press release this afternoon, Mike Christenson is leaving CA effective May 31. I will not be replacing Mike in the COO role. He leaves the company on a solid operational footing, with many of his accomplishments over the last five years having become the fabric of how we run our business today. On behalf of all of us at CA, I would like to thank Mike for his many contributions to CA and wish him well. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Nancy, who will provide details on the fourth quarter and full year results."

As Bill mentioned, we had a solid fourth quarter and close to fiscal year 2010, which I will discuss in a moment. Our results reflect the hard work of our global team, a focus on implementing our strategy and continued operational execution. Bill took you through the fourth quarter results. Let me put these in the context of our financial performance for the full year. 
Revenue was $4.35 billion, up 3% in constant currency and 2% as reported. Non-GAAP operating expense was $3 billion, up 2% in constant currency and as reported. This is good performance in light of the fact that it includes our fiscal year 2010 restructuring and other investments to pursue our growth strategy. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was 31%. This would have been 34%, excluding stock-based compensation, both include one percentage point from restructuring and were flat with last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.62, up 8% in constant currency and 5% as reported. This include $0.06 per share in restructuring and a $0.04 headwind from currency, and it also reflects an approximate $0.07 per share benefit from our improvement in our approach to Texas as we continue to work to align our profile with industry norms. 
And finally, cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion, up 19% in constant currency and 12% as reported. Four points of growth in cash flow improvements resulted from reduced restructuring payments in fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009. 
On a GAAP basis, our operating margin also improved three percentage points to 29%, and our diluted EPS was $1.47, up 19% in constant currency and 14% as reported. 
I am also pleased to announce that we completed our stock repurchase authorization and CA's Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program for $500 million, which we announced this afternoon.  
Let me now provide some details on fourth quarter performance, which reflects our business as we enter 2011.  As we have said, our revenue backlog is the best means of determining future revenue estimates. Total revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $8.2 billion, a new record of 8% in constant currency and 11% as reported. Both the current and non-current portions of backlog grew on a constant currency and as reported basis, with that current portion growing 4% on a constant-currency basis and 7% as reported year-over-year. 
Nimsoft contributed approximately $40 million to revenue backlog in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, Nimsoft primarily sells software on a subscription basis. So let me give you some color behind this revenue backlog. 
Our Renewal portfolio is comprised of contracts with various durations, often making year-over-year bookings comparisons less meaningful than at other companies who do not use a subscription model. But to understand our growth dynamics, we will focus on yields on renewals and new product sales.  And in the fourth quarter, our renewal yield, essentially a same-store sales metric that indicates the underlying pricing on the Renewal portfolio, was just under 90% for the quarter. This slight sequential decrease in renewal yield was driven by three data center consolidations resulting from our customers, mergers and acquisitions. Without those three deals, renewal yield would have been more than 90%. For the full year, this renewal yield was in the low 90% range, an improvement over the past several years. 
Next, new software sales. In percentage terms, fourth quarter new software sales, including capacity, grew low-single digits year-over-year, both in constant currency and as reported. Our distributed new software sales grew high-single digits led by two areas: Service Management and Assurance; and Identity and Access Management. We want to see even more growth out of these businesses, which are significant to our strategy. 
After an exceptionally strong third quarter, sales of new Mainframe products, excluding capacity, were down slightly year-over-year. But for the full year, sales on new Mainframe products were up over 20% and validate our investments in the Mainframe. Mainframe capacity was flat year-over-year, reflecting the mix of business in our Renewal portfolio. 
And finally, the dollar value of new stand-alone software sales increased more than 20% year-over-year. Bill gave you many of the details on our fourth quarter results, so I have just a few additional things to cover. 
Total revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion and grew year-over-year 3% in constant currency and 7% as reported. This includes a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately $37 million year-over-year. We did see a slight sequential decline in total revenue, which is primarily attributable to currency. 
Subscription and maintenance revenue was $968 million, up year-over-year 2% in constant currency and 6% as reported. Revenue from professional services was $76 million, down 13% in constant currency and 10% as reported. While revenue improvements in services will be a lagging indicator, new engagements accelerated in the back half of the year. A dollar value of new services contracts grew sequentially and more than 30% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. 
Revenue from software fees and other was $59 million, up 50% in constant currency and 55% as reported. This growth includes $11 million in revenue from NetQoS. Please note that the revenue contribution from Nimsoft was not material due to a subscription pricing model. 
On the income statement for the quarter, non-GAAP operating income before interest and taxes was $257 million, down 14% on a constant-currency basis and 18% as reported. As Bill mentioned, our non-GAAP operating margin was 23%. Excluding the three percentage points of stock-based compensation expense, our non-GAAP operating margin was 26%. This was negatively affected by five percentage points due to restructuring. 
Turning to GAAP results for the quarter. GAAP operating income was $232 million, up 33% in constant currency and 29% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 54% due to the effect of discrete items in the quarter. Our full year GAAP tax rate was 34%. From a GAAP perspective, this yielded a $0.02 year-over-year benefit to EPS in the fourth quarter and a $0.06 year-over-year benefit to full year EPS. 
Now for cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $636 million, compared to $648 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. This was down 4% in constant currency and 2% as reported. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was affected by a year-over-year decrease in single installment payments, which were $182 million in fiscal 2010, compared to $244 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Year-over-year total billings backlog of $4.6 billion was up 13% in constant currency and 16% as reported. DSOs were up slightly year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to turn to our review of our balance sheet. CA ended the quarter with approximately $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.5 billion of total debt, bringing our net cash position to approximately $1 billion. During the quarter, we close the acquisition of Nimsoft for approximately $350 million, and this was funded through offshore cash. 
As I mentioned, between January and April, we purchased approximately 6.7 million shares of stock for a total of $156 million. This completes our $250 million stock repurchase authorization, which was announced in October of 2008. 
Now I will turn to fiscal year 2011's guidance. Please note that all non-GAAP operating measures will be reported, excluding stock-based compensation expense on an ongoing basis. Guidance provided this afternoon reflects that change. In addition, guidance presented in this afternoon includes approximately $0.06 of dilution from the acquisitions closed during fiscal year 2010. 
Let me remind you, as has been our practice, guidance is based upon March 31 exchange rates and includes a partial hedge of operating income. Guidance for fiscal year 2011 reflects our decision to invest in the company, and at the same time, to continue improvement in financial performance. 
Guidance is as follows. Total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 3% to 5% in constant currency. At March 31 exchange rates, this translates to reported revenue of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion. The range on non-GAAP operating margins, excluding stock-based compensation expense, is expected to be 34% to 35%, which is flat to up to one percentage point from fiscal year 2010. We continue to expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to range between 33% and 34% in this fiscal year, flat to a one-point improvement over fiscal year 2010. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth, excluding stock-based compensation expense in constant currency, is expected to be in the range of 7% to 12%. At March 31 exchange rates, this translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.87 to $1.95. Fiscal year 2010 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.74, excluding stock-based compensation expense. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 5% to 11%. At March 31 exchange rates, this translates to reported diluted earnings per share of $1.56 to $1.64. And cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 2% to 7% in constant currency. At March 31 exchange rates, this translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion to $1.475 billion. This includes approximately $50 million in restructuring cost, which will reduce cash flow by 3% and is why our non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow from operations growth differ in fiscal 2011. 
For the full year, we expect approximately 513 million actual shares outstanding and a weighted-average diluted share count of approximately 514 million shares. This does not include the effect of any future stock repurchases. Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. 
Before I close today's remarks, I would like to give you a little additional color on the first quarter. First, as Bill mentioned, we expect revenue to accelerate as we move through the year. As a result, we expect the first quarter revenue growth will be the trough for the year. Second, fiscal year 2010 first quarter included approximately $400 million in managed service provider contracts, which will not recur in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Third, first quarter results will include approximately $0.02 of expenses related to CA World, our user conference. 
In addition, last year's first quarter cash flow from operations included a single installment payment of more than $100 million, which we do not expect to recur this year. And finally, please note that from a full year perspective, our renewal portfolio in fiscal 2011 is weighted towards the back half of the year. 
We talked with you in March about our longer-term objectives of revenue growth in the high-single digits, protecting and expanding profitability and double-digit cash flow growth. Fiscal year 2011 guidance is the first step in that direction. It reflects strategic investments made to position CA as a market leader, accelerating growth in our strategic product areas, which translates into growing revenue over the year in a gradually improving business environment. I look forward to seeing many of you at CA World next week and we'll now turn the call over to Bill."

We have set the company on a course for market leadership. We have a great asset in Mainframe that we are nurturing and that will help fund our future. We are investing in growth markets, where we have established market leadership, such as Identity and Access Management and Service Assurance. And are committed to establishing leadership in high-growth, next-generation technologies, such as virtualization and cloud. 
We are focusing on gaining new customers. The more than 14,000 emerging enterprises with revenue from $300 million to $2 billion, a market that we have not reached in the past and we'll now serve through our acquisition of Nimsoft and investments in the channel. 
We are investing in emerging markets, countries with growth rates well above our currently established market. And we will be offering some of our management solutions in a Software-as-a-Service delivery model that is easy to use. 
I am working very closely with the teams to ensure operational discipline around these initiatives removing any obstacles that prevent our growth. As I have said, we will measure our success through growth, both at the top of the P&L in revenue and at the bottom in earnings per share, as well as cash flow. 
In a few days, we will kick off CA World in Las Vegas. It is our premier user conference and we expect about 5,000 customers to attend. For those of you who plan to be there, I assure you, you will come away with a clear understanding of why I am so confident that CA is a company that help customers get the most out of their data processing centers, whether internal systems, in the cloud or combination of both. So with that, I will turn it back to Kelsey, and we look forward to your questions."

We have a recovering Services business, which actually decelerated our revenues, so we are encouraged, but this is the level we feel encouraged at right now. I think we've talked about in the last couple of calls that we've had items in Europe that we needed to address, and we changed the management teams. And then when you change the management team, our revenue model is a lagging model. But we have the impact of that EMEA still coming through, and you heard Bill mentioned that in his commentary. So you kind of have to take the combination of services gradually recovering, EMEA gradually recovering, positive effects from the acquisition, which made us comfortable feeling 3% to 5% was the appropriate level."

And as we move into this year, we're continuing to add the skills we want. We'll continue that through the year and increase it as we go through the year. And there's another piece, it's very, very, important. You may recall this when we talk before, and that is we're going after emerging geographies and we're going after, additionally, the emerging enterprises, the 14,000 accounts that's between 300 million and 2 billion. And the Nimsoft acquisition we made was for two reasons: one, for the technology; and two, for the channel of delivery primarily through NSPs. One of the primary reason, I mentioned this once before, one of the primary reasons we did that, and Gary Read, the CEO there, want to come with us is, he couldn't fund going after the demand that was actually out there. We can. We are. We're developing that channel, we're investing heavily in that channel, we're increasing our investment in international markets by 28% this year, so we're going after the strategy that we defined for you. And what we're going to do and we're investing in that, and it's going to turn it back to us as we go through the year, because that revenue growth does accelerate as we go through the year.

Now on the 3Tera, we're already in the market with that on a platform that was a part of it, and you will see in here, as everyone will, when it come to CA World next week, that in fact, we are introducing significant capability into the marketplace, and you'll see a demonstration of what our strategy is and delivery of those products, and so that's one of the reasons I've said in the back end. What I've said on the introductory part is that you will see that we're starting to deliver on that. And yes, we're going to push hard on the additional platforms. That's one of the things we bring to the marketplace. And you can trust that we'll be on it, but I gave you a range of where it's going to be. It's a reasonable range and we'll continue to push it.

As many of you know, I am just entering my fourth month in the CEO role, and it has been very busy. I have traveled extensively to Asia, Europe and across the U.S., meeting with our team and spending time with customers, talking to them about CA, our solutions and our strategic vision. 
I remain more convinced than ever that the direction we have chose to take this company is the right one. While I will get into our strategy and vision, I first want to talk about our fourth quarter performance. I want you to understand how I view our results, and there are few puts and takes unique to the fourth quarter that I would like to highlight. 
So let me start with revenue. Revenue of $1.1 billion was up 3% in constant currency and 7% as reported. North American revenue was $670 million, up 6% in constant currency and 7% as reported. International revenue was $433 million, down 3% in constant currency and up 6% as reported. 
Weaker performance in EMEA earlier in fiscal 2010 contributed to this quarter's constant currency decrease in international revenue.  As you know, revenue is a lagging indicator in CA's business model. To address our execution challenges in EMEA, we made some changes in the fall, appointing new leadership and bringing on new sales talent. I am encouraged that the fourth quarter sales of new software, excluding capacity, were the strongest we have seen in EMEA and more than a quarters. However, this story is not over, and we can do better. 
We continued to upgrade talent in that region and refine our approach. Over time, I know we can increase the revenue contribution from our international markets. EMEA will be an important part of that evolution. 
I want to note that we expect the lagging impact from EMEA week sales in the first half of fiscal 2010 to affect revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. With first quarter revenue growth expected to be the trough for fiscal year 2011. The guidance Nancy will provide later indicates that we also expect revenue to accelerate in the back half of fiscal 2011. 
Now let me turn to the operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $846 million, up 9% on a constant-currency basis, and up 17% as reported. Non-GAAP operating margin was 23%, down from our low 30% range. The biggest driver of this non-GAAP expense increase was the $50 million restructuring we announced in early April. This equates to $0.06 per share in the quarter. This restructuring was necessary to reposition the company's operational capabilities to pursue our growth strategy, including virtualization management and cloud computing. Step like this allow us to invest in new products, new talent, new channels or to do so while preserving profitability. 
The next largest driver of expense was sales and marketing. Some of this increase was commissions due to year-over-year growth in new license sales and incentives to promote the sales of our new technologies. A piece of this investment was in people. We were hiring into year end. To grow, we are going to have to change the DNA of this organization as it relates to new channels to market, and we have accomplished some of that through bringing talented people to CA, both through acquisition and recruiting. 
I would like to talk about our tax rate for a minute, one of the puts and takes I referenced before. We improved our tax rate. Our non-GAAP rate for the quarter was 28% and 34% for the full year. We continued to refine our tax structure, and we believe we are on a path aligned with industry norms, which is in the lower 30% range. So for the fourth quarter, this yielded an $0.08 year-over-year benefit to non-GAAP earnings per share. Given all the progress we have made in our strategy, we are pleased with these overall results. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.34 for the quarter was up 13% in constant currency and 10% as reported. On a GAAP basis, our operating margin was 21%, and our diluted earnings per share were $0.19, up 54% in constant currency and 46% as reported. 
And finally, cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $636 million, a slight decrease year-over-year due to the timing of a single installment payments. We ended the year with $1.4 billion in cash flow from operations, which place us at the high end of our expected range. 
Now I would like to turn to the business that was closed in the fourth quarter, which will drive future revenue and profit. As we indicated in January, contract renewals in the back half of fiscal 2010 were roughly evenly split between the third and fourth quarter. For the quarter, total bookings were down 4% in constant currency and 1% as reported, reflecting lumpiness in our renewed portfolio, a difficult compare in Latin America and ongoing weakness in our Internet Security business unit. 
Sales of new software, including capacity, were low-single digits. Although there were bright spots in our performance, obviously, I am not satisfied with those results and believe we can accelerate that growth and here's why. First, our foundation, the Mainframe, a market that is forecasted to grow at just over 1% compounded annually through 2013, exceeded our expectations in fiscal 2010. While the large portion of our Mainframe business is maintenance, new Mainframe product sales are essential to growth. Excluding capacity, these were up more than 20% in fiscal 2010. 
We are number one or number two in every significant Mainframe management product category in which we compete. We are winning because of our strong commitment to the platform, which focuses on innovation and a continuing and expanded role for the Mainframe. We call this Mainframe 2.0. 
Then there is the growth part of our portfolio, which features market growth rates at range from the high single digits to more than 20% compounded annually over the next few years. These markets are where we are focusing our investment and we are seeing progress. The first of these growth businesses, our Identity and Access Management business, reported another quarter of record new product sales. 
During the fourth quarter, we saw strong sales of both our flagship SiteMinder product and CA Access Control. We added more than 45 new Identity/Access Management [Identity and Access Management] customers. Some of these were existing customers. Some were completely new. 
Here is what is behind our strong results. We talked to customers everyday who want to take advantage of the cloud but have concerns about security. Our Identity and Access Management portfolio enables them to confidently move forward with adoption. CA SiteMinder authenticates and federates users to cloud-based applications and CA Identity Manager provisions users to cloud applications such as salesforce.com. Our next growth business is Service Management and Assurance, CA's monitoring and performance management technology. 
In the fourth quarter, Service Assurance, which includes application performance management, eHealth and Spectrum, grew new product sales low double digits year-over-year, excluding NetQoS. Including NetQoS, Service Assurance sales grew more than 25% year-over-year. In its first full quarter with CA, NetQoS new product sales accelerated sequentially and more than doubled year-over-year. 
And finally, our Cloud portfolio. We closed the acquisition of three tier on March 25. Three tier's app logic allows CA customers to provision, deploy and scale both public and private cloud services. Customers range from large telcos offering cloud-computing services to e-commerce applications such as jewelry.com. We plan to extend support of three tier to both VMware ESX and Microsoft Hyper-V in the back half of this fiscal year. And on March 17, we closed the acquisition of Nimsoft, IT management solutions, particularly suited for emerging markets and emerging enterprises. Nimsoft new product sales grew more than 75% year-over-year with more than half of that business completed after the close of the acquisition. 
We also introduced Nimsoft On Demand, our new Software-as-a-Service unified monitoring solution. In a few weeks since it was launched, more than 100 customers have requested trials of Nimsoft On Demand. We believe infrastructure management as a service will be an important software delivery model for CA. 
With a successful fiscal year 2010 behind us, we now turn our attention to 2011 and beyond. The technology market is at an inflection point. Recognized by our customers and industry analyst, creating what I believe as a significant opportunity. I also believe CA is well positioned to capitalize on this evolution. Our customers want to leverage emerging technologies, while also getting the most of their existing investments. 
This convergence of requirements is well suited for CA. Customers wants CA's platform independence. Our heterogeneous approach, let's them choose any combination of hardware vendors right for their needs. They want CA's decades of experience and expertise across multiple platforms, from mainframe, to physical, to virtual and cloud. They want CA's global presence with 24-hour support. They can call on us anytime of the day or night to solve problems if and when they arise. And they want technologies to help them keep pace with business demands.  
We will continue to invest in our products and solutions, driving for market leadership in the key markets that underlie our strategy: Mainframe, Service Assurance, Identity Access Management, Virtualization and Cloud. We feel good about our strategic direction, and we believe 2011 will be a good step towards achieving our longer-term financial objectives of high single-digit revenue growth. 
As you may have read in the press release this afternoon, Mike Christenson is leaving CA effective May 31. I will not be replacing Mike in the COO role. He leaves the company on a solid operational footing, with many of his accomplishments over the last five years having become the fabric of how we run our business today. On behalf of all of us at CA, I would like to thank Mike for his many contributions to CA and wish him well. 
With that, let me now turn the call over to Nancy, who will provide details on the fourth quarter and full year results."

As Bill mentioned, we had a solid fourth quarter and close to fiscal year 2010, which I will discuss in a moment. Our results reflect the hard work of our global team, a focus on implementing our strategy and continued operational execution. Bi",1840,"Thank you. As Bill mentioned, we had a solid fourth quarter and close to fiscal year 2010, which I will discuss in a moment. Our results reflect the hard work of our global team, a focus on implementing our strategy and continued operational execution. Bill took you through the fourth quarter results. Let me put these in the context of our financial performance for the full year. 
Revenue was $4.35 billion, up 3% in constant currency and 2% as reported. Non-GAAP operating expense was $3 billion, up 2% in constant currency and as reported. This is good performance in light of the fact that it includes our fiscal year 2010 restructuring and other investments to pursue our growth strategy. 
Non-GAAP operating margin was 31%. This would have been 34%, excluding stock-based compensation, both include one percentage point from restructuring and were flat with last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.62, up 8% in constant currency and 5% as reported. This include $0.06 per share in restructuring and a $0.04 headwind from currency, and it also reflects an approximate $0.07 per share benefit from our improvement in our approach to Texas as we continue to work to align our profile with industry norms. 
And finally, cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion, up 19% in constant currency and 12% as reported. Four points of growth in cash flow improvements resulted from reduced restructuring payments in fiscal 2010 versus fiscal 2009. 
On a GAAP basis, our operating margin also improved three percentage points to 29%, and our diluted EPS was $1.47, up 19% in constant currency and 14% as reported. 
I am also pleased to announce that we completed our stock repurchase authorization and CA's Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program for $500 million, which we announced this afternoon.  
Let me now provide some details on fourth quarter performance, which reflects our business as we enter 2011.  As we have said, our revenue backlog is the best means of determining future revenue estimates. Total revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $8.2 billion, a new record of 8% in constant currency and 11% as reported. Both the current and non-current portions of backlog grew on a constant currency and as reported basis, with that current portion growing 4% on a constant-currency basis and 7% as reported year-over-year. 
Nimsoft contributed approximately $40 million to revenue backlog in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, Nimsoft primarily sells software on a subscription basis. So let me give you some color behind this revenue backlog. 
Our Renewal portfolio is comprised of contracts with various durations, often making year-over-year bookings comparisons less meaningful than at other companies who do not use a subscription model. But to understand our growth dynamics, we will focus on yields on renewals and new product sales.  And in the fourth quarter, our renewal yield, essentially a same-store sales metric that indicates the underlying pricing on the Renewal portfolio, was just under 90% for the quarter. This slight sequential decrease in renewal yield was driven by three data center consolidations resulting from our customers, mergers and acquisitions. Without those three deals, renewal yield would have been more than 90%. For the full year, this renewal yield was in the low 90% range, an improvement over the past several years. 
Next, new software sales. In percentage terms, fourth quarter new software sales, including capacity, grew low-single digits year-over-year, both in constant currency and as reported. Our distributed new software sales grew high-single digits led by two areas: Service Management and Assurance; and Identity and Access Management. We want to see even more growth out of these businesses, which are significant to our strategy. 
After an exceptionally strong third quarter, sales of new Mainframe products, excluding capacity, were down slightly year-over-year. But for the full year, sales on new Mainframe products were up over 20% and validate our investments in the Mainframe. Mainframe capacity was flat year-over-year, reflecting the mix of business in our Renewal portfolio. 
And finally, the dollar value of new stand-alone software sales increased more than 20% year-over-year. Bill gave you many of the details on our fourth quarter results, so I have just a few additional things to cover. 
Total revenue for the quarter was $1.1 billion and grew year-over-year 3% in constant currency and 7% as reported. This includes a positive foreign exchange impact of approximately $37 million year-over-year. We did see a slight sequential decline in total revenue, which is primarily attributable to currency. 
Subscription and maintenance revenue was $968 million, up year-over-year 2% in constant currency and 6% as reported. Revenue from professional services was $76 million, down 13% in constant currency and 10% as reported. While revenue improvements in services will be a lagging indicator, new engagements accelerated in the back half of the year. A dollar value of new services contracts grew sequentially and more than 30% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. 
Revenue from software fees and other was $59 million, up 50% in constant currency and 55% as reported. This growth includes $11 million in revenue from NetQoS. Please note that the revenue contribution from Nimsoft was not material due to a subscription pricing model. 
On the income statement for the quarter, non-GAAP operating income before interest and taxes was $257 million, down 14% on a constant-currency basis and 18% as reported. As Bill mentioned, our non-GAAP operating margin was 23%. Excluding the three percentage points of stock-based compensation expense, our non-GAAP operating margin was 26%. This was negatively affected by five percentage points due to restructuring. 
Turning to GAAP results for the quarter. GAAP operating income was $232 million, up 33% in constant currency and 29% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 54% due to the effect of discrete items in the quarter. Our full year GAAP tax rate was 34%. From a GAAP perspective, this yielded a $0.02 year-over-year benefit to EPS in the fourth quarter and a $0.06 year-over-year benefit to full year EPS. 
Now for cash flow from operations. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $636 million, compared to $648 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. This was down 4% in constant currency and 2% as reported. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was affected by a year-over-year decrease in single installment payments, which were $182 million in fiscal 2010, compared to $244 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. Year-over-year total billings backlog of $4.6 billion was up 13% in constant currency and 16% as reported. DSOs were up slightly year-over-year. 
Now I'd like to turn to our review of our balance sheet. CA ended the quarter with approximately $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.5 billion of total debt, bringing our net cash position to approximately $1 billion. During the quarter, we closed the acquisition of Nimsoft for approximately $350 million, and this was funded through offshore cash. 
As I mentioned, between January and April, we purchased approximately 6.7 million shares of stock for a total of $156 million. This completes our $250 million stock repurchase authorization, which was announced in October of 2008. 
Now I will turn to fiscal year 2011's guidance. Please note that all non-GAAP operating measures will be reported, excluding stock-based compensation expense on an ongoing basis. Guidance provided this afternoon reflects that change. In addition, guidance presented this afternoon includes approximately $0.06 of dilution from the acquisitions closed during fiscal year 2010. 
Let me remind you, as has been our practice, guidance is based upon March 31 exchange rates and includes a partial hedge of operating income. Guidance for fiscal year 2011 reflects our decision to invest in the company, and at the same time, to continue improvement in financial performance. 
Guidance is as follows. Total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 3% to 5% in constant currency. At March 31 exchange rates, this translates to reported revenue of $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion. The range on non-GAAP operating margins, excluding stock-based compensation expense, is expected to be 34% to 35%, which is flat to up to one percentage point from fiscal year 2010. We continue to expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to range between 33% and 34% in this fiscal year, flat to a one-point improvement over fiscal year 2010. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share growth, excluding stock-based compensation expense in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 7% to 12%. At March 31 exchange rates, this translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.87 to $1.95. Fiscal year 2010 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.74, excluding stock-based compensation expense. 
GAAP diluted earnings per share growth in constant currency is expected to be in the range of 5% to 11%. At March 31 exchange rates, this translates to reported diluted earnings per share of $1.56 to $1.64. And cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 2% to 7% in constant currency. At March 31 exchange rates, this translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion to $1.475 billion. This includes approximately $50 million in restructuring cost, which will reduce cash flow by 3% and is why our non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow from operations growth differ in fiscal 2011. 
For the full year, we expect approximately 513 million actual shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 514 million shares. This does not include the effect of any future stock repurchases. Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. 
Before I close today's remarks, I would like to give you a little additional color on the first quarter. First, as Bill mentioned, we expect revenue to accelerate as we move through the year. As a result, we expect the first quarter revenue growth will be the trough for the year. Second, fiscal year 2010 first quarter included approximately $400 million in managed service provider contracts, which will not recur in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Third, first quarter results will include approximately $0.02 of expenses related to CA World, our user conference. 
In addition, last year's first quarter cash flow from operations included a single installment payment of more than $100 million, which we do not expect to recur this year. And finally, please note that from a full year perspective, our renewal portfolio in fiscal 2011 is weighted towards the back half of the year. 
We talked with you in March about our longer-term objectives of revenue growth in the high-single digits, protecting and expanding profitability and double-digit cash flow growth. Fiscal year 2011 guidance is the first step in that direction. It reflects strategic investments made to position CA as a market leader, accelerating growth in our strategic product areas, which translates into growing revenue over the year in a gradually improving business environment. I look forward to seeing many of you at CA World next week and we'll now turn the call over to Bill."

Before I turn the call back to Kelsey for questions, I would like to make a few closing comments. 
We have set the company on a course for market leadership. We have a great asset in Mainframe that we are nurturing and that will help fund our future. We are investing in growth markets, where we have established market leadership, such as Identity and Access Management and Service Assurance. And are committed to establishing leadership in high-growth, next-generation technologies, such as virtualization and cloud. 
We are focusing on gaining new customers. The more than 14,000 emerging enterprises with revenue from $300 million to $2 billion, a market that we have not reached in the past and we'll now serve through our acquisition of Nimsoft and investments in the channel. 
We are investing in emerging markets, countries with growth rates well above our currently established market. And we will be offering some of our management solutions in a Software-as-a-Service delivery model that is easy to use. 
I am working very closely with the teams to ensure operational discipline around these initiatives removing any obstacles that prevent our growth. As I have said, we will measure our success through growth, both at the top of the P&L in revenue and at the bottom in earnings per share, as well as cash flow. 
In a few days, we will kick off CA World in Las Vegas. It is our premier user conference and we expect about 5,000 customers to attend. For those of you who plan to be there, I assure you, you will come away with a clear understanding of why I am so confident that CA is a company that help customers get the most out of their data processing centers, whether internal systems, in the cloud or combination of both. So with that, I will turn it back to Kelsey, and we look forward to your questions."

I think we've talked about in the last couple of calls that we've had items in Europe that we needed to address, and we changed the management teams. And then when you change the management team, our revenue model is a lagging model. But we have the impact of that EMEA still coming through, and you heard Bill mentioned that in his commentary. So you kind of have to take the combination of services gradually recovering, EMEA gradually recovering, positive effects from the acquisition, which made us comfortable feeling 3% to 5% was the appropriate level."

You may recall this when we talk before, and that is we're going after emerging geographies and we're going after, additionally, the emerging enterprises, the 14,000 accounts that's between 300 million and 2 billion. And the Nimsoft acquisition we made was for two reasons: one, for the technology; and two, for the channel of delivery to that, primarily through NSPs. One primary reason, I mentioned this once before, one of the primary reasons we did that, and Gary Read, the CEO there, want to come with us, is he couldn't fund going after the demand that was actually out there. We can. We are. We're developing that channel, we're investing heavily in that channel, we're increasing our investment in international markets by 28% this year, so we're going after the strategy that we defined for you. And what we're going to do and we're investing in that, and it's going to turn it back to us as we go through the year, because that revenue growth does accelerate as we go through the year.

First of all, you know the model that we're on as far as revenue and closing transactions. And so when we're closing them out the increasing rate as we go through the year, revenue for us is a lagging indicator. So if we say it's growing as you go into the back end of the year, you can pay us forward that into the following year then and understand what that means. Now on the 3Tera, we're already in the market with that on a platform that was a part of it, and you will see in here, as everyone will, when they come to CA World next week, that in fact, we are introducing significant capability into the marketplace, and you'll see a demonstration of what our strategy is and delivery of those products, and so that's one of the reasons I've said in the back end. What I've said on the introductory part is that you will see that we're starting to deliver on that. And yes, we're going to push hard on the additional platforms. That's one of the things we bring to the marketplace, and you can trust that we'll be on it. But I gave you a range of where it's going to be. It's a reasonable range and we'll continue to push it. So I think when you walk away from where we already are with cloud capability, virtualization capability and walk away from next week at the CA World, I think you understand that we've got all of the resources driving at it."

So that really is the main indicator for us, because when you look at bookings, you're comparing one set of renewals to another set of renewal. And the most important thing for CA is to have a disciplined approach to established renewal schedules. And when we renew a product, make sure it's renewed at an appropriate renewal yield. That, along with selling new products, is how you're seeing that revenue backlog starting to grow.

Thank you for joining us. June 30th marked the end of my first full quarter as CEO of CA Technologies and I am pleased that we met our revenue, operating margin, earnings per share and cash flow plan for the quarter. During the quarter, we focused on execution to unlock value, accelerate growth and establish our company as the industry leader in I.T. management and security for virtualization and cloud. 
We also continued to invest in our core strengths in managing and securing main frame and distributed environments. We are making progress and we believe we will meet our update of financial expectations for the full year.
During the first quarter, we re-aligned our organization to make our business even more customer-centric and focused, brought in new senior talents to complement our management team, divested non-strategic I.T. governor’s products from the portfolio. 
Started the process and re-branded the company, began realizing value from our newly acquired technologies and announced more than 20 new products to more than 5,000 customers and attendees at our successful user conference CA World.
From a financial prospective, revenue grew 3% in constant currency which is right where we thought we would be. Operating margins were down as expected. This was a result of expenses related to CA World and acquisitions closed last fiscal year. 
Non-GAAP EPS was down 1% in constant currency and finally cash flow was in line with our expectations although down for the quarter. This was primarily a result of a decrease in upfront single installment payments. We achieved these results even though our renewal portfolio was approximately half of what it was last year. Renewal yields were in the low 90% range. These results combined with continued growth in the current portion of the revenue backlog on a constant currency basis are why we are confident in our full year outlook.
However, we also realized there was more we can do especially when we look at new product sales performance during the quarter. We saw growth in the dollar value of stand alone sales of new products meaning sales not attached to renewal. 
Year-over-year, stand alone sales were up more than 30% and contributed to the more than 50% constant currency growth in our software fees and other revenue line. This quarter, standalone deals improved our front revenue and underscored the value of our product portfolio. However, improvements in standalone sales were not enough to offset the negative impact, the lighter inventory renewals had on our ability to drive new product sales.
Quarters with lighter renewal inventories generally result in lower new production sales as renewals are an important opportunity to sell new products. As a result, new product sales excluding mainframe capacity were down mid teens year-over-year. 
At the same time, standalone sales which typically features shorter contract lends in combination with the lighter renewal portfolio contributed to a significant decrease in average contract duration. During the quarter, our average contract lends was 2.9 years. The lowest it has been more than 12 quarters and down from 4.2 in the prior year period. 
This change in duration is reflective of customer preferences but is also influenced by our renewed portfolio causing duration to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Adjusting for the change in average duration, first quarter new product sales excluding capacity were up high single digits on an annualized revenue basis and help drive growth in our current revenue backlog. 
While we are encouraged by the underlined fundamentals of the business this quarter, we are focused on ways to improve free standing sales, help customers in new and emerging growth markets and become an even more strategic partner to our customers. 
We believe that by focusing on these key areas, we will further improve execution and accelerate new product sales. With that, let me turn the call over to Nancy to talk further about our results and our updated outlook. Nancy?

To start with, please note that all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. Now to the quarter.

To start with, please note that all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. Now to the quarter. As Bill said, we saw a constant currency growth in our total revenue backlog and even more encouraging in the current portion of this backlog despite a decline in new product sales. 
Let me explain, total new product sales tell only a part of the story this quarter. To fully understand the impact of new product sales on backlog and future revenues we also look at the contact duration of the new product sales in each period. 
Adjusting for this difference in duration on annualized revenue basis new product sales excluding capacity were up, high single digits. This explains why our current revenue backlog prove during the quarter. Current revenue backlog is an important leading indicator of future revenue and a reason we are confident in our full year revenue expectations. 
Total revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $7.7 billion, up 2% in constant currency and flat as reported. The current portion of backlog grew 4% on a constant currency and 2% on as reported basis. 
Current revenue backlog growth was driven by new distributed software sales of Service Assurance where we believe we have the most complete and compelling stack in the industry.
NetQoS grew new sales by more than 40% in the quarter. We also saw growth in project and portfolio management where customers believe our solutions are best in class. This was offset by declines in virtualization and service automation and identity and access management. We announced availability of five new virtualization management products at the end of the first quarter which have yet to contribute to our results. 
And we are in the process of rebuilding our pipeline in identity and access management which delivered sequential quarters of record performance in the back half of fiscal 2010.
Sales of new mainframe products as well as capacity were down year-over-year. Mainframe sales correlate to the underlying renewal portfolio which as you know was lighter this quarter. We anticipate that mainframe new product sales and capacity will accelerate in the back half of the year, driven by more robust portfolio of renewals.
Total revenue for the quarter was $1.09 billion and grew 3% in constant currency and 5% as reported. This includes a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately $15 million. We did see a slight sequential decline in total revenue from the fourth quarter which is attributable to currency. 2% of our revenue growth in constant currency was from products, primarily acquisition and 1% from services. 
Subscription and maintenance revenue was $961 million, up 1% in constant currency and 2% as reported. Revenue from software fees and another was $52 million, up 51% in constant currency and 58% as reported. 
This reflects contributions from NetQoS and CA Wily. Revenue from professional services was $78 million, up 11% in both constant currency and as reported. This quarter, we focused on completing services projects. However, we did see a deceleration in new services engagement which was a function of the underlying business. 
Now, I’d like to turn to the remainder of the income statement starting with our non-GAAP results. Operating expenses were $724 million, up 8% on a constant currency basis and 10% as reported. This included cost associated with CA World and from acquisitions that closed in fiscal year of 2010. These incremental expenses are reflected in almost every expense line item. Operating income before interest and taxes was $367 million, down 6% on a constant currency basis and 5% as reported.
For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 34%; a decrease of three percentage points reflecting previously discussed investments in CA World and acquisition dilution. Non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operation was $0.45, down 1% in constant currency and flat as reported. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 33.5%
Turning to GAAP results, GAAP operating margin was 30% compared to 31% in the first quarter of last year. GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $324 million, down 8% in constant currency and flat as reported. 
While earnings per diluted common share from continuing operation was $0.43, up 7% in constant currency and 16% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 28.3%. 
Cash flow from operations in the quarter was a $117 million compared to $262 million in the first quarter of this fiscal 2010. First quarter cash flow operations was effected by a year-over-year decrease in single installment payments which were $90 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to a $164 million in the prior year period. 
In addition, cash flow was affected by the year-over-year increase in expenses. Cash flow varies quarter-to-quarter and we remain comfortable with our full year 2011 expectations. Total billings back log of $4.5 billion was up 7% in constant currency and 4% as reported. 
DSO’s were up but we are confidence they will return to normal. Looking at our balance sheet, CA ended the quarter with approximately $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.6 billion of total dept, bringing our net cash position to approximately $918 million. 
Between the middle of May, when our newly authorized $500 million re-purchase program was announced in June 30th, we purchased approximately two million shares of stock for a total of $40 million. 
Between July 1st and July 20th, we re-purchased an additional one million shares for $20 million. This leaves approximately 440 million in remaining approval on the new program and we continue to be in the market. With that, I’d like too reaffirm guidance for revenue, operating margins and cash flow and increase our GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share outlook for fiscal year 2011. 
We continue to provide guidance for growth rates on a constant currency basis which we believe best illustrates the operational performance of the company. With the exception of earnings per share, changes in the dollar amount of the ranges reflects currency fluctuation only as we have not changed our expectations regarding growth rates from guidance given in May. 
In addition, guidance presented this afternoon includes approximately $0.6 of dilution and earnings per share from the acquisitions closed during fiscal year 2010. As a reminder, it is been our practice to provide guidance based on June 30th exchange rates which include a partial hedge of operating income. Guidance is as follows.
Total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 3% to 5% in constant currency. At June 30th exchange rates, this translates the reported revenue of $4.4 to $4.5 billion. The range on non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 34% to 35% which is flat to up 1 percentage point from fiscal year 2010. 
We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to range between 33% and 34% in this fiscal year, flat to one point improvement over fiscal year 2010. Growth in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 7% to 14% in constant currency. 
This reflects a two point or $0.03 increase to the top end of the range provided in May. At June 30th exchange rates, this translates the reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of the $1.82 to a $1.94. 
Growth in GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 5% to 13% in constant currency. This reflects a two point or $0.03 increase to the top end of the range provided in May. At June 30th exchange rates; this translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of a $1.51 to a $1.63. And cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 2% to 7% in constant currency.
At June 30th exchange rates; this translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.38 to $1.45 billion. This includes approximately $50 million in restructuring cash payments where the expense was incurred in the fourth quarter of last year. These payments will reduce cash flow by 3% and is one of the reasons why our non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow from operations growth differ in fiscal 2011.
For the full year, we expect approximately 510 million actual shares outstanding and a weighted-average diluted share count of approximately 511 million shares. This does not include the effect of any future stock repurchases. 
Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. Before I turn the call back to Bill, I would like to provide additional color on the remainder of the year and the second quarter. As we have said, our full year renewal portfolio is approximately 10% lighter as compared to the inventory of renewals in fiscal year 2010. 
It is also weighted towards the back half of the year. Specific to the second quarter, our inventory of renewals is approximately three quarters of last year. Due to the correlation between renewals and cash, we would expect cash flow to be stronger in the second half of this year.
We understand that currencies continue to fluctuate. So I will provide some additional color on CA Technology’s currency exposure. We hedged approximately 80% of our forecasted cash flows for six currencies, the euro being the largest component. This results in a partial hedge of approximately one third of our operating income. Therefore as a rule of sum, a $0.03 decrease in the euro affects our revenue by $12 million and our EPS by approximately $0.01 for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Using June 30th exchange rates, our quarterly revenue is negatively impacted by about $30 million when compared to original guidance. With that, I will turn the call over to Bill to conclude.

And as a result, I’m even more confident in our long term direction. At CA World, I saw firsthand the reaction of our customers to the direction we are taking the company and the products that are backing up that strategy. 
With our strategy clearly defined, we now have one focus, execution. Operationally, our priorities are: increasing the number of free standing sales with new products and getting them in the hands of our customers, responding to customer demand in growth geographies and growth accounts and continuing to align the organization to be more responsive to customer needs and emerging trends. 
Specifically, we will grow free standing sales with new products by driving sales for the new products we introduced at CA World in May, adding new sales leadership and new quarter bearing sales people and developing and delivering new services offerings. 
Second, we see demand outside our current markets and are building our global emerging markets business. Our approach includes a channel and partner strategy. We recognize that these markets will approach us and consume technology differently than our traditional customer base. This is why we purchase Nimsoft with more than 300 MSP partners and continue to invest in our software as a service capabilities. 
While these initiatives will take a few quarters to show meaningful growth, we expect most of the heavy lifting and investment which has already built into our plan to be complete this year and results to start to show in fiscal year 2012. 
Third, we are continuing to re-align the organization behind our strategy, creating a new customer solutions group for CSG lead by David Dobson and design to move CA Technologies from our products and quick approach to one driven by needs of customers. We are now focused on market position and improving share to leveraging our portfolio and expertise. This year is about execution. 
You will see immediate impact in some areas and in others; it will take some time but is about realizing our potential, unlocking our value and growing CA Technologies. We know clearly what we have to do and we are doing it. So with that, I’ll turn it back to Kelsey and we look forward to your questions.

We don’t normally tie that, those capacity changes because obviously we have multi-year contracts etcetera but it does creates some focus and the price performance level of what IBM is delivering is very, very good. 
In terms of pipeline, there is two types of pipeline for us. As Nancy mentioned, the renewal portfolio will continue to expand the inventory through the next few quarters. So that drives both capacity and product. And at CA World, we announced a series of products. One called Chorus where it’s a whole new way to manage main frame tools sets, getting good customer reception. 
So, the number of tools we have available, the vigor in the platform. And then in addition, we are doing some very specific software replacements in software rationalization.
Our services organization is created a software rationalization practice and we’re doing some pretty good size replacements there, taking advantage of vendor consolidations. So I think it’s across the board and we are hopeful that as the renewal portfolio expands, it’s going to look very good over the next few quarters.

So it’s right in our sweet spot. So, we expect the next two quarters for public sector to continue to be robust. And as you know, we have a dedicated public sector organization for both state in the local and federal.

So a little bit of the background, CA has traditionally been organized around product groups and product sales and the fundamental change is really quite simple. We have taken the opportunity to align my group and my team around selected customer markets and segments. 
So to give you a quick overview of what they are, we are organized around our mainframe customers, our security business our large enterprise data center, segments and customers and very importantly Bill commented on in his remarks.
We have formed a team and a new team to focus on these growth markets and customers that we have typically not focused on. So that’s a wonderful opportunity for us to extend the capabilities and technologies we have to a new set of customers. 
So my team has end-to-end accountability, for our business in those selected customer segments and clearly I am working very closely with Ajei Gopal who runs now our technology and development team. 
And then intersecting George’s sales and go-to market team to be able to deliver on the market requirements my team is just sensing and Bill will do that, a very heavy focus on execution. 
So in short term my team has a focus on the execution of our growth strategies that we have called in our strategy to improve our ability to develop and deliver solutions for the market more quickly.

That duration change tends to fluctuate every quarter and it’s a function of two things, the customers whose renewal contracts are scheduled and the number of free standing sales which tend to have slightly shorter duration. 
So both of those were what will fluctuate during the quarter and drove this down to 2.9. What I think you can see that high single digits translated into a 4% constant currency revenue growth in the current portion of our revenue backlog.

We are seeing very much an interest for a technology that’s in our sweet spot and its growing well. One of the advantages we have, we had coverage model to address the public sector for some time where we have folks that are very well versed in how to call on a government, how to manage the process and how to work also with integrators globally.

Thank you for joining us. June 30 marked the end of my first full quarter as CEO of CA Technologies, and I am pleased that we met our revenue, operating margin, earnings per share and cash flow plan for the qu",645,"Thanks, Kelsey, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. June 30 marked the end of my first full quarter as CEO of CA Technologies, and I am pleased that we met our revenue, operating margin, earnings per share and cash flow plan for the quarter. 
During the quarter, we focused on execution to unlock value, accelerate growth and establish our company as the industry leader in IT management and security for virtualization and cloud. We also continued to invest in our core strengths in managing and securing mainframe and distributed environments. We are making progress, and we believe we will meet our updated financial expectations for the full year.
During the first quarter, we realigned our organization to make our business even more customer-centric and focused, brought in new senior talent to complement our management team, divested non-strategic IT governance products from the portfolio, started the process of rebranding the company, began realizing value from our newly acquired technologies and announced more than 20 new products to more than 5,000 customers and attendees at our successful user conference, CA World. 
From a financial perspective, revenue grew 3% in constant currency, which is right where we thought we would be. Operating margins were down as expected. This was a result of expenses related to CA World and acquisitions closed last fiscal year. Non-GAAP EPS was down 1% in constant currency. And finally, cash flow was in line with our expectations, although down for the quarter. This was primarily a result of the decrease in upfront, single installment payments.
We achieved these results even though our renewal portfolio was approximately half of what it was last year. Renewal yields were in the low-90% range. These results, combined with continued growth in the current portion of the revenue backlog on a constant-currency basis, are why we are confident in our full year outlook. However, we also realized there is more we can do, especially when we look at new product sales performance during the quarter.
We saw growth in the dollar value of standalone sales of new products, meaning sales not attached to renewal. Year-over-year, standalone sales were up more than 30% and contributed to the more than 50% constant-currency growth in our software fees and other revenue line. This quarter, standalone deals improved upfront revenue and underscored the value of our product portfolio. However, improvements in standalone sales were not enough to offset the negative impact the lighter inventory of renewals had on our ability to drive new product sales. Quarters with lighter renewal inventories generally result in lower new product sales, as renewals are an important opportunity to sell new products. As a result, new product sales, excluding mainframe capacity, were down mid-teens year-over-year.
At the same time, standalone sales, which typically features shorter contract lengths, in combination with the lighter renewal portfolio, contributed to a significant decrease in average contract duration. During the quarter, our average contract length was 2.9 years, the lowest it has been in more than 12 quarters and down from 4.2 in the prior-year period. This change in duration is reflective of customer preferences but is also influenced by our renewal portfolio causing duration to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. 
Adjusting for the change in average duration, first quarter new product sales, excluding capacity, were up high-single digits on an annualized revenue basis and helped drive growth in our current revenue backlog. While we are encouraged by the underlying fundamentals of the business this quarter, we are focused on ways to improve freestanding sales, help customers in new and emerging growth markets and become an even more strategic partner to our customers. We believe that by focusing on these key areas, we will further improve execution and accelerate new product sales. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Nancy to talk further about our results and our updated outlook. Nancy?"

To start with, please note that all growth rates are year-over-year, unless otherwise indicated. Now to the quarter. As Bill said, we saw constant-currency growth in our total revenue backlog, and even more encouraging, in the current p",1617,"Thank you, Bill. To start with, please note that all growth rates are year-over-year, unless otherwise indicated. 
Now to the quarter. As Bill said, we saw constant-currency growth in our total revenue backlog, and even more encouraging, in the current portion of this backlog despite a decline in new product sales. Let me explain. 
Total new product sales tell only a part of the story this quarter. To fully understand the impact of new product sales on backlog and future revenues, we also look at the contract duration of the new product sales in each period. Adjusting for this difference in duration, on an annualized revenue basis, new product sales, excluding capacity, were up high-single digits. This explains why our current revenue backlog grew during the quarter. 
Current revenue backlog is an important leading indicator of future revenue and a reason we are confident in our full year revenue expectations. Total revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $7.7 billion, up 2% in constant currency and flat as reported. The current portion of backlog grew 4% on a constant-currency and 2% on an as-reported basis. Current revenue backlog growth was driven by new distributed software sales of Service Assurance, where we believe we have the most complete and compelling stack in the industry. 
NetQoS grew new sales by more than 40% in the quarter. We also saw growth in project and portfolio management, where customers believe our solutions are best in class. This was offset by declines in virtualization and service automation and Identity and Access Management. We announced availability of five new virtualization management products at the end of the first quarter, which have yet to contribute to our results. And we are in the process of rebuilding our pipeline in Identity and Access Management, which delivered sequential quarters of record performance in the back half of fiscal 2010.
Sales of new Mainframe products, as well as capacity, were down year-over-year. Mainframe sales correlate to the underlying renewal portfolio, which as you know, was lighter this quarter. We anticipate that Mainframe new product sales and capacity will accelerate in the back half of the year, driven by a more robust portfolio of renewals.
Total revenue for the quarter was $1.09 billion and grew 3% in constant currency and 5% as reported. This includes a favorable foreign exchange impact of approximately $15 million. We did see a slight sequential decline in total revenue from the fourth quarter, which is attributable to currency. 2% of our revenue growth in constant currency was from products, primarily acquisitions and 1% from services. 
Subscription and maintenance revenue was $961 million, up 1% in constant currency and 2% as reported. Revenue from software fees and other was $52 million, up 51% in constant currency and 58% as reported. This reflects contributions from NetQoS and CA Wily. Revenue from professional services was $78 million, up 11% in both constant currency and as reported. This quarter, we focused on completing services projects. However, we did see a deceleration in new services engagements, which was a function of the underlying business.
Now I'd like to turn to the remainder of the income statement, starting with our non-GAAP results. Operating expenses were $724 million, up 8% on a constant-currency basis and 10% as reported. This included costs associated with CA World and from acquisitions that closed in fiscal year 2010. These incremental expenses are reflected in almost every expense line item. 
Operating income before interest and taxes was $367 million, down 6% on a constant-currency basis and 5% as reported.  For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 34%, a decrease of three percentage points, reflecting previously discussed investments in CA World and acquisition dilution. 
Non-GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.45, down 1% in constant currency and flat as reported. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 33.5%.
Turning to GAAP results. GAAP operating margin was 30% compared to 31% in the first quarter of last year. GAAP operating income from continuing operations was $324 million, down 8% in constant currency and flat as reported, while earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations was $0.43, up 7% in constant currency and 16% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 28.3%. 
Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $117 million compared to $262 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. First quarter cash flow from operations was affected by a year-over-year decrease in single installment payments, which were $90 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 compared to $164 million in the prior-year period. In addition, cash flow was affected by the year-over-year increase in expenses. Cash flow varies quarter-to-quarter, and we remain comfortable with our full year 2011 expectations. Total Billings backlog of $4.5 billion was up 7% in constant currency and 4% as reported. DSOs were up, but we are confident they will return to normal. 
Looking at our balance sheet, CA ended the quarter with approximately $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.6 billion of total debt, bringing our net cash position to approximately $918 million. Between the middle of May when our newly authorized $500 million repurchase program was announced, in June 30, we purchased approximately 2 million shares of stock for a total of $40 million. Between July 1 and July 20, we repurchased an additional 1 million shares for $20 million. This leaves approximately $440 million in remaining approval on the new program, and we continue to be in the market.
With that, I'd like to reaffirm guidance for revenue, operating margin and cash flow, and increase our GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share outlook for fiscal year 2011. We continue to provide guidance for growth rates on a constant-currency basis, which we believe best illustrates the operational performance of the company. With the exception of earnings per share, changes in the dollar amount of the ranges reflect currency fluctuation only, as we have not changed our expectations regarding growth rates from guidance given in May. 
It's addition, guidance presented this afternoon includes approximately $0.06 of dilution in earnings per share from the acquisitions closed during fiscal year 2010. As a reminder, it has been our practice to provide guidance based on June 30 exchange rates, which include a partial hedge of operating income. 
Guidance is as follows. Total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 3% to 5% in constant currency. At June 30 exchange rates, this translates to reported revenue of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion. The range on non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 34% to 35%, which is flat to up one percentage point from fiscal year 2010. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to range between 33% and 34% in this fiscal year, flat to one point improvement over fiscal year 2010. Growth in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 7% to 14% in constant currency. This reflects a two point or $0.03 increased to the top end of the range provided in May. 
At June 30 exchange rates, this translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.82 to $1.94. Growth in GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of 5% to 13% in constant currency. This reflects a two point or $0.03 increase to the top end of the range provided in May. At June 30 exchange rates, this translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.51 to $1.63. And cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 2% to 7% in constant currency. At June 30 exchange rates, this translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.38 billion to $1.45 billion. This includes approximately $50 million in restructuring cash payments, where the expense was incurred in the fourth quarter of last year. These payments will reduce cash flow by 3% and is one of the reasons why our non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow from operations growth differ in fiscal 2011.
For the full year, we expect approximately 510 million actual share outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 511 million shares. This does not include the effect of any future stock repurchases. Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. 
Before I turn the call back to Bill, I would like to provide additional color on the remainder of the year and the second quarter. As we have said, our full year renewal portfolio is approximately 10% lighter as compared to the inventory of renewals in fiscal year 2010. It is also weighted towards the back half of the year. Specific to the second quarter, our inventory of renewals is approximately three quarters of last year. 
Due to the correlation between renewals and cash, we would expect cash flow to be stronger in the second half of this year. We understand that currencies continue to fluctuate, so I will provide some additional color on CA Technologies' currency exposure. We hedged approximately 80% of our forecasted cash flows for six currencies, the euro being the largest component. This results in a partial hedge of approximately 1/3 of our operating income. Therefore, as a rule of thumb, a $0.03 decrease in the euro affects our revenues by $12 million and our EPS by approximately $0.01 for the remainder of the fiscal year. Using June 30 exchange rates, our quarterly revenue is negatively impacted by about $30 million when compared to original guidance. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Bill to conclude. Bill?"

And as a result, I am even more confident in our long-term direction. At CA World, I saw first hand the reaction of our customers to the direction we are taking the company and the products that are backing up that strategy. With our strategy clearly defined, we now have one focus: Execution. 
Operationally, our priorities are: Increasing the number of freestanding sales with new products and getting them in the hands of our customers, responding to customer demand in growth geographies and growth accounts and continuing to align the organization to be more responsive to customer needs and emerging trends. Specifically, we will grow freestanding sales with new products by driving sales for the new products we introduced at CA World in May, adding new sales leadership and new quota-bearing sales people and developing and delivering new services offerings. 
Second, we see demand outside our current markets and are building our global emerging markets business. Our approach includes a channel and partner strategy. We recognize that these markets will purchase and consume technology differently than our traditional customer base. This is why we purchased Nimsoft, with more than 300 MSP partners, and continued to invest in our software as a service capabilities. While these initiatives will take a few quarters to show meaningful growth, we expect most of the heavy lifting and investment, which is already built into our plan, to be complete this year and results to start to show in fiscal year 2012. 
Third, we are continuing to realign the organization beyond our strategy, creating a new Customer Solutions Group or CSG led by David Dobson and designed to move CA Technologies from a product-centric approach to one driven by needs of customers. We are now focused on market position and improving share through leveraging our portfolio and expertise. This year is about execution. You will see immediate impact in some areas. And in others, it will take some time. But it is about realizing our potential, unlocking our value and growing CA Technologies. We know clearly what we have to do, and we are doing it. So with that, I will turn it back to Kelsey, and we look forward to your questions."

So that's a wonderful opportunity for us to extend the capabilities and technologies we have to a new set of customers. So my team has end-to-end accountability for our business in those selected customer segments. And clearly, I'm working very closely with Ajei Gopal, who runs now our Technology and Development team. And then, intersecting with George's Sales and Go-to-Market team to be able to deliver on the market requirements my team's sensing, and be able to do that with very heavy focus on execution.

That duration change tends to fluctuate every quarter. And it's a function of two things: The customers whose renewal contracts are scheduled and the number of freestanding sales, which tend to have slightly shorter duration. So both of those were what will fluctuate during the quarter and drove us down to 2.9. What I think you can see is that high single digits translated into a 4% constant currency revenue growth in the current portion of our revenue backlog. So we're encouraged that freestanding sales, which grew 30%, contributed to that growth."

But the Mainframe 2.0 initiative has been successful for us, and the fact that we've been able to visit and interact with the majority of our users.

I am pleased to announce that CA Technologies had grown at second quarter. These results demonstrate that we are making progress.

I am pleased to announce that CA Technologies had grown at second quarter. These results demonstrate that we are making progress. Our strategy to manage and secure physical, virtual and cloud environments is the right strategy and the changes we made to our organization and our focus on rigorous execution are beginning to pay off.
Year-over-year revenue grew 5% in constant currency and which is at the high end of our revenue expectations. Non-GAAP operating margin was 35% reflecting the planned delusion from acquisitions they were closed during fiscal 2010. Even with these investments non-GAAP EPS was up 10% in constant currency.
Cash flow from operations was up 11% in constant currency and amid our expectations. And finally both current and total revenue backlog grew, a good indicator for me of our future revenue growth.
Let me give you a little insight about our sales performance within the business book during the quarter. Total new product sales and capacity grew at high single digits year-over-year. Within this, our distributed products delivered the strongest new sales performance in 10 quarters. Even more satisfying is the breadth of demand across our portfolio.
Project and portfolio management and identity and access management, both grew new sales of products double digits with service insurance tripling year-over-year. It was a record quarter for security, specifically identity and access management.
We were also pleased that we were able to achieve this new sales growth, despite a significant decrease in mainframe capacity sales. This was due to the nature and mix of our renewed portfolio in the quarter which was weighted toward distributed.
Finally, given the lumpy timing of our renewals, I look to our renewal yield to judge the health of our portfolio. Our renewal yield this quarter was in the low 90's consistent with previous quarters.
As we have said over the past few quarters the renewal portfolio increases in the second half of fiscal 2011 compared to the first half and we expect momentum in mainframe to build as well. This combined with our strong first half performance gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year outlook which we are re affirming this afternoon.
At the end of last quarters earnings call I highlighted our operational priorities. They continue to be. Increasing the number of free standing stales with new products, responding to customer demand in both geographies and emerging enterprises and continuing to alight the organization to be more responsive to customers needs and emerging trends.
I believe these priorities will help us unlock the value of CA Technologies. And while we are not yet done we did make very good progress against these objectives during the quarter.
Let me first address free standing sales. We look at this in terms of how we engage our customers. Are we becoming less dependant on our renewal cycle as a compelling event to sell new products to our customers. Free standing sales give us the opportunity to increase our share abroad through both cross selling the current customers and the addition of new customers.
Our success can be seen in our progress in new product sales and we expanded our foot print with 100 new major market accounts this quarter. Another proved point is our success with emerging technologies like virtualization management which are driving purchases across the portfolio.
For example, the U.S. army made a significant investment across project and portfolio management, service assurance and virtualization management and automation solutions.
Rooms to go versus virtualization management integrated with infrastructure management and customers like Logicalis are already using our virtualization management and automation technology to deliver one of the first Cisco UCS Hybrid hosted and on site cloud services. Our second operational priority is responding to customer demand in both geographies and emerging enterprises, companies with revenue from $300 million to $2 billion.
Nimsoft has accelerated our ability to access both of these markets through new channels. including more than 350 managed service providers. We added 37 new Nimsoft customers this quarter including Netflix, Talis and SunGard.
In addition, Nimsoft recently announced full support for Vblog monitoring and assigned ACADIA the virtual computing environment company formed by Cisco, EMC and VMware.
Last quarter I had mentioned that we have increased our investment in growth geographies which for us also include Japan and Australia and recently we brought new management talent into several key roles. While we do not expect these investments or have a material impact this fiscal year. We are encouraged by resource in countries like Mexico and Japan which were significantly during the quarter.
And we expanded our footprint in more than 100 emerging market accounts this quarter. On the third priority, we continue to align the organization to be more responsive to customer needs and emerging trends. Much of this initial heavy lifting was done at the beginning of the July when we created customer solutions group or CSG.
We are already seeing the CSG organization help to improve our execution and we expect overtime that will further enhance our competitive position and our ability to respond to the needs of our customers and changes in the market.
It also helps us drive results from both the assets we have developed and acquired. While we continue to focus on sales of acquired technologies like Nimsoft and NetQoS. We also leverage acquisitions to further our internal development. For example NetQoS technology is included in our new CA virtual assurance product as well as the new CA service assurance suite.
Another good example of driving value out of acquisitions of 3Tera, there are now more than 80 companies using CA's 3Tera AppLogic to one of the 400 grids on 4 continents.
Either as Direct CA Technologies customers or as customers of managed service providers and finally this quarter we announced three acquisitions which enhanced our ability to help customers manage and secure virtualized and cloud environments.
First, for 4Base, a virtualization and a cloud infrastructure consulting firm, with experience in more than 300 engagements, 4Base helps customers like Toyota Motorcredit Corporation accelerate their virtualization transformation.
Second, Hyperformix, expected to close shortly is capacity management software for physical, virtual and cloud infrastructures. Hyperformix will help our customers solve a critical virtualization managed need capacity planning and finally our cost systems which is a leader in providing advancing authentication and broad dimension solutions.
Today Arcot has approximately 120 million identifies already verified using this technology. Before I turn the call over to Nancy, I would like to thank our global teams for their execution and hard work in meeting our customers evolving needs. Nancy?

Now to the quarter, growth in both the current and the total portion of our revenue backlog is a good indicator of our future revenue growth and continues to be reason we remain confident in our full year revenue expectation. Total revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was 7.8 billion up 2% both in constant currency and as reported with the current portion growing 3% on both a constant currency and as reported basis.
Contract duration was 3.5 years. Total revenue for the quarter was 1.11 billion and grew 5% in constant currency and 4% as reported. This includes a negative foreign exchange impact of approximately $15 million. In constant currency robust growth in North America of 8% was partially offset by international performance where revenue grew 2%.
Approximately one half of our revenue growth in constant currency was organic while the other half was from acquired technologies. Subscription and maintenance revenue was $961 million, up 1% in constant currency and down 1% as reported.
Revenue from software fees and other was $70 million, up 150% in both constant currency and as reported. Revenue from professional services was $79 million, up 13% in both constant currency and as reported.
Now I'd like to turn to the remainder of the income statement starting with our non-GAAP results. Operating expenses were $721 million, up 8% on a constant currency basis and 7% as reported. This increase in expenses was primarily driven by acquisitions closed during fiscal year 2010, offset by a one time $10 million benefit from the sale of an equity interest.
Operating income before interest and taxes was $398 million, flat over the prior period on a constant currency basis and down 1% as reported. As I mentioned, we had a one time $10 million benefit from the sale of an equity interest during the quarter. This translated to a 1 percentage point benefit to both GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins and a $0.01 benefit to both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS.
For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 3%, a decrease of 2 percentage points, reflecting dilution from the previously mentioned acquisitions. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.49, up 10% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 34%. 
Turning to GAAP results, GAAP operating margin was 28%. GAAP operating income was $307 million, down 2% in constant currency and down 9% as reported while earnings per diluted common share was $0.43, up 14% in constant currency and up 5% as reported.
On effective GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was 25%. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $130 million, up 11% in constant currency compared to $120 million in the prior year period. Second quarter cash flow from operations was affected by a year-over-year increase in single installment payments which was $124 million in the second quarter, compared to $64 million in the prior year period.
Total billings backlog of $4.7 billion was up 6% in both constant currency and as reported. DSOs were slightly down. Looking at our balance sheet CA Technologies ended the quarter with approximately 2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and 1.6 billion of total debt bringing our net cash position to 958 million.
During the second quarter we purchased approximately 5 million shares of stock for a total 96 million. This leaves approximately 365 million and a remaining approval and we continue to be in the market.
With that I would like to reaffirm guidance for fiscal year 2011. We expect the renewed portfolio to increase in the back half of the year compared to the first half and we also expect that this will drive our mix of new business to a more radical model.
We continue to provide guidance for growth rates on a constant currency basis which we believe best illustrates the operational performance of the company. Dollar changes for all metric expect earnings per share reflect currency fluctuation only.
While the constant currency growth rates are both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share have not changed. The dollar range is provided this afternoon have increased to reflect year-to-date performance, the reduce share count and the currency fluctuation.
As a reminder it is being our practice to provide guidance based upon exchange rates on the last tapped of the previous quarter, in this case September 30 and guidance includes a partial hedge of operating income.
Guidance is as follows, total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 3 to 5% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of 4.45 to 4.55 billion. The range on non-GAAP operating and margin is expected to be 34 to 35%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to range between 33 and 34%.
Both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share on the low and the high end of the range have increased by $0.03. Growth in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 7 to 14% in constant currency. This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of a $1.85 to a $1.97.
Growth in GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 5 to 13% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of a $1.55 to a $1.66 and cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 2 to 7% in constant currency.
This translates to reported cash flow from operations of 1.4 to 1.475 billion. This includes approximately 50 million in restructuring cash payments. These payments will reduce cash flow by 3% and is one of the reasons why our non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow from operations growth differ in fiscal 2011.
Guidance does not include the affect of any future material acquisitions. For the full year we expect approximately 506 million actual shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 508 million shares. This does not include the effect of any future stock repurchases.
And with that I'd like to turn the call over to Bill to conclude. Bill?

I am pleased to announce that CA Technologies had a good second quarter. These results demonstrate that we are making progress. Our strategy to manage and secure physical, virtual and cloud environments is the right strategy. And the changes we made to our organization and our focus on rigorous execution are beginning to pay off. 
Year-over-year, revenue grew 5% in constant currency and was at the high-end of our revenue expectations. Non-GAAP operating margin was 35%, reflecting the plan dilution from acquisitions that were closed during fiscal 2010. Even with these investments, non-GAAP EPS was up 10% in constant currency. Cash flow from operations was up 11% in constant currency and have met our expectations. And finally, both current and total revenue backlog grew, a good indicator for me of our future revenue growth.
Let me give you a little insight about our sales performance within the business booked during the quarter. Total new product sales and capacity grew at high-single digits year-over-year. Within this, our distributor products delivered the strongest new sales performance in 10 quarters. Even more satisfying is the breadth of demand across our portfolio. Project and Portfolio Management and Identity and Access Management both grew new sales of products double digits, with Service Assurance tripling year-over-year. It was a record quarter for Security, specifically Identity and Access Management. We were also pleased that we are able to achieve this new sales growth, despite a significant decrease in Mainframe capacity sales. This was due to the nature and mix of our renewal portfolio in the quarter, which was weighted toward Distributed . Finally, given the lumpy timing of our renewals, I look for our renewal yield to judge the health of our portfolio. Our renewal yield this quarter was in the low 90s, consistent with previous quarters.
As we have said over the past few quarters, the renewal portfolio increases in the second half of fiscal 2011 compared to the first half, and we expect momentum in Mainframe to build as well. This, combined with our strong first half performance, gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year outlook, which we are reaffirming this afternoon. 
At the end of last quarter's earnings call, I highlighted our operational priorities. They continue to be: Increasing the number of free standing sales with new products; responding to customer demand in growth geographies and emerging enterprises; and continuing to align the organization to be more responsive to customer's needs and emerging trends. I believe these priorities will help us unlock the value of CA Technologies, and while we are not yet done, we did make very good progress against these objectives during the quarter. 
Let me first address freestanding sales. We look at this in terms of how we engage our customers. Are we becoming less dependent on a renewal cycle as a compelling event to sell new products to our customers. Free standing sales give us the opportunity to increase our share of wallet through both cross-selling the current customers and the addition of new customers. Our success can be seen in our progress in new product sales and we expanded our footprint in more than 100 new major market accounts this quarter. 
Another proof point is our success with emerging technologies like Virtualization Management, which are driving purchases across the portfolio. For example, the U.S. Army made a significant investment across Project and Portfolio Management, Service Assurance and Virtualization Management and Automation Solutions. Rooms to go versus Virtualization Management integrated with infrastructure management. And customers like Logicalis are already using our Virtualization Management and Automation Technology to deliver one of the first Cisco UCS Hybrid hosted and on-site cloud services. 
Our second operational priority is responding to customer demand in growth geographies and emerging enterprises, companies with revenue from $300 million to $2 billion. Nimsoft has accelerated our ability to access both of these markets through new channels, including more than 350 managed service providers. We had a 37 new Nimsoft customers this quarter, including Netflix, Thales and SunGard.  In addition, Nimsoft recently announced full support for Vblock monitoring and signed Acadia to virtual computing environment company formed by Cisco, EMC and VMware. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that we have increased our investment in growth geographies, which for us also includes Japan and Australia. And recently, we brought new management talent into several key roles. While we do not expect these investments to have a material impact this fiscal year, we are encouraged by results in countries like Mexico and Japan, which grew significantly during the quarter. And we expanded our footprint in more than 100 emerging market accounts this quarter.
On the third priority, we continue to align the organization to be more responsive to customer needs and emerging trends. Much of this initial heavy lifting was done at the beginning of July when we created Customer Solutions Group or CSG. We are already seeing the CSG organization help to improve our execution and we expect, over time, that it will further enhance our competitive position and our ability to respond to the needs of our customers and changes in the market. It also helps us drive results from both the assets we have developed and acquired.
While we continue to focus on sales of acquired technologies like Nimsoft and NetQoS, we also leveraged acquisitions to further internal development. For example, NetQoS technology is included in our new CA Virtual Assurance product, as well as a new CA Service Assurance suite. Another good example of driving value out of acquisitions is 3Tera. There are now more than 80 companies using CA’s 3Tera AppLogic to run over 400 grids on four continents, either as direct CA Technologies customers or as customers of managed service providers. And finally, this quarter we announced three acquisitions, which enhanced our ability to help customers manage and secure virtualized and cloud environments. 
First, 4Base, a virtualization and cloud infrastructure consulting firm with experience in more than 300 engagements. 4Base helps customers like Toyota Motor Credit Corporation accelerate their virtualization transformation. Second, Hyperformix, expect to close shortly, it is capacity management software for physical, virtual and cloud infrastructures. Hyperformix will help our customers solve a critical Virtualization Management need: Capacity planning. And finally, Arcot systems, which is a leader in providing advanced authentication and fraud prevention solutions. 
Today Arcot has approximately 120 million identities already verified using its technology. Before I turn the call over to Nancy, I would like to thank our global teams for their execution and hard work in meeting our customer's evolving needs. Nancy?"
262913,114222553,81000,"CA Technologies, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. To start with, please note that all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. Now to the quarter. Growth in both the current and the total portion of our revenue backlog is a good indicator of our future revenue growth a",1032,"Thank you, Bill. To start with, please note that all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. Now to the quarter. Growth in both the current and the total portion of our revenue backlog is a good indicator of our future revenue growth and continues to be a reason we remain confident in our full year revenue expectation. 
Total revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $7.8  billion, up 2% both in constant currency and as reported, with the current portion growing 3% on both on a constant currency and as reported basis.
Contract duration was 3.5 years. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.11 billion and grew 5% in constant currency and 4% as reported. This includes a negative foreign exchange impact of approximately $15 million. 
In constant currency, robust growth in North America up 8% was partially offset by international performance where revenue grew 2%. Approximately one half of our revenue growth in constant currency was organic, while the other half was from acquired technologies.
Subscription and maintenance revenue was $961  million, up 1% in constant currency and down 1% as reported. Revenue from software fees and others were $70 million, up by 150% in both constant currency and as reported. Revenue from Professional Services was $79 million, up 13% in both constant currency and as reported.
Now I'd like to turn to the remainder of the income statement starting with our non-GAAP results. Operating expenses were $721 million, up 8% on a constant currency basis and 7% as reported. This increase in expenses was primarily driven by acquisitions closed during fiscal year 2010, offset by a one-time $10 million benefit from the sale of an equity interest. 
Operating income before interest and taxes was $389 million, flat over the prior period on a constant currency basis and down 1% as reported. As I mentioned, we had a one-time $10 million benefit from the sale of an equity interest during the quarter. This translated to a one percentage point benefit to both GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins, and a $0.01 benefit to both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS. 
For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 35%, a decrease of two percentage points, reflecting dilution from the previously-mentioned acquisitions. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.49, up 10% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 34%.
Turning to GAAP results. GAAP operating margin was 28%. GAAP operating income was $307 million, down 2% in constant currency and down 9% as reported, while earnings per diluted common share was $0.43, up a 14% in constant currency and up 5% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was 25%. 
Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $130 million, up 11% in constant currency compared to $120 million in the prior-year period. Second quarter cash flow from operations was affected by a year-over-year increase in single installment payments, which was $124 million in the second quarter, compared to $64 million in the prior-year period. Total billings backlog of $4.7 billion was up 6% in both constant currency and as reported. DSOs were slightly down.
Looking at our balance sheet, CA Technologies ended the quarter with approximately $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.6  billion of total debt, bringing our net cash position to $958 million. 
During the second quarter, we purchased approximately 5 million shares of stock for a total of $96 million. This leaves approximately $365 million in the remaining approval and we continued to be in the market.
With that, I'd like to reaffirm guidance for fiscal year 2011. We expect the renewal portfolio to increase in the back half of the year compared to the first half, and we also expect that this will drive our mix of new business to a more ratable model. We continue to provide guidance for growth rates on a constant currency basis, which we believe best illustrates the operational performance of the company.
Dollar changes for all metrics, except earnings per share, reflect currency fluctuation only. While the constant currency growth rates of both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share have not changed, the dollar ranges provided this afternoon have increased to reflect year-to-date performance, the reduced share count and the currency fluctuation.
As a reminder, it has been our practice to provide guidance based upon exchange rates on the last date of the previous quarter, in this case September 30. And guidance includes a partial hedge of operating income. Guidance is as follows: Total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 3% to 5% in constant currency, this translates to reported revenue of $4.45 billion to $4.55 billion. The range on non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 34% to 35%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to range between 33% and 34%. Both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share on the low and the high end of the range have increased by $0.03. Growth in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 7% to 14% in constant currency, this translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.97. Growth in GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 5% to 13% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.54 to $1.66, and cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 2% to 7% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion to $1.475  billion. This includes approximately $50 million in restructuring cash payments. These payments will reduce cash flow by 3%, and is one of the reasons why our non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow from operations growth differ in fiscal 2011. 
Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisitions. For the full year, we expect approximately 506 million actual shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 508 million shares. This does not include the effect of any future stock repurchases.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill to conclude. Bill?"

I am pleased to announce that CA Technologies had a good second quarter. These results demonstrate that we are making progress. Our strategy to manage and secure physical, virtual and cloud environments is the right strategy. And the changes we made to our organization and our focus on rigorous execution are beginning to pay off. 
Year-over-year, revenue grew 5% in constant currency and was at the high end of our revenue expectations. Non-GAAP operating margin was 35%, reflecting the planned dilution from acquisitions that were closed during fiscal 2010. Even with these investments, non-GAAP EPS was up 10% in constant currency. Cash flow from operations was up 11% in constant currency and have met our expectations. And finally, both current and total revenue backlog grew, a good indicator for me of our future revenue growth.
Let me give you a little insight about our sales performance within the business booked during the quarter. Total new product sales and capacity grew at high-single digits year-over-year. Within this, our distributor products delivered the strongest new sales performance in 10 quarters. Even more satisfying is the breadth of demand across our portfolio. Project and Portfolio Management and Identity and Access Management both grew new sales of products double digits, with Service Assurance tripling year-over-year. It was a record quarter for Security, specifically Identity and Access Management. We were also pleased that we are able to achieve this new sales growth, despite a significant decrease in Mainframe capacity sales. This was due to the nature and mix of our Renewal portfolio in the quarter, which was weighted toward Distributed . Finally, given the lumpy timing of our renewals, I look to our Renewal yield to judge the health of our portfolio. Our Renewal yield this quarter was in the low 90s, consistent with previous quarters.
As we have said over the past few quarters, the Renewal portfolio increases in the second half of fiscal 2011 compared to the first half, and we expect momentum in Mainframe to build as well. This, combined with our strong first half performance, gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year outlook, which we are reaffirming this afternoon. 
At the end of last quarter's earnings call, I highlighted our operational priorities. They continue to be: Increasing the number of freestanding sales with new products; responding to customer demand in growth geographies and emerging enterprises; and continuing to align the organization to be more responsive to customer's needs and emerging trends. I believe these priorities will help us unlock the value of CA Technologies. And while we are not yet done, we did make very good progress against these objectives during the quarter. 
Let me first address freestanding sales. We look at this in terms of how we engage our customers. Are we becoming less dependent on a renewal cycle as a compelling event to sell new products to our customers. Freestanding sales give us the opportunity to increase our share of wallet through both cross-selling to current customers and the addition of new customers. Our success can be seen in our progress in new product sales, and we expanded our footprint in more than 100 new major market accounts this quarter. 
Another proof point is our success with emerging technologies like Virtualization Management, which are driving purchases across the portfolio. For example, the U.S. Army made a significant investment across Project and Portfolio Management, Service Assurance and Virtualization Management and Automation Solutions. Rooms To Go purchased Virtualization Management integrated with infrastructure Management. And customers like Logicalis are already using our Virtualization Management and Automation Technology to deliver one of the first Cisco UCS hybrid hosted and on-site cloud services. 
Our second operational priority is responding to customer demand in growth geographies and emerging enterprises, companies with revenue from $300 million to $2 billion. Nimsoft has accelerated our ability to access both of these markets through new channels, including more than 350 managed service providers. We added 37 new Nimsoft customers this quarter, including Netflix, Thales and SunGard.  In addition, Nimsoft recently announced full support for Vblock monitoring and signed Acadia, the virtual computing environment company formed by Cisco, EMC and VMware. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that we have increased our investment in growth geographies, which for us also include Japan and Australia. And recently, we brought new management talent into several key roles. While we do not expect these investments to have a material impact this fiscal year, we are encouraged by results in countries like Mexico and Japan, which grew significantly during the quarter. And we expanded our footprint in more than 100 emerging market accounts this quarter.
On the third priority: we continue to align the organization to be more responsive to customer needs and emerging trends. Much of this initial heavy lifting was done at the beginning of July when we created Customer Solutions Group or CSG. We are already seeing the CSG organization help to improve our execution and we expect, over time, that it will further enhance our competitive position and our ability to respond to the needs of our customers and changes in the market. It also helps us drive results from both the assets we have developed and acquired.
While we continue to focus on sales of acquired technologies like Nimsoft and NetQoS, we also leveraged acquisitions to further internal development. For example, NetQoS technology is included in our new CA Virtual Assurance product, as well as a new CA Service Assurance suite. Another good example of driving value out of acquisitions is 3Tera. There are now more than 80 companies using CA’s 3Tera AppLogic to run over 400 grids on four continents, either as direct CA Technologies customers or as customers of managed service providers. 
And finally, this quarter we announced three acquisitions, which enhance our ability to help customers manage and secure virtualized and cloud environments. 
First, 4Base, a virtualization and cloud infrastructure consulting firm with experience in more than 300 engagements. 4Base helps customers like Toyota Motor Credit Corporation accelerate their virtualization transformation. Second, Hyperformix, expected to close shortly, is capacity management software for physical, virtual and cloud infrastructures. Hyperformix will help our customers solve a critical Virtualization Management need: capacity planning. And finally, Arcot Systems, which is a leader in providing advanced authentication and fraud prevention solutions.  Today Arcot has approximately 120 million identities already verified using its technology. 
Before I turn the call over to Nancy, I would like to thank our global teams for their execution and hard work in meeting our customers' evolving needs. Nancy?"

To start with, please note that all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. Now to the quarter. Growth in both the current and the total portion of our revenue backlog is a good indicator of our future revenue growth,",1029,"Thank you, Bill. To start with, please note that all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. Now to the quarter. Growth in both the current and the total portion of our revenue backlog is a good indicator of our future revenue growth, and continues to be a reason we remain confident in our full year revenue expectation. 
Total revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $7.8 billion, up 2% both in constant currency and as reported, with the current portion growing 3% on both on a constant currency and as-reported basis.
Contract duration was 3.5 years. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.11 billion and grew 5% in constant currency and 4% as reported. This includes a negative foreign exchange impact of approximately $15 million. 
In constant currency, robust growth in North America, up 8%, was partially offset by international performance where revenue grew 2%. Approximately one-half of our revenue growth in constant currency was organic, while the other half was from acquired technologies.
Subscription and maintenance revenue was $961  million, up 1% in constant currency and down 1% as reported. Revenue from software fees and other was $70 million, up by 150% in both constant currency and as reported. Revenue from professional services was $79 million, up 13% in both constant currency and as reported.
Now I'd like to turn to the remainder of the income statement starting with our non-GAAP results. Operating expenses were $721 million, up 8% on a constant currency basis and 7% as reported. This increase in expenses was primarily driven by acquisitions closed during fiscal year 2010, offset by a one-time $10 million benefit from the sale of an equity interest. 
Operating income before interest and taxes was $389 million, flat over the prior period on a constant currency basis and down 1% as reported. As I mentioned, we had a one-time $10 million benefit from the sale of an equity interest during the quarter. This translated to a one percentage point benefit to both GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins, and a $0.01 benefit to both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS. 
For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 35%, a decrease of two percentage points, reflecting dilution from the previously-mentioned acquisitions. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.49, up 10% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 34%.
Turning to GAAP results. GAAP operating margin was 28%. GAAP operating income was $307 million, down 2% in constant currency and down 9% as reported, while earnings per diluted common share was $0.43, up a 14% in constant currency and up 5% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was 25%. 
Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $130 million, up 11% in constant currency compared to $120 million in the prior-year period. Second quarter cash flow from operations was affected by a year-over-year increase in single-installment payments, which was $124 million in the second quarter, compared to $64 million in the prior-year period. Total billings backlog of $4.7 billion was up 6% in both constant currency and as reported. DSOs were slightly down.
Looking at our balance sheet, CA Technologies ended the quarter with approximately $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.6  billion of total debt, bringing our net cash position to $958 million. 
During the second quarter, we purchased approximately 5 million shares of stock for a total of $96 million. This leaves approximately $365 million in a remaining approval and we continue to be in the market.
With that, I'd like to reaffirm guidance for fiscal year 2011. We expect the Renewal portfolio to increase in the back half of the year compared to the first half, and we also expect that this will drive our mix of new business to a more ratable model. We continue to provide guidance for growth rates on a constant currency basis, which we believe best illustrates the operational performance of the company.
Dollar changes for all metrics, except earnings per share, reflect currency fluctuation only. While the constant currency growth rates of both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share have not changed, the dollar ranges provided this afternoon have increased to reflect year-to-date performance, the reduced share count and the currency fluctuation.
As a reminder, it has been our practice to provide guidance based upon exchange rates on the last date of the previous quarter, in this case September 30. And guidance includes a partial hedge of operating income. Guidance is as follows: total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 3% to 5% in constant currency, this translates to reported revenue of $4.45 billion to $4.55 billion. The range on non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 34% to 35%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to range between 33% and 34%. Both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share on the low and the high end of the range have increased by $0.03. Growth in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 7% to 14% in constant currency.  This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.97. Growth in GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 5% to 13% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.54 to $1.66, and cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 2% to 7% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion to $1.475  billion. This includes approximately $50 million in restructuring cash payments. These payments will reduce cash flow by 3%, and is one of the reasons why our non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow from operations growth differ in fiscal 2011. 
Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisition. For the full year, we expect approximately 506 million actual shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 508 million shares. This does not include the effect of any future stock repurchases.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill to conclude. Bill?"

I am pleased to announce that CA Technologies had a good second quarter. These results demonstrate that we are making progress. Our strategy to manage and secure physical, virtual and cloud environments is the right strategy. And the changes we made to our organization and our focus on rigorous execution are beginning to pay off. 
Year-over-year, revenue grew 5% in constant currency and was at the high end of our revenue expectations. Non-GAAP operating margin was 35%, reflecting the planned dilution from acquisitions that were closed during fiscal 2010. Even with these investments, non-GAAP EPS was up 10% in constant currency. Cash flow from operations was up 11% in constant currency and have met our expectations. And finally, both current and total revenue backlog grew, a good indicator for me of our future revenue growth.
Let me give you a little insight about our sales performance within the business booked during the quarter. Total new product sales and capacity grew at high-single digits year-over-year. Within this, our distributor products delivered the strongest new sales performance in 10 quarters. Even more satisfying is the breadth of demand across our portfolio. Project and Portfolio Management and Identity and Access Management both grew new sales of products double digits, with Service Assurance tripling year-over-year. It was a record quarter for Security, specifically Identity and Access Management. We were also pleased that we are able to achieve this new sales growth, despite a significant decrease in Mainframe capacity sales. This was due to the nature and mix of our Renewal portfolio in the quarter, which was weighted toward Distributed . Finally, given the lumpy timing of our renewals, I look to our Renewal yield to judge the health of our portfolio. Our Renewal yield this quarter was in the low 90s, consistent with previous quarters.
As we have said over the past few quarters, the Renewal portfolio increases in the second half of fiscal 2011 compared to the first half, and we expect momentum in Mainframe to build as well. This, combined with our strong first half performance, gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year outlook, which we are reaffirming this afternoon. 
At the end of last quarter's earnings call, I highlighted our operational priorities. They continue to be: Increasing the number of freestanding sales with new products; responding to customer demand in growth geographies and emerging enterprises; and continuing to align the organization to be more responsive to customer's needs and emerging trends. I believe these priorities will help us unlock the value of CA Technologies. And while we are not yet done, we did make very good progress against these objectives during the quarter. 
Let me first address freestanding sales. We look at this in terms of how we engage our customers. Are we becoming less dependent on a renewal cycle as a compelling event to sell new products to our customers. Freestanding sales give us the opportunity to increase our share of wallet through both cross-selling to current customers and the addition of new customers. Our success can be seen in our progress in new product sales, and we expanded our footprint in more than 100 new major market accounts this quarter. 
Another proof point is our success with emerging technologies like Virtualization Management, which are driving purchases across the portfolio. For example, the U.S. Army made a significant investment across Project and Portfolio Management, Service Assurance and Virtualization Management and Automation Solutions. Rooms To Go purchased Virtualization Management integrated with infrastructure Management. And customers like Logicalis are already using our Virtualization Management and Automation Technology to deliver one of the first Cisco UCS hybrid hosted and on-site cloud services. 
Our second operational priority is responding to customer demand in growth geographies and emerging enterprises, companies with revenue from $300 million to $2 billion. Nimsoft has accelerated our ability to access both of these markets through new channels, including more than 350 managed service providers. We added 37 new Nimsoft customers this quarter, including Netflix, Thales and SunGard.  In addition, Nimsoft recently announced full support for Vblock monitoring and signed Acadia, the virtual computing environment company formed by Cisco, EMC and VMware. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that we have increased our investment in growth geographies, which for us also include Japan and Australia. And recently, we brought new management talent into several key roles. While we do not expect these investments to have a material impact this fiscal year, we are encouraged by results in countries like Mexico and Japan, which grew significantly during the quarter. And we expanded our footprint in more than 100 emerging market accounts this quarter.
On the third priority: we continue to align the organization to be more responsive to customer needs and emerging trends. Much of this initial heavy lifting was done at the beginning of July when we created Customer Solutions Group or CSG. We are already seeing the CSG organization help to improve our execution and we expect, over time, that it will further enhance our competitive position and our ability to respond to the needs of our customers and changes in the market. It also helps us drive results from both the assets we have developed and acquired.
While we continue to focus on sales of acquired technologies like Nimsoft and NetQoS, we also leveraged acquisitions to further internal development. For example, NetQoS technology is included in our new CA Virtual Assurance product, as well as a new CA Service Assurance suite. Another good example of driving value out of acquisitions is 3Tera. There are now more than 80 companies using CA’s 3Tera AppLogic to run over 400 grids on four continents, either as direct CA Technologies customers or as customers of managed service providers. 
And finally, this quarter we announced three acquisitions, which enhance our ability to help customers manage and secure virtualized and cloud environments. 
First, 4Base, a virtualization and cloud infrastructure consulting firm with experience in more than 300 engagements. 4Base helps customers like Toyota Motor Credit Corporation accelerate their virtualization transformation. Second, Hyperformix, expected to close shortly, is capacity management software for physical, virtual and cloud infrastructures. Hyperformix will help our customers solve a critical Virtualization Management need: capacity planning. And finally, Arcot Systems, which is a leader in providing advanced authentication and fraud prevention solutions.  Today Arcot has approximately 120 million identities already verified using its technology. 
Before I turn the call over to Nancy, I would like to thank our global teams for their execution and hard work in meeting our customers' evolving needs. Nancy?"
262913,114222553,81031,"CA Technologies, Q2 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2010",2010-10-21,"Earnings Calls","CA, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bill. To start with, please note that all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. Now to the quarter. Growth in both the current and the total portion of our revenue backlog is a good indicator of our future revenue growth,",1029,"Thank you, Bill. To start with, please note that all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise indicated. Now to the quarter. Growth in both the current and the total portion of our revenue backlog is a good indicator of our future revenue growth, and continues to be a reason we remain confident in our full year revenue expectation. 
Total revenue backlog at the end of the quarter was $7.8 billion, up 2% both in constant currency and as reported, with the current portion growing 3% on both on a constant currency and as-reported basis.
Contract duration was 3.5 years. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.11 billion and grew 5% in constant currency and 4% as reported. This includes a negative foreign exchange impact of approximately $15 million. 
In constant currency, robust growth in North America, up 8%, was partially offset by international performance where revenue grew 2%. Approximately one-half of our revenue growth in constant currency was organic, while the other half was from acquired technologies.
Subscription and maintenance revenue was $961  million, up 1% in constant currency and down 1% as reported. Revenue from software fees and other was $70 million, up by 150% in both constant currency and as reported. Revenue from professional services was $79 million, up 13% in both constant currency and as reported.
Now I'd like to turn to the remainder of the income statement starting with our non-GAAP results. Operating expenses were $721 million, up 8% on a constant currency basis and 7% as reported. This increase in expenses was primarily driven by acquisitions closed during fiscal year 2010, offset by a one-time $10 million benefit from the sale of an equity interest. 
Operating income before interest and taxes was $389 million, flat over the prior period on a constant currency basis and down 1% as reported. As I mentioned, we had a one-time $10 million benefit from the sale of an equity interest during the quarter. This translated to a one percentage point benefit to both GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins, and a $0.01 benefit to both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS. 
For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating margin was 35%, a decrease of two percentage points, reflecting dilution from the previously-mentioned acquisitions. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.49, up 10% in constant currency and 9% as reported. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 34%.
Turning to GAAP results. GAAP operating margin was 28%. GAAP operating income was $307 million, down 2% in constant currency and down 9% as reported, while earnings per diluted common share was $0.43, up a 14% in constant currency and up 5% as reported. Our effective GAAP tax rate for the second quarter was 25%. 
Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $130 million, up 11% in constant currency compared to $120 million in the prior-year period. Second quarter cash flow from operations was affected by a year-over-year increase in single-installment payments, which was $124 million in the second quarter, compared to $64 million in the prior-year period. Total billings backlog of $4.7 billion was up 6% in both constant currency and as reported. DSOs were slightly down.
Looking at our balance sheet, CA Technologies ended the quarter with approximately $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.6  billion of total debt, bringing our net cash position to $958 million. 
During the second quarter, we purchased approximately 5 million shares of stock for a total of $96 million. This leaves approximately $365 million in a remaining approval and we continue to be in the market.
With that, I'd like to reaffirm guidance for fiscal year 2011. We expect the Renewal portfolio to increase in the back half of the year compared to the first half, and we also expect that this will drive our mix of new business to a more ratable model. We continue to provide guidance for growth rates on a constant currency basis, which we believe best illustrates the operational performance of the company.
Dollar changes for all metrics, except earnings per share, reflect currency fluctuation only. While the constant currency growth rates of both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share have not changed, the dollar ranges provided this afternoon have increased to reflect year-to-date performance, the reduced share count and the currency fluctuation.
As a reminder, it has been our practice to provide guidance based upon exchange rates on the last date of the previous quarter, in this case September 30. And guidance includes a partial hedge of operating income. Guidance is as follows: total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 3% to 5% in constant currency, this translates to reported revenue of $4.45 billion to $4.55 billion. The range on non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 34% to 35%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate to range between 33% and 34%. Both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings per share on the low and the high end of the range have increased by $0.03. Growth in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 7% to 14% in constant currency.  This translates to reported non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.97. Growth in GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of 5% to 13% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP diluted earnings per share of $1.54 to $1.66, and cash flow from operations is expected to grow at 2% to 7% in constant currency. This translates to reported cash flow from operations of $1.4 billion to $1.475  billion. This includes approximately $50 million in restructuring cash payments. These payments will reduce cash flow by 3%, and is one of the reasons why our non-GAAP earnings per share and cash flow from operations growth differ in fiscal 2011. 
Guidance does not include the effect of any future material acquisition. For the full year, we expect approximately 506 million actual shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 508 million shares. This does not include the effect of any future stock repurchases.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill to conclude. Bill?"

So as George commented on and as Bill has commented on, we're seeing in second quarter results the customer response to the breadth and overall competitiveness of our portfolios. That's primarily what we're focused on. And then I just wanted to comment on what we're doing inside of our development organization. Ajei is now looking across all our products and businesses, and we're starting to leverage technologies across multiple parts of our portfolio. And I think we're just starting to see the benefit of that, and I'm very encouraged with some of the things we're doing around user interface, leveraging the NetQoS technology, starting to leverage AppLogic or the 3Tera technology. So it's very much part of our execution plan and focus, and I think you're starting to see the benefit of that in second quarter."
