After my announcement this morning, Brian McKeon will review our financial results, followed by Bob Brennan's CEO remarks. When Bob is finished, we will open up the phones for our Q&A. Following today's earnings call, Brian and I will be presenting at the RW Baird Business Solutions Conference here in Boston.
As you may have seen in today's earnings release, we introduced two new metrics, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS as part of our ongoing effort to enhance our investor communications. The year-over-year growth in these metrics is an important measure of our performance. As such, we believe that excluding certain components of these results will be helpful with respect to comparability.
Adjusted OIBDA is operating income before depreciation and amortization, excluding asset gains and losses. This metric more accurately reflects how we plan, forecast and evaluate the performance of our business. Adjusted EPS is reported EPS, excluding asset gains and losses, other income expense, the tax impact of these reconciling items and discrete tax items and net income loss attributable to non-controlling interest. This metric more accurately reflects how we forecast our earnings. Both metrics also facilitate the comparison of our results for the current periods and guidance for future guidance with results for past periods.
Per our custom, we have a user controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website, at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to slide two, today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2010 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide and our current report on Form 8-K filed on March 8, 2009 for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements.
As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments among others are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information in the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release.
With that, I would like to introduce our CFO, Brian McKeon.

We've got a lot to cover today, let's go right to it.Slide three highlights the key messages from today's review. Q4 wrapped up a strong year of financial performance for Iron Mountain as we continued to deliver",3612,"Thanks, Steve and good morning, everyone. We've got a lot to cover today, let's go right to it.
Slide three highlights the key messages from today's review. Q4 wrapped up a strong year of financial performance for Iron Mountain as we continued to deliver strong year-on-year profit and cash flow gains despite economic impacts that are constraining top line growth.
Revenue performance in the quarter was as expected. Storage internal growth was a solid 5% with gains moderated by the impact of constrained new sales and higher destruction we've experienced in recent quarters reflecting recessionary impacts. Service revenues were flat overall as continued pressure on activity levels offset solid gains in areas such as eDiscovery services.
Despite economic impacts, we continue to deliver strong profit and free cash flow performance. This is a result of our focus on operational excellence including productivity initiatives, pricing program improvements, and overhead and capital spending controls. This focus enabled us to drive almost 300 basis points of improvement in our adjusted OIBDA margin this year with solid gains across each of our major business segments.
For the quarter, we delivered adjusted OIBDA growth of 14% on a reported basis and 12% excluding the impacts of foreign currency rate changes. About 2% of this growth is due to the initial re-characterization of vehicle leases discussed in prior conference calls. We also continued to improve our cash flows and strengthen our balance sheet. Free cash flow for 2009 reached and all-time high of $336 million, driven by strong profit performance and controlled capital spending.
Looking ahead to 2010, we are targeting improved revenue growth and strong sustainable underlying operating performance. Today, we are raising our guidance to reflect recent performance, changes to macro factors, and the impact of the Mimosa acquisition.
Today, we also announced that our Board of Directors has approved a $150 million share repurchase authorization and a dividend with an annual rate of $0.25 per share. These actions are a direct result of our strong cash generation performance and reflect our confidence our long-term growth potential and our commitment to delivering long-term shareholder value. I'll talk more about this later in my remarks.
Let's turn now to slide four and begin with our review of fourth quarter results. Slide four compares our results for this quarter to the fourth quarter of 2008. Reported revenues for the quarter were up 4% to $779 million.
From a segment perspective, North American Physical posted 2% internal growth, supported by solid 5% storage internal growth. Storage gains and improved paper prices offset soft service revenues, resulting from lower core service activity levels.
Our International Physical segment reported 4% internal growth, supported by solid 7% growth in storage and core services. These gains were moderated by declines in complementary revenues, due primarily to lower paper revenues and project activity.
In our Digital segment, growth improved to 5% in the fourth quarter, driven by continued strong performance in our eDiscovery business. These gains more than offset storage weakness, resulting from lower subscription sales.
Benefits from operational excellence initiatives drove higher service margins in our North American Physical segment, supporting a 340 basis point improvement in our consolidated gross margin. Higher storage gross margins, aided by improved pricing in North American Physical and solid gains in our International Physical business was also a key contributor to gross margin gains. As a reminder, gross profits for the quarter also benefitted from the $5 million in rent expense, resulting from the re-characterization of certain vehicle leases.
Adjusted OIBDA grew 14% on a reported basis and 12% excluding the impact of FX changes. This improvement was driven by gross profit gains and controlled SG&A growth of 7% as we continue to focus investment on initiatives aimed at driving growth and gross profit improvements. For the quarter, depreciation was $74 million and amortization was $9 million, slightly below our forecast.
Finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter increased 23% to $0.27 per share, reflecting strong operating performance and interest expense that was flat to last year. As a reminder, the reconciliation of adjusted EPS to reported EPS can be found in today's earnings release or at the Investor Relations page of our website.
Let's now take a closer look a tour revenue growth on slide five. Slide five breaks down our overall revenue growth, shows internal growth on major service line, as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange. As noted, our total internal growth for the quarter was 3%. Storage growth though still solid, moderated to 5% as expected. These gains were offset by continued pressures on service revenues.
Storage revenues, which represent more than 56% of total revenues, continue to provide and expanding foundation for overall revenue performance. Storage internal growth for the quarter was supported by solid performance in North America and strong growth in international expansion markets, particularly Continental Europe. As expected, we saw some moderation in storage revenue growth, reflecting impacts from longer sales cycles and continued higher destruction activity.
Core service internal growth was 1%. Gains were constrained by lower service activity levels in the handling and transportation of records and secure shredding services, areas that continue to be impacted by economic conditions.
Complementary service revenue internal growth was minus 1% for the quarter. The decline in complementary service revenues was less than in recent quarters due to continued strong performance in our eDiscovery business and improved recycled paper prices. While recycled paper revenue gains were limited in the quarter due to economic pressures on recycling volumes, this is no longer a negative factor impacting our growth performance.
Foreign exchange increased reported growth by 1% in the quarter as trends in this front improved. We should see moderately positive effects at current exchange rates as we moving forward.
Let's now turn to slide six to review our full year operating performance. Slide six looks at our full year operating performance compared to 2008. Reported revenues exceeded $3 billion, down slightly versus the prior year as unfavorable foreign currency changes reduced reported revenue growth by 4%. These impacts offset positive internal revenue growth gains of 3%. As we'll discuss in our guidance review, we expect to see improvements on both of these fronts in 2010.
For the full year, we achieved a 10% improvement in adjusted OIBDA, which was a 14% gain on a constant dollar basis. As a reminder, gross profit and adjusted OIBDA, each benefitted from a $20 million decrease in rent expense, resulting from the re-characterization of certain vehicle leases.
These results reflected a 300 basis point improvement in both our gross margin and operating OIBDA - and our adjusted OIBDA margin, supported by our focus on operational excellence including sustainable gains from productivity and pricing initiatives. These operating gains and a 4% decrease in interest expense drove a 22% increase in adjusted EPS.
2009 was also a year of improved capital efficiency, which combined with our strong profit performance, drove record free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments of $336 million.
Let's move now to slide seven for a review of the full year from a segment perspective. Slide seven shows key metrics for each of our four segments compared to 2008. As we discussed at Investor Day last October, each of our major business segments plays a distinct role within our integrated strategy.
In north - in the North American Physical segment, we are focused on capitalizing on our core opportunities to drive growth and returns, demonstrating the power of the Iron Mountain model. In the International Physical segment, we are building up the global foundation through a balanced approach, driving growth and higher returns in developed markets, while developing the next generation of file rooms [ph] in expansion markets. In the Digital, we are extending our capabilities in high-growth incremental markets.
We've already discussed our revenue performance for 2009 and I will have more to say on this when we are reviewing our 2010 outlook. A key takeaway from this slide is that despite top line pressure, each of our major business segments is reporting improved operating performance and capital efficiency.
North America, our largest segment, continues to drive higher profits, cash flow, and returns. We continue to drive our optimization agenda, while expanding our business foundations through a targeted growth strategy. Significant growth opportunities exist in the unvended storage and DMS markets for this segment and we are evolving our go-to-market capability and strategy to capture this potential.
Our International segment continues to improve as we develop scale in our expansion markets and drive higher growth and profitability in our larger established markets. Due to the significant year-on-year strengthening of the U.S. dollar against all major currencies in 2009, our reported results were reduced by approximately 16%. As noted, at current rates, FX should be a positive factor moving forward, allowing us to benefit from the momentum and performance for driving in this business.
Finally, our Digital business continues to make progress against its strategic agenda, while delivering solid profitability even in this difficult economic environment. Our eDiscovery business had a very successful year and we are excited to add the Mimosa acquisition to our portfolio.
Let's turn to slide eight for a more detailed look at our capital spending and free cash flow. Slide eight summarizes our capital spending and our free cash flow for the year, performance that drove record results for Iron Mountain. Total capital spending was $321 million for 2009 including $36 million for real estate. This represents a 14% decrease from our 2008 levels, reflecting continued focus on the capital allocation process and lower-than-forecasted real estate spending.
Our capital efficiency continues to improve as capital spending excluding real estate decreased to 9.4% of revenues in 2009 from 10.8% in 2008. We expect to build on this progress in 2010. This reduction in capital spending, combined with our increased profitability, drove free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments to a record $336 million.
Our sustained strong profit and cash flow performance was instrumental in our Board's decision to advance payouts to shareholders. I'll speak more to this in a moment. But first, let's turn to slide nine to review our debt statistics.
Our focus on cash flow improvement is supporting continued strengthening of our balance sheet and liquidity. Our debt portfolio at the end of 2009 remained in a very strong position. Our weighted average interest rate is 7% and were 87% fixed. Maturity is now at 8.1 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014.
Consolidated leverage at the end of the year was 3.3 times, benefitting from our strong operating cash flows and limited acquisition activity over the last two years. The acquisition of Mimosa is expected to increase our leverage ratio by only about 10 basis points.
Our liquidity position has also improved to more than $1.1 billion with $447 million in cash and $700 million in additional borrowing capacity as of year-end. Currently, we have a very strong balance sheet and we are well positioned in terms of our cash and financing capacity and we are making comfortable operating at or below the low end of our target leverage range of 3.5 to 4.5 times in the current environment.
This concludes our review of Q4 2009 results. In summary, revenue performance was as expected. We are driving strong sustainable profit and cash flow performance through our focus on operational excellence and we remain committed to strengthening our business foundation globally while delivering strong financial performance and believe we are well positioned to build on that progress in 2010.
Let's now turn to slide 10 to discuss today's shareholder payout announcement before concluding with our updated 2010 guidance. As Bob will discuss in his remarks today, we announced the advancement of program supporting shareholder payouts as part of our financial approach.
As context, over the last two years, Iron Mountain has generated more than $400 million of free cash flow after $700 million of capital expenditures including real estate. This performance has resulted in a substantial lowering of our leverage ratios as we've expanded our business. We intend to build on this progress and are targeting sustained strong free cash flow and expanding profitability as we move forward.
Our strong cash flow performance, combined with the strong balance sheet, gives us substantial capacity to invest in our growth agenda, including targeted acquisitions, while supporting payouts to shareholders. The shareholder payout approach we are advancing reflects our confidence in our long-term growth outlook and our commitment to delivering value to our shareholders.
The quarterly dividend, which we intend to grow over time, will serve as the foundation for shareholder payouts. Based on the closing price of our stock at February 19th, this represents a 1% dividend yield. The share repurchase program will serve as an additional vehicle for capital deployment. The $150 million authorization represents about 3% of our outstanding common stock based on the closing price on February 19th. All share repurchases are subject to stock price, market conditions, corporate and legal requirements and other factors.
The Board has granted the authority to establish trading plans under SEC rule 10b5-1. This will allow us to repurchase shares in the open market during periods in which the stock trading window is otherwise is closed to the company. The advancement of payouts to shareholders is a significant milestone in the evolution as - of our company and we are excited to announce this today.
Let's now review our 2010 outlook. In terms of our guidance for 2010, there are three key messages you should hear today. The first is that we are targeting improved revenue growth in 2010, supported by 4% to 6% internal revenue gains. While we are planning for continued headwinds from economic factors heading into 2010, we are committed to driving improved growth as we move forward and expect a benefit from more favorable macro factors such as improved - improvements in FX and recycled paper pricing.
We also intend to drive strong adjusted OIBDA growth, supported by a continued progress on our North American productivity initiatives and improved profits in our International business segment. Our objectives in 2010 call for 7% to 12% reported growth in adjusted OIBDA, building on our solid 2009 results. These objectives reflect the solid progress in operational improvements we continue to drive across our business.
Finally, we are adjusting our guidance for the impact of our recently announced acquisition of Mimosa. For 2010, we expect Mimosa to add about $20 million to our annual revenues. This deal will be modestly dilutive to earnings in 2010 due to current operating losses and integration costs. Based on expected synergies and strong revenue growth, however, Mimosa is expected to generate positive adjusted OIBDA beginning in 2011.
Let's review our outlook in more detail, starting with a breakdown of our revenue growth guidance. The table on slide 12 shows our expectations for internal growth and total growth in 2010 including impact from FX and acquisitions. As noted, we are targeting internal growth in the 4% to 6% range. While below our long-term target rates, in the high-single digit internal growth trends seen just before the financial crisis, this outlook reflects an improved growth trajectory that should put us on track for higher growth as the economy recovers.
We continue to expect storage growth to be in the mid-single digits, reflecting current trends and impact from 2009 activity. The storage costs will be more difficult early in 2009, particularly in Q1, given the carryover effect of softer new sales and higher destructions through 2009. These comparisons will improve as we work through the year.
We are planning for continued softness in core service activity levels until we see clearer signs of improvement and expect this revenue growth to be between 1% and 5% in 2010. With respect to our complementary revenues, we are expecting a significant improvement over 2009, which will support our overall internal growth rate of 4% to 6%. The increase in complementary revenue growth is 8% to 15%, is driven by continued strong performance in our eDiscovery business, easier comps, and higher paper prices. These gains are being mitigated as the demand for special projects remain soft.
We also expect the impact of the recent increase in recycled paper prices to be partially offset by volume and activity pressures. Please note that complementary revenues due fluctuate in our business and historically are more vulnerable to general economic conditions, but they also represent a smaller part of our revenue base.
As I mentioned earlier, the Mimosa acquisition should add just under a point to our revenue growth in 2010. Combined with the estimated 1% benefit from the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar, we are projecting reported revenue growth to be in the 6% to 8% range for 2010.
Let's turn to slide 13 for a look at revenue growth across our segments. Slide 13 highlights our expectations for internal growth rates across our three major business segments. For our North American Physical segment, which finished the year with a 3% internal growth rate, we are expecting 2010 internal growth to move up to the 4% to 5% range. This outlook reflects mid-single digit storage revenue growth gains, supported by improved complementary service revenue growth. These gains will be moderated by lower service activity levels and expectations for constrained shredding growth in the current environment.
For our International Physical segment, we are projecting internal growth in the 4% to 6% range. 2009 was a good year in the International segment, supported by solid growth rates in core revenue, partially offset by pressures on our complementary services. We saw a solid revenue performance in our expansion markets and expect this to continue in 2010. For 2010, we are targeting continued solid core revenue growth rates in our International business, building on our momentum in these markets.
Finally, with respect to our Worldwide Digital segment, we are targeting an internal growth rate of flat to 10%. We expect continued solid growth from our expanding eDiscovery business as we - but we will be working through the impacts of recent lower subscription sales in our storage growth. While it’s still too early to call - to plan for a turnaround, we have seen some positive factors with respect to Digital sales and remain confident that we can get this business on track towards strong long-term growth as the economy recovers.
Slide 14 incorporates these projections to our overall guidance for 2010. Slide 14 summarizes our full year 2010 and Q1 outlook. Overall, we are now targeting 6% to 8% growth in reported revenues, including benefits from the Mimosa acquisition and a weaker U.S. dollar.
We are raising our guidance in dollar terms and now expect 2010 revenues of between $3.185 billion to $3.255 billion. With respect to adjusted OIBDA, we are targeting 7% to 12% reported growth or $930 million to $975 million, reflecting continued margin gains and additional benefits from higher paper prices. These gains are partially offset by the dilutive impact of the Mimosa acquisition.
Our capital expenditures of approximately $320 million include $30 million for real estate. The decrease from our preliminary forecast given on Investor Day last October is due primarily to lower expected real estate spending, benefits from our procurement initiative and refined spending plans in the context of the current growth outlook.
In terms of free cash flow, we intend to build on our strong 2009 performance with goals for free cash flow before acquisition and real estate investments of $330 million to $370 million. The year-on-year growth rate for free cash flow is constrained by increase in cash taxes that we expect to be about $110 million in 2010. As you know, we've utilized nearly all of our U.S. federal NOLs and our cash tax rate is now approaching our book tax rate.
For the first quarter, we are projecting revenues of $770 million to $790 million and adjusted OIBDA of $210 million to $220 million. This outlook reflects Q1 internal growth in the 3% to 6% range. As noted earlier, we expect our storage growth comps to be toughest in the first quarter, but these impacts should be offset by favorable comps on factors such as recycled paper revenues.
Turning to slide 15, you can see our expectations for the P&L below the adjusted OIBDA line for the full year 2010. D&A expense is up modestly, reflecting the Mimosa acquisition and interest is flat compared to 2009. We are expecting our structural tax rate to be 40% for 2010. This rate is 2% higher than our 2009 structural rate, due primarily to the exploration of certain tax loss related to R&D credits and foreign income at December 31st, 2009. This 2% increase in our structural rate has a projected $0.04 impact on earnings for the full year. It's possible that this loss would be retroactively reenacted during the year. If that happens, we will adjust our structural tax rate accordingly.
As Steve described earlier, adjusted EPS assumes asset gains and losses, other income expense and non-controlling interest to be zero. This will allow for greater year-on-year comparability. Our adjusted EPS calculation assumes 205 million shares outstanding.
In summary, 2009 was a solid year as strong execution drove record profitability and free cash flow. Our business fundamentals are solid and despite the current economic headwinds, we remain confident in our long-term growth potential and expect to make progress in improving our growth trajectory in 2010. Our balance sheet remains strong and we are very well positioned financially to fund our growth agenda and support shareholder payouts.
Thanks and now, I'll turn the call over to Bob.

30292,98071264,51599,"Iron Mountain Inc., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2010",2010-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Iron Mountain Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Brian and good morning, everyone. As Brian explained, our financial results for the quarter came in as expected. We had a good quarter, we had a good year, and we've done well.Our revenue growth was moderated by the economy and factors we've dis",1549,"Thanks, Brian and good morning, everyone. As Brian explained, our financial results for the quarter came in as expected. We had a good quarter, we had a good year, and we've done well.
Our revenue growth was moderated by the economy and factors we've discussed on previous calls. But despite a tough selling environment, we managed well, applying discipline and focus to operating Iron Mountain with excellence. We advanced our strategic position and I'm very proud of the way the team delivered strong profit and cash flow gains across all segments of the business.
On this call, I want to shed light on the current trends in our business and emphasize some key areas of focus for the year. I also, of course, will provide more detail on two strategic fronts, both announced in just the last two days. First, the advancement of our Digital business through the acquisition of Mimosa and second, our shareholder payout approach. Both are right up the alley of our strategy and I'll share those details in a few minutes.
There are three things I want you to hear today. The first is about growth because while we are working through some economic headwinds, we are targeting an improved growth trajectory in 2010 and remain optimistic about Iron Mountain's growth potential going forward. The second key message I want you to hear is that we remain focused on managing our business with discipline and intent to leverage continued gains from our operational excellence initiatives to drive strong profits and cash flow this year and in the years that follow. The third message is that we are advancing our long-term strategic agenda, demonstrated by our investments in technology services.
So let's go to the top of the agenda. Let's talk about growth and the trends in our business where we experience the most impact. Current growth trends are what we expected. You've heard me tell you on the recent calls that we anticipated pressure from the economy on our near-term growth rate. The economy took us from high-single digit growth to where we are now. You can see from our forecast that we expect improvements in our growth rate, but not a turnaround in 2010. As the economy improves, revenue should improve.
In the meantime, we are aggressively getting after revenue growth with the same focus and discipline we applied to expanding margins in the last few years and I'm optimistic about our growth potential. A few things. First, there are positive factors on the growth front. Next, we are taking the right proactive steps to get after revenue. And third, we continue to expand our capability on a permanent basis. Let me cover all three.
First, the positive factors on the growth front. Our international expansion markets have been posting solid gains. We see signs of improvement in technology sales. Now, it's still tough, but it's improving. And our DMS pipeline is growing. And although the sales cycle for DMS is a long sales cycle, this clear customer interest, which reinforces the fact that this is a big growth area where we have a unique value proposition.
In addition to these positive factors, we are applying aggressive tactics to get after revenue now. We are not sitting back waiting for the economy to improve. The team that brought the operational excellence and the margin expansion that came with it, they are running well, we are pivoting our leadership into the - on to pursuit of our biggest revenue opportunities.
We continue to get better at selling by aligning our sales force with key vertical segments to capture more opportunity within our existing accounts and we are supporting sales with targeted programs such as teaming with our real estate partners to get after net new business through that channel and others. These positive factors and proactive steps support my confidence in an improved growth outlook for 2010 and beyond.
As we move forward, we'll also continue to improve our capabilities in areas that will drive strong long-term growth in our business. These include capturing large unvented opportunity in our core Physical business; growing new services, particularly DMS and Digital; and continuing international expansion in growth markets like Continental Europe, Latin America, and Asia. These areas of focus position us well for a return to our target growth rates as the economy improves.
We are confident that we can improve our capability to sell in market just like we have improved our capability to operate the business in the last few years. So the first message is one of an improved growth trajectory. It's our top priority and we are getting after growth in an aggressive way.
The second message that I want to reinforce today is one of operational excellence. As we advance our growth strategy, we will leverage the benefits of our operational excellence initiatives to drive continued strong financial performance. In 2009, despite revenue pressures, we achieved 14% growth in adjusted OIBDA on a constant currency basis with record capital efficiency and free cash flow. The team did a great job.
Our goals for strong profit gains and cash generation in 2010 reflect that these gains are driven by sustainable initiatives and enhanced organizationally capability. I want to know we have substantial room to drive continued improvement.
It's indicated in our operational priorities this year, which include the continued rollout of existing initiatives such as our transportation improvement and record center optimization programs to new markets; the expansion of our operational initiatives on a global basis, supported by a global - supported by a strengthened global support structure that we've put in place; and the rollout of new initiatives such as global procurement, which is supporting gains in areas like capital efficiency and operational uniformity further down into our business.
This focus gives us the ability to invest against the initiatives, while we deliver strong financial results. So the first message is to reinforce our bias for growth, the second message is operational excellence bring sustainable benefits. Now, I want to talk to you about major advances to our strategy that we've been signaling for some time.
As you know, our growth strategy is to focus on organic development of the core Physical business, complemented by the expansion of services, tied to the rapid growth of digital and hybrid records, all in the context of delivering strong financial results. The strategy has been on track for years and our conviction only grows as we extend our leadership in the market, as evidenced by this week's acquisition of Mimosa.
We are really excited to have Mimosa - the Mimosa team join the Iron Mountain family. They are a great company, they complement our growth strategy and they fit well into our overall approach to M&A. Mimosa is a leader in enterprise-class content archiving. They have more than 1,000 customers and they are recognized by industry analysts as the fast-growing visionary archival solution. This solution complements our growth strategy. Their product works at the customer's site to provide storage of and access to e-mail and share point files.
With Mimosa, Iron Mountain can now manage enterprise information wherever it resides, with the customer at their site or in our cloud. Mimosa is a great example of the type of acquisition that fits well in our growth strategy. The last major acquisition was Stratify in late 2007 and Mimosa is a technology acquisition similar to Stratify, Connected, and LiveVault in the following regard. They are leader in their segment, highly complementary to our existing business, they are moderately sized, meaning that we can integrate them well and it represents next-generation technology, giving us the ability to leapfrog in the marketplace.
We continue to be very thoughtful as we add businesses to our portfolio, complementing our internal development efforts and our partnership initiatives. So that's Mimosa and I would like to welcome Ravi and his team to Iron Mountain.
This morning, we also announced that our Board approved a new program to being returning capital to shareholders, comprised of $150 million share repurchase program and Iron Mountain's first ever dividend. These programs underscore the power of our business model and the confidence we have going forward in our growth agenda.
Our profitability and cash generation has improved at an impressive rate. Strong cash flow gives us a strong balance sheet and we have the financial flexibility to initiate periodic share repurchases and pay quarterly dividends while continuing to invest in our growth agenda and pursue strategic acquisitions like Mimosa. We are here to drive strong growth over time. These actions by our Board demonstrate our confidence in the long-term growth prospects of the company and our commitment to delivering long-term value to our shareholders.
So let me sum up. We are focused on strengthening our growth trajectory as a business. It's reflected in our goals for 2010 and the substantial long-term growth opportunity for our business. We intend to build on our increasing profitability and cash flows, leveraging sustainable gains in operational excellence as we go. And we are here to constantly advance our strategy as an information management services leader, positioning Iron Mountain for short, medium, and long-term success.

I'm sure Bob can add. The - we are in a similar place to where we were a few months ago in terms of our outlook and the trends, the improvement in the internal growth rate and some of that's driven by the favorable changes we've seen in factors like recycled paper pricing gives us more confidence at the low end of the outlook, but we are in a similar kind of growth range to where we were a few months ago.
The destructions have, I would say, stabilized, but remained at relatively higher levels than historically. So some of those carryover impacts that we saw from the growth in destructions here during 2009 will put a little more pressure on the growth rate early in the year, but we think we will be looking at some better comparisons as we work through the year on storage.
  New sales, it takes awhile for any changes in our sales to work through our business and has continued to be a challenging selling environment, but as Bob noted and I'm sure he can add more to this, we are getting after that aggressively and hopefully, we can improve on that front going forward. So I would say the - in the immediate term, the - those trends are similar, we do think we can do some things to influence that positively as we move forward and obviously, if the economy improves, that will be a big help as well.
The activity piece, David, is I would say is really less related to the - there is some impact on storage than it tends to have impact on our service revenues, but the economy continues to be soft and we factor that all in, we think we can still deliver solid growth and relatively improved performance and position ourselves well for when those economic factors improve.

And the thing I would highlight to you is just the capability that we've built in places like our North American organization. I mean, last year, we clearly had a big change in our growth outlook versus what we had expected given the economy and I think we demonstrated an ability to adapt quickly and adjust our cost structure to fit the new growth environment and deliver our profit objectives and so I think we have excellent capability to adapt our cost structure to changes in the growth outlook and we feel very confident in ability our - our ability to deliver our profit objectives because of that.

So there is a benefit to that.
I would say, however, though our outlook for 2010, if you take out real estate, our capital spending as a percentage of revenues will be about 9% thereabouts. That's consistent with our five-year goal. We may have some variation in this year-to-year, but we are building the capability we think to sustain our capital spending at those levels. So we don't think this is one-time and think we can sustain lower spending as a percentage of sales. That's our intent and hopefully we can continue to demonstrate through that through our good management and good performance.

Just want to highlight a couple of things on recycled paper. Keep in mind, we did see some - when we gave the guidance, we had seen some improvement on paper pricing, it's obviously improved since then. The - it is - part of the reason that paper pricing is up is because recycled paper volumes are down.
So there are some offsets to the revenue gains that we've seen just given - it’s a supply-demand imbalance, because recycled paper volumes are down, it is a key factor driving this, so there will be some offsets from the volumes being down. We do expect some pressure on service pricing that goes along with higher paper pricing competitively. Net-net, it is a positive factor, but it's - it's about 2 percentage points of a favorable benefit on the growth rate from where we were before.
Keep in mind, on the OIBDA guidance, we did have an offset with Mimosa. There is some dilutive effect next year. So that was moving the other direction. But to your point, we did raise it about $35 million and raised the growth rate about 1%. So we feel positive about that development.

We posted solid results for the first quarter of 2010. Revenue growth of 7% was in line with expectations. Storage internal growth was solid at 4%. Service internal growth was 5% as strength in complementary service revenues, including benefits from higher paper prices, offset continued softness in core services. As we work to strengthen our revenue growth, we continue to drive strong profit and free cash flow performance. 
For the quarter, we delivered adjusted OIBDA growth of 11% driven by gross margin expansion of nearly 200 basis points. This expansion continues to be supported by productivity and pricing gains. Profit gains and capital efficiencies drove year-to-date free cash flow of $54 million. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.23 per share, an increase of 19% compared to the same period last year. Our reported EPS was $0.12 per share, including the impacts of the higher effective tax rate and the change in fiscal year end for Iron Mountain Europe from October 31 to December 31. I'll discuss these items more fully later on my remarks. 
Overall, Q1 was a solid start to the year, and we're on track towards delivering strong full year financial performance, consistent with the goals shared on our Q4 earnings call. We are refining our guidance today to include the expected impacts of the recent earthquakes on our Chilean business, including items such as insurance deductibles and remediation costs. 
Let's now turn to Slide 4 and begin our review of the first quarter results. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the first quarter of 2009. As I mention, revenues for the quarter were up 7% to $777 million. From a segment perspective, North American Physical posted 4% internal growth supported by a 4% storage internal growth and strong complementary service revenue performance. Overall gains were constrained by a continued pressures on core service activity levels, including the impacts from an unusually severe winter weather in several major markets. 
Our International Physical segment reported 6% internal growth supported by solid 8% growth in core revenues. These gains were moderated by declines in complementary revenues due primarily to lower project activity.
In our Digital segment, reported revenue growth was 3% for the first quarter including benefits from the Mimosa acquisition we completed at the end of February. Internal growth for this segment was minus 1% as eDiscovery gains were offset by impacts from lower subscription sales in recent quarters. 
Sustainable benefits from productivity initiatives and pricing gains, particularly in our North American Physical segment, drove higher service gross margins supporting a 190 basis points improvement in our consolidated gross margin. Higher storage gross margins, aided by improved pricing in North American Physical and gains in our International Physical business, were also key contributor to gross margin improvement.
Adjusted OIBDA grew 11% driven by strong gross profit gains. Below the adjusted OIBDA line, depreciation was $76 million and amortization was $9 million, in line with our forecast. Other expense for the quarter was $9 million, including $5 million of charges related to foreign currency rate changes and a $4 million one-time charge related to the change in Iron Mountain Europe's fiscal year from October 31 to December 31. This charge represents the net impact of this change for the two years ended December 31, 2009. There were no other effects from this change in our P&L.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.23 per share, an increase of 19% compared to the prior year reflecting strong operating performance and flat year-on-year interest expense. Reported EPS for the first quarter was $0.12 per share. The reported earnings were impacted by a higher effective tax rate reflecting the impact of discreet items, which more than offset higher pretax income. The structural tax rate for the first quarter was 39% as the impact of expired cash legislation was less than originally expected. The impact of discrete tax items primarily relates to foreign currency rate changes in the quarter added 23 points to the effective tax rate. We expect the structural tax rate for 2010 to be 39%. 
Let's now take up closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line, as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange. As noted, our total internal growth for the quarter was 4%. Storage internal growth was solid at 4%, while complementary service revenues rebounded from a difficult 2009 to post 17% internal growth in Q1. These gains were offset by continued pressures on core service activity levels. Storage revenues, which represent more than 56% of total revenues continue to provide an expanding foundation for overall revenue performance. 
Storage revenue internal growth was 4%, with gains moderated by economic effects, which have constrained storage volume growth in recent quarters. Our service internal growth was flat for the first quarter. Growth rates were limited by lower activity levels, which remain pressured by economic conditions. We're planning for continued softness in core service activity given recent trends, as well as the select impacts from service reductions related to the Chilean earthquakes.
Overall, service revenues grew 5% reflecting strong growth in complementary service revenues supported by recent gains in recycled paper pricing. 
While paper price levels remain well above 2009 levels, they recently retreated about 15% from February, March levels, which were less than future gains. Foreign exchange increase reported revenue growth by 3% in the quarter reflecting the year-over-year weakening of the U.S. dollar. That current exchange rates' positive effects from foreign currency will moderate as we move forward.  
The Mimosa acquisition had minimal impact in our revenue growth in Q1 due to the timing of the close. Looking ahead, Mimosa should add just under 1% to our reported revenue growth each quarter. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our performance on a segment basis. Slide 6 shows key metrics for each of our core segments compared to Q1 of 2009. As a reminder, we have distinct goals and roles for our business segments within our integrated strategy. The North American Physical segment is the key financial driver of the business. We're capitalizing on our core opportunities to expand its high return foundation. 
In the International Physical segment, we're expanding our capabilities globally through a balanced approach focused on driving strong growth and improved returns. And in our Digital segment, we're investing to drive accelerated growth in attractive incremental markets. As shown in the slide, our Physical businesses continued to deliver strong operating performance. 
North America, our largest segment, continues to drive strong profits and cash flow. We're advancing our optimization agenda, while expanding our foundation through a targeted growth strategy. We have several programs aimed at driving improved revenue growth, and our field leadership is focused on supporting this effort with the same rigor they use to drive operational excellence.
Our International segment is performing well with solid revenue growth and improved profitability. We're beginning to leverage the success we had with operational excellence in North America and our larger more-developed international markets. Changes in the year-on-year exchange rates increased our reported results in this segment by approximately 8%. Please note that CapEx, which was 14% of segment revenues in Q1, includes about $11 million incurred by Iron Mountain Europe in November and December of 2009. 
In our Digital segment, we're working through some of the effects of softer subscription revenues in recent quarters and growth, while investing to advance our long-term strategic agenda. The integration of Mimosa is progressing well, and we'll enhance our service offering in support of this accelerated digital growth. 
Let's turn to Slide 7 for a more detailed look at our capital spending and free cash flow. Slide 7 summarizes our capital spending and our free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. Total capital spending was $57 million for Q1, including $3 million for real estate. As I just mentioned, included in the total is $11 million of CapEx that was incurred by Iron Mountain Europe during November and December of 2009. 
Traditionally, the first quarter is a light CapEx quarter as some of our projects was scheduled for later in the year, and many required time to plan and source before the significant expenditures are eventually made. We remained focused on aggressively driving efficiencies in our capital spending, while supporting key growth initiatives and projects that help drive long-term return improvement. 
For Q1, the free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate was $54 million. The year-on-year decrease in free cash flow was a result of higher capital spending in 2009 compared to 2010. This is due primarily to a large accrued balance at December 31, 2009 and the inclusion of the additional two months of CapEx from Europe.
For 2010, we expect free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate to be approximately $340 million to $370 million, reflecting continued benefits from our efforts to improve profitability and capital efficiency.
As we announced in our Q4 earnings call in February, our Board approved a 150 million share repurchase program. In the first quarter, we acquired 410,000 shares for approximately $11 million. This leaves us a balance of $139 million for additional share repurchases under the existing plan. 
Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a review of our key debt statistics. Our strong performance supports the continued strengthening of our balance sheet. Our debt portfolio at March 31, 2010, remained in a very strong position. Our weighted average interest rate at 6.9% and were 87% fixed. Maturity is just under eight years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. Consolidated leverage remained at 3.4x, benefiting from our strong operating cash flows while reflecting the $112 million we paid for the acquisition of Mimosa. 
Our liquidity position remains strong at more than $1 billion with $325 million in cash and $743 million in additional borrowing capacity as of quarter end. Currently, we have a very strong balance sheet, and we're well positioned in terms of the cash and financing capacity.
This concludes our review of Q1 2010 results. In summary, revenue performance was in line with expectations, we're driving continued strong profit and cash flow performance through sustainable productivity and pricing gains and we remain committed to strengthening our business foundation globally, while delivering strong financial performance. And we're on track towards these goals in 2010. 
Let's now turn to Slide 9 to review our outlook for Q2 and the full year. Slide 9 summarizes our full year 2010 and Q2 guidance. Let me begin with the discussion of our outlook for next quarter. 
For Q2, we're projecting revenue of $785 million to $805 million. This reflects a 5% to 8% reported growth rate, including an estimated 2% to 3% benefit from foreign exchange. While we are planning for continued solid storage growth, our outlook incorporates expectations for lower service revenue growth in Q2. We expect continued near-term pressure on core service activity, and we'll be facing some difficult comparisons as we lap a large one-time license sale on Digital and a large project in Europe. These factors will likely limit service revenue gains overall in Q2, and constrain the overall internal growth to the 2% to 4% range. Growth rates in the second half are expected to improve as the comparisons ease.
We're protecting Q2 adjusted OIBDA of $218 million to $228 million, reflecting expectations for sustained strong adjusted OIBDA margins. For the full year, we're reinforcing the solid fundamental outlook we discussed in our last conference call. We have reduced the dollar ranges of revenue by $5 million and adjusted OIBDA by $5 million to $10 million to reflect the impacts of the Chilean earthquakes in our full year results.  
As a result of the Chilean earthquakes, we experienced some damage in all of our facilities in the region. None of our facility were destroyed by fire or impacted by water damage. However, the structural integrity of 5 buildings was compromised and wrecking including certain buildings was damaged or destroyed. 
The adjustments we're making to our full year guidance reflect our expectations for loss, revenues and profits as the business works to return to normal, as well as the additional insurance and remediation costs associated with those efforts. For the enterprise, our full year outlook for reported revenue growth remains in the range of 6% to 8% supported by internal growth of 4% to 6%. 
Our revenue outlook reflects the expectations for solid storage growth this year consistent with prior guidance. We are targeting improved growth overall in the business in the second half of 2010, following some tougher comparisons in Q1 and Q2. We would note that performance at the high end of the revenue range will require improvement in current trends for service revenues in the second half of this year. 
Our profit outlook remains strong with the expectations for 7% to 11% growth in adjusted OIBDA and strong gains in adjusted EPS. As noted, we're lowering our expected capital expenditures for the year to approximately $290 million, reflecting refine capital plans and lower expectations for real estate spending. Included in our capital expenditures of approximately $290 million is about $29 million for real estate. In addition, we're adjusting our free cash flow outlook to $340 million to $370 million, reflecting our revised outlook for CapEx and adjusted OIBDA and moderately higher cash taxes. 
In April, we received the $10 million cash advance on our insurance claims related to the Chilean earthquakes that will be reflected in our Q2 free cash flow. Although we do expect to receive additional insurance proceeds in the future, we're not including any in our cash flow forecast at this time as the size and timing of these receipts is uncertain. We haven't included estimates for potential incremental 2010 capital spending related to Chile as well, as we're still evaluating facility, planning and timing of remediation. Thanks, and I would now like to turn the call over to Bob."

As Brian noted, our quarterly financial results came in as expected. Our internal revenue growth improved somewhat despite difficult comparisons and continued pressures from the economy on service revenues. We continue to deliver strong profit growth and cash flow. Overall, Q1 was a solid start for the year and we're on track towards delivering strong financial performance this year. 
Key messages that you should hear on today's update. First, our financial performance remains strong. This performance reflect the strength of our business model and the gains that we continue to drive to our focus on operational excellence across our business.
We're working on improving our growth trajectory, driving aggressively against new business with positive early results. This emphasis will help offset continued pressures on service activity and the impact from select factors such as the earthquake in Chile. 
Third, we're making good progress against our strategic priorities, including driving growth and improved returns in our International business, expanding our technology services offering and continuing to strengthen our organization.
Let me start by providing an update on our growth agenda. We're making progress on the growth front despite some continued headwinds in the business. Our quarterly growth performance was in line with the expectations. Storage growth, a key financial driver for Iron Mountain, was solid at 4%. As expected, we saw some moderation in storage growth in Q1 reflecting impacts from lower new sales levels and higher destructions during 2009. Destructions have stabilized, we're working on driving new sales, and believe we're on track towards achieving our full year objectives to storage revenues. 
Overall, internal growth was also 4% as benefits from factors like higher paper pricing offset continued pressures on core service activity. Service activity softens substantially during the economic downturn, and we continue to see lower transportation and shredding service levels, which are offsetting gains we are realizing in areas like DMS.
We are focused on strengthening our growth trajectory as we work through the year on factors that are in our control. In this context, we have concentrated efforts within our organization on capturing the large unmended opportunities we see in our business. We have a number of programs targeting and driving improved growth and extended our field leadership on supporting this effort with the same rigor that they used to drive operational excellence. 
We're of course, also working on improving our growth rate in Digital. We've added new services like eVantage to address evolving customer requirements. For eDiscovery services, we've added Classify & Collect that allows our PC backup customers to easily identify data, which is subject to legal hold and we've expanded the storage capacity in our server backup offering, all of which will help strengthen our recurring storage pipeline and overall revenue.
While it's still very early, we're making progress on the new sales front. We've landed new business opportunities in the data protection space, improved our competitiveness and strength, and our field organization is driving increased pipeline activity in records management. 
In digital, we're strengthening our subscription sales pipeline, which will drive benefits in terms of recurring revenue gains. We've got work to do, but we feel positive about this early progress towards improving our new sales performance.
As we focus on improving growth trends in the near term, we're also advancing on our long-term strategic agenda. As seen in our quarterly results, we continue to drive strong operating performance in our core North American operations. The business is running well. And a key area of Iron Mountain involves extending this operating capability to drive growth and improve returns in our international operations. As we have noted, this is an area where we are driving improved momentum and one that will be a key factor supporting strong financial performance in 2010 and beyond.
We're on track for strong performance in our International business this year, and we've begun deploying the North American label [ph] for operational excellence in our more developed international markets, such as the UK and Australia. Productivity gains in these markets will enable continued investment against global expansion, while driving strong profit gains. We're pleased with the capability and progress we're advancing on this front, and see this as an area where we can continue to build upon for the long term. We're emphasizing the expansion of technology service as a key driver of our long-term strategy as well. 
As noted on our year-end call, we recently completed the acquisition of Mimosa Systems. Mimosa provides enterprise-class, on-premise archiving services so organizations can better benefit from business continuity, compliance and litigation readiness. Mimosa deploys next generation technology and compliments our existing suite of digital products.  With Mimosa, Iron Mountain now has the ability to store enterprise information wherever it resides, whether it's at the customer location or ours, offering them increased choice and flexibility for managing their information. The integration of Mimosa is going well and Mimosa's CEO, T.M. Ravi,has agreed to become the Head of Marketing for our Digital business.
This expansion of our technology services offerings helps to strengthen our Digital business, and also helps to strengthen our value proposition across all our service lines. See, our customers records and information management challenges are not neatly arranged into files by format. They're struggling to manage the risks and costs associated with information growth across all formats, and are looking to solution providers with a broad range of expertise and capability for much needed help. 
Iron Mountain is uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity because we work across all formats and have more experience in managing records. The development of our technology services portfolio is positioning us well to deliver long-term growth across our business. We're on the right track strategically, as we remain focused on solving our customers' biggest information management challenges.
Expanding our talent base is another key statistic theme for our business. This is a focus that exists for us from our frontline operations to the Board of Directors. And in March, we welcomed Al Verrecchia, Chairman of Hasbro to our Board of Directors. Al led a highly successful transformation of Hasbro, and we'll certainly benefit from his executive leadership on our Board. Overall, we're making good progress against our strategic agenda.
Now before I conclude my remarks, Brian have mentioned the financial impact of the Chilean earthquake. Chile has been always been a great business for Iron Mountain, and their response to this disaster has only been further distinguished their greatness. All 850 of our employees are safe. We've coordinated a worldwide effort around Iron Mountain to help them, help our customers, and those round-the-clock efforts have also included providing local humanitarian aid. We're very proud of their performance. 
But before I take your questions, let me summarize. We had a solid quarter that was in line with our expectations. We're on track towards delivering strong financial performance this year. We were concentrating our efforts around an improved growth trajectory, while advancing our long-term strategic priorities to capture the potential we see for our business. 
Thanks, and now we'll open the phone lines and take your questions."

And as an enterprise, we have other areas to help us drive margin improvement. Most notably, we think there's a significant opportunity in the International business. As you know, the margins there relative to our North American Physical business are currently quite a bit lower. Some of that's in the stage of development of that business and the investments we're making in expansion markets, but that also represents a significant opportunity for us and also our Digital business as that could gains in [ph] scale. So we have a number of things that we believe can help us sustain strong profit performance ahead of revenue growth as we move forward."

As a reminder, on our last earnings call we introduced two new metrics, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS as part of our ongoing efforts to enhance our investor communications. We use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments, among others, our metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website, as well as in today's press release. With that, I would like to introduce our CFO, Brian McKeon."

We posted solid results on the first quarter of 2010. Revenue growth of 7% was in line with expectations. Storage internal growth was solid at 4%. Service internal growth was 5% as strength in complementary service revenues, including benefits from higher paper prices, offset continued softness in core services. As we work to strengthen our revenue growth, we continue to drive strong profit and free cash flow performance. 
For the quarter, we delivered adjusted OIBDA growth of 11% driven by gross margin expansion of nearly 200 basis points. This expansion continues to be supported by productivity and pricing gains. Profit gains and capital efficiencies drove year-to-date free cash flow of $54 million. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.23 per share, an increase of 19% compared to the same period last year. Our reported EPS was $0.12 per share, including the impacts of the higher effective tax rate and the change in fiscal year end for Iron Mountain Europe from October 31 to December 31. I'll discuss these items more fully later on my remarks. 
Overall, Q1 was a solid start to the year, and we're on track towards delivering strong full year financial performance, consistent with the goals shared on our Q4 earnings call. We are refining our guidance today to include the expected impacts of the recent earthquakes on our Chilean business, including items such as insurance deductibles and remediation costs. 
Let's now turn to Slide 4 and begin our review of the first quarter results. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the first quarter of 2009. As I mentioned, revenues for the quarter were up 7% to $777 million. From a segment perspective, North American Physical posted 4% internal growth supported by 4% storage internal growth and strong complementary service revenue performance. Overall gains were constrained by continued pressures on core service activity levels, including impacts from unusually severe winter weather in several major markets. 
Our International Physical segment reported 6% internal growth supported by solid 8% growth in core revenues. These gains were moderated by declines in complementary revenues due primarily to lower project activity.
In our Digital segment, reported revenue growth was 3% for the first quarter including benefits from the Mimosa acquisition we completed at the end of February. Internal growth for this segment was minus 1% as eDiscovery gains were offset by impacts from lower subscription sales in recent quarters. 
Sustainable benefits from productivity initiatives and pricing gains, particularly in our North American Physical segment, drove higher service gross margins supporting a 190 basis points improvement in our consolidated gross margin. Higher storage gross margins, aided by improved pricing in North American Physical and gains in our International Physical business, were also key contributor to gross margin improvement.
Adjusted OIBDA grew 11% driven by strong gross profit gains. Below the adjusted OIBDA line, depreciation was $76 million and amortization was $9 million, in line with our forecast. Other expense for the quarter was $9 million, including $5 million of charges related to foreign currency rate changes and a $4 million one-time charge related to the change in Iron Mountain Europe's fiscal year from October 31 to December 31. This charge represents the net impact of this change for the two years ended December 31, 2009. There were no other effects from this change in our P&L.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.23 per share, an increase of 19% compared to the prior year reflecting strong operating performance and flat year-on-year interest expense. Reported EPS for the first quarter was $0.12 per share. The reported earnings were impacted by a higher effective tax rate reflecting the impact of discreet items, which more than offset higher pretax income. The structural tax rate for the first quarter was 39% as the impact of expired cash legislation was less than originally expected. The impact of discrete tax items primarily related to foreign currency rate changes in the quarter added 23 points to the effective tax rate. We expect the structural tax rate for 2010 to be 39%. 
Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line, as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange. As noted, our total internal growth for the quarter was 4%. Storage internal growth was solid at 4%, while complementary service revenues rebounded from a difficult 2009 to post 17% internal growth in Q1. These gains were offset by continued pressures on core service activity levels. Storage revenues, which represent more than 56% of total revenues continue to provide an expanding foundation for overall revenue performance. 
Storage revenue internal growth was 4%, with gains moderated by economic effects, which have constrained storage volume growth in recent quarters. Our service internal growth was flat for the first quarter. Growth rates were limited by lower activity levels, which remain pressured by economic conditions. We're planning for continued softness in core service activity given recent trends, as well as the select impacts from service reductions related to the Chilean earthquakes.
Overall, service revenues grew 5% reflecting strong growth in complementary service revenues supported by recent gains in recycled paper pricing. 
While paper price levels remain well above 2009 levels, they recently retreated about 15% from February, March levels, which were less than future gains. Foreign exchange increase reported revenue growth by 3% in the quarter reflecting the year-over-year weakening of the U.S. dollar. That current exchange rates' positive effects from foreign currency will moderate as we move forward.  
The Mimosa acquisition had minimal impact in our revenue growth in Q1 due to the timing of the close. Looking ahead, Mimosa should add just under 1% to our reported revenue growth each quarter. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our performance on a segment basis. Slide 6 shows key metrics for each of our core segments compared to Q1 of 2009. As a reminder, we have distinct goals and roles for our business segments within our integrated strategy. The North American Physical segment is the key financial driver of the business. We're capitalizing on our core opportunities to expand its high return foundation. 
In the International Physical segment, we're expanding our capabilities globally through a balanced approach focused on driving strong growth and improved returns. And in our Digital segment, we're investing to drive accelerated growth in attractive incremental markets. As shown in the slide, our Physical businesses continued to deliver strong operating performance. 
North America, our largest segment, continues to drive strong profits and cash flow. We're advancing our optimization agenda, while expanding our foundation through a targeted growth strategy. We have several programs aimed at driving improved revenue growth, and our field leadership is focused on supporting this effort with the same rigor they use to drive operational excellence.
Our International segment is performing well with solid revenue growth and improved profitability. We're beginning to leverage the success we had with operational excellence in North America and our larger more-developed international markets. Changes in the year-on-year exchange rates increased our reported results in this segment by approximately 8%. Please note that CapEx, which was 14% of segment revenues in Q1, includes about $11 million incurred by Iron Mountain Europe in November and December of 2009. 
In our Digital segment, we're working through some of the effects of softer subscription revenues in recent quarters and growth, while investing to advance our long-term strategic agenda. The integration of Mimosa is progressing well, and we'll enhance our service offering in support of accelerated digital growth. 
Let's turn to Slide 7 for a more detailed look at our capital spending and free cash flow. Slide 7 summarizes our capital spending and our free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. Total capital spending was $57 million for Q1, including $3 million for real estate. As I just mentioned, included in the total is $11 million of CapEx that was incurred by Iron Mountain Europe during November and December of 2009. 
Traditionally, the first quarter is a light CapEx quarter as some of our projects was scheduled for later in the year, and many required time to plan and source before the significant expenditures are eventually made. We remained focused on aggressively driving efficiencies in our capital spending, while supporting key growth initiatives and projects that help drive long-term return improvement. 
For Q1, the free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate was $54 million. The year-on-year decrease in free cash flow was a result of higher capital spending in 2009 compared to 2010. This is due primarily to a large accrued balance at December 31, 2009 and the inclusion of the additional two months of CapEx from Europe.
For 2010, we expect free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate to be approximately $340 million to $370 million, reflecting continued benefits from our efforts to improve profitability and capital efficiency.
As we announced in our Q4 earnings call in February, our Board approved a $150 million share repurchase program. In the first quarter, we acquired 410,000 shares for approximately $11 million. This leaves us a balance of $139 million for additional share repurchases under the existing plan. 
Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a review of our key debt statistics. Our strong performance supports the continued strengthening of our balance sheet. Our debt portfolio at March 31, 2010, remained in a very strong position. Our weighted average interest rate at 6.9% and were 87% fixed. Maturity is just under eight years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. Consolidated leverage remained at 3.4x, benefiting from our strong operating cash flows while reflecting the $112 million we paid for the acquisition of Mimosa. 
Our liquidity position remains strong at more than $1 billion with $325 million in cash and $743 million in additional borrowing capacity as of quarter end. Currently, we have a very strong balance sheet, and we're well positioned in terms of the cash and financing capacity.
This concludes our review of Q1 2010 results. In summary, revenue performance was in line with expectations, we're driving continued strong profit and cash flow performance through sustainable productivity and pricing gains and we remain committed to strengthening our business foundation globally, while delivering strong financial performance. And we're on track towards these goals in 2010. 
Let's now turn to Slide 9 to review our outlook for Q2 and the full year. Slide 9 summarizes our full year 2010 and Q2 guidance. Let me begin with the discussion of our outlook for next quarter. 
For Q2, we're projecting revenue of $785 million to $805 million. This reflects a 5% to 8% reported growth rate, including an estimated 2% to 3% benefit from foreign exchange. While we are planning for continued solid storage growth, our outlook incorporates expectations for lower service revenue growth in Q2. We expect continued near-term pressure on core service activity, and we'll be facing some difficult comparisons as we lap a large one-time license sale on Digital and a large project in Europe. These factors will likely limit service revenue gains overall in Q2, and constrain the overall internal growth to the 2% to 4% range. Growth rates in the second half are expected to improve as the comparisons ease.
We're protecting Q2 adjusted OIBDA of $218 million to $228 million, reflecting expectations for sustained strong adjusted OIBDA margins. For the full year, we're reinforcing the solid fundamental outlook we discussed in our last conference call. We have reduced the dollar ranges of revenue by $5 million and adjusted OIBDA by $5 million to $10 million to reflect the impacts of the Chilean earthquakes in our full year results.  
As a result of the Chilean earthquakes, we experienced some damage in all of our facilities in the region. None of our facility were destroyed by fire or impacted by water damage. However, the structural integrity of 5 buildings was compromised and wrecking including certain buildings was damaged or destroyed. 
The adjustments we're making to our full year guidance reflect our expectations for loss, revenues and profits as the business works to return to normal, as well as the additional insurance and remediation costs associated with those efforts. For the enterprise, our full year outlook for reported revenue growth remains in the range of 6% to 8% supported by internal growth of 4% to 6%. 
Our revenue outlook reflects the expectations for solid storage growth this year consistent with prior guidance. We are targeting improved growth overall in the business in the second half of 2010, following some tougher comparisons in Q1 and Q2. We would note that performance at the high end of the revenue range will require improvement in current trends for service revenues in the second half of this year. 
Our profit outlook remains strong with the expectations for 7% to 11% growth in adjusted OIBDA and strong gains in adjusted EPS. As noted, we're lowering our expected capital expenditures for the year to approximately $290 million, reflecting refine capital plans and lower expectations for real estate spending. Included in our capital expenditures of approximately $290 million is about $29 million for real estate. In addition, we're adjusting our free cash flow outlook to $340 million to $370 million, reflecting our revised outlook for CapEx and adjusted OIBDA and moderately higher cash taxes. 
In April, we received the $10 million cash advance on our insurance claims related to the Chilean earthquakes that will be reflected in our Q2 free cash flow. Although we do expect to receive additional insurance proceeds in the future, we're not including any in our cash flow forecast at this time as the size and timing of these receipts is uncertain. We haven't included estimates for potential incremental 2010 capital spending related to Chile as well, as we're still evaluating facility, planning and timing of remediation. Thanks, and I would now like to turn the call over to Bob."

As Brian noted, our quarterly financial results came in as expected. Our internal revenue growth improved somewhat despite difficult comparisons and continued pressures from the economy on service revenues. We continue to deliver strong profit growth and cash flow. Overall, Q1 was a solid start for the year and we're on track towards delivering strong financial performance this year. 
Key messages that you should hear on today's update. First, our financial performance remains strong. This performance reflect the strength of our business model and the gains that we continue to drive to our focus on operational excellence across our business.
We're working on improving our growth trajectory, driving aggressively against new business with positive early results. This emphasis will help offset continued pressures on service activity and the impact from select factors such as the earthquake in Chile. 
Third, we're making good progress against our strategic priorities, including driving growth and improved returns in our International business, expanding our technology services offering and continuing to strengthen our organization.
Let me start by providing an update on our growth agenda. We're making progress on the growth front despite some continued headwinds in the business. Our quarterly growth performance was in line with the expectations. Storage growth, a key financial driver for Iron Mountain, was solid at 4%. As expected, we saw some moderation in storage growth in Q1 reflecting impacts from lower new sales levels and higher destructions during 2009. Destructions have stabilized, we're working on driving new sales, and believe we're on track towards achieving our full year objectives to storage revenues. 
Overall, internal growth was also 4% as benefits from factors like higher paper pricing offset continued pressures on core service activity. Service activity softens substantially during the economic downturn, and we continue to see lower transportation and shredding service levels, which are offsetting gains we are realizing in areas like DMS.
We are focused on strengthening our growth trajectory as we work through the year on factors that are in our control. In this context, we have concentrated efforts within our organization on capturing the large unmended opportunities we see in our business. We have a number of programs targeting and driving improved growth and extended our field leadership on supporting this effort with the same rigor that they used to drive operational excellence. 
We're of course, also working on improving our growth rate in Digital. We've added new services like eVantage to address evolving customer requirements. For eDiscovery services, we've added Classify & Collect that allows our PC backup customers to easily identify data, which is subject to legal hold and we've expanded the storage capacity in our server backup offering, all of which will help strengthen our recurring storage pipeline and overall revenue.
While it's still very early, we're making progress on the new sales front. We've landed new business opportunities in the data protection space, improved our competitiveness and strength, and our field organization is driving increased pipeline activity in records management. 
In digital, we're strengthening our subscription sales pipeline, which will drive benefits in terms of recurring revenue gains. We've got work to do, but we feel positive about this early progress towards improving our new sales performance.
As we focus on improving growth trends in the near term, we're also advancing on our long-term strategic agenda. As seen in our quarterly results, we continue to drive strong operating performance in our core North American operations. The business is running well. And a key area of Iron Mountain involves extending this operating capability to drive growth and improve returns in our international operations. As we have noted, this is an area where we are driving improved momentum and one that will be a key factor supporting strong financial performance in 2010 and beyond.
We're on track for strong performance in our International business this year, and we've begun deploying the North American label [ph] for operational excellence in our more developed international markets, such as the UK and Australia. Productivity gains in these markets will enable continued investment against global expansion, while driving strong profit gains. We're pleased with the capability and progress we're advancing on this front, and see this as an area where we can continue to build upon for the long term. We're emphasizing the expansion of technology service as a key driver of our long-term strategy as well. 
As noted on our year-end call, we recently completed the acquisition of Mimosa Systems. Mimosa provides enterprise-class, on-premise archiving services so organizations can better benefit from business continuity, compliance and litigation readiness. Mimosa deploys next generation technology and compliments our existing suite of digital products.  With Mimosa, Iron Mountain now has the ability to store enterprise information wherever it resides, whether it's at the customer location or ours, offering them increased choice and flexibility for managing their information. The integration of Mimosa is going well and Mimosa's CEO, T.M. Ravi,has agreed to become the Head of Marketing for our Digital business.
This expansion of our technology services offerings helps to strengthen our Digital business, and also helps to strengthen our value proposition across all our service lines. See, our customers records and information management challenges are not neatly arranged into files by format. They're struggling to manage the risks and costs associated with information growth across all formats, and are looking to solution providers with a broad range of expertise and capability for much needed help. 
Iron Mountain is uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity because we work across all formats and have more experience in managing records. The development of our technology services portfolio is positioning us well to deliver long-term growth across our business. We're on the right track strategically, as we remain focused on solving our customers' biggest information management challenges.
Expanding our talent base is another key statistic theme for our business. This is a focus that exists for us from our frontline operations to the Board of Directors. And in March, we welcomed Al Verrecchia, Chairman of Hasbro to our Board of Directors. Al led a highly successful transformation of Hasbro, and we'll certainly benefit from his executive leadership on our Board. Overall, we're making good progress against our strategic agenda.
Now before I conclude my remarks, Brian have mentioned the financial impact of the Chilean earthquake. Chile has been always been a great business for Iron Mountain, and their response to this disaster has only been further distinguished their greatness. All 850 of our employees are safe. We've coordinated a worldwide effort around Iron Mountain to help them, help our customers, and those round-the-clock efforts have also included providing local humanitarian aid. We're very proud of their performance. 
But before I take your questions, let me summarize. We had a solid quarter that was in line with our expectations. We're on track towards delivering strong financial performance this year. We were concentrating our efforts around an improved growth trajectory, while advancing our long-term strategic priorities to capture the potential we see for our business. 
Thanks, and now we'll open the phone lines and take your questions."

We'll work through the lapping on that. And we have a large license sale on digital. So there's a couple of factors that are going to moderate growth. Paper pricing came down 15%, so that's less of a benefit. But net-net, I think overall in the business, we feel good. We've got the storage moving on a good track.

We posted solid results on the first quarter of 2010. Revenue growth of 7% was in line with expectations. Storage internal growth was solid at 4%. Service internal growth was 5% as strength in complementary service revenues, including benefits from higher paper prices, offset continued softness in core services. As we work to strengthen our revenue growth, we continue to drive strong profit and free cash flow performance. 
For the quarter, we delivered adjusted OIBDA growth of 11% driven by gross margin expansion of nearly 200 basis points. This expansion continues to be supported by productivity and pricing gains. Profit gains and capital efficiencies drove year-to-date free cash flow of $54 million. 
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.23 per share, an increase of 19% compared to the same period last year. Our reported EPS was $0.12 per share, including the impacts of the higher effective tax rate and the change in fiscal year end for Iron Mountain Europe from October 31 to December 31. I'll discuss these items more fully later on my remarks. 
Overall, Q1 was a solid start to the year, and we're on track towards delivering strong full year financial performance, consistent with the goals shared on our Q4 earnings call. We are refining our guidance today to include the expected impacts of the recent earthquakes on our Chilean business, including items such as insurance deductibles and remediation costs. 
Let's now turn to Slide 4 and begin our review of the first quarter results. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the first quarter of 2009. As I mentioned, revenues for the quarter were up 7% to $777 million. From a segment perspective, North American Physical posted 4% internal growth supported by 4% storage internal growth and strong complementary service revenue performance. Overall gains were constrained by continued pressures on core service activity levels, including impacts from unusually severe winter weather in several major markets. 
Our International Physical segment reported 6% internal growth supported by solid 8% growth in core revenues. These gains were moderated by declines in complementary revenues due primarily to lower project activity.
In our Digital segment, reported revenue growth was 3% for the first quarter including benefits from the Mimosa acquisition we completed at the end of February. Internal growth for this segment was minus 1% as eDiscovery gains were offset by impacts from lower subscription sales in recent quarters. 
Sustainable benefits from productivity initiatives and pricing gains, particularly in our North American Physical segment, drove higher service gross margins supporting a 190 basis points improvement in our consolidated gross margin. Higher storage gross margins, aided by improved pricing in North American Physical and gains in our International Physical business, were also key contributor to gross margin improvement.
Adjusted OIBDA grew 11% driven by strong gross profit gains. Below the adjusted OIBDA line, depreciation was $76 million and amortization was $9 million, in line with our forecast. Other expense for the quarter was $9 million, including $5 million of charges related to foreign currency rate changes and a $4 million one-time charge related to the change in Iron Mountain Europe's fiscal year from October 31 to December 31. This charge represents the net impact of this change for the two years ended December 31, 2009. There were no other effects from this change in our P&L.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.23 per share, an increase of 19% compared to the prior year reflecting strong operating performance and flat year-on-year interest expense. Reported EPS for the first quarter was $0.12 per share. The reported earnings were impacted by a higher effective tax rate reflecting the impact of discreet items, which more than offset higher pretax income. The structural tax rate for the first quarter was 39% as the impact of expired cash legislation was less than originally expected. The impact of discrete tax items primarily related to foreign currency rate changes in the quarter added 23 points to the effective tax rate. We expect the structural tax rate for 2010 to be 39%. 
Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line, as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange. As noted, our total internal growth for the quarter was 4%. Storage internal growth was solid at 4%, while complementary service revenues rebounded from a difficult 2009 to post 17% internal growth in Q1. These gains were offset by continued pressures on core service activity levels. Storage revenues, which represent more than 56% of total revenues continue to provide an expanding foundation for overall revenue performance. 
Storage revenue internal growth was 4%, with gains moderated by economic effects, which have constrained storage volume growth in recent quarters. Our service internal growth was flat for the first quarter. Growth rates were limited by lower activity levels, which remain pressured by economic conditions. We're planning for continued softness in core service activity given recent trends, as well as the select impacts from service reductions related to the Chilean earthquakes.
Overall, service revenues grew 5% reflecting strong growth in complementary service revenues supported by recent gains in recycled paper pricing. 
While paper price levels remain well above 2009 levels, they recently retreated about 15% from February, March levels, which were less than future gains. Foreign exchange increase reported revenue growth by 3% in the quarter reflecting the year-over-year weakening of the U.S. dollar. That current exchange rates' positive effects from foreign currency will moderate as we move forward.  
The Mimosa acquisition had minimal impact in our revenue growth in Q1 due to the timing of the close. Looking ahead, Mimosa should add just under 1% to our reported revenue growth each quarter. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our performance on a segment basis. Slide 6 shows key metrics for each of our core segments compared to Q1 of 2009. As a reminder, we have distinct goals and roles for our business segments within our integrated strategy. The North American Physical segment is the key financial driver of the business. We're capitalizing on our core opportunities to expand its high return foundation. 
In the International Physical segment, we're expanding our capabilities globally through a balanced approach focused on driving strong growth and improved returns. And in our Digital segment, we're investing to drive accelerated growth in attractive incremental markets. As shown in the slide, our Physical businesses continued to deliver strong operating performance. 
North America, our largest segment, continues to drive strong profits and cash flow. We're advancing our optimization agenda, while expanding our foundation through a targeted growth strategy. We have several programs aimed at driving improved revenue growth, and our field leadership is focused on supporting this effort with the same rigor they use to drive operational excellence.
Our International segment is performing well with solid revenue growth and improved profitability. We're beginning to leverage the success we had with operational excellence in North America and our larger more-developed international markets. Changes in the year-on-year exchange rates increased our reported results in this segment by approximately 8%. Please note that CapEx, which was 14% of segment revenues in Q1, includes about $11 million incurred by Iron Mountain Europe in November and December of 2009. 
In our Digital segment, we're working through some of the effects of softer subscription revenues in recent quarters and growth, while investing to advance our long-term strategic agenda. The integration of Mimosa is progressing well, and we'll enhance our service offering in support of accelerated digital growth. 
Let's turn to Slide 7 for a more detailed look at our capital spending and free cash flow. Slide 7 summarizes our capital spending and our free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. Total capital spending was $57 million for Q1, including $3 million for real estate. As I just mentioned, included in the total is $11 million of CapEx that was incurred by Iron Mountain Europe during November and December of 2009. 
Traditionally, the first quarter is a light CapEx quarter as some of our projects was scheduled for later in the year, and many required time to plan and source before the significant expenditures are eventually made. We remained focused on aggressively driving efficiencies in our capital spending, while supporting key growth initiatives and projects that help drive long-term return improvement. 
For Q1, the free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate was $54 million. The year-on-year decrease in free cash flow was a result of higher capital spending in 2009 compared to 2010. This is due primarily to a large accrued balance at December 31, 2009 and the inclusion of the additional two months of CapEx from Europe.
For 2010, we expect free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate to be approximately $340 million to $370 million, reflecting continued benefits from our efforts to improve profitability and capital efficiency.
As we announced in our Q4 earnings call in February, our Board approved a $150 million share repurchase program. In the first quarter, we acquired 410,000 shares for approximately $11 million. This leaves us a balance of $139 million for additional share repurchases under the existing plan. 
Let's now turn to Slide 8 for a review of our key debt statistics. Our strong performance supports the continued strengthening of our balance sheet. Our debt portfolio at March 31, 2010, remained in a very strong position. Our weighted average interest rate at 6.9% and were 87% fixed. Maturity is just under eight years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. Consolidated leverage remained at 3.4x, benefiting from our strong operating cash flows while reflecting the $112 million we paid for the acquisition of Mimosa. 
Our liquidity position remains strong at more than $1 billion with $325 million in cash and $743 million in additional borrowing capacity as of quarter end. Currently, we have a very strong balance sheet, and we're well positioned in terms of the cash and financing capacity.
This concludes our review of Q1 2010 results. In summary, revenue performance was in line with expectations, we're driving continued strong profit and cash flow performance through sustainable productivity and pricing gains and we remain committed to strengthening our business foundation globally, while delivering strong financial performance. And we're on track towards these goals in 2010. 
Let's now turn to Slide 9 to review our outlook for Q2 and the full year. Slide 9 summarizes our full year 2010 and Q2 guidance. Let me begin with the discussion of our outlook for next quarter. 
For Q2, we're projecting revenue of $785 million to $805 million. This reflects a 5% to 8% reported growth rate, including an estimated 2% to 3% benefit from foreign exchange. While we are planning for continued solid storage growth, our outlook incorporates expectations for lower service revenue growth in Q2. We expect continued near-term pressure on core service activity, and we'll be facing some difficult comparisons as we lap a large one-time license sale on Digital and a large project in Europe. These factors will likely limit service revenue gains overall in Q2, and constrain the overall internal growth to the 2% to 4% range. Growth rates in the second half are expected to improve as the comparisons ease.
We're protecting Q2 adjusted OIBDA of $218 million to $228 million, reflecting expectations for sustained strong adjusted OIBDA margins. For the full year, we're reinforcing the solid fundamental outlook we discussed in our last conference call. We have reduced the dollar ranges of revenue by $5 million and adjusted OIBDA by $5 million to $10 million to reflect the impacts of the Chilean earthquakes in our full year results.  
As a result of the Chilean earthquakes, we experienced some damage in all of our facilities in the region. None of our facility were destroyed by fire or impacted by water damage. However, the structural integrity of 5 buildings was compromised and wrecking including certain buildings was damaged or destroyed. 
The adjustments we're making to our full year guidance reflect our expectations for loss, revenues and profits as the business works to return to normal, as well as the additional insurance and remediation costs associated with those efforts. For the enterprise, our full year outlook for reported revenue growth remains in the range of 6% to 8% supported by internal growth of 4% to 6%. 
Our revenue outlook reflects the expectations for solid storage growth this year consistent with prior guidance. We are targeting improved growth overall in the business in the second half of 2010, following some tougher comparisons in Q1 and Q2. We would note that performance at the high end of the revenue range will require improvement in current trends for service revenues in the second half of this year. 
Our profit outlook remains strong with the expectations for 7% to 11% growth in adjusted OIBDA and strong gains in adjusted EPS. As noted, we're lowering our expected capital expenditures for the year to approximately $290 million, reflecting refine capital plans and lower expectations for real estate spending. Included in our capital expenditures of approximately $290 million is about $29 million for real estate. In addition, we're adjusting our free cash flow outlook to $340 million to $370 million, reflecting our revised outlook for CapEx and adjusted OIBDA and moderately higher cash taxes. 
In April, we received the $10 million cash advance on our insurance claims related to the Chilean earthquakes that will be reflected in our Q2 free cash flow. Although we do expect to receive additional insurance proceeds in the future, we're not including any in our cash flow forecast at this time as the size and timing of these receipts is uncertain. We haven't included estimates for potential incremental 2010 capital spending related to Chile as well, as we're still evaluating facility, planning and timing of remediation. Thanks, and I would now like to turn the call over to Bob."

As Brian noted, our quarterly financial results came in as expected. Our internal revenue growth improved somewhat despite difficult comparisons and continued pressures from the economy on service revenues. We continue to deliver strong profit growth and cash flow. Overall, Q1 was a solid start for the year and we're on track towards delivering strong financial performance this year. 
Key messages that you should hear on today's update. First, our financial performance remains strong. This performance reflect the strength of our business model and the gains that we continue to drive to our focus on operational excellence across our business.
We're working on improving our growth trajectory, driving aggressively against new business with positive early results. This emphasis will help offset continued pressures on service activity and the impact from select factors such as the earthquake in Chile. 
Third, we're making good progress against our strategic priorities, including driving growth and improved returns in our International business, expanding our technology services offering and continuing to strengthen our organization.
Let me start by providing an update on our growth agenda. We're making progress on the growth front despite some continued headwinds in the business. Our quarterly growth performance was in line with the expectations. Storage growth, a key financial driver for Iron Mountain, was solid at 4%. As expected, we saw some moderation in storage growth in Q1 reflecting impacts from lower new sales levels and higher destructions during 2009. Destructions have stabilized, we're working on driving new sales, and believe we're on track towards achieving our full year objectives to storage revenues. 
Overall, internal growth was also 4% as benefits from factors like higher paper pricing offset continued pressures on core service activity. Service activity softens substantially during the economic downturn, and we continue to see lower transportation and shredding service levels, which are offsetting gains we are realizing in areas like DMS.
We are focused on strengthening our growth trajectory as we work through the year on factors that are in our control. In this context, we have concentrated efforts within our organization on capturing the large unmended opportunities we see in our business. We have a number of programs targeting and driving improved growth and extended our field leadership on supporting this effort with the same rigor that they used to drive operational excellence. 
We're of course, also working on improving our growth rate in Digital. We've added new services like eVantage to address evolving customer requirements. For eDiscovery services, we've added Classify & Collect that allows our PC backup customers to easily identify data, which is subject to legal hold and we've expanded the storage capacity in our server backup offering, all of which will help strengthen our recurring storage pipeline and overall revenue.
While it's still very early, we're making progress on the new sales front. We've landed new business opportunities in the data protection space, improved our competitiveness and strength, and our field organization is driving increased pipeline activity in records management. 
In digital, we're strengthening our subscription sales pipeline, which will drive benefits in terms of recurring revenue gains. We've got work to do, but we feel positive about this early progress towards improving our new sales performance.
As we focus on improving growth trends in the near term, we're also advancing on our long-term strategic agenda. As seen in our quarterly results, we continue to drive strong operating performance in our core North American operations. The business is running well. And a key area of Iron Mountain involves extending this operating capability to drive growth and improve returns in our international operations. As we have noted, this is an area where we are driving improved momentum and one that will be a key factor supporting strong financial performance in 2010 and beyond.
We're on track for strong performance in our International business this year, and we've begun deploying the North American label [ph] for operational excellence in our more developed international markets, such as the UK and Australia. Productivity gains in these markets will enable continued investment against global expansion, while driving strong profit gains. We're pleased with the capability and progress we're advancing on this front, and see this as an area where we can continue to build upon for the long term. We're emphasizing the expansion of technology service as a key driver of our long-term strategy as well. 
As noted on our year-end call, we recently completed the acquisition of Mimosa Systems. Mimosa provides enterprise-class, on-premise archiving services so organizations can better benefit from business continuity, compliance and litigation readiness. Mimosa deploys next generation technology and compliments our existing suite of digital products.  With Mimosa, Iron Mountain now has the ability to store enterprise information wherever it resides, whether it's at the customer location or ours, offering them increased choice and flexibility for managing their information. The integration of Mimosa is going well and Mimosa's CEO, T.M. Ravi,has agreed to become the Head of Marketing for our Digital business.
This expansion of our technology services offerings helps to strengthen our Digital business, and also helps to strengthen our value proposition across all our service lines. See, our customers records and information management challenges are not neatly arranged into files by format. They're struggling to manage the risks and costs associated with information growth across all formats, and are looking to solution providers with a broad range of expertise and capability for much needed help. 
Iron Mountain is uniquely positioned to capture this opportunity because we work across all formats and have more experience in managing records. The development of our technology services portfolio is positioning us well to deliver long-term growth across our business. We're on the right track strategically, as we remain focused on solving our customers' biggest information management challenges.
Expanding our talent base is another key statistic theme for our business. This is a focus that exists for us from our frontline operations to the Board of Directors. And in March, we welcomed Al Verrecchia, Chairman of Hasbro to our Board of Directors. Al led a highly successful transformation of Hasbro, and we'll certainly benefit from his executive leadership on our Board. Overall, we're making good progress against our strategic agenda.
Now before I conclude my remarks, Brian have mentioned the financial impact of the Chilean earthquake. Chile has been always been a great business for Iron Mountain, and their response to this disaster has only been further distinguished their greatness. All 850 of our employees are safe. We've coordinated a worldwide effort around Iron Mountain to help them, help our customers, and those round-the-clock efforts have also included providing local humanitarian aid. We're very proud of their performance. 
But before I take your questions, let me summarize. We had a solid quarter that was in line with our expectations. We're on track towards delivering strong financial performance this year. We were concentrating our efforts around an improved growth trajectory, while advancing our long-term strategic priorities to capture the potential we see for our business. 
Thanks, and now we'll open the phone lines and take your questions."

And so we're expecting some lost storage revenue. The profit impacts, obviously there's some impact from the lost business.

Remember that there's a ton of room in Continental Europe as well. We're still in the early stages of scaling these individual countries because unlike North America, Spain is different from Germany, which is different from France. And those businesses still have a lot of room for improvement, and it's in a timescale measured in years. You'll see more improvement there than you will from markets where we're just entering."

But overall, we're continuing to drive solid storage revenue growth, and we're looking improve that as we move forward. The service activity was supported by a couple of factors, obviously, improved paper pricing. We are seeing very good growth on the DMS front. And those factors are offset by the softness that we see on service activity levels and also, kind of on a select basis, some of the more traditional project work that we have done that isn't related in managing hybrid records, which we think is indicative of just kind of softer activity in some of the sales pipeline that softened last year. But yes, on balance, it's solid growth, in line with what we were hoping to achieve.

We continued to drive strong financial performance in the second quarter. Adjusted OIBDA came in above the high end of our guidance range, driven by strong cost management and benefits from productivity initiatives that supported better-than-expected gross margin gains. Adjusted OIBDA increased 8% percent in Q2 and 10% year-to-date versus the prior year, and is on track towards our full-year growth targets.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.28 per share, an increase of 13% compared to the same period last year. Our reported EPS was $0.20 per share including one-time impacts on other expense and our effective tax rate related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar within the quarter.
Revenue growth for the quarter was 5%, aided by favorable year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Internal growth was 2% with consistent trends in core revenue growth. Revenue gains continue to be moderated by economic trends, which have pressured core service activity and storage growth. FX revenue benefits for the quarter were also about $9 million less than originally forecast given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
Looking forward. We're maintaining our outlook for strong adjusted OIBDA growth this year, consistent with our prior guidance. We are adjusting our full-year revenue outlook to reflect recent changes in FX rates and consistent internal growth trends, which are below our original goals for improved 4% to 6% internal growth this year.
Let's now turn to Slide 4 and begin our review of the second quarter results.
Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the second quarter of 2009. As noted, Q2 was another strong quarter for financial performance. Enterprise revenue growth was a solid 5%, supported by favorable year-on-year currency rate changes.
From a segment perspective, North American Physical posted 3% internal growth, supported by 3% storage internal growth and strong complementary service revenue performance, including benefits from higher paper prices and DMS revenues. Overall gains continue to be constrained by economic trends contributing to soft core service activity levels.
Our International Physical segment reported 2% internal growth, supported by solid 6% growth in storage revenues. These gains were moderated by tough comparisons to prior-year project revenues.
In our Digital segment, reported revenue growth was 5% in the second quarter, including benefits from the Mimosa acquisition we completed at the end of February. Internal growth for the segment was minus 1%, reflecting the impacts of lower subscription sales in 2009 and moderated growth in eDiscovery consistent with broader market trends. Our positive momentum on the new sales front, as illustrated by our stronger license sales, supported our Q2 Digital results.
We continue to translate moderate overall revenue growth into strong gross profit gains. Gross profits increased 9% versus the prior year, reflecting a 230 basis point in margin improvement. Continued benefits from productivity initiatives and disciplined cost controls are supporting these gains and driving higher service margins. Storage gross margins also improved, aided by pricing gains.
Adjusted OIBDA grew 8% to $236 million. This increase was driven by gross profit gains and lower incentive compensation expense, offset by Mimosa integration costs and investments in growth initiatives including the development of our international Hybrid Records business.
Below the adjusted OIBDA line, depreciation was $75 million and amortization was $10 million in line with our forecast. Other expense for the quarter was $4 million primarily related to foreign currency rate changes.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.28 per share, an increase of 13% compared to the prior year, reflecting strong operating performance combined with relatively flat interest expense. Reported EPS in Q2 of 2010 and Q2 of 2009 were impacted by discrete effects related to FX rate changes.
Reported EPS for the second quarter was $0.20 per share. The reported earnings were impacted by a higher effective tax rate reflecting the impact of discreet items which more than offset higher operating income.
The structural tax rate for the second quarter was 39%. The impact of discrete tax items, primarily related to foreign currency rate changes in the quarter, added 15 points to the effective tax rate.
Reported EPS for Q2 of 2009 was $0.43 including the benefits of $18 million of other income and a 14% effective tax rate due to FX rate changes in that quarter. We expect the structural tax rate for 2010 to be 39%.
Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5.
Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange compared to our 2010 full-year target growth ranges.
Total internal growth for the quarter was 2% reflecting consistent core revenue growth trends. Economic factors continue to constrain service activity levels and storage growth. Core activity correlates with employment and general economic trends and has remained soft in recent quarters. We've seen significant pressure in vertical segments such as Legal Services, which have been particularly hard hit during this downturn.
The internal growth rate for core storage revenues continues to trend at 3%. While we're making positive progress on the new sales front, overall volume gains continue to be constrained by softness in general business activity and sustained higher levels of destructions.
We're seeing some moderation in net pricing benefit in areas like U.S. box storage as well, towards the 2% range, due primarily to business mix and lower CPI levels. Revenue gains in International Physical and Digital remain primarily volume driven.
Core service internal growth was down 1% in the second quarter, consistent with recent trends. Growth in our complementary services revenues, which face a difficult comparison to Q2 of 2009, was supported by higher recycled paper prices and strong gains in growth areas such as DMS. We continue to see benefits from our focus on expanding our hybrids records management services, and Bob will have more to say on this shortly.
Overall, while core growth trends remain consistent, and we're building momentum and strengthening new sales and growing a hybrid records services, we are trending below our goals for improved 4% to 6% revenue growth this year. These consistent trends will be reflected in our updated full-year outlook, which I'll discuss more fully later in the presentation.
Foreign exchange increased reported revenue growth by 2% in the quarter, reflecting the year-over-year weakening of the U.S. dollar. At recent exchange rates, we expect the FX impact on revenue growth to be about minus 1% for the second half of the year.
The Mimosa acquisition added under 1% to our reported revenue growth in the quarter. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our year-to-date performance.
Slide 6 looks at our year-to-date operating performance compared to the first half of 2009. The key take-away from this slide is that, despite the ongoing economic factors that are moderating top line growth, we continue to drive very strong financial results.
Our continued focus on operational improvement is driving substantial gains in gross profits, leading to a 220 basis point increase in gross margin for the first half of 2010 compared to the same prior-year period. These improvements are sustainable and position us well for flow-through benefits from higher growth when economic conditions improve.
For the first half of the year, we achieved 10% growth in adjusted OIBDA. Strong operating gains, combined with a relatively flat interest expense, drove a 16% increase in adjusted EPS compared to the first half of 2009.
Our focus on disciplined capital allocation continues to drive improvement to our capital efficiency. Combined with operating profit gains, this progress drove a 17% increase in year-to-date free cash flow compared to the same prior-year period.
Let's move now to Slide 7 for a year-to-date review from a segment perspective.
Slide 7 shows key metrics for each of our four segments compared to the first half of 2009. Our year-to-date financial results reflect solid execution across our business.
North America, our largest segment, continues to drive higher profits, cash flows and returns. We continue to push our optimization agenda while expanding our business foundation through a targeted growth strategy. Significant growth opportunities exist in the unvended storage and DMS markets for this segment, and we're making solid progress in advancing our growth strategies on these fronts.
Our focus on operational excellence will allow us to build on the very attractive economics of this business as we continue to expand.
Our International segment also continues to expand and is well positioned to continue delivering strong profit gains. Internal storage growth is 6% year-to-date in this segment, supported by gains in expansion markets. While year-to-date revenue and profit growth have been constrained by some tough comparisons and early investments in expanding our Hybrids Records business, we remain on track for solid profit and margin improvement in our International business this year.
Our Digital business continues to work through economic impact that have pressured subscription revenues in recent quarters, as well as impacts from cost pressures in the Legal segment, which have contributed to a softer eDiscovery market. Integration costs associated with the Mimosa acquisition are reflected in the year-to-date profit results of the segment.
Bob will discuss in more detail the progress we're making in advancing our new sales and product initiatives to position us for strong long-term growth in Digital.
Let's now turn to Slide 8 for more a detailed look at our capital spending and free cash flow.
Slide 8 summarizes our capital spending and our free cash flow on a year-to-date basis.
Total capital spending was $107 million for the first half of 2010 including $4 million for real estate. We remain focused on driving efficiencies in our capital spending while supporting key growth initiatives and projects that help drive long-term return improvement.
For the first half of 2010, free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate was $141 million, a 17% increase over the same prior-year period. The year-on-year increase in free cash flow was a result of higher operating profits in 2010 compared to 2009. Included in the $141 million of free cash flow is $8 million of net insurance proceeds associated with the Chilean earthquake.
For 2010, we're revising our expectations for free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate to approximately $330 million to $360 million. This reflects estimates for higher cash taxes, which are offsetting additional capital efficiencies.
As we announced in our Q4 earnings call in February, our board approved a $150 million share repurchase program. In the second quarter, we acquired 1.8 million shares for approximately $44 million. Combined with our first quarter purchases, we've acquired 2.2 million shares for approximately $54 million year-to-date. This leaves us a balance of $96 million for additional share repurchases under the existing plan.
Let's now turn to Slide 9 for a review of our key debt statistics.
Our strong financial performance and disciplined cash management has resulted in a very healthy balance sheet. Our debt portfolio at June 30, 2010 remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate is 6.9%, and we're 87% fixed. Maturity is 7.5 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014.
Consolidated leverage is at 3.1x, benefiting from our significant operating cash flows while reflecting the $112 million we paid for the acquisition of Mimosa in Q1. Leverage is just below the low end of our target range of 3.5x to 4.5x, and we're comfortable operating at this level given the current economic environment.
We're also well-positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. Liquidity is nearly $1.1 billion, with $340 million in cash and $750 million in additional borrowing capacity as of quarter end.
This concludes our review of the Q2 2010 results.
In summary, we continue to drive strong financial performance despite the economic impacts moderating revenue growth. And we remain committed to strengthening our business foundation globally while delivering strong financial performance to position the company to capture increased benefits when economic conditions improve.
Let's now turn to Slide 10 to discuss our financial outlook.
Slide 10 highlights the key factors impacting our revised outlook for the balance of the year. As noted, we remain on track for strong financial performance in 2010. We are updating our revenue outlook today to reflect recent changes in FX rates and ongoing pressures on general business activity.
Our current outlook is for 4% to 5% reported revenue growth this year, down from our prior goals for 6% to 8% growth improvement this year. The recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar has reduced our full-year growth outlook by nearly 1%. We've also adjusted our full-year internal growth forecast  of the 3% range, incorporating year-to-date trends and expectations for continued soft economic conditions.
While we are seeing signs of improvement in complementary services, and we continue to make progress in strengthening our sales pipeline, economic trends are limiting core revenue growth. Our outlook reflects projections for full-year storage growth in the 3% range, consistent with recent trends, and for flat to modest growth in core service revenues.
While macro factors continue to constrain our revenue growth outlook, our progress in driving operational excellence across our business and improving our international profit trajectory is keeping us on track for significant profit gains this year. This progress enables us to maintain our outlook for 7% to 11% adjusted OIBDA growth, double-digit adjusted EPS gains and strong free cash flow in 2010.
Let's now turn to Slide 11 to review specifics related to our 2010 guidance. Slide 11 summarizes our full year 2010 and Q3 guidance.
For 2010, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $3.12 billion to $3.16 billion. This represents reported revenue growth of between 4% and 5%, including internal revenue growth of approximately 3%, and 1% to 1.5% of combined acquisition and growth in FX benefit based on recent foreign currency exchange rates.
Our profit outlook remains strong, with expectations for 7% to 11% growth in adjusted OIBDA and 10% to 20% gains in adjusted EPS. Our adjusted OIBDA at outlook remains at the midpoint of $945 million, as productivity gains and benefits from cost management initiatives and lower incentive compensation accruals offset negative impacts from factors such as FX.
We're lowering our expected capital expenditures for the year to approximately $280 million, reflecting refined spending plans. Included in our capital expenditures is $20 million for real estate.
As noted, we're adjusting our free cash flow outlook to $330 million to $360 million, reflecting a higher outlook for cash taxes.
For Q3, we're projecting revenue of $780 million to $800 million, reflecting internal growth of 3% to 4%, supported by approximately 2% core revenue growth and improved complementary revenue gains. We expect Q3 adjusted OIBDA in the $236 million to $246 million range.
Let's turn to Slide 12 to put this performance in a longer-term context. Slide 12 demonstrates the long-term record of strong financial performance we're building at Iron Mountain.
Over the past four years, we've been executing consistently against key financial objectives for our company: to drive consistently strong revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth; improve capital efficiency to support higher incremental return on invested capital; and to advanced strategies to optimize our capital structure, drive cash flow and maximize investor returns.
While the impacts of the economic slowdown have pushed our recent top line performance below our long-term goals, we continue to execute with discipline to deliver strong financial performance. Over the past four years, while continue to expand our business foundation and capability, we've driven consistently strong adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS growth well ahead of revenue gains.
Our disciplined approach to capital allocation has supported a 500-plus basis point improvement in capital efficiency, record cash flow generation and the substantial strengthening of our balance sheet.
These improvements are sustainable, and reflect the strength of our business model and our growing capability as an organization. These factors will enable us to deliver continued strong performance and position us well to realize the benefits of strong incremental profit and cash flow from future revenue growth as the economy improves.
Thank you. I'd like to now turn the call over to Bob."

As Brian mentioned, we delivered strong financial results in Q2 with adjusted OIBDA results exceeding the high end of our expectations. And we continue to deliver strong performance despite economic factors that are moderating our revenue growth.
Today, I'm going to discuss how our business is doing in the current environment, such that we continued to deliver positive financial performance and position ourselves well for when the economy recovers. I'm also going to provide an update on our growth agenda, highlighting the progress we're making in key areas such as hybrid service expansion and go-to-market strength, as these are fundamental enablers of our long-term success.
There are some key messages that I want to emphasize today. First, Iron Mountain's business continues to deliver strong financial results despite consistent macro impacts that are moderating our revenue growth. Second, we're making good progress on our growth agenda, positioning ourselves for strong long-term performance by focusing on areas we can control.
Let's talk about our financial performance in Q2.
We continue to demonstrate the attractiveness of the Iron Mountain business model as reflected in today's results. And as Brian pointed out at the close of his remarks, profitability and cash flow are all up significantly in the past four years.
This performance is the direct result of our base business model, as well as our determination to implement operational excellence and process discipline across our company. We continue to strengthen the management of pricing, transportation, workflow in our record centers and the way we procure services. These actions support strong gross margin gains, and as you know, we're extending this capability globally, which along with our growth initiatives will help grow our international returns.
We believe that being able to continue delivering strong financial performance will serve us well as we make progress with our growth agenda, and it'll also position Iron Mountain to take advantage of the economy as it improves.
So let me talk now about the current trends and how we're managing them.
In terms of Core business trends, we're experiencing the same softness that many of our customers are. Specifically, core service activity levels are down. This correlates with continued high unemployment in our customer base and the general sluggish business environment.
Certain segments, like Legal, are seeing significant pressure in terms of their cost and litigation activity. This puts pressure on our services in that segment.
The continued economic weakness has also constrained storage volume gains in developed markets like North America and the UK. Customers are focused on cost controls, which leads to sharp control over their inventories. Now we see these trends as principally related to the soft economy, and until we see evidence to the contrary, we're planning for these trends to continue and have updated our growth outlook accordingly.
We know our business is a great business and has great potential, and we'll continue to manage through this impacts and deliver strong financial results. We intend to grow profits faster than revenue, translating mid-single digit revenue growth into strong adjusted OIBDA, earnings per share and cash flow gains. We continue to focus on those things that are within our control to improve our growth rate and position ourselves to take advantage of any recovery that occurs in the economy.
So let me talk about Iron Mountain's growth. 
I'm pleased with the progress we're making on our growth agenda because, as you know, our customers need to reduce their costs and risks, know what information they have, manage it appropriately, realize greater value from their information and have confidence that it is guarded safely. That's Iron Mountain's value proposition, and we're excited about the traction we're getting with more and more customers. And because we've built a business that runs effectively, we can focus on our customers' critical information needs as they evolve.
In terms of core growth, we continue to make good strides globally, with solid 6% storage internal growth internationally in Q2, supported by continued growth in expansion markets like Continental Europe, Latin America and Australia.
And having established a foundation and a culture of operational excellence in North America, we're now in a position to really aggressively pursue revenue. And I'm confident that we'll be equally successful in this endeavor as we were in establishing operational excellence.
We've made steady progress in building the sales pipeline this year, and I'm pleased with our new sales performance. To give you a better sense for this momentum, let me highlight some of the deals that we won in our Core business during the quarter.
Berkshire Hathaway awarded us preferred vendor status, meaning they recommend Iron Mountain records management to all of their operating units. This is a relationship we've been cultivating for some time, where we advised Berkshire Hathaway to consolidate their efforts and where we won their business over time.
Also during the quarter, one of the largest commercial real estate companies in the world signed a master agreement to bring Iron Mountain's records management, shredding and data protection capabilities downstream to their tenants on a worldwide basis.
One of the world's leading professional services firms signed a ten-year contract with us to outsource all of their records management program in the Netherlands. And with this win, we now serve all of the big four accounting firms in that region. 
During the quarter, two of the leading pharmaceutical companies and the largest tax advisory firm in the world awarded us their Shredding business. As you know, this is a competitive business. However, the competition for shredding gets a lot easier for Iron Mountain when we're dealing with large firms that have multiple locations where they're demanding an unbroken chain of custody, operational uniformity and certifiable destruction of their information. And as you might imagine, you can't risk destroying the wrong tax return or lab notebook.
Iron Mountain remains very well positioned to capture these clients as we deploy the right capabilities and have the scale necessary to service their needs.
Also in our Core business is our Hybrid business, which you've heard me refer to as DMS, where there are both physical and digital properties to protecting the asset. But this also involves the capability of converting from physical to digital, where we have a unique value proposition. Hybrid services support our complementary revenue growth, and I'm quite pleased with our progress during the quarter.
During the quarter, we won CitiFinancial, where we're working with them on a project where we get their records from 1,800 branches and move them to our storage and from there, we will then image the loans for their -- for Citi's review.
One of the largest technology companies in the world chose Iron Mountain to replace their existing partner for imaging services into their customer base with our DMS capability. This a very big competitive victory for us, and it reinforces our credibility as best in class. 
During the quarter, a major government agency co-awarded us a project to retrieve, organize and transport records from hundreds of banks around the country and image those documents at our imaging centers for the purpose of long-term preservation.
And also during the quarter in our core, a major Hollywood studio chose us to transcribe their vial [ph] (27:45) film and sound assets throughout the continent of Europe.
I highlight these wins because they're all expected to scale meaningfully, and there are common requirements around winning them which are unique to our value proposition. And an unbroken chain of custody around physical assets, the facilities and the people to convert those assets and the ability to store them digitally so that our customers can take action on the information.
These wins reinforce our momentum in the marketplace, demonstrating the linkage between our businesses, and underscore our value proposition, reminding us that we're on the right track strategically, and that we continue to earn the confidence of some of the premiere names in business as we refine our offerings into the marketplace.
Let me talk about the Digital business.
Our current growth in digital is constrained by softer subscription sales in the past few quarters and recent pressure on eDiscovery. We are taking action to address these issues and are positioning ourselves for long-term success in this business.
We've significantly increased the capability of our technology services, having recently increased the amount of data that can be handled in our server protection product, added discovery capability to our PC protection product and successfully integrated the business of our Mimosa acquisition within the first 100 days they were in Iron Mountain.
We've won several technology service deals during the quarter, including an agreement with Hitachi Densa to resell our server protection in Japan. One of the world's largest energy companies, during the quarter, chose us to protect the data of all their remote workers. And another one of the big technology giants chose our PC protection solution for downstream sales to their customer base.
We're seeing the results of rallying our company and marshaling our operational discipline around the pursuit of new revenue. As you know, it takes time to see those results flow through in an annuity-based business model.
I also want to mention one other thing on the growth equation. We've significantly strengthen our leadership team, and during the last quarter, Jerry Rulli joined us as the Executive Vice President of worldwide sales at Iron Mountain. I've known Jerry's work for some time and believe that he can really bring a system of selling to our sales force and improve our capability as it relates to generating new revenue.
The bottom line for all of this is that Iron Mountain is making clear progress both in helping to mitigate the near-term impacts of the economy and position our company for long-term success. We'll continue to focus on and strengthen our capabilities in the areas that drive long-term growth for our business, which include capturing the large unvended opportunity in core physical, expanding our high return model and international expansion and growing new service capabilities. I look forward to sharing more on these fronts during our upcoming Investor Day.
And before I take your questions, I want to remind of you the key messages that we started with.
As illustrated in today's positive results, our business is performing and we're successfully navigating through the current economic environment and its continued impact on our business. Additionally, we're making significant progress on advancing our growth agenda to be ready to take advantage of the economy when it improves and to position Iron Mountain for the long term.
I'd like to now turn the call over to the operator and take your questions. Thank you."

It's more than a pricing-only strategy. We've got benefits in terms of higher service margins from the productivity initiatives that we've advanced. On storage margins, we've had some benefit from pricing. But we've been very aggressively managing our facility utilization as a key initiative that's supporting that as well. Higher paper pricing is helping us. Energy, to a smaller degree, on a net basis has been a positive factor recently. So there're a number of factors that are helping us on that front, and we believe we can sustain that. And as we're extending many of these initiatives globally and heightening the focus on international margin improvement, we think that can be a -- this is clearly part of our long-term strategy. As far as your questions on pricing, our strategy has not changed. We continue to look to get a reasonable increase in pricing for the value of the services that we provide. We are reflecting some moderation. As you noted, for some customers, CPI-based escalators are built into their long-term contracts. That's moderated somewhat. We've seen some net business impacts. It's not one thing, but several factors and -- so that has moderated a bit.

All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties.

As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the appropriate GAAP measures, as required by Reg G, at the Investor Relations page of our website as well as in today's press release.

We continued to drive strong financial performance in the second quarter. Adjusted OIBDA came in above the high end of our guidance range, driven by strong cost management and benefits from productivity initiatives that supported better-than-expected gross margin gains. Adjusted OIBDA increased 8% percent in Q2 and 10% year-to-date versus the prior year, and is on track towards our full-year growth targets.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.28 per share, an increase of 13% compared to the same period last year. Our reported EPS was $0.20 per share including one-time impacts on other expense and our effective tax rate related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar within the quarter.
Revenue growth for the quarter was 5%, aided by favorable year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates. Internal growth was 2% with consistent trends in core revenue growth. Revenue gains continue to be moderated by economic trends, which have pressured core service activity and storage growth. FX revenue benefits for the quarter were also about $9 million less than originally forecast given the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar.
Looking forward. We're maintaining our outlook for strong adjusted OIBDA growth this year, consistent with our prior guidance. We are adjusting our full-year revenue outlook to reflect recent changes in FX rates and consistent internal growth trends, which are below our original goals for improved 4% to 6% internal growth this year.
Let's now turn to Slide 4 and begin our review of the second quarter results.
Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the second quarter of 2009. As noted, Q2 was another strong quarter for financial performance. Enterprise revenue growth was a solid 5%, supported by favorable year-on-year currency rate changes.
From a segment perspective, North American Physical posted 3% internal growth, supported by 3% storage internal growth and strong complementary service revenue performance, including benefits from higher paper prices and DMS revenues. Overall gains continue to be constrained by economic trends contributing to soft core service activity levels.
Our International Physical segment reported 2% internal growth, supported by solid 6% growth in storage revenues. These gains were moderated by tough comparisons to prior-year project revenues.
In our Digital segment, reported revenue growth was 5% in the second quarter, including benefits from the Mimosa acquisition we completed at the end of February. Internal growth for the segment was minus 1%, reflecting the impacts of lower subscription sales in 2009 and moderated growth in eDiscovery consistent with broader market trends. Our positive momentum on the new sales front, as illustrated by our stronger license sales, supported our Q2 Digital results.
We continue to translate moderate overall revenue growth into strong gross profit gains. Gross profits increased 9% versus the prior year, reflecting a 230 basis point in margin improvement. Continued benefits from productivity initiatives and disciplined cost controls are supporting these gains and driving higher service margins. Storage gross margins also improved, aided by pricing gains.
Adjusted OIBDA grew 8% to $236 million. This increase was driven by gross profit gains and lower incentive compensation expense, offset by Mimosa integration costs and investments in growth initiatives including the development of our international Hybrid Records business.
Below the adjusted OIBDA line, depreciation was $75 million and amortization was $10 million in line with our forecast. Other expense for the quarter was $4 million primarily related to foreign currency rate changes.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.28 per share, an increase of 13% compared to the prior year, reflecting strong operating performance combined with relatively flat interest expense. Reported EPS in Q2 of 2010 and Q2 of 2009 were impacted by discrete effects related to FX rate changes.
Reported EPS for the second quarter was $0.20 per share. The reported earnings were impacted by a higher effective tax rate reflecting the impact of discreet items which more than offset higher operating income.
The structural tax rate for the second quarter was 39%. The impact of discrete tax items, primarily related to foreign currency rate changes in the quarter, added 15 points to the effective tax rate.
Reported EPS for Q2 of 2009 was $0.43 including the benefits of $18 million of other income and a 14% effective tax rate due to FX rate changes in that quarter. We expect the structural tax rate for 2010 to be 39%.
Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5.
Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange compared to our 2010 full-year target growth ranges.
Total internal growth for the quarter was 2% reflecting consistent core revenue growth trends. Economic factors continue to constrain service activity levels and storage growth. Core activity correlates with employment and general economic trends and has remained soft in recent quarters. We've seen significant pressure in vertical segments such as Legal Services, which have been particularly hard hit during this downturn.
The internal growth rate for core storage revenues continues to trend at 3%. While we're making positive progress on the new sales front, overall volume gains continue to be constrained by softness in general business activity and sustained higher levels of destructions.
We're seeing some moderation in net pricing benefit in areas like U.S. box storage as well, towards the 2% range, due primarily to business mix and lower CPI levels. Revenue gains in International Physical and Digital remain primarily volume driven.
Core service internal growth was down 1% in the second quarter, consistent with recent trends. Growth in our complementary services revenues, which face a difficult comparison to Q2 of 2009, was supported by higher recycled paper prices and strong gains in growth areas such as DMS. We continue to see benefits from our focus on expanding our hybrids records management services, and Bob will have more to say on this shortly.
Overall, while core growth trends remain consistent, and we're building momentum and strengthening new sales and growing a hybrid records services, we are trending below our goals for improved 4% to 6% revenue growth this year. These consistent trends will be reflected in our updated full-year outlook, which I'll discuss more fully later in the presentation.
Foreign exchange increased reported revenue growth by 2% in the quarter, reflecting the year-over-year weakening of the U.S. dollar. At recent exchange rates, we expect the FX impact on revenue growth to be about minus 1% for the second half of the year.
The Mimosa acquisition added under 1% to our reported revenue growth in the quarter. 
Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our year-to-date performance. Slide 6 looks at our year-to-date operating performance compared to the first half of 2009. The key take-away from this slide is that, despite the ongoing economic factors that are moderating top line growth, we continue to drive very strong financial results.
Our continued focus on operational improvement is driving substantial gains in gross profits, leading to a 220 basis point increase in gross margin for the first half of 2010 compared to the same prior-year period. These improvements are sustainable and position us well for flow-through benefits from higher growth when economic conditions improve.
For the first half of the year, we achieved 10% growth in adjusted OIBDA. Strong operating gains, combined with a relatively flat interest expense, drove a 16% increase in adjusted EPS compared to the first half of 2009.
Our focus on disciplined capital allocation continues to drive improvement to our capital efficiency. Combined with operating profit gains, this progress drove a 17% increase in year-to-date free cash flow compared to the same prior-year period.
Let's move now to Slide 7 for a year-to-date review from a segment perspective. Slide 7 shows key metrics for each of our four segments compared to the first half of 2009. Our year-to-date financial results reflect solid execution across our business.
North America, our largest segment, continues to drive higher profits, cash flows and returns. We continue to push our optimization agenda while expanding our business foundation through a targeted growth strategy. Significant growth opportunities exist in the unvended storage and DMS markets for this segment, and we're making solid progress in advancing our growth strategies on these fronts.
Our focus on operational excellence will allow us to build on the very attractive economics of this business as we continue to expand.
Our International segment also continues to expand and is well positioned to continue delivering strong profit gains. Internal storage growth is 6% year-to-date in this segment, supported by gains in expansion markets. While year-to-date revenue and profit growth have been constrained by some tough comparisons and early investments in expanding our Hybrids Records business, we remain on track for solid profit and margin improvement in our International business this year.
Our Digital business continues to work through economic impact that have pressured subscription revenues in recent quarters, as well as impacts from cost pressures in the Legal segment, which have contributed to a softer eDiscovery market. Integration costs associated with the Mimosa acquisition are reflected in the year-to-date profit results of the segment.
Bob will discuss in more detail the progress we're making in advancing our new sales and product initiatives to position us for strong long-term growth in Digital.
Let's now turn to Slide 8 for more a detailed look at our capital spending and free cash flow. Slide 8 summarizes our capital spending and our free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. Total capital spending was $107 million for the first half of 2010 including $4 million for real estate. We remain focused on driving efficiencies in our capital spending while supporting key growth initiatives and projects that help drive long-term return improvement.
For the first half of 2010, free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate was $141 million, a 17% increase over the same prior-year period. The year-on-year increase in free cash flow was a result of higher operating profits in 2010 compared to 2009. Included in the $141 million of free cash flow is $8 million of net insurance proceeds associated with the Chilean earthquake.
For 2010, we're revising our expectations for free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate to approximately $330 million to $360 million. This reflects estimates for higher cash taxes, which are offsetting additional capital efficiencies.
As we announced in our Q4 earnings call in February, our board approved a $150 million share repurchase program. In the second quarter, we acquired 1.8 million shares for approximately $44 million. Combined with our first quarter purchases, we've acquired 2.2 million shares for approximately $54 million year-to-date. This leaves us a balance of $96 million for additional share repurchases under the existing plan.
Let's now turn to Slide 9 for a review of our key debt statistics. Our strong financial performance and disciplined cash management has resulted in a very healthy balance sheet. Our debt portfolio at June 30, 2010 remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate is 6.9%, and we're 87% fixed. Maturity is 7.5 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014.
Consolidated leverage is at 3.1x, benefiting from our significant operating cash flows while reflecting the $112 million we paid for the acquisition of Mimosa in Q1. Leverage is just below the low end of our target range of 3.5x to 4.5x, and we're comfortable operating at this level given the current economic environment.
We're also well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. Liquidity is nearly $1.1 billion, with $340 million in cash and $750 million in additional borrowing capacity as of quarter end.
This concludes our review of the Q2 2010 results.
In summary, we continue to drive strong financial performance despite the economic impacts moderating revenue growth. And we remain committed to strengthening our business foundation globally while delivering strong financial performance to position the company to capture increased benefits when economic conditions improve.
Let's now turn to Slide 10 to discuss our financial outlook. Slide 10 highlights the key factors impacting our revised outlook for the balance of the year. As noted, we remain on track for strong financial performance in 2010. We are updating our revenue outlook today to reflect recent changes in FX rates and ongoing pressures on general business activity.
Our current outlook is for 4% to 5% reported revenue growth this year, down from our prior goals for 6% to 8% growth improvement this year. The recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar has reduced our full year growth outlook by nearly 1%. We've also adjusted our full year internal growth forecast of the 3% range, incorporating year-to-date trends and expectations for continued soft economic conditions.
While we are seeing signs of improvement in complementary services, and we continue to make progress in strengthening our sales pipeline, economic trends are limiting core revenue growth. Our outlook reflects projections for full year storage growth in the 3% range, consistent with recent trends, and for flat to modest growth in core service revenues.
While macro factors continue to constrain our revenue growth outlook, our progress in driving operational excellence across our business and improving our international profit trajectory is keeping us on track for significant profit gains this year. This progress enables us to maintain our outlook for 7% to 11% adjusted OIBDA growth, double-digit adjusted EPS gains and strong free cash flow in 2010.
Let's now turn to Slide 11 to review specifics related to our 2010 guidance. Slide 11 summarizes our full year 2010 and Q3 guidance. For 2010, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $3,120,000,000 to $3,160,000,000. This represents reported revenue growth of between 4% and 5%, including internal revenue growth of approximately 3%, and 1% to 1.5% of combined acquisition and growth and FX benefit based on recent foreign currency exchange rates.
Our profit outlook remains strong, with expectations for 7% to 11% growth in adjusted OIBDA and 10% to 20% gains in adjusted EPS. Our adjusted OIBDA outlook remains at the midpoint of $945 million, as productivity gains and benefits from cost management initiatives and lower incentive compensation accruals offset negative impacts from factors such as FX.
We're lowering our expected capital expenditures for the year to approximately $280 million, reflecting refined spending plans. Included in our capital expenditures is $20 million for real estate.
As noted, we're adjusting our free cash flow outlook to $330 million to $360 million, reflecting a higher outlook for cash taxes.
For Q3, we're projecting revenue of $780 million to $800 million, reflecting internal growth of 3% to 4%, supported by approximately 2% core revenue growth and improved complementary revenue gains. We expect Q3 adjusted OIBDA in the $236 million to $246 million range.
Let's turn to Slide 12 to put this performance in a longer-term context. Slide 12 demonstrates the long-term record of strong financial performance we're building in Iron Mountain. Over the past four years, we've been executing consistently against key financial objectives for our company: to drive consistently strong revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth; improve capital efficiency to support higher incremental return on invested capital; and to advance strategies to optimize our capital structure, drive cash flow and maximize investor returns.
While the impacts of the economic slowdown have pushed our recent top line performance below our long-term goals, we continue to execute with discipline to deliver strong financial performance. Over the past four years, while we continue to expand our business foundation and capability, we've driven consistently strong adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EPS growth well ahead of revenue gains.
Our disciplined approach to capital allocation has supported a 500-plus basis point improvement in capital efficiency, record cash flow generation and the substantial strengthening of our balance sheet.
These improvements are sustainable, and reflect the strength of our business model and our growing capability as an organization. These factors will enable us to deliver continued strong performance and position us well to realize the benefits of strong incremental profit and cash flow from future revenue growth as the economy improves.
Thank you. I'd like to now turn the call over to Bob."

As Brian mentioned, we delivered strong financial results in Q2 with adjusted OIBDA results exceeding the high end of our expectations. And we continue to deliver strong performance despite economic factors that are moderating our revenue growth.
Today, I'm going to discuss how our business is doing in the current environment, such that we continued to deliver positive financial performance and position ourselves well for when the economy recovers. I'm also going to provide an update on our growth agenda, highlighting the progress we're making in key areas such as hybrid service expansion and go-to-market strength, as these are fundamental enablers of our long-term success.
There are some key messages that I want to emphasize today. First, Iron Mountain's business continues to deliver strong financial results despite consistent macro impacts that are moderating our revenue growth. Second, we're making good progress on our growth agenda, positioning ourselves for strong long-term performance by focusing on areas we can control.
Let's talk about our financial performance in Q2.  We continue to demonstrate the attractiveness of the Iron Mountain business model as reflected in today's results. And as Brian pointed out at the close of his remarks, profitability and cash flow are all up significantly in the past four years.
This performance is the direct result of our base business model, as well as our determination to implement operational excellence and process discipline across our company. We continue to strengthen the management of pricing, transportation, workflow in our record centers and the way we procure services. These actions support strong gross margin gains. And as you know, we're extending this capability globally, which along with our growth initiatives, will help grow our international returns.
We believe that being able to continue delivering strong financial performance will serve us well as we make progress with our growth agenda, and it'll also position Iron Mountain to take advantage of the economy as it improves.
So let me talk now about the current trends and how we're managing them. In terms of core business trends, we're experiencing the same softness that many of our customers are. Specifically, core service activity levels are down. This correlates with continued high unemployment in our customer base and the general sluggish business environment.  Certain segments, like Legal, are seeing significant pressure in terms of their cost and litigation activity. This puts pressure on our services in that segment.
The continued economic weakness has also constrained storage volume gains in developed markets like North America and the U.K. Customers are focused on cost controls, which leads to sharp control over their inventories. Now we see these trends as principally related to the soft economy, and until we see evidence to the contrary, we're planning for these trends to continue and have updated our growth outlook accordingly.
We know our business is a great business and has great potential, and we'll continue to manage through this impacts and deliver strong financial results. We intend to grow profits faster than revenue, translating mid-single digit revenue growth into strong adjusted OIBDA, earnings per share and cash flow gains. We continue to focus on those things that are within our control to improve our growth rate and position ourselves to take advantage of any recovery that occurs in the economy.
So let me talk about Iron Mountain's growth. 
I'm pleased with the progress we're making on our growth agenda because, as you know, our customers need to reduce their costs and risks, know what information they have, manage it appropriately, realize greater value from their information and have confidence that it is guarded safely. That's Iron Mountain's value proposition, and we're excited about the traction we're getting with more and more customers. And because we've built a business that runs effectively, we can focus on our customers' critical information needs as they evolve.
In terms of core growth, we continue to make good strides globally, with solid 6% storage internal growth internationally in Q2, supported by continued growth in expansion markets like Continental Europe, Latin America and Australia.
And having established a foundation and a culture of operational excellence in North America, we're now in a position to really aggressively pursue revenue. And I'm confident that we'll be equally successful in this endeavor as we were in establishing operational excellence.
We've made steady progress in building the sales pipeline this year, and I'm pleased with our new sales performance. To give you a better sense for this momentum, let me highlight some of the deals that we won in our Core business during the quarter.
Berkshire Hathaway awarded us preferred vendor status, meaning they recommend Iron Mountain records management to all of their operating units. This is a relationship we've been cultivating for some time, where we advised Berkshire Hathaway to consolidate their efforts and where we won their business over time.
Also during the quarter, one of the largest commercial real estate companies in the world signed a master agreement to bring Iron Mountain's records management, shredding and data protection capabilities downstream to their tenants on a worldwide basis.
One of the world's leading professional services firms signed a ten-year contract with us to outsource all of their records management program in the Netherlands. And with this win, we now serve all of the big four accounting firms in that region. 
During the quarter, two of the leading pharmaceutical companies and the largest tax advisory firm in the world awarded us their Shredding business. As you know, this is a competitive business. However, the competition for shredding gets a lot easier for Iron Mountain when we're dealing with large firms that have multiple locations where they're demanding an unbroken chain of custody, operational uniformity and certifiable destruction of their information. And as you might imagine, you can't risk destroying the wrong tax return or lab notebook.
Iron Mountain remains very well positioned to capture these clients as we deploy the right capabilities and have the scale necessary to service their needs.
Also in our Core business is our Hybrid business, which you've heard me refer to as DMS, where there are both physical and digital properties to protecting the asset. But this also involves the capability of converting from physical to digital, where we have a unique value proposition. Hybrid services support our complementary revenue growth, and I'm quite pleased with our progress during the quarter.
During the quarter, we won CitiFinancial, where we're working with them on a project where we get their records from 1,800 branches and move them to our storage and from there, we will then image the loans for their -- for Citi's review.
One of the largest technology companies in the world chose Iron Mountain to replace their existing partner for imaging services into their customer base with our DMS capability. This a very big competitive victory for us, and it reinforces our credibility as best in class. 
During the quarter, a major government agency co-awarded us a project to retrieve, organize and transport records from hundreds of banks around the country and image those documents at our imaging centers for the purpose of long-term preservation.
And also during the quarter in our core, a major Hollywood studio chose us to transcribe their vial [ph] (27:45) film and sound assets throughout the continent of Europe.
I highlight these wins because they're all expected to scale meaningfully, and there are common requirements around winning them which are unique to our value proposition. And an unbroken chain of custody around physical assets, the facilities and the people to convert those assets and the ability to store them digitally so that our customers can take action on the information.
These wins reinforce our momentum in the marketplace, demonstrating the linkage between our businesses, and underscore our value proposition, reminding us that we're on the right track strategically, and that we continue to earn the confidence of some of the premiere names in business as we refine our offerings into the marketplace.
Let me talk about the Digital business.
Our current growth in digital is constrained by softer subscription sales in the past few quarters and recent pressure on eDiscovery. We are taking action to address these issues and are positioning ourselves for long-term success in this business.
We've significantly increased the capability of our technology services, having recently increased the amount of data that can be handled in our server protection product, added discovery capability to our PC protection product and successfully integrated the business of our Mimosa acquisition within the first 100 days they were in Iron Mountain.
We've won several technology service deals during the quarter, including an agreement with Hitachi Densa to resell our server protection in Japan. One of the world's largest energy companies, during the quarter, chose us to protect the data of all their remote workers. And another one of the big technology giants chose our PC protection solution for downstream sales to their customer base.
We're seeing the results of rallying our company and marshaling our operational discipline around the pursuit of new revenue. As you know, it takes time to see those results flow through in an annuity-based business model.
I also want to mention one other thing on the growth equation. We've significantly strengthen our leadership team, and during the last quarter, Jerry Rulli joined us as the Executive Vice President of worldwide sales at Iron Mountain. I've known Jerry's work for some time and believe that he can really bring a system of selling to our sales force and improve our capability as it relates to generating new revenue.
The bottom line for all of this is that Iron Mountain is making clear progress both in helping to mitigate the near-term impacts of the economy and position our company for long-term success. We'll continue to focus on and strengthen our capabilities in the areas that drive long-term growth for our business, which include capturing the large unvended opportunity in core physical, expanding our high return model and international expansion and growing new service capabilities. I look forward to sharing more on these fronts during our upcoming Investor Day.
And before I take your questions, I want to remind of you the key messages that we started with.
As illustrated in today's positive results, our business is performing and we're successfully navigating through the current economic environment and its continued impact on our business. Additionally, we're making significant progress on advancing our growth agenda to be ready to take advantage of the economy when it improves and to position Iron Mountain for the long term.
I'd like to now turn the call over to the operator and take your questions. Thank you."

It's more than a pricing-only strategy. We've got benefits in terms of higher service margins from the productivity initiatives that we've advanced. On storage margins, we've had some benefit from pricing. But we've been very aggressively managing our facility utilization as a key initiative that's supporting that as well. Higher paper pricing is helping us. Energy, to a smaller degree, on a net basis has been a positive factor recently. So there're a number of factors that are helping us on that front, and we believe we can sustain that. And as we're extending many of these initiatives globally and heightening the focus on international margin improvement, we think that can be a -- this is clearly part of our long-term strategy. As far as your questions on pricing, our strategy has not changed. We continue to look to get a reasonable increase in pricing for the value of the services that we provide. We are reflecting some moderation. As you noted, for some customers, CPI-based escalators are built into their long-term contracts. That's moderated somewhat. We've seen some net business impacts. It's not one thing, but several factors and -- so that has moderated a bit.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who attended our 13th Annual Investor Day in New York earlier this month. We are pleased with the turnout, and hope you found the presentations informative. As always, we appreciate your support.
For our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2010 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide or our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements.
As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before discretionary acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently, and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website as well as in today's press release. 
With that, I'd like to introduce our CFO, Brian McKeon."

Slide 3 highlights the key messages from today's review. We continue to drive strong financial performance in the third quarter.

We continue to drive strong financial performance in the third quarter. Reported revenue growth for the quarter of 2% was in line with our outlook. Results were supported by solid gains in our International Physical segment, strong growth in hybrid services and benefits from higher recycled paper prices.
Revenue growth continues to be constrained by economic factors, which contributed to very soft core service activity this summer. Adjusted OIBDA came in above the high end of our guidance range, driven by continued benefits from productivity initiatives and lower incentive compensation accruals.  Adjusted OIBDA increased 13% in Q3 and 11% year-to-date versus the prior year. Adjustments to incentive compensation accruals added about five points of growth in Q3 and four points of growth on a year-to-date basis.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.35 per share, an increase of 39% compared to the same period last year. Our reported EPS was a loss of $0.76 per share, including a $1.24 per share after-tax charge for the Digital goodwill impairment.
As we proactively advance changes to improve performance in our Digital business, we evaluated our Digital business carrying value, resulting in a $255 million estimated goodwill impairment charge. We'll finalize the amount in the fourth quarter and record any adjustment if necessary at that time. It's important to note that this charge does not impact revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS or free cash flow. Both Bob and I will discuss this more fully later in our remarks.
Also included in reported EPS were benefits for the impacts on Other Income and our effective tax rate related to the weakening of the U.S. dollar within the quarter and the gain on the sale of our domain name management product line.
For the full year, we're raising our adjusted OIBDA outlook reflecting the strong year-to-date performance and benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals. We're also raising our full year cash flow outlook to reflect lower capital spending projections and expected benefits from recently enacted U.S. tax legislation. We're refining our revenue outlook as well to incorporate current internal growth trends and foreign currency exchange rates.
Let's now turn to Slide 4 and begin our review of the third quarter results. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the third quarter of 2009. Q3 was another solid quarter of financial performance. Enterprise revenue growth was 2%, in line with our outlook with overall gains constrained by continued softness in core service activity. Continued strong profit performance was supported gross margin gains and benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals. From a segment perspective, North American Physical posted 2% internal growth supported by strong complementary service revenue performance, including benefits from higher paper pricing and hybrid service revenues.
Storage internal growth was 1% in Q3. North American records management volume growth moderated as continued higher outgoing volumes offset new sales gains. As expected, there was some moderation in average net price gains, which are now trending in the 2% range for Records Management, due in part to lower CPI levels. Episodic destructions in our Physical Data Protection business constrained growth in that service line and also contributed to lower storage revenue growth. Core service revenues declined this summer, consistent with overall soft economic conditions. 
Our International Physical segment generated 5% internal growth. Storage internal growth was a solid 6%, supported by strong performance in the expansion markets. Reported revenues for this segment were 3%, including the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate changes.
In our Digital segment, reported revenue declined 1% in the third quarter as gains in backup and archiving services were offset by the divestiture of our domain name management product line and continued pressure on eDiscovery revenues. We expect continued pressure on Digital revenue growth in the near term as we work through comparisons to stronger prior year growth in areas such as eDiscovery. 
We continue to translate moderate overall revenue growth into strong gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 6% versus the prior year, yielding a 220 basis points margin improvement. Higher storage gross margins, particularly in the International segment are supporting these gains. Continued benefits from productivity initiatives drove higher service margins, which were also a key contributor to our improved performance.
Adjusted OIBDA grew 13% to $254 million. This increase was driven by gross profit gains, controlled SG&A spending and lower incentive compensation expense, which added about five points of growth in the quarter. These gains were partially offset by Mimosa integration costs and targeted investments in growth initiatives. Below the adjusted OIBDA line, depreciation was $77 million and amortization was $10 million, in line with our forecast. Other Income for the quarter was $9 million, including a $7 million gain on the sale of our domain name management program line and a $4 million gain related to foreign currency rate changes in the quarter. These were offset by an early debt extinguishment charge of $2 million.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.35 per share, an increase of 39% compared to the prior year, reflecting strong operating performance combined with lower interest expense. Reported EPS for the second quarter was a loss of $0.76 per share, including the impact of the $255 million non-cash charge for the Digital goodwill impairment. 
The structural tax rate for the third quarter was 38%, in line with our expectations. Including the impact of discrete tax items primarily related to the impairment charge, the effective tax rate for the quarter was minus 16%. It was minimal tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment charge as the majority of goodwill associated with our Digital business is non-deductible.
Also included as discrete tax items was a reversal of worldwide tax reserves due to lapses of statue of limitation periods and settlements with taxing authorities, and the positive impact of foreign exchange rate changes in the quarter. These benefits more than offset a charge to establish a valuation allowance, reflecting recently enacted U.S. legislative changes impacting the expected utilization of foreign tax credits. We expect the structural tax rate for 2010 to be 39%.
Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange compared to our 2010 full year outlook. Total internal growth for the quarter was 2%, consistent with the prior quarter. Economic factors continue to constrain service activity levels and storage growth. Core activity correlates with employment and general economic trends and has remained soft in recent quarters. The internal growth rate for core storage revenues was 2% in the quarter. Records Management volume growth moderated slightly as continued higher outgoing volume levels in North America offset new sales gains and solid momentum in international markets. Storage revenue growth also reflected moderated average net pricing gains in North American Records Management and episodic destructions in the Physical Data Protection business. We expect Storage internal growth for 2010 to be in the 2% to 3% range.
Core revenue internal growth was 1% in the third quarter, primarily reflecting lower core service activity levels. We're planning for continued weakness in core service revenues until we see clear signs of improvement. For the full year, we expect core revenue internal growth to be in the 1% range. Solid growth in our complementary service revenues was supported by higher recycled paper prices and strong gains in hybrid service revenues. These gains were partially offset by lower eDiscovery revenues and the lapping of a large European project.
Overall, revenue growth trends remain relatively consistent. Income and volume growth is stabilizing, and we're seeing some improvement in new sales. Offsetting these trends are continued weakness in core service activities and moderated net average pricing in the North American Box business, due in part to lower CPI rates. As a result, we expect full year internal growth to be in the 2% to 3% range.
At recent exchange rates, we expect the FX impact to increase revenue growth this year by about 1%. Acquisitions net of the domain name product line divestiture are expected to add less than 1% to total growth.
Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our year-to-date performance. Slide 6 shows our year-to-date operating performance compared to the first nine months of 2009. Despite the ongoing economic factors that are constraining revenue growth, we continue to drive strong profit and cash flow performance. Gross profit increased 9% to $1.4 billion, yielding a 220 basis point improvement in gross margin for the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same prior-year period. These results are supported by continued benefits from North American productivity initiatives, solid international operating performance and higher recycled paper prices.
Gross profit gains are sustainable and position us well for flow-through benefits for higher growth when the economic conditions improve. Adjusted OIBDA grew 11% for the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Strong gross margin gains, controlled overhead spending and lower incentive compensation expense, which added about four points to growth, drove the increase. Solid underlying operating performance and lower interest expense drove a 24% increase in adjusted EPS compared to the first nine months of 2009. Disciplined capital spending combined with strong operating profit gains drove a 12% increase in year-to-date free cash flow compared to the same prior year period.
Let's move now to Slide 7 for a year-to-date review from a segment perspective. Slide 7 shows key metrics for each of our four segments compared to the first nine months of 2009. The strength of our business portfolio is enabling strong sustainable financial performance. Our year-to-date results reflect solid gains in our North America and International Physical business segments. North America, our largest segment, continues to post solid revenue growth while driving higher profits and strong cash flows. As highlighted at Investor Day, we're capitalizing on our leadership in this segment to expand our services and drive the strong returns that flow from our recurring revenue model. 
Our International segment is delivering solid revenue gains supported by strong growth in the expansion markets. Select cost accrual impacts have lowered International segment adjusted OIBDA by about $8 million year-to-date. Excluding these effects, the segment is driving solid comparable margin gains and strong profit growth. These gains reflect benefits from driving operational excellence initiatives in the developed markets and from building scale across our business. Continued benefits in these areas are expected to be a key contributor to our overall profit performance going forward. 
In our Digital business, we continue to work through economic impacts that have pressured this business in recent quarters. As Bob will discuss in more detail, we're actively advancing efforts to better integrate our Digital services into Iron Mountain, to accelerate growth and cost efficiencies. As noted earlier, we proactively reassessed the value of our Digital goodwill in Q3. This resulted in a $255 million impairment related to our worldwide Digital segment and a $1.24 reduction of reported EPS. This impairment reflects a combination of factors including recent economic pressures on the Digital business and specific recent challenges related to our eDiscovery business.
At a higher level, it's taking longer than originally anticipated to build this business towards higher scale and profitability. We're taking proactive steps to improve performance in Digital, including changing leadership, integrating sales efforts to drive our growth and integrating elements of support operations to drive cost efficiencies. Digital services are an important part of our integrated value proposition and our long-term potential. We'll continue advancing positive steps to strengthen our sales performance and returns in this business.
Let's turn to Slide 8 for a more detailed look at our capital spending and free cash flow. Slide 8 summarizes our capital spending and our free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. We continue to drive strong cash flow performance through a disciplined approach. Total capital spending was up $174 million for the first nine months of 2010, including $7 million for real estate. We remain focused on driving efficiencies in our capital spending while supporting key growth initiatives and projects that help drive long-term return improvement. 
As a result of higher operating profits and lower capital expenditures, free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate was $260 million for the first nine months of the year, a 12% increase over the same prior-year period. We remain solidly on track for record performance in both capital efficiency and free cash flow. For 2010, we're increasing our expectations for free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate to approximately $350 million to $380 million. This reflects a strong year-to-date performance, expected benefits from recently enacted U.S. tax legislation, and updated projections for capital spending in the $270 million range. 
Our strong operating cash flow allows us to invest towards long-term growth in our business while also supporting shareholder payouts. In the third quarter, we acquired 1.8 million shares of our stock for approximately $40 million. As of September 30, we have acquired 4 million shares for approximately $95 million year-to-date. As we announced at Investor Day earlier this month, our Board recently approved a $200 million increase to our existing share repurchase program. This authorization is in addition to the $150 million authorization announced earlier this year, which as of September 30 had approximately $55 million remaining. This leaves us a balance of $255 million for additional share repurchases.
Let's now turn to Slide 9 for a review of our key debt statistics. Our strong financial performance and focus on cash management continues to strengthen our balance sheet. Our debt portfolio at September 30, 2010, remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate is 6.9%, and we're 87% fixed. Maturity is 7.1 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. Our consolidated leverage ratio decreased to 3.0x. Currently, our consolidated leverage ratio is at the low end of what we feel is a very manageable 3x to 4x leverage level for our company. 
During the quarter, we used excess cash to fund a $200 million partial redemption of our 7 3/4% senior subordinated notes due in 2015. This transaction reduces our annual interest expense by about $16 million. We're also well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. Liquidity is more than $945 million, with $184 million in cash and $762 million in additional borrowing capacity as of quarter end. This concludes our review of the Q3 2010 results. 
While the digital asset impairment impacted our reported profit results, our underlying operating profit and cash flow performance remains strong commercial, reflecting our disciplined management approach and strong business foundation. 
Let's now to turn to Slide 10 to discuss our financial outlook. Slide 10 summarizes our full year 2010 and Q4 guidance. We remain on track for strong financial performance this year. For 2010, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $3,120,000,000 to $3,140,000,000, at the lower end of our guidance range. This represents reported revenue growth of about 4% including internal revenue growth of between 2% and 3%, and 1% to 1.5% of combined acquisition growth and FX benefit. We're increasing our profit outlook reflecting productivity gains, controlled spending and benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals. We expect adjusted OIBDA of $940 million to $955 million up 8% to 10% versus prior year. Adjusted EPS is now projected in the $1.12 to $1.16 range or growth of 14% to 19%. 
As noted, we're increasing our free cash flow outlook to $350 million to $380 million, reflecting the flow-through of strong operating performance, expected benefits from recent tax legislation and projections for capital expenditures of about $270 million for the year. The capital outlook includes about $15 million for real estate. As noted earlier, the digital asset impairment has no impact on revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS or free cash flow. For Q4, we're projecting revenue of $780 million to $800 million and adjusted OIBDA in the $233 million to $248 million range. 
Thanks, and now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob."

The third quarter was another quarter of solid operating performance for Iron Mountain as we benefited from our strong business foundation, combined with our commitment to operational excellence and global service expansion. I'll discuss this more fully later in my remarks, but I want you to know that we're taking proactive steps to address the challenges currently facing our Digital business and get it back on track. This ongoing review has resulted in a $255 million impairment charge that Brian described in his comments.
First, I will briefly review our current business performance and talk about what we're doing to continue delivering solid financial results. I also want to reinforce the key messages delivered at our recent Investor Day held earlier in the month, specifically, that we have a strong sustainable business foundation, that we continue to deliver excellent financial performance and improved returns, that we're focused on improving our growth trajectory to targeted strategies and that we intend to create long-term value as a leading information management services company.
Let's first discuss our Q3 results and current business trends. As we discussed at Investor Day, we continue to work through the challenges of a tough economy that are moderating our revenue growth. As recently as 2008, our internal growth rate was 8%. Since that time, we've moderated to the 2% to 3% range where we are currently. Most important change in our growth rate is the decrease in core service activity levels driven by the economy. In Q3, we saw continued pressure on these core service activities, reflecting impacts from high unemployment, excess office space and generally lower levels of spending. We've also seen moderating in storage revenue growth. Trends have been stabilizing on this front, and in Q3, Records Management volumes globally were up about 1%. This is down slightly from Q2 growth as a solid international growth and momentum in new sales were offset by sustained higher North American destruction and withdrawal levels. As expected, we've also seen some moderation in average net price gains in our North American Records Management business, from the 3% range to the 2% range, reflecting business mix impact and effects from currently low inflation.
In other areas such as state balding, we've seen impact from episodic customer reductions and container storage, which constrained gains in the quarter. Again, we see these impact as primarily economic in nature, and our current outlook incorporates our expectation for the continued effects from these type of factors until we see a clearer sign of improvement in economic conditions. 
Despite these impacts, we're driving positive revenue gains, and we continue to advance our long-term growth agenda. International growth remains solid with sustained 6% growth in Storage revenues and strong performance in the expansion markets. For example, in Spain, we managed active medical records at hospital groups [indiscernible]  and expand our services to other hospitals in that group during 2011. In Germany, we added Santander Bank to our listed new Records Management customers. And in the Czech Republic, we've added recurring storage and service revenues at OBI.
We continue to drive new sales initiatives to strengthen our North American core volume growth. During the quarter at Target, we added secure shredding to the hard copy and tape vaulting services we've been providing to them for the past decade. At Exelon, we've added records management data protection and secure shredding to an existing vital records program. And at Chan Hospital [ph], we added release of information, shredding services and special project work to their existing Records Management program. And as I mentioned at Investor Day, we added FedEx as a new customer where we've really been deploying a comprehensive shredding solution to 1,800 retail locations in one month's time.
We also continue to build momentum in our hybrid services, with double-digit gains that help support strong complementary service revenue growth during the quarter. In just a couple weeks' time, we closed a $500,000 litigation support project with a leading sports retailer, and as in most hybrid projects, this will likely lead to additional work. We're also making progress in developing technology services as part of an integrated value proposition. Under Harry Ebbighausen's leadership, we're advancing tighter integration of our Digital services into Iron Mountain's core operations to accelerate revenue growth and capture cost efficiencies. While areas such as eDiscovery remain constrained by legal cost pressures, we continue to make solid progress expanding our industry-leading PC backup and e-mail archival solutions.
During the quarter, we closed a substantial PC backup and e-mail archiving management deal with Varian Semiconductor and several deals closed with our Mimosa acquisition as a result of an integrated value proposition, including sales with Select Medical, Yuri Insurance [ph] and Sears. We're also refining our product strategy by divesting nonstrategic offerings such as our Data Domain business, which we sold during the quarter. 
As I noted at Investor Day, our Digital business is facing some important challenges and has been impacted recently by execution that's below our high standards, a tough economy, and shortfalls in the eDiscovery business, significant shortfalls. We're being proactive to address these challenges in our Digital business. I've made significant leadership changes, we're strengthening the points of integration with our core business, and we're more sharply focused on advancing the growth of our industry-leading services through our enterprise sales force.
Now as part of this ongoing review, we look closely at the carrying value of the business and determined that a reduced value is more appropriate under the current circumstance. This resulted in the $255 million impairment charge that Brian described. I want you to know that technology services remain an important part of an integrated value proposition at Iron Mountain, and I want you to remember that we have leading businesses in PC backup, in intellectual property management, in e-mail archiving, and that we're taking steps to improve our execution in this business and get it back towards higher growth and profitability.
So while we aggressively meet these challenges, we're faced with and we meet them head-on, we also continued to deliver strong financial results, driven by our focus on operational excellence and global service expansion. We continue to drive higher profits and improved capital efficiency, and this has led to significant increases in our free cash flow and a strength in balance sheet.
So let me sum up Q3. We continue to deliver solid positive revenue gains. We translated these gains into strong profit and cash results that are keeping us on track towards strong full year operating performance. And we're confident in our ability to address these opportunities that are within our control while we deliver strong profitability and cash flow performance. As we work through the immediate-term environment, we remain highly energized by the tremendous potential for Iron Mountain over the long term as we pursue the strategy I outlined for you at Investor Day.
As we discussed at Investor Day, our primary goal is to bridge towards higher revenue growth by pursuing three areas: First, strengthening our go-to-market effectiveness where we're taking a very targeted, low-risk approach to improving our sales capability. Second, through international expansion, where the international markets are inherently attractive to us as a selling platform and where we have a proven approach. And third, through the expansion of new services in both the digital and hybrid markets, we're leveraging the power of Iron Mountain to capture significant long-term growth opportunities in large, fast-growing markets. 
So it's go-to-market, international expansion and the development of new services. That's our agenda, and we'll pursue this agenda within the context of delivering strong financial performance and improved returns as we continue to focus on operational excellence. We're on track towards delivering 8% to 10% adjusted OIBDA growth and record cash flows in 2010. This builds on the strong record of performance we've achieved over the past four years. It reflects the strength of our underlying business and the capability and discipline of our team. We look forward to reporting on our continued process in developing the potential and power of Iron Mountain. 
Thanks. Now we'd like to take your questions."

Customers are just not willing to pay what they were paying for their law firms. The law firms are not willing to incur the cost associated with eDiscovery, and they're trying to drive down the size of the matter. Our cost to serve remains high even though the size of the matter is lower. So what you should hear from that is that our -- a goal of ours is to drive down the cost of offering that service, and that's something we're getting on."

For our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2010 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide or our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements.
As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before discretionary acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently, and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website as well as in today's press release. 
With that, I'd like to introduce our CFO, Brian McKeon.

Slide 3 highlights the key messages from today's review. We continue to drive strong financial performance in the third quarter.

We continue to drive strong financial performance in the third quarter. Reported revenue growth for the quarter of 2% was in line with our outlook. Results were supported by solid gains in our International Physical segment, strong growth in hybrid services and benefits from higher recycled paper prices.
Revenue growth continues to be constrained by economic factors, which contributed to very soft core service activity this summer. Adjusted OIBDA came in above the high end of our guidance range, driven by continued benefits from productivity initiatives and lower incentive compensation accruals.  Adjusted OIBDA increased 13% in Q3 and 11% year-to-date versus the prior year. Adjustments to incentive compensation accruals added about five points of growth in Q3 and four points of growth on a year-to-date basis.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.35 per share, an increase of 39% compared to the same period last year. Our reported EPS was a loss of $0.76 per share, including a $1.24 per share after-tax charge for the Digital goodwill impairment.
As we proactively advance changes to improve performance in our Digital business, we evaluated our Digital business carrying value, resulting in a $255 million estimated goodwill impairment charge. We'll finalize the amount in the fourth quarter and record any adjustment if necessary at that time. It's important to note that this charge does not impact revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS or free cash flow. Both Bob and I will discuss this more fully later in our remarks.
Also included in reported EPS were benefits for the impacts on Other Income and our effective tax rate related to the weakening of the U.S. dollar within the quarter and the gain on the sale of our domain name management product line.
For the full year, we're raising our adjusted OIBDA outlook reflecting the strong year-to-date performance and benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals. We're also raising our full year cash flow outlook to reflect lower capital spending projections and expected benefits from recently enacted U.S. tax legislation. We're refining our revenue outlook as well to incorporate current internal growth trends and foreign currency exchange rates.
Let's now turn to Slide 4 and begin our review of the third quarter results. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the third quarter of 2009. Q3 was another solid quarter of financial performance. Enterprise revenue growth was 2%, in line with our outlook with overall gains constrained by continued softness in core service activity. Continued strong profit performance was supported gross margin gains and benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals. From a segment perspective, North American Physical posted 2% internal growth supported by strong complementary service revenue performance, including benefits from higher paper pricing and hybrid service revenues.
Storage internal growth was 1% in Q3. North American records management volume growth moderated as continued higher outgoing volumes offset new sales gains. As expected, there was some moderation in average net price gains, which are now trending in the 2% range for Records Management, due in part to lower CPI levels. Episodic destructions in our Physical Data Protection business constrained growth in that service line and also contributed to lower storage revenue growth. Core service revenues declined this summer, consistent with overall soft economic conditions. 
Our International Physical segment generated 5% internal growth. Storage internal growth was a solid 6%, supported by strong performance in the expansion markets. Reported revenues for this segment were 3%, including the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate changes.
In our Digital segment, reported revenue declined 1% in the third quarter as gains in backup and archiving services were offset by the divestiture of our domain name management product line and continued pressure on eDiscovery revenues. We expect continued pressure on Digital revenue growth in the near term as we work through comparisons to stronger prior year growth in areas such as eDiscovery. 
We continue to translate moderate overall revenue growth into strong gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 6% versus the prior year, yielding a 220 basis points margin improvement. Higher storage gross margins, particularly in the International segment are supporting these gains. Continued benefits from productivity initiatives drove higher service margins, which were also a key contributor to our improved performance.
Adjusted OIBDA grew 13% to $254 million. This increase was driven by gross profit gains, controlled SG&A spending and lower incentive compensation expense, which added about five points of growth in the quarter. These gains were partially offset by Mimosa integration costs and targeted investments in growth initiatives. Below the adjusted OIBDA line, depreciation was $77 million and amortization was $10 million, in line with our forecast. Other Income for the quarter was $9 million, including a $7 million gain on the sale of our domain name management program line and a $4 million gain related to foreign currency rate changes in the quarter. These were offset by an early debt extinguishment charge of $2 million.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.35 per share, an increase of 39% compared to the prior year, reflecting strong operating performance combined with lower interest expense. Reported EPS for the second quarter was a loss of $0.76 per share, including the impact of the $255 million non-cash charge for the Digital goodwill impairment. 
The structural tax rate for the third quarter was 38%, in line with our expectations. Including the impact of discrete tax items primarily related to the impairment charge, the effective tax rate for the quarter was minus 16%. It was minimal tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment charge as the majority of goodwill associated with our Digital business is non-deductible.
Also included as discrete tax items was a reversal of worldwide tax reserves due to lapses of statue of limitation periods and settlements with taxing authorities, and the positive impact of foreign exchange rate changes in the quarter. These benefits more than offset a charge to establish a valuation allowance, reflecting recently enacted U.S. legislative changes impacting the expected utilization of foreign tax credits. We expect the structural tax rate for 2010 to be 39%.
Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange compared to our 2010 full year outlook. Total internal growth for the quarter was 2%, consistent with the prior quarter. Economic factors continue to constrain service activity levels and storage growth. Core activity correlates with employment and general economic trends and has remained soft in recent quarters. The internal growth rate for core storage revenues was 2% in the quarter. Records Management volume growth moderated slightly as continued higher outgoing volume levels in North America offset new sales gains and solid momentum in international markets. Storage revenue growth also reflected moderated average net pricing gains in North American Records Management and episodic destructions in the Physical Data Protection business. We expect Storage internal growth for 2010 to be in the 2% to 3% range.
Core revenue internal growth was 1% in the third quarter, primarily reflecting lower core service activity levels. We're planning for continued weakness in core service revenues until we see clear signs of improvement. For the full year, we expect core revenue internal growth to be in the 1% range. Solid growth in our complementary service revenues was supported by higher recycled paper prices and strong gains in hybrid service revenues. These gains were partially offset by lower eDiscovery revenues and the lapping of a large European project.
Overall, revenue growth trends remain relatively consistent. Income and volume growth is stabilizing, and we're seeing some improvement in new sales. Offsetting these trends are continued weakness in core service activities and moderated net average pricing in the North American Box business, due in part to lower CPI rates. As a result, we expect full year internal growth to be in the 2% to 3% range.
At recent exchange rates, we expect the FX impact to increase revenue growth this year by about 1%. Acquisitions net of the domain name product line divestiture are expected to add less than 1% to total growth.
Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our year-to-date performance. Slide 6 shows our year-to-date operating performance compared to the first nine months of 2009. Despite the ongoing economic factors that are constraining revenue growth, we continue to drive strong profit and cash flow performance. Gross profit increased 9% to $1.4 billion, yielding a 220 basis point improvement in gross margin for the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same prior-year period. These results are supported by continued benefits from North American productivity initiatives, solid international operating performance and higher recycled paper prices.
Gross profit gains are sustainable and position us well for flow-through benefits for higher growth when the economic conditions improve. Adjusted OIBDA grew 11% for the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Strong gross margin gains, controlled overhead spending and lower incentive compensation expense, which added about four points to growth, drove the increase. Solid underlying operating performance and lower interest expense drove a 24% increase in adjusted EPS compared to the first nine months of 2009. Disciplined capital spending combined with strong operating profit gains drove a 12% increase in year-to-date free cash flow compared to the same prior year period.
Let's move now to Slide 7 for a year-to-date review from a segment perspective. Slide 7 shows key metrics for each of our four segments compared to the first nine months of 2009. The strength of our business portfolio is enabling strong sustainable financial performance. Our year-to-date results reflect solid gains in our North America and International Physical business segments. North America, our largest segment, continues to post solid revenue growth while driving higher profits and strong cash flows. As highlighted at Investor Day, we're capitalizing on our leadership in this segment to expand our services and drive the strong returns that flow from our recurring revenue model. 
Our International segment is delivering solid revenue gains supported by strong growth in the expansion markets. Select cost accrual impacts have lowered International segment adjusted OIBDA by about $8 million year-to-date. Excluding these effects, the segment is driving solid comparable margin gains and strong profit growth. These gains reflect benefits from driving operational excellence initiatives in the developed markets and from building scale across our business. Continued benefits in these areas are expected to be a key contributor to our overall profit performance going forward. 
In our Digital business, we continue to work through economic impacts that have pressured this business in recent quarters. As Bob will discuss in more detail, we're actively advancing efforts to better integrate our Digital services into Iron Mountain, to accelerate growth and cost efficiencies. As noted earlier, we proactively reassessed the value of our Digital goodwill in Q3. This resulted in a $255 million impairment related to our worldwide Digital segment and a $1.24 reduction of reported EPS. This impairment reflects a combination of factors including recent economic pressures on the Digital business and specific recent challenges related to our eDiscovery business.
At a higher level, it's taking longer than originally anticipated to build this business towards higher scale and profitability. We're taking proactive steps to improve performance in Digital, including changing leadership, integrating sales efforts to drive our growth and integrating elements of support operations to drive cost efficiencies. Digital services are an important part of our integrated value proposition and our long-term potential. We'll continue advancing positive steps to strengthen our sales performance and returns in this business.
Let's turn to Slide 8 for a more detailed look at our capital spending and free cash flow. Slide 8 summarizes our capital spending and our free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. We continue to drive strong cash flow performance through a disciplined approach. Total capital spending was up $174 million for the first nine months of 2010, including $7 million for real estate. We remain focused on driving efficiencies in our capital spending while supporting key growth initiatives and projects that help drive long-term return improvement. 
As a result of higher operating profits and lower capital expenditures, free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate was $260 million for the first nine months of the year, a 12% increase over the same prior-year period. We remain solidly on track for record performance in both capital efficiency and free cash flow. For 2010, we're increasing our expectations for free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate to approximately $350 million to $380 million. This reflects a strong year-to-date performance, expected benefits from recently enacted U.S. tax legislation, and updated projections for capital spending in the $270 million range. 
Our strong operating cash flow allows us to invest towards long-term growth in our business while also supporting shareholder payouts. In the third quarter, we acquired 1.8 million shares of our stock for approximately $40 million. As of September 30, we have acquired 4 million shares for approximately $95 million year-to-date. As we announced at Investor Day earlier this month, our Board recently approved a $200 million increase to our existing share repurchase program. This authorization is in addition to the $150 million authorization announced earlier this year, which as of September 30 had approximately $55 million remaining. This leaves us a balance of $255 million for additional share repurchases.
Let's now turn to Slide 9 for a review of our key debt statistics. Our strong financial performance and focus on cash management continues to strengthen our balance sheet. Our debt portfolio at September 30, 2010, remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate is 6.9%, and we're 87% fixed. Maturity is 7.1 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. Our consolidated leverage ratio decreased to 3.0x. Currently, our consolidated leverage ratio is at the low end of what we feel is a very manageable 3x to 4x leverage level for our company. 
During the quarter, we used excess cash to fund a $200 million partial redemption of our 7 3/4% senior subordinated notes due in 2015. This transaction reduces our annual interest expense by about $16 million. We're also well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. Liquidity is more than $945 million, with $184 million in cash and $762 million in additional borrowing capacity as of quarter end. This concludes our review of the Q3 2010 results. 
While the digital asset impairment impacted our reported profit results, our underlying operating profit and cash flow performance remains strong commercial, reflecting our disciplined management approach and strong business foundation. 
Let's now to turn to Slide 10 to discuss our financial outlook. Slide 10 summarizes our full year 2010 and Q4 guidance. We remain on track for strong financial performance this year. For 2010, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $3,120,000,000 to $3,140,000,000, at the lower end of our guidance range. This represents reported revenue growth of about 4% including internal revenue growth of between 2% and 3%, and 1% to 1.5% of combined acquisition growth and FX benefit. We're increasing our profit outlook reflecting productivity gains, controlled spending and benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals. We expect adjusted OIBDA of $940 million to $955 million up 8% to 10% versus prior year. Adjusted EPS is now projected in the $1.12 to $1.16 range or growth of 14% to 19%. 
As noted, we're increasing our free cash flow outlook to $350 million to $380 million, reflecting the flow-through of strong operating performance, expected benefits from recent tax legislation and projections for capital expenditures of about $270 million for the year. The capital outlook includes about $15 million for real estate. As noted earlier, the digital asset impairment has no impact on revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS or free cash flow. For Q4, we're projecting revenue of $780 million to $800 million and adjusted OIBDA in the $233 million to $248 million range. 
Thanks, and now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.

The third quarter was another quarter of solid operating performance for Iron Mountain as we benefited from our strong business foundation, combined with our commitment to operational excellence and global service expansion. I'll discuss this more fully later in my remarks, but I want you to know that we're taking proactive steps to address the challenges currently facing our Digital business and get it back on track. This ongoing review has resulted in a $255 million impairment charge that Brian described in his comments.
First, I will briefly review our current business performance and talk about what we're doing to continue delivering solid financial results. I also want to reinforce the key messages delivered at our recent Investor Day held earlier in the month, specifically, that we have a strong sustainable business foundation, that we continue to deliver excellent financial performance and improved returns, that we're focused on improving our growth trajectory to targeted strategies and that we intend to create long-term value as a leading information management services company.
Let's first discuss our Q3 results and current business trends. As we discussed at Investor Day, we continue to work through the challenges of a tough economy that are moderating our revenue growth. As recently as 2008, our internal growth rate was 8%. Since that time, we've moderated to the 2% to 3% range where we are currently. Most important change in our growth rate is the decrease in core service activity levels driven by the economy. In Q3, we saw continued pressure on these core service activities, reflecting impacts from high unemployment, excess office space and generally lower levels of spending. We've also seen moderating in storage revenue growth. Trends have been stabilizing on this front, and in Q3, Records Management volumes globally were up about 1%. This is down slightly from Q2 growth as a solid international growth and momentum in new sales were offset by sustained higher North American destruction and withdrawal levels. As expected, we've also seen some moderation in average net price gains in our North American Records Management business, from the 3% range to the 2% range, reflecting business mix impact and effects from currently low inflation.
In other areas such as state balding, we've seen impact from episodic customer reductions and container storage, which constrained gains in the quarter. Again, we see these impact as primarily economic in nature, and our current outlook incorporates our expectation for the continued effects from these type of factors until we see a clearer sign of improvement in economic conditions. 
Despite these impacts, we're driving positive revenue gains, and we continue to advance our long-term growth agenda. International growth remains solid with sustained 6% growth in Storage revenues and strong performance in the expansion markets. For example, in Spain, we managed active medical records at hospital groups [indiscernible]  and expand our services to other hospitals in that group during 2011. In Germany, we added Santander Bank to our listed new Records Management customers. And in the Czech Republic, we've added recurring storage and service revenues at OBI.
We continue to drive new sales initiatives to strengthen our North American core volume growth. During the quarter at Target, we added secure shredding to the hard copy and tape vaulting services we've been providing to them for the past decade. At Exelon, we've added records management data protection and secure shredding to an existing vital records program. And at Chan Hospital [ph], we added release of information, shredding services and special project work to their existing Records Management program. And as I mentioned at Investor Day, we added FedEx as a new customer where we've really been deploying a comprehensive shredding solution to 1,800 retail locations in one month's time.
We also continue to build momentum in our hybrid services, with double-digit gains that help support strong complementary service revenue growth during the quarter. In just a couple weeks' time, we closed a $500,000 litigation support project with a leading sports retailer, and as in most hybrid projects, this will likely lead to additional work. We're also making progress in developing technology services as part of an integrated value proposition. Under Harry Ebbighausen's leadership, we're advancing tighter integration of our Digital services into Iron Mountain's core operations to accelerate revenue growth and capture cost efficiencies. While areas such as eDiscovery remain constrained by legal cost pressures, we continue to make solid progress expanding our industry-leading PC backup and e-mail archival solutions.
During the quarter, we closed a substantial PC backup and e-mail archiving management deal with Varian Semiconductor and several deals closed with our Mimosa acquisition as a result of an integrated value proposition, including sales with Select Medical, Yuri Insurance [ph] and Sears. We're also refining our product strategy by divesting nonstrategic offerings such as our Data Domain business, which we sold during the quarter. 
As I noted at Investor Day, our Digital business is facing some important challenges and has been impacted recently by execution that's below our high standards, a tough economy, and shortfalls in the eDiscovery business, significant shortfalls. We're being proactive to address these challenges in our Digital business. I've made significant leadership changes, we're strengthening the points of integration with our core business, and we're more sharply focused on advancing the growth of our industry-leading services through our enterprise sales force.
Now as part of this ongoing review, we look closely at the carrying value of the business and determined that a reduced value is more appropriate under the current circumstance. This resulted in the $255 million impairment charge that Brian described. I want you to know that technology services remain an important part of an integrated value proposition at Iron Mountain, and I want you to remember that we have leading businesses in PC backup, in intellectual property management, in e-mail archiving, and that we're taking steps to improve our execution in this business and get it back towards higher growth and profitability.
So while we aggressively meet these challenges, we're faced with and we meet them head-on, we also continued to deliver strong financial results, driven by our focus on operational excellence and global service expansion. We continue to drive higher profits and improved capital efficiency, and this has led to significant increases in our free cash flow and a strength in balance sheet.
So let me sum up Q3. We continue to deliver solid positive revenue gains. We translated these gains into strong profit and cash results that are keeping us on track towards strong full year operating performance. And we're confident in our ability to address these opportunities that are within our control while we deliver strong profitability and cash flow performance. As we work through the immediate-term environment, we remain highly energized by the tremendous potential for Iron Mountain over the long term as we pursue the strategy I outlined for you at Investor Day.
As we discussed at Investor Day, our primary goal is to bridge towards higher revenue growth by pursuing three areas: First, strengthening our go-to-market effectiveness where we're taking a very targeted, low-risk approach to improving our sales capability. Second, through international expansion, where the international markets are inherently attractive to us as a selling platform and where we have a proven approach. And third, through the expansion of new services in both the digital and hybrid markets, we're leveraging the power of Iron Mountain to capture significant long-term growth opportunities in large, fast-growing markets. 
So it's go-to-market, international expansion and the development of new services. That's our agenda, and we'll pursue this agenda within the context of delivering strong financial performance and improved returns as we continue to focus on operational excellence. We're on track towards delivering 8% to 10% adjusted OIBDA growth and record cash flows in 2010. This builds on the strong record of performance we've achieved over the past four years. It reflects the strength of our underlying business and the capability and discipline of our team. We look forward to reporting on our continued process in developing the potential and power of Iron Mountain. 
Thanks. Now we'd like to take your questions.

We've made a decision to divest a part of the business, recently the Domain Name business. And that led us to accelerate looking at the carrying values and to assess the carrying value of the goodwill. And we decided to take that step and to record the impairment this quarter, and it's part of this overall proactive effort we're taking to get the business on track.

For our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2010 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide or our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements.
As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before discretionary acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently, and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website as well as in today's press release.

Slide 3 highlights the key messages from today's review. We continue to drive strong financial performance in the third quarter. Reported revenue growth for the quarter of 2% was in line with our outlook. Resul",2699,"Thanks, Stephen. And good morning, everyone. Slide 3 highlights the key messages from today's review. We continue to drive strong financial performance in the third quarter. Reported revenue growth for the quarter of 2% was in line with our outlook. Results were supported by solid gains in our International Physical segment, strong growth in hybrid services and benefits from higher recycled paper prices.
Revenue growth continues to be constrained by economic factors, which contributed to very soft core service activity this summer. Adjusted OIBDA came in above the high end of our guidance range, driven by continued benefits from productivity initiatives and lower incentive compensation accruals.  Adjusted OIBDA increased 13% in Q3 and 11% year-to-date versus the prior year. Adjustments to incentive compensation accruals added about five points of growth in Q3 and four points of growth on a year-to-date basis.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.35 per share, an increase of 39% compared to the same period last year. Our reported EPS was a loss of $0.76 per share, including a $1.24 per share after-tax charge for the Digital goodwill impairment.
As we proactively advance changes to improve performance in our Digital business, we evaluated our Digital business carrying value, resulting in a $255 million estimated goodwill impairment charge. We'll finalize the amount in the fourth quarter and record any adjustment if necessary at that time. It's important to note that this charge does not impact revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS or free cash flow. Both Bob and I will discuss this more fully later in our remarks.
Also included in reported EPS were benefits for the impacts on Other Income and our effective tax rate related to the weakening of the U.S. dollar within the quarter and the gain on the sale of our domain name management product line.
For the full year, we're raising our adjusted OIBDA outlook reflecting the strong year-to-date performance and benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals. We're also raising our full year cash flow outlook to reflect lower capital spending projections and expected benefits from recently enacted U.S. tax legislation. We're refining our revenue outlook as well to incorporate current internal growth trends and foreign currency exchange rates.
Let's now turn to Slide 4 and begin our review of the third quarter results. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the third quarter of 2009. Q3 was another solid quarter of financial performance. Enterprise revenue growth was 2%, in line with our outlook with overall gains constrained by continued softness in core service activity. Continued strong profit performance was supported by gross margin gains and benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals. From a segment perspective, North American Physical posted 2% internal growth supported by strong complementary service revenue performance, including benefits from higher paper pricing and hybrid service revenues.
Storage internal growth was 1% in Q3. North American records management volume growth moderated as continued higher outgoing volumes offset new sales gains. As expected, there was some moderation in average net price gains, which are now trending in the 2% range for Records Management, due in part to lower CPI levels. Episodic destructions in our Physical Data Protection business constrained growth in that service line and also contributed to lower storage revenue growth. Core service revenues declined this summer, consistent with overall soft economic conditions. 
Our International Physical segment generated 5% internal growth. Storage internal growth was a solid 6%, supported by strong performance in the expansion markets. Reported revenues for this segment were 3%, including the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate changes.
In our Digital segment, reported revenue declined 1% in the third quarter as gains in backup and archiving services were offset by the divestiture of our domain name management product line and continued pressure on eDiscovery revenues. We expect continued pressure on Digital revenue growth in the near term as we work through comparisons to stronger prior year growth in areas such as eDiscovery. 
We continue to translate moderate overall revenue growth into strong gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 6% versus the prior year, yielding a 220 basis points margin improvement. Higher storage gross margins, particularly in the International segment are supporting these gains. Continued benefits from productivity initiatives drove higher service margins, which were also a key contributor to our improved performance.
Adjusted OIBDA grew 13% to $254 million. This increase was driven by gross profit gains, controlled SG&A spending and lower incentive compensation expense, which added about five points of growth in the quarter. These gains were partially offset by Mimosa integration costs and targeted investments in growth initiatives. Below the adjusted OIBDA line, depreciation was $77 million and amortization was $10 million, in line with our forecast. Other Income for the quarter was $9 million, including a $7 million gain on the sale of our domain name management program line and a $4 million gain related to foreign currency rate changes in the quarter. These were offset by an early debt extinguishment charge of $2 million.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.35 per share, an increase of 39% compared to the prior year, reflecting strong operating performance combined with lower interest expense. Reported EPS for the second quarter was a loss of $0.76 per share, including the impact of the $255 million non-cash charge for the Digital goodwill impairment. 
The structural tax rate for the third quarter was 38%, in line with our expectations. Including the impact of discrete tax items primarily related to the impairment charge, the effective tax rate for the quarter was minus 16%. It was minimal tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment charge as the majority of goodwill associated with our Digital business is non-deductible.
Also included as discrete tax items was the reversal of worldwide tax reserves due to lapses of statute of limitation periods and settlements with taxing authorities, and the positive impact of foreign exchange rate changes in the quarter. These benefits more than offset a charge to establish a valuation allowance, reflecting recently enacted U.S. legislative changes impacting the expected utilization of foreign tax credits. We expect the structural tax rate for 2010 to be 39%.
Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange compared to our 2010 full year outlook. Total internal growth for the quarter was 2%, consistent with the prior quarter. Economic factors continue to constrain service activity levels and storage growth. Core activity correlates with employment and general economic trends and has remained soft in recent quarters. The internal growth rate for core storage revenues was 2% in the quarter. Records Management volume growth moderated slightly as continued higher outgoing volume levels in North America offset new sales gains and solid momentum in international markets. Storage revenue growth also reflected moderated average net pricing gains in North American Records Management and episodic destructions in the Physical Data Protection business. We expect Storage internal growth for 2010 to be in the 2% to 3% range.
Core revenue internal growth was 1% in the third quarter, primarily reflecting lower core service activity levels. We're planning for continued weakness in core service revenues until we see clear signs of improvement. For the full year, we expect core revenue internal growth to be in the 1% range. Solid growth in our complementary service revenues was supported by higher recycled paper prices and strong gains in hybrid service revenues. These gains were partially offset by lower eDiscovery revenues and the lapping of a large European project.
Overall, revenue growth trends remain relatively consistent. Income and volume growth is stabilizing, and we're seeing some improvement in new sales. Offsetting these trends are continued weakness in core service activities and moderated net average pricing in the North American Box business, due in part to lower CPI rates. As a result, we expect full year internal growth to be in the 2% to 3% range.
At recent exchange rates, we expect the FX impact to increase revenue growth this year by about 1%. Acquisitions net of the domain name product line divestiture are expected to add less than 1% to total growth.
Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our year-to-date performance. Slide 6 shows our year-to-date operating performance compared to the first nine months of 2009. Despite the ongoing economic factors that are constraining revenue growth, we continue to drive strong profit and cash flow performance. Gross profit increased 9% to $1.4 billion, yielding a 220 basis point improvement in gross margin for the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same prior-year period. These results are supported by continued benefits from North American productivity initiatives, solid international operating performance and higher recycled paper prices.
Gross profit gains are sustainable and position us well for flow-through benefits for higher growth when the economic conditions improve. Adjusted OIBDA grew 11% for the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Strong gross margin gains, controlled overhead spending and lower incentive compensation expense, which added about four points to growth, drove the increase. Solid underlying operating performance and lower interest expense drove a 24% increase in adjusted EPS compared to the first nine months of 2009. Disciplined capital spending combined with strong operating profit gains drove a 12% increase in year-to-date free cash flow compared to the same prior year period.
Let's move now to Slide 7 for a year-to-date review from a segment perspective. Slide 7 shows key metrics for each of our four segments compared to the first nine months of 2009. The strength of our business portfolio is enabling strong sustainable financial performance. Our year-to-date results reflect solid gains in our North America and International Physical business segments. North America, our largest segment, continues to post solid revenue growth while driving higher profits and strong cash flows. As highlighted at Investor Day, we're capitalizing on our leadership in this segment to expand our services and drive the strong returns that flow from our recurring revenue model. 
Our International segment is delivering solid revenue gains supported by strong growth in the expansion markets. Select cost accrual impacts have lowered International segment adjusted OIBDA by about $8 million year-to-date. Excluding these effects, the segment is driving solid comparable margin gains and strong profit growth. These gains reflect benefits from driving operational excellence initiatives in the developed markets and from building scale across our business. Continued benefits in these areas are expected to be a key contributor to our overall profit performance going forward. 
In our Digital business, we continue to work through economic impacts that have pressured this business in recent quarters. As Bob will discuss in more detail, we're actively advancing efforts to better integrate our Digital services into Iron Mountain, to accelerate growth and cost efficiencies. As noted earlier, we proactively reassessed the value of our Digital goodwill in Q3. This resulted in a $255 million impairment related to our worldwide Digital segment and a $1.24 reduction of reported EPS. This impairment reflects a combination of factors including recent economic pressures on the Digital business and specific recent challenges related to our eDiscovery business.
At a higher level, it's taking longer than originally anticipated to build this business towards higher scale and profitability. We're taking proactive steps to improve performance in Digital, including changing leadership, integrating sales efforts to drive higher growth and integrating elements of support operations to drive cost efficiencies. Digital services are an important part of our integrated value proposition and our long-term potential. We'll continue advancing positive steps to strengthen our sales performance and returns in this business.
Let's turn to Slide 8 for a more detailed look at our capital spending and free cash flow. Slide 8 summarizes our capital spending and our free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. We continue to drive strong cash flow performance through a disciplined approach. Total capital spending was up $174 million for the first nine months of 2010, including $7 million for real estate. We remain focused on driving efficiencies in our capital spending while supporting key growth initiatives and projects that help drive long-term return improvement. 
As a result of higher operating profits and lower capital expenditures, free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate was $260 million for the first nine months of the year, a 12% increase over the same prior-year period. We remain solidly on track for record performance in both capital efficiency and free cash flow. For 2010, we're increasing our expectations for free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate to approximately $350 million to $380 million. This reflects a strong year-to-date performance, expected benefits from recently enacted U.S. tax legislation, and updated projections for capital spending in the $270 million range. 
Our strong operating cash flow allows us to invest towards long-term growth in our business while also supporting shareholder payouts. In the third quarter, we acquired 1.8 million shares of our stock for approximately $40 million. As of September 30, we have acquired 4 million shares for approximately $95 million year-to-date. As we announced at Investor Day earlier this month, our Board recently approved a $200 million increase to our existing share repurchase program. This authorization is in addition to the $150 million authorization announced earlier this year, which as of September 30 had approximately $55 million remaining. This leaves us a balance of $255 million for additional share repurchases.
Let's now turn to Slide 9 for a review of our key debt statistics. Our strong financial performance and focus on cash management continues to strengthen our balance sheet. Our debt portfolio at September 30, 2010, remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate is 6.9%, and we're 87% fixed. Maturity is 7.1 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. Our consolidated leverage ratio decreased to 3.0x. Currently, our consolidated leverage ratio is at the low end of what we feel is a very manageable 3x to 4x leverage level for our company. 
During the quarter, we used excess cash to fund a $200 million partial redemption of our 7 3/4% senior subordinated notes due in 2015. This transaction reduces our annual interest expense by about $16 million. We're also well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. Liquidity is more than $945 million, with $184 million in cash and $762 million in additional borrowing capacity as of quarter end. This concludes our review of the Q3 2010 results. 
While the digital asset impairment impacted our reported profit results, our underlying operating profit and cash flow performance remains strong, reflecting our disciplined management approach and strong business foundation. 
Let's now to turn to Slide 10 to discuss our financial outlook. Slide 10 summarizes our full year 2010 and Q4 guidance. We remain on track for strong financial performance this year. For 2010, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $3,120,000,000 to $3,140,000,000, at the lower end of our guidance range. This represents reported revenue growth of about 4% including internal revenue growth of between 2% and 3%, and 1% to 1.5% of combined acquisition growth and FX benefit. We're increasing our profit outlook reflecting productivity gains, controlled spending and benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals. We expect adjusted OIBDA of $940 million to $955 million, up 8% to 10% versus prior year. Adjusted EPS is now projected in the $1.12 to $1.16 range or growth of 14% to 19%. 
As noted, we're increasing our free cash flow outlook to $350 million to $380 million, reflecting the flow-through of strong operating performance, expected benefits from recent tax legislation and projections for capital expenditures of about $270 million for the year. The capital outlook includes about $15 million for real estate. As noted earlier, the digital asset impairment has no impact on revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS or free cash flow. For Q4, we're projecting revenue of $780 million to $800 million and adjusted OIBDA in the $233 million to $248 million range. 
Thanks, and now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob."

And good morning, everyone. The third quarter was another quarter of solid operating performance for Iron Mountain as we benefited from our strong business foundation, combined with our commitment to operational excellence and global service expansion. I'll discuss this more fully later in my remarks, but I want you to know that we're taking proactive steps to address the challenges currently facing our Digital business and get it back on track. This ongoing review has resulted in a $255 million impairment charge that Brian described in his comments.
First, I will briefly review our current business performance and talk about what we're doing to continue delivering solid financial results. I also want to reinforce the key messages delivered at our recent Investor Day held earlier in the month, specifically: That we have a strong sustainable business foundation; that we continue to deliver excellent financial performance and improved returns; that we're focused on improving our growth trajectory to targeted strategies; and that we intend to create long-term value as a leading information management services company.
Let's first discuss our Q3 results and current business trends. As we discussed at Investor Day, we continue to work through the challenges of a tough economy that are moderating our revenue growth. As recently as 2008, our internal growth rate was 8%. Since that time, we've moderated to the 2% to 3% range where we are currently. Most important change in our growth rate is the decrease in core service activity levels driven by the economy. In Q3, we saw continued pressure on these core service activities, reflecting impacts from high unemployment, excess office space and generally lower levels of spending. We've also seen moderation in storage revenue growth. Trends have been stabilizing on this front, and in Q3, Records Management volumes globally were up about 1%. This is down slightly from Q2 growth as a solid international growth and momentum in new sales were offset by sustained higher North American destruction and withdrawal levels. As expected, we've also seen some moderation in average net price gains in our North American Records Management business, from the 3% range to the 2% range, reflecting business mix impacts and effects from currently low inflation.
In other areas such as tape vaulting, we've seen impacts from episodic customer reductions and container storage, which constrained gains in the quarter. Again, we see these impacts as primarily economic in nature, and our current outlook incorporates our expectation for the continued effects from these types of factors until we see a clearer sign of improvement in economic conditions. 
Despite these impacts, we're driving positive revenue gains, and we continue to advance our long-term growth agenda. International growth remains solid with sustained 6% growth in Storage revenues and strong performance in the expansion markets. For example, in Spain, we managed active medical records at hospital groups [indiscernible] and extend our services to other hospitals in that group during 2011. In Germany, we added Santander Bank to our listed new Records Management customers. And in the Czech Republic, we've added recurring storage and service revenues at OBI.
We continue to drive new sales initiatives to strengthen our North American core volume growth. During the quarter at Target, we added secure shredding to the hard copy and tape vaulting services we've been providing to them for the past decade. At Exelon, we've added records management data protection and secure shredding to an existing vital records program. And at Chan Hospital [ph], we added release of information, shredding services and special project work to their existing Records Management program. And as I mentioned at Investor Day, we added FedEx as a new customer where we've really been deploying a comprehensive shredding solution to 1,800 retail locations in one month's time.
We also continue to build momentum in our hybrid services, with double-digit gains that help support strong complementary service revenue growth during the quarter. In just a couple weeks' time, we closed a $500,000 litigation support project with a leading sports retailer, and as in most hybrid projects, this will likely lead to additional work. We're also making progress in developing technology services as part of an integrated value proposition. Under Harry Ebbighausen's leadership, we're advancing tighter integration of our Digital services into Iron Mountain's core operations to accelerate revenue growth and capture cost efficiencies. While areas such as eDiscovery remain constrained by legal cost pressures, we continue to make solid progress expanding our industry-leading PC backup and email archival solutions.
During the quarter, we closed a substantial PC backup and email archiving management deal with Varian Semiconductor and several deals closed with our Mimosa acquisition as a result of an integrated value proposition, including sales with Select Medical, Yuri Insurance [ph] and Sears. We're also refining our product strategy by divesting nonstrategic offerings such as our Data Domain business, which we sold during the quarter. 
As I noted at Investor Day, our Digital business is facing some important challenges and has been impacted recently by execution that's below our high standards, a tough economy, and shortfalls in the eDiscovery business, significant shortfalls. We're being proactive to address these challenges in our Digital business. I've made significant leadership changes, we're strengthening the points of integration with our core business, and we're more sharply focused on advancing the growth of our industry-leading services through our enterprise sales force.
Now as part of this ongoing review, we look closely at the carrying value of the business and determined that a reduced value is more appropriate under the current circumstance. This resulted in the $255 million impairment charge that Brian described. I want you to know that technology services remain an important part of an integrated value proposition at Iron Mountain. And I want you to remember that we have leading businesses in PC backup, in intellectual property management, in email archiving, and that we're taking steps to improve our execution in this business and get it back towards higher growth and profitability.
So while we aggressively meet these challenges, we're faced with and we meet them head-on, we also continued to deliver strong financial results, driven by our focus on operational excellence and global service expansion. We continue to drive higher profits and improve capital efficiency, and this has led to significant increases in our free cash flow and a strengthened balance sheet.
So let me sum up Q3. We continue to deliver solid positive revenue gains. We translated these gains into strong profit and cash results that are keeping us on track towards strong full year operating performance. And we're confident in our ability to address these opportunities that are within our control while we deliver strong profitability and cash flow performance. As we work through the immediate-term environment, we remain highly energized by the tremendous potential for Iron Mountain over the long term as we pursue the strategy I outlined for you at Investor Day.
As we discussed at Investor Day, our primary goal is to bridge towards higher revenue growth by pursuing three areas: First, strengthening our go-to-market effectiveness where we're taking a very targeted, low-risk approach to improving our sales capability; second, through international expansion, where the international markets are inherently attractive to us as a selling platform and where we have a proven approach; and third, through the expansion of new services in both the digital and hybrid markets, we're leveraging the power of Iron Mountain to capture significant long-term growth opportunities in large, fast-growing markets. 
So it's go-to-market, international expansion and the development of new services. That's our agenda, and we'll pursue this agenda within the context of delivering strong financial performance and improved returns as we continue to focus on operational excellence. We're on track towards delivering 8% to 10% adjusted OIBDA growth and record cash flows in 2010. This builds on the strong record of performance we've achieved over the past four years. It reflects the strength of our underlying business and the capability and discipline of our team. We look forward to reporting on our continued process in developing the potential and power of Iron Mountain. 
Thanks. Now we'd like to take your questions."

 For our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2. Today's earnings call and slide presentation will contain a number of forward-looking statements, most notably our outlook for our 2010 financial performance. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to today's press release, the Safe Harbor language on this slide or our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the major risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contemplated in our forward-looking statements.
 As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before discretionary acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently, and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website as well as in today's press release.
 With that, I'd like to introduce our CFO, Brian McKeon.

Slide 3 highlights the key messages from today's review. We continue to drive strong financial performance in the third quarter.

We continue to drive strong financial performance in the third quarter. Reported revenue growth for the quarter of 2% was in line with our outlook. Results were supported by solid gains in our International Physical segment, strong growth in hybrid services and benefits from higher recycled paper prices.
 Revenue growth continues to be constrained by economic factors, which contributed to very soft core service activity this summer. Adjusted OIBDA came in above the high end of our guidance range, driven by continued benefits from productivity initiatives and lower incentive compensation accruals.  Adjusted OIBDA increased 13% in Q3 and 11% year-to-date versus the prior year. Adjustments to incentive compensation accruals added about five points of growth in Q3 and four points of growth on a year-to-date basis.
 Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.35 per share, an increase of 39% compared to the same period last year. Our reported EPS was a loss of $0.76 per share, including a $1.24 per share after-tax charge for the Digital goodwill impairment.
 As we proactively advance changes to improve performance in our Digital business, we evaluated our Digital business carrying value, resulting in a $255 million estimated goodwill impairment charge. We'll finalize the amount in the fourth quarter and record any adjustment if necessary at that time. It's important to note that this charge does not impact revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS or free cash flow. Both Bob and I will discuss this more fully later in our remarks.
 Also included in reported EPS were benefits for the impacts on Other Income and our effective tax rate related to the weakening of the U.S. dollar within the quarter and the gain on the sale of our domain name management product line.
 For the full year, we're raising our adjusted OIBDA outlook reflecting the strong year-to-date performance and benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals. We're also raising our full year cash flow outlook to reflect lower capital spending projections and expected benefits from recently enacted U.S. tax legislation. We're refining our revenue outlook as well to incorporate current internal growth trends and foreign currency exchange rates.
 Let's now turn to Slide 4 and begin our review of the third quarter results. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the third quarter of 2009. Q3 was another solid quarter of financial performance. Enterprise revenue growth was 2%, in line with our outlook with overall gains constrained by continued softness in core service activity. Continued strong profit performance was supported gross margin gains and benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals. From a segment perspective, North American Physical posted 2% internal growth supported by strong complementary service revenue performance, including benefits from higher paper pricing and hybrid service revenues.
 Storage internal growth was 1% in Q3. North American records management volume growth moderated as continued higher outgoing volumes offset new sales gains. As expected, there was some moderation in average net price gains, which are now trending in the 2% range for Records Management, due in part to lower CPI levels. Episodic destructions in our Physical Data Protection business constrained growth in that service line and also contributed to lower storage revenue growth. Core service revenues declined this summer, consistent with overall soft economic conditions.
 Our International Physical segment generated 5% internal growth. Storage internal growth was a solid 6%, supported by strong performance in the expansion markets. Reported revenues for this segment were 3%, including the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate changes.
 In our Digital segment, reported revenue declined 1% in the third quarter as gains in backup and archiving services were offset by the divestiture of our domain name management product line and continued pressure on eDiscovery revenues. We expect continued pressure on Digital revenue growth in the near term as we work through comparisons to stronger prior year growth in areas such as eDiscovery.
 We continue to translate moderate overall revenue growth into strong gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 6% versus the prior year, yielding a 220 basis points margin improvement. Higher storage gross margins, particularly in the International segment are supporting these gains. Continued benefits from productivity initiatives drove higher service margins, which were also a key contributor to our improved performance.
 Adjusted OIBDA grew 13% to $254 million. This increase was driven by gross profit gains, controlled SG&A spending and lower incentive compensation expense, which added about five points of growth in the quarter. These gains were partially offset by Mimosa integration costs and targeted investments in growth initiatives. Below the adjusted OIBDA line, depreciation was $77 million and amortization was $10 million, in line with our forecast. Other Income for the quarter was $9 million, including a $7 million gain on the sale of our domain name management program line and a $4 million gain related to foreign currency rate changes in the quarter. These were offset by an early debt extinguishment charge of $2 million.
 Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.35 per share, an increase of 39% compared to the prior year, reflecting strong operating performance combined with lower interest expense. Reported EPS for the second quarter was a loss of $0.76 per share, including the impact of the $255 million non-cash charge for the Digital goodwill impairment.
 The structural tax rate for the third quarter was 38%, in line with our expectations. Including the impact of discrete tax items primarily related to the impairment charge, the effective tax rate for the quarter was minus 16%. It was minimal tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment charge as the majority of goodwill associated with our Digital business is non-deductible.
 Also included as discrete tax items was a reversal of worldwide tax reserves due to lapses of statue of limitation periods and settlements with taxing authorities, and the positive impact of foreign exchange rate changes in the quarter. These benefits more than offset a charge to establish a valuation allowance, reflecting recently enacted U.S. legislative changes impacting the expected utilization of foreign tax credits. We expect the structural tax rate for 2010 to be 39%.
 Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange compared to our 2010 full year outlook. Total internal growth for the quarter was 2%, consistent with the prior quarter. Economic factors continue to constrain service activity levels and storage growth. Core activity correlates with employment and general economic trends and has remained soft in recent quarters. The internal growth rate for core storage revenues was 2% in the quarter. Records Management volume growth moderated slightly as continued higher outgoing volume levels in North America offset new sales gains and solid momentum in international markets. Storage revenue growth also reflected moderated average net pricing gains in North American Records Management and episodic destructions in the Physical Data Protection business. We expect Storage internal growth for 2010 to be in the 2% to 3% range.
 Core revenue internal growth was 1% in the third quarter, primarily reflecting lower core service activity levels. We're planning for continued weakness in core service revenues until we see clear signs of improvement. For the full year, we expect core revenue internal growth to be in the 1% range. Solid growth in our complementary service revenues was supported by higher recycled paper prices and strong gains in hybrid service revenues. These gains were partially offset by lower eDiscovery revenues and the lapping of a large European project.
 Overall, revenue growth trends remain relatively consistent. Income and volume growth is stabilizing, and we're seeing some improvement in new sales. Offsetting these trends are continued weakness in core service activities and moderated net average pricing in the North American Box business, due in part to lower CPI rates. As a result, we expect full year internal growth to be in the 2% to 3% range.
 At recent exchange rates, we expect the FX impact to increase revenue growth this year by about 1%. Acquisitions net of the domain name product line divestiture are expected to add less than 1% to total growth.
 Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our year-to-date performance. Slide 6 shows our year-to-date operating performance compared to the first nine months of 2009. Despite the ongoing economic factors that are constraining revenue growth, we continue to drive strong profit and cash flow performance. Gross profit increased 9% to $1.4 billion, yielding a 220 basis point improvement in gross margin for the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same prior-year period. These results are supported by continued benefits from North American productivity initiatives, solid international operating performance and higher recycled paper prices.
 Gross profit gains are sustainable and position us well for flow-through benefits for higher growth when the economic conditions improve. Adjusted OIBDA grew 11% for the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Strong gross margin gains, controlled overhead spending and lower incentive compensation expense, which added about four points to growth, drove the increase. Solid underlying operating performance and lower interest expense drove a 24% increase in adjusted EPS compared to the first nine months of 2009. Disciplined capital spending combined with strong operating profit gains drove a 12% increase in year-to-date free cash flow compared to the same prior year period.
 Let's move now to Slide 7 for a year-to-date review from a segment perspective. Slide 7 shows key metrics for each of our four segments compared to the first nine months of 2009. The strength of our business portfolio is enabling strong sustainable financial performance. Our year-to-date results reflect solid gains in our North America and International Physical business segments. North America, our largest segment, continues to post solid revenue growth while driving higher profits and strong cash flows. As highlighted at Investor Day, we're capitalizing on our leadership in this segment to expand our services and drive the strong returns that flow from our recurring revenue model.
 Our International segment is delivering solid revenue gains supported by strong growth in the expansion markets. Select cost accrual impacts have lowered International segment adjusted OIBDA by about $8 million year-to-date. Excluding these effects, the segment is driving solid comparable margin gains and strong profit growth. These gains reflect benefits from driving operational excellence initiatives in the developed markets and from building scale across our business. Continued benefits in these areas are expected to be a key contributor to our overall profit performance going forward.
 In our Digital business, we continue to work through economic impacts that have pressured this business in recent quarters. As Bob will discuss in more detail, we're actively advancing efforts to better integrate our Digital services into Iron Mountain, to accelerate growth and cost efficiencies. As noted earlier, we proactively reassessed the value of our Digital goodwill in Q3. This resulted in a $255 million impairment related to our worldwide Digital segment and a $1.24 reduction of reported EPS. This impairment reflects a combination of factors including recent economic pressures on the Digital business and specific recent challenges related to our eDiscovery business.
 At a higher level, it's taking longer than originally anticipated to build this business towards higher scale and profitability. We're taking proactive steps to improve performance in Digital, including changing leadership, integrating sales efforts to drive our growth and integrating elements of support operations to drive cost efficiencies. Digital services are an important part of our integrated value proposition and our long-term potential. We'll continue advancing positive steps to strengthen our sales performance and returns in this business.
 Let's turn to Slide 8 for a more detailed look at our capital spending and free cash flow. Slide 8 summarizes our capital spending and our free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. We continue to drive strong cash flow performance through a disciplined approach. Total capital spending was up $174 million for the first nine months of 2010, including $7 million for real estate. We remain focused on driving efficiencies in our capital spending while supporting key growth initiatives and projects that help drive long-term return improvement.
 As a result of higher operating profits and lower capital expenditures, free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate was $260 million for the first nine months of the year, a 12% increase over the same prior-year period. We remain solidly on track for record performance in both capital efficiency and free cash flow. For 2010, we're increasing our expectations for free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate to approximately $350 million to $380 million. This reflects a strong year-to-date performance, expected benefits from recently enacted U.S. tax legislation, and updated projections for capital spending in the $270 million range.
 Our strong operating cash flow allows us to invest towards long-term growth in our business while also supporting shareholder payouts. In the third quarter, we acquired 1.8 million shares of our stock for approximately $40 million. As of September 30, we have acquired 4 million shares for approximately $95 million year-to-date. As we announced at Investor Day earlier this month, our Board recently approved a $200 million increase to our existing share repurchase program. This authorization is in addition to the $150 million authorization announced earlier this year, which as of September 30 had approximately $55 million remaining. This leaves us a balance of $255 million for additional share repurchases.
 Let's now turn to Slide 9 for a review of our key debt statistics. Our strong financial performance and focus on cash management continues to strengthen our balance sheet. Our debt portfolio at September 30, 2010, remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate is 6.9%, and we're 87% fixed. Maturity is 7.1 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. Our consolidated leverage ratio decreased to 3.0x. Currently, our consolidated leverage ratio is at the low end of what we feel is a very manageable 3x to 4x leverage level for our company.
 During the quarter, we used excess cash to fund a $200 million partial redemption of our 7 3/4% senior subordinated notes due in 2015. This transaction reduces our annual interest expense by about $16 million. We're also well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. Liquidity is more than $945 million, with $184 million in cash and $762 million in additional borrowing capacity as of quarter end. This concludes our review of the Q3 2010 results.
 While the digital asset impairment impacted our reported profit results, our underlying operating profit and cash flow performance remains strong commercial, reflecting our disciplined management approach and strong business foundation.
 Let's now to turn to Slide 10 to discuss our financial outlook. Slide 10 summarizes our full year 2010 and Q4 guidance. We remain on track for strong financial performance this year. For 2010, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $3,120,000,000 to $3,140,000,000, at the lower end of our guidance range. This represents reported revenue growth of about 4% including internal revenue growth of between 2% and 3%, and 1% to 1.5% of combined acquisition growth and FX benefit. We're increasing our profit outlook reflecting productivity gains, controlled spending and benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals. We expect adjusted OIBDA of $940 million to $955 million up 8% to 10% versus prior year. Adjusted EPS is now projected in the $1.12 to $1.16 range or growth of 14% to 19%.
 As noted, we're increasing our free cash flow outlook to $350 million to $380 million, reflecting the flow-through of strong operating performance, expected benefits from recent tax legislation and projections for capital expenditures of about $270 million for the year. The capital outlook includes about $15 million for real estate. As noted earlier, the digital asset impairment has no impact on revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS or free cash flow. For Q4, we're projecting revenue of $780 million to $800 million and adjusted OIBDA in the $233 million to $248 million range.
 Thanks, and now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.

The third quarter was another quarter of solid operating performance for Iron Mountain as we benefited from our strong business foundation, combined with our commitment to operational excellence and global service expansion. I'll discuss this more fully later in my remarks, but I want you to know that we're taking proactive steps to address the challenges currently facing our Digital business and get it back on track. This ongoing review has resulted in a $255 million impairment charge that Brian described in his comments.
 First, I will briefly review our current business performance and talk about what we're doing to continue delivering solid financial results. I also want to reinforce the key messages delivered at our recent Investor Day held earlier in the month, specifically, that we have a strong sustainable business foundation, that we continue to deliver excellent financial performance and improved returns, that we're focused on improving our growth trajectory to targeted strategies and that we intend to create long-term value as a leading information management services company.
 Let's first discuss our Q3 results and current business trends. As we discussed at Investor Day, we continue to work through the challenges of a tough economy that are moderating our revenue growth. As recently as 2008, our internal growth rate was 8%. Since that time, we've moderated to the 2% to 3% range where we are currently. Most important change in our growth rate is the decrease in core service activity levels driven by the economy. In Q3, we saw continued pressure on these core service activities, reflecting impacts from high unemployment, excess office space and generally lower levels of spending. We've also seen moderating in storage revenue growth. Trends have been stabilizing on this front, and in Q3, Records Management volumes globally were up about 1%. This is down slightly from Q2 growth as a solid international growth and momentum in new sales were offset by sustained higher North American destruction and withdrawal levels. As expected, we've also seen some moderation in average net price gains in our North American Records Management business, from the 3% range to the 2% range, reflecting business mix impact and effects from currently low inflation.
 In other areas such as state balding, we've seen impact from episodic customer reductions and container storage, which constrained gains in the quarter. Again, we see these impact as primarily economic in nature, and our current outlook incorporates our expectation for the continued effects from these type of factors until we see a clearer sign of improvement in economic conditions.
 Despite these impacts, we're driving positive revenue gains, and we continue to advance our long-term growth agenda. International growth remains solid with sustained 6% growth in Storage revenues and strong performance in the expansion markets. For example, in Spain, we managed active medical records at hospital groups [indiscernible]  and expand our services to other hospitals in that group during 2011. In Germany, we added Santander Bank to our listed new Records Management customers. And in the Czech Republic, we've added recurring storage and service revenues at OBI.
 We continue to drive new sales initiatives to strengthen our North American core volume growth. During the quarter at Target, we added secure shredding to the hard copy and tape vaulting services we've been providing to them for the past decade. At Exelon, we've added records management data protection and secure shredding to an existing vital records program. And at Chan Hospital [ph], we added release of information, shredding services and special project work to their existing Records Management program. And as I mentioned at Investor Day, we added FedEx as a new customer where we've really been deploying a comprehensive shredding solution to 1,800 retail locations in one month's time.
 We also continue to build momentum in our hybrid services, with double-digit gains that help support strong complementary service revenue growth during the quarter. In just a couple weeks' time, we closed a $500,000 litigation support project with a leading sports retailer, and as in most hybrid projects, this will likely lead to additional work. We're also making progress in developing technology services as part of an integrated value proposition. Under Harry Ebbighausen's leadership, we're advancing tighter integration of our Digital services into Iron Mountain's core operations to accelerate revenue growth and capture cost efficiencies. While areas such as eDiscovery remain constrained by legal cost pressures, we continue to make solid progress expanding our industry-leading PC backup and e-mail archival solutions.
 During the quarter, we closed a substantial PC backup and e-mail archiving management deal with Varian Semiconductor and several deals closed with our Mimosa acquisition as a result of an integrated value proposition, including sales with Select Medical, Yuri Insurance [ph] and Sears. We're also refining our product strategy by divesting nonstrategic offerings such as our Data Domain business, which we sold during the quarter.
 As I noted at Investor Day, our Digital business is facing some important challenges and has been impacted recently by execution that's below our high standards, a tough economy, and shortfalls in the eDiscovery business, significant shortfalls. We're being proactive to address these challenges in our Digital business. I've made significant leadership changes, we're strengthening the points of integration with our core business, and we're more sharply focused on advancing the growth of our industry-leading services through our enterprise sales force.
 Now as part of this ongoing review, we look closely at the carrying value of the business and determined that a reduced value is more appropriate under the current circumstance. This resulted in the $255 million impairment charge that Brian described. I want you to know that technology services remain an important part of an integrated value proposition at Iron Mountain, and I want you to remember that we have leading businesses in PC backup, in intellectual property management, in e-mail archiving, and that we're taking steps to improve our execution in this business and get it back towards higher growth and profitability.
 So while we aggressively meet these challenges, we're faced with and we meet them head-on, we also continued to deliver strong financial results, driven by our focus on operational excellence and global service expansion. We continue to drive higher profits and improved capital efficiency, and this has led to significant increases in our free cash flow and a strength in balance sheet.
 So let me sum up Q3. We continue to deliver solid positive revenue gains. We translated these gains into strong profit and cash results that are keeping us on track towards strong full year operating performance. And we're confident in our ability to address these opportunities that are within our control while we deliver strong profitability and cash flow performance. As we work through the immediate-term environment, we remain highly energized by the tremendous potential for Iron Mountain over the long term as we pursue the strategy I outlined for you at Investor Day.
 As we discussed at Investor Day, our primary goal is to bridge towards higher revenue growth by pursuing three areas: First, strengthening our go-to-market effectiveness where we're taking a very targeted, low-risk approach to improving our sales capability. Second, through international expansion, where the international markets are inherently attractive to us as a selling platform and where we have a proven approach. And third, through the expansion of new services in both the digital and hybrid markets, we're leveraging the power of Iron Mountain to capture significant long-term growth opportunities in large, fast-growing markets.
 So it's go-to-market, international expansion and the development of new services. That's our agenda, and we'll pursue this agenda within the context of delivering strong financial performance and improved returns as we continue to focus on operational excellence. We're on track towards delivering 8% to 10% adjusted OIBDA growth and record cash flows in 2010. This builds on the strong record of performance we've achieved over the past four years. It reflects the strength of our underlying business and the capability and discipline of our team. We look forward to reporting on our continued process in developing the potential and power of Iron Mountain.
 Thanks. Now we'd like to take your questions.

For our custom, we have a user-controlled slide presentation on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ironmountain.com. Referring now to Slide 2.

As you know, we use several non-GAAP measures when presenting our financial results. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow before discretionary acquisitions and investments, among others, are metrics we speak to frequently, and ones we believe to be important in evaluating our overall financial performance. We provide additional information and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their appropriate GAAP measures as required by Reg G at the Investor Relations page of our website as well as in today's press release.

We continue to drive strong financial performance in the third quarter. Reported revenue growth for the quarter of 2% was in line with our outlook. Results were supported by solid gains in our International Physical segment, strong growth in hybrid services and benefits from higher recycled paper prices.
Revenue growth continues to be constrained by economic factors, which contributed to very soft core service activity this summer. Adjusted OIBDA came in above the high end of our guidance range, driven by continued benefits from productivity initiatives and lower incentive compensation accruals.  Adjusted OIBDA increased 13% in Q3 and 11% year-to-date versus the prior year. Adjustments to incentive compensation accruals added about five points of growth in Q3 and four points of growth on a year-to-date basis.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.35 per share, an increase of 39% compared to the same period last year. Our reported EPS was a loss of $0.76 per share, including a $1.24 per share after-tax charge for the Digital goodwill impairment.
As we proactively advance changes to improve performance in our Digital business, we evaluated our Digital business carrying value, resulting in a $255 million estimated goodwill impairment charge. We'll finalize the amount in the fourth quarter and record any adjustment if necessary at that time. It's important to note that this charge does not impact revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS or free cash flow. Both Bob and I will discuss this more fully later in our remarks.
Also included in reported EPS were benefits for the impacts on Other Income and our effective tax rate related to the weakening of the U.S. dollar within the quarter and the gain on the sale of our domain name management product line.
For the full year, we're raising our adjusted OIBDA outlook reflecting strong year-to-date performance and benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals. We're also raising our full year cash flow outlook to reflect lower capital spending projections and expected benefits from recently enacted U.S. tax legislation. We're refining our revenue outlook as well to incorporate current internal growth trends and foreign currency exchange rates.
Let's now turn to Slide 4 and begin our review of the third quarter results. Slide 4 compares our results for this quarter to the third quarter of 2009. Q3 was another solid quarter of financial performance. Enterprise revenue growth was 2%, in line with our outlook with overall gains constrained by continued softness in core service activity. Continued strong profit performance was supported by gross margin gains and benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals. From a segment perspective, North American Physical posted 2% internal growth supported by strong complementary service revenue performance, including benefits from higher paper pricing and hybrid service revenues.
Storage internal growth was 1% in Q3. North American records management volume growth moderated as continued higher outgoing volumes offset new sales gains. As expected, there was some moderation in average net price gains, which are now trending in the 2% range for Records Management, due in part to lower CPI levels. Episodic destructions in our Physical Data Protection business constrained growth in that service line and also contributed to lower storage revenue growth. Core service revenues declined this summer, consistent with overall soft economic conditions. 
Our International Physical segment generated 5% internal growth. Storage internal growth was a solid 6%, supported by strong performance in the expansion markets. Reported revenues for this segment were 3%, including the impacts of foreign currency exchange rate changes.
In our Digital segment, reported revenue declined 1% in the third quarter as gains in backup and archiving services were offset by the divestiture of our domain name management product line and continued pressure on eDiscovery revenues. We expect continued pressure on Digital revenue growth in the near term as we work through comparisons to stronger prior year growth in areas such as eDiscovery. 
We continue to translate moderate overall revenue growth into strong gross profit gains. Gross profit increased 6% versus the prior year, yielding a 220 basis points margin improvement. Higher storage gross margins, particularly in the International segment are supporting these gains. Continued benefits from productivity initiatives drove higher service margins, which were also a key contributor to our improved performance.
Adjusted OIBDA grew 13% to $254 million. This increase was driven by gross profit gains, controlled SG&A spending and lower incentive compensation expense, which added about five points of growth in the quarter. These gains were partially offset by Mimosa integration costs and targeted investments in growth initiatives. Below the adjusted OIBDA line, depreciation was $77 million and amortization was $10 million, in line with our forecast. Other Income for the quarter was $9 million, including a $7 million gain on the sale of our domain name management product line and a $4 million gain related to foreign currency rate changes in the quarter. These were offset by an early debt extinguishment charge of $2 million.
Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.35 per share, an increase of 39% compared to the prior year, reflecting strong operating performance combined with lower interest expense. Reported EPS for the second quarter was a loss of $0.76 per share, including the impact of the $255 million non-cash charge for the Digital goodwill impairment. 
The structural tax rate for the third quarter was 38%, in line with our expectations. Including the impact of discrete tax items primarily related to the impairment charge, the effective tax rate for the quarter was minus 16%. There was minimal tax benefit associated with the goodwill impairment charge as the majority of goodwill associated with our Digital business is non-deductible.
Also included as discrete tax items were the reversal of worldwide tax reserves due to lapses of statute of limitation periods and settlements with taxing authorities, and the positive impact of foreign exchange rate changes in the quarter. These benefits more than offset a charge to establish a valuation allowance, reflecting recently enacted U.S. legislative changes impacting the expected utilization of foreign tax credits. We expect the structural tax rate for 2010 to be 39%.
Let's now take a closer look at our revenue growth on Slide 5. Slide 5 breaks down our overall revenue growth. It shows internal growth by major service line as well as the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange compared to our 2010 full year outlook. Total internal growth for the quarter was 2%, consistent with the prior quarter. Economic factors continue to constrain service activity levels and storage growth. Core activity correlates with employment and general economic trends and has remained soft in recent quarters. The internal growth rate for core storage revenues was 2% in the quarter. Records Management volume growth moderated slightly as continued higher outgoing volume levels in North America offset new sales gains and solid momentum in international markets. Storage revenue growth also reflected moderated average net pricing gains in North American Records Management and episodic destructions in the Physical Data Protection business. We expect Storage internal growth for 2010 to be in the 2% to 3% range.
Core revenue internal growth was 1% in the third quarter, primarily reflecting lower core service activity levels. We're planning for continued weakness in core service revenues until we see clear signs of improvement. For the full year, we expect core revenue internal growth to be in the 1% range. Solid growth in our complementary service revenues was supported by higher recycled paper prices and strong gains in hybrid service revenues. These gains were partially offset by lower eDiscovery revenues and the lapping of a large European project.
Overall, revenue growth trends remain relatively consistent. Incoming volume growth is stabilizing, and we're seeing some improvement in new sales. Offsetting these trends are continued weakness in core service activities and moderated net average pricing in the North American Box business, due in part to lower CPI rates. As a result, we expect full year internal growth to be in the 2% to 3% range.
At recent exchange rates, we expect the FX impact to increase revenue growth this year by about 1%. Acquisitions net of the domain name product line divestiture are expected to add less than 1% to total growth.
Let's now turn to Slide 6 to review our year-to-date performance. Slide 6 shows our year-to-date operating performance compared to the first nine months of 2009. Despite the ongoing economic factors that are constraining revenue growth, we continue to drive strong profit and cash flow performance. Gross profit increased 9% to $1.4 billion, yielding a 220 basis point improvement in gross margin for the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same prior-year period. These results are supported by continued benefits from North American productivity initiatives, solid international operating performance and higher recycled paper prices.
Gross margin gains are sustainable and position us well for flow-through benefits from higher growth when economic conditions improve. Adjusted OIBDA grew 11% for the first nine months of 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Strong gross margin gains, controlled overhead spending and lower incentive compensation expense, which added about four points to growth, drove the increase. Solid underlying operating performance and lower interest expense drove a 24% increase in adjusted EPS compared to the first nine months of 2009. Disciplined capital spending combined with strong operating profit gains drove a 12% increase in year-to-date free cash flow compared to the same prior year period.
Let's move now to Slide 7 for a year-to-date review from a segment perspective. Slide 7 shows key metrics for each of our four segments compared to the first nine months of 2009. The strength of our business portfolio is enabling strong sustainable financial performance. Our year-to-date results reflect solid gains in our North America and International Physical business segments. North America, our largest segment, continues to post solid revenue growth while driving higher profits and strong cash flows. As highlighted at Investor Day, we're capitalizing on our leadership in this segment to expand our services and drive the strong returns that flow from our recurring revenue model. 
Our International segment is delivering solid revenue gains supported by strong growth in the expansion markets. Select cost accrual impacts have lowered International segment adjusted OIBDA by about $8 million year-to-date. Excluding these effects, the segment is driving solid comparable margin gains and strong profit growth. These gains reflect benefits from driving operational excellence initiatives in the developed markets and from building scale across our business. Continued benefits in these areas are expected to be a key contributor to our overall profit performance going forward. 
In our Digital business, we continue to work through economic impacts that have pressured this business in recent quarters. As Bob will discuss in more detail, we're actively advancing efforts to better integrate our Digital services into Iron Mountain, to accelerate growth and cost efficiencies. As noted earlier, we proactively reassessed the value of our Digital goodwill in Q3. This resulted in a $255 million impairment related to our worldwide Digital segment and a $1.24 reduction of reported EPS. This impairment reflects a combination of factors including recent economic pressures on the Digital business and specific recent challenges related to our eDiscovery business.
At a higher level, it's taking longer than originally anticipated to build this business towards higher scale and profitability. We're taking proactive steps to improve performance in Digital, including changing leadership, integrating sales efforts to drive higher growth and integrating elements of support operations to drive cost efficiencies. Digital services are an important part of our integrated value proposition and our long-term potential. We'll continue advancing positive steps to strengthen our sales performance and returns in this business.
Let's turn to Slide 8 for a more detailed look at our capital spending and free cash flow. Slide 8 summarizes our capital spending and our free cash flow on a year-to-date basis. We continue to drive strong cash flow performance through a disciplined approach. Total capital spending was $174 million for the first nine months of 2010, including $7 million for real estate. We remain focused on driving efficiencies in our capital spending while supporting key growth initiatives and projects that help drive long-term return improvement. 
As a result of higher operating profits and lower capital expenditures, free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate was $260 million for the first nine months of the year, a 12% increase over the same prior-year period. We remain solidly on track for record performance in both capital efficiency and free cash flow. For 2010, we're increasing our expectations for free cash flow before acquisitions and discretionary investments in real estate to approximately $350 million to $380 million. This reflects a strong year-to-date performance, expected benefits from recently enacted U.S. tax legislation, and updated projections for capital spending in the $270 million range. 
Our strong operating cash flow allows us to invest towards long-term growth in our business while also supporting shareholder payouts. In the third quarter, we acquired 1.8 million shares of our stock for approximately $40 million. As of September 30, we have acquired 4 million shares for approximately $95 million year-to-date. As we announced at Investor Day earlier this month, our Board recently approved a $200 million increase to our existing share repurchase program. This authorization is in addition to the $150 million authorization announced earlier this year, which as of September 30 had approximately $55 million remaining. This leaves us a balance of $255 million for additional share repurchases.
Let's now turn to Slide 9 for a review of our key debt statistics. Our strong financial performance and focus on cash management continues to strengthen our balance sheet. Our debt portfolio at September 30, 2010, remains long and fixed. Our weighted average interest rate is 6.9%, and we're 87% fixed. Maturity is 7.1 years with no meaningful repayment obligations until 2014. Our consolidated leverage ratio decreased to 3.0x. Currently, our consolidated leverage ratio is at the low end of what we feel is a very manageable 3x to 4x leverage level for our company. 
During the quarter, we used excess cash to fund a $200 million partial redemption of our 7 3/4% senior subordinated notes due in 2015. This transaction reduces our annual interest expense by about $16 million. We're also well positioned in terms of cash and financing capacity. Liquidity is more than $945 million, with $184 million in cash and $762 million in additional borrowing capacity as of quarter end. This concludes our review of the Q3 2010 results. 
While the digital asset impairment impacted reported profit results, our underlying operating profit and cash flow performance remains strong, reflecting our disciplined management approach and strong business foundation. 
Let's now to turn to Slide 10 to discuss our financial outlook. Slide 10 summarizes our full year 2010 and Q4 guidance. We remain on track for strong financial performance this year. For 2010, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $3,120,000,000 to $3,140,000,000, at the lower end of our prior guidance range. This represents reported revenue growth of about 4% including internal revenue growth of between 2% and 3%, and 1% to 1.5% of combined acquisition growth and FX benefit. We're increasing our profit outlook reflecting productivity gains, controlled spending and benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals. We expect adjusted OIBDA of $940 million to $955 million, up 8% to 10% versus prior year. Adjusted EPS is now projected in the $1.12 to $1.16 range or growth of 14% to 19%. 
As noted, we're increasing our free cash flow outlook to $350 million to $380 million, reflecting the flow-through of strong operating performance, expected benefits from recent tax legislation and projections for capital expenditures of about $270 million for the year. The capital outlook includes about $15 million for real estate. As noted earlier, the digital asset impairment has no impact on revenue, adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EPS or free cash flow. For Q4, we're projecting revenue of $780 million to $800 million and adjusted OIBDA in the $233 million to $248 million range. 
Thanks, and now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob."

The third quarter was another quarter of solid operating performance for Iron Mountain as we benefited from our strong business foundation, combined with our commitment to operational excellence and global service expansion. I'll discuss this more fully later in my remarks, but I want you to know that we're taking proactive steps to address the challenges currently facing our Digital business and get it back on track. This ongoing review has resulted in a $255 million impairment charge that Brian described in his comments.
First, I will briefly review our current business performance and talk about what we're doing to continue delivering solid financial results. I also want to reinforce the key messages delivered at our recent Investor Day held earlier in the month, specifically: That we have a strong sustainable business foundation; that we continue to deliver excellent financial performance and improved returns; that we're focused on improving our growth trajectory through targeted strategies; and that we intend to create long-term value as a leading information management services company.
Let's first discuss our Q3 results and current business trends. As we discussed at Investor Day, we continue to work through the challenges of a tough economy that are moderating our revenue growth. As recently as 2008, our internal growth rate was 8%. Since that time, we've moderated to the 2% to 3% range where we are currently. The most important change in our growth rate is the decrease in core service activity levels driven by the economy. In Q3, we saw continued pressure on these core service activities, reflecting impacts from high unemployment, excess office space and generally lower levels of spending. We've also seen moderation in storage revenue growth. Trends have been stabilizing on this front, and in Q3, Records Management volumes globally were up about 1%. This is down slightly from Q2 growth as a solid international growth and momentum in new sales were offset by sustained higher North American destruction and withdrawal levels. As expected, we've also seen some moderation in average net price gains in our North American Records Management business, from the 3% range to the 2% range, reflecting business mix impacts and effects from currently low inflation.
In other areas such as tape vaulting, we've seen impacts from episodic customer reductions and container storage, which constrained gains in the quarter. Again, we see these impacts as primarily economic in nature, and our current outlook incorporates our expectation for the continued effects from these types of factors until we see a clearer sign of improvement in economic conditions. 
Despite these impacts, we're driving positive revenue gains, and we continue to advance our long-term growth agenda. International growth remains solid with sustained 6% growth in Storage revenues and strong performance in the expansion markets. For example, in Spain, we'll manage active medical records at hospital group Sagra [ph] and extend our services to other hospitals in that group during 2011. In Germany, we added Santander Bank to our listed new Records Management customers. And in the Czech Republic, we've added recurring storage and service revenues at OBI.
We continue to drive new sales initiatives to strengthen our North American core volume growth. During the quarter at Target, we added secure shredding to the hard copy and tape vaulting services we've been providing to them for the past decade. At Exelon, we've added records management data protection and secure shredding to an existing vital records program. And at Chan Hospital [ph], we added release of information, shredding services and special project work to their existing Records Management program. And as I mentioned at Investor Day, we added FedEx as a new customer where we've really been deploying a comprehensive shredding solution to 1,800 retail locations in one month's time.
We also continue to build momentum in our hybrid services, with double-digit gains that help support strong complementary service revenue growth during the quarter. In just a couple weeks' time, we closed a $500,000 litigation support project with a leading sports retailer, and as in most hybrid projects, this will likely lead to additional work. We're also making progress in developing technology services as part of an integrated value proposition. Under Harry Ebbighausen's leadership, we're advancing tighter integration of our Digital services into Iron Mountain's core operations to accelerate revenue growth and capture cost efficiencies. While areas such as eDiscovery remain constrained by legal cost pressures, we continue to make solid progress expanding our industry-leading PC backup and email archival solutions.
During the quarter, we closed a substantial PC backup and email archiving management deal with Varian Semiconductor and several deals closed with our Mimosa acquisition as a result of an integrated value proposition, including sales with Select Medical, Erie Insurance and Sears. We're also refining our product strategy by divesting nonstrategic offerings such as our Data Domain business, which we sold during the quarter. 
As I noted at Investor Day, our Digital business is facing some important challenges and has been impacted recently by execution that's below our high standards, a tough economy, and shortfalls in the eDiscovery business, significant shortfalls. We're being proactive to address these challenges in our Digital business. I've made significant leadership changes, we're strengthening the points of integration with our core business, and we're more sharply focused on advancing the growth of our industry-leading services through our enterprise sales force.
Now as part of this ongoing review, we looked closely at the carrying value of the business and determined that a reduced value is more appropriate under the current circumstance. This resulted in the $255 million impairment charge that Brian described. I want you to know that technology services remain an important part of an integrated value proposition at Iron Mountain. And I want you to remember that we have leading businesses in PC backup, in intellectual property management, in email archiving, and that we're taking steps to improve our execution in this business and get it back towards higher growth and profitability.
So while we aggressively meet these challenges, we're faced with and we meet them head-on, we also continued to deliver strong financial results, driven by our focus on operational excellence and global service expansion. We continue to drive higher profits and improved capital efficiency, and this has led to significant increases in our free cash flow and a strengthened balance sheet.
So let me sum up Q3. We continue to deliver solid positive revenue gains. We translated these gains into strong profit and cash results that are keeping us on track towards strong full year operating performance. And we're confident in our ability to address these opportunities that are within our control while we deliver strong profitability and cash flow performance. As we work through the immediate-term environment, we remain highly energized by the tremendous potential for Iron Mountain over the long term as we pursue the strategy I outlined for you at Investor Day.
As we discussed at Investor Day, our primary goal is to bridge towards higher revenue growth by pursuing three areas: First, strengthening our go-to-market effectiveness where we're taking a very targeted, low-risk approach to improving our sales capability; second, through international expansion, where the international markets are inherently attractive to us as a selling platform and where we have a proven approach; and third, through the expansion of new services. In both the digital and hybrid markets, we're leveraging the power of Iron Mountain to capture significant long-term growth opportunities in large, fast-growing markets. 
So it's go-to-market, international expansion and the development of new services. That's our agenda, and we'll pursue this agenda within the context of delivering strong financial performance and improved returns as we continue to focus on operational excellence. We're on track towards delivering 8% to 10% adjusted OIBDA growth and record cash flows in 2010. This builds on the strong record of performance we've achieved over the past four years. It reflects the strength of our underlying business and the capability and discipline of our team. We look forward to reporting on our continued progress in developing the potential and power of Iron Mountain. 
Thanks. Now we'd like to take your questions."

Keep in mind that a fair amount of that is we're catching up, if you will, for year-to-date accruals and reflecting our most recent views. So as we highlighted at Investor Day, David, we're having low incentive compensation payouts this year. For the full year, it'll probably add about three points to our growth rate and in terms of our forecast. And as we look forward to next year, we'll plan for normal accruals and that is, on a comparison basis, it provides a drag to our OIBDA growth rate. But we are not achieving our revenue growth goals this year, and areas like service trends that have been a real challenge for us. And that's being reflected in low incentive compensation payouts this year."
