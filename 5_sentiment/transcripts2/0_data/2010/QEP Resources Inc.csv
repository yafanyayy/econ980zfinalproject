This is Richard Doleshek, QEP Resources Chief Financial Officer. I want to thank you for joining us today for the QEP Resources Third Quarter Results Conference Call.
With me today are Chuck Stanley, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jay Neese, Executive Vice President and Head of our E&P Operations; and Scott Gutberlet, Director of Investor Relations.
As you all know, the third quarter was our first quarter as a standalone company having being spun-off Questar Corporation on June 30th and I don’t think we missed a beat with regard to our operating performance.
In terms of our third quarter results, we provided an operations update for E&P and Midstream businesses on Monday and we issued our earnings release yesterday.
In our operations update, we reported third quarter 2010 production of 61.7 Bcfe, 54% of which came from our Midcontinent divisions. We updated development activities in our core areas and we raised 2010 production guidance to a range 225 to 227 Bcfe. Yesterday, in our earnings release, we reported third quarter and nine month 2010 results and updated our 2010 guidance.
To remind everyone, in conjunction with our spin-off from Questar, we distributed Wexpro Company to Questar, and accordingly, we have recasted our historical results to treat Wexpro’s results as discontinued operations. Therefore, QEP’s reported period-to-period results are comparable to each other and we will be happy to provide additional information about this during Q&A.
In today’s conference call, we will use non-GAAP measure, EBITDA, which is defined in our earnings release. In addition, we’ll be making numerous forward-looking statements and we remind everyone that our actual results could differ from our estimates for a variety of reasons many of which are beyond our control.
Turning to our third quarter results, the story was double-digit production growth offset by slightly weaker net realized prices. Excluding costs associated with the separation including early debt retirement expense, our third quarter EBITDA was $297 million, which was up 8% or $21 million from the second quarter of 2010 and up $12 million from the third quarter of 2009.
QEP Energy, our E&P business, contributed $246 million or 83% of our aggregate third quarter EBIDTA and QEP Field Services our gathering and processing business, contributed $49 million or about 16% of our total EBITDA which is slightly down from its contribution in the second quarter of this year.
For the first nine months of the year, our EBITDA was $842 million, which was up about $2 million from a year ago in spite of net realized natural gas prices that were 27% lower in 2010.
QEP Energy’s contribution was $684 million, which was $30 million or roughly 4% lower than the first nine months of 2009; however, QEP Field Services contribution was $152 million which was about $38 million or 33% higher than the first nine months of 2009.
The items driving our EBITDA included QEP Energy’s daily production, which averaged 670 million cubic feet equivalent day in the quarter and was 40% higher than the 590 million cubic feet equivalent per day average in the second quarter 2010 and 41% higher than the 476 million cubic feet equivalent day average in the third quarter of 2009, which did include some price-related curtailments.
QEP Energy’s net realized equivalent price, which includes the settlement of all of our commodity derivatives, averaged $5.10 per Mcfe in the quarter, which was 5% lower than the $5.35 per Mcfe realized in the second quarter of 2010 and 24% lower than the $6.70 per Mcfe realized in third quarter of 2009.
QEP Energy’s commodity derivatives portfolio contributed $68 million of EBITDA in the quarter, which was the same as in the second quarter of 2010 compared to $156 million in the third quarter of 2009.
The derivatives portfolio added $1.11 per Mcfe to QEP Energy’s net realized price in the third quarter compared to $1.27 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2010 and $3.56 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2009.
QEP Energy’s combined operating and production tax expenses were $52 million in the quarter compared to $47 million in the second quarter of 2010 and $49 million in the second quarter of 2009.
While the absolute expenses increased in the third quarter, the per unit cost declined to $0.84 per Mcfe in the quarter compared to $0.88 per Mcfe in the second quarter of 2010 and $0.91 per Mcfe in the third quarter of 2009.
Finally, QEP Field Services EBITDA were 6% lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter of 2010, but 4% higher than the third quarter of 2009. Gathering margins were essentially flat to second quarter, but up 16% from the third quarter of 2009.
Gas gathering volumes were up 11% from the second quarter at about 1.38 Bcf per day and above 32% from the third quarter 2009 benefiting from increased volumes in Northwest Louisiana and in Pinedale. Processing margins were down 14% from both the second quarter of 2010 and third quarter of 2009 due to increased shrinkage cost and NGL prices that were $0.08 per gallon lower in the second quarter of 2010 and NGL sales volumes that were $0.06 lower than the second quarter.
Net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of the year was $71 million, up 3% from the second quarter of 2010, driven by EBITDA which was $21 million higher than the third quarter and $11 million gain on asset sales, but offset by separation in early debt retirement cost associated to spin-off and higher non-cash charges including DD&A expense.
Net income from continuing operations was flat with the third quarter of 2009 on $12 million higher EBITDA and a positive $39 million swing in unrealized gains and losses on our basis-only swaps, offset by DD&A expense that was $38 million higher.
For the first nine months of 2010, we reported capital expenditures on an accrual basis of $1.57 billion including $370 million of expenditures in the third quarter of 2010.
Spending for E&P activities was $877 million for the nine months including $329 million in the quarter, and year-to-date spending on leasehold acquisitions was $94 million. Spending in our Midstream business was $179 million for the nine months including $40 million in the quarter.
In terms of financing activities we cleared the last major hurdle associated with our spin-off. In August, we completed the purchase of $638 million of senior notes that were tendered to us as a result of the change of control provisions in the indenture and we issued $625 million principal amount of senior notes 2021 to finance the purchase.
The end result is that senior notes portfolio with an average coupon of 6.76% which is 3 basis points higher than the old portfolio and average duration of 8.65 years which is about two years longer than the average duration before the refinancing.
Additionally, we issued the new notes on the existing 2001 indenture so there is no structural difference in the new senior notes.
After we issued the new notes, we cancelled the $500 million term loan that we put in place to back up the tender offer, and as a result the only bank facility we have now is our $1 billion revolving credit which matures in 2013 and had $225 million outstanding at September 30. And again, I am happy to answer any questions you might have about the refinancing during Q&A.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Chuck.

As Richard noted, on Monday and Tuesday, we issued separate releases covering our operations and financial results. I will try to add a little color to those releases, update you on our plans for the remainder of this year. I will give you a",3109,"Good morning. As Richard noted, on Monday and Tuesday, we issued separate releases covering our operations and financial results. I will try to add a little color to those releases, update you on our plans for the remainder of this year. I will give you a brief high level overview of what we plan to present to our Board in early November regarding our 2011 plans and then move on to Q&A.
First, let’s review some of the highlights from our operations. As Richard has already noted, we grew production in QEP Energy 41% in the third quarter to 61.7 Bcfe. As we pointed out in our release, that headline number for a year-over-year comparison is a bit misleading. Many of you will recall that in 2009 in the third quarter in response to low prices, we deliberately curtailed our production.
While we don’t report absolute shut-in volumes taking into account last year’s curtailments, the year-over-year and quarterly comparisons are closer to 20% growth. For the first nine months of 2010, QEP production totaled 166.9 Bcfe compared to 131.4 Bcfe in ‘09. The third quarter production was up 15% from the second quarter production volumes in 2010.
I would like to also point out the acceleration of our Midcontinent production growth. On a headline basis, the third quarter 2010 production in the Midcontinent was up 65% from a year ago. We take into account last year’s curtailments, Midcontinent production was still up about 40% compared to the third quarter of 2009 and about 30% for the first nine months.
Of particular note, our QEP Midcontinent production was up 21% from the second quarter of 2010. We’re starting to see solid growth contribution from our liquids-rich plays in our Western Midcontinent assets.
Third quarter 2010 Western Midcontinent production driven primarily by our liquids-rich plays in the Cana shale and in the Granite Wash plays was 9.9 Bcfe or approximately double what it was a year ago. Eastern Midcontinent totaled about 23.5 Bcfe during the quarter, and it was driven primarily by production from our Haynesville Shale drilling activity in Northwest Louisiana.
Let me draw attention to the operations release that we put out day before yesterday and there were some slides of the company that released or posted on our Web site at qepres.com. I will refer to those slides as I go through the results from individual plays here.
Since our last call, QEP has turned 13 new company-operated Haynesville Shale wells to sales. All these wells were very strong with initial rates of over 10 million cubic feet a day of gas on 16 to 18 64th-inch chokes and flowing pressures very strong in excess of 7,500 pounds.
Please remember that we continue to constrain our choke back our Haynesville wells during flow back. So the initial production rates that we report from our wells aren’t comparable to the rates that were reported some other operators and they are not comparable to our own results that we reported back in 2009.
We continue to see evidence that constraining the rate of flow and the choke size during flow back is the right approach to managing Haynesville production in the reservoir in particular and we believe that the wells that we are drilling and completing today, our every bid is good as the wells that we reported with in excess of 20 million cubic feet a day initial rates last year.
Year-to-date QEP gross completed Haynesville wells cost of average about $8.8 million. So, we are seeing a slight increase in well cost. As we mentioned in the last quarter, we have fundamentally changed our completion design. We are pumping more sand and more fluid today than were earlier in the year and that’s the primary reason for the increase in well cost.
I’d also point out that given the consistency of results in this play, mainly due to the constrained flow back that we’re applying to our Haynesville wells, this is the last quarter that we’re going to report individual well results.
We’ll give you numbers of wells that we complete et cetera, but you can rest assure that we’ll faithfully report to you any deviations whether they would be positive or negative from our current results. We currently have seven rigs running in the play, operated by QEP. Refer to slides three and four in the operational slide deck for more details.
At Pinedale, we just completed and turned to sales our 91st new well, actually its 92nd new well as of a few minutes ago with the morning report for this year. We’re on track to deliver over 100 new wells at Pinedale for 2010. Year-to-date our operated gross completed well cost have averaged about $3.7 million. We currently have five rigs running at Pinedale.
Since our call we’ve reallocated one of our Pinedale rigs to focus on oil-directed drilling. First drilling our first Niobrara exploratory well and then we’ll move up to the Williston Basin to drill Bakken and Three Forks oil wells. Please refer to slides five and six in the slide deck for more detail on our Pinedale play.
Moving on to the Granite Wash and the Atoka play in the Texas Panhandle, since our last call, we have turned two new QEP operated wells to sales. The first, the Methodist Home 2 #5H well. It’s a horizontal well completed in the Atoka Wash, and it went to sale in late July.
We briefly mentioned this well on our last call. We didn’t have peak sales results from it at that point. The peak rate from the Methodist Home 2 #5H well was 15.9 million cubic feet of gas equivalent per day.
A fairly wet gas stream on a processed basis it would yield a 8.4 million cubic feet a day of dry gas plus 1,081 barrels of NGLs and 176 barrels per day of condensate, so very encouraging results from that Methodist Home well in the Granite Wash/Atoka zone in lower part of the section.
The second well turned to sales the Huff 6034H well also targeted the deeper Atoka interval. This well went to sales in early October and had a peak rate of 15.4 million cubic feet equivalent a day or 11.4 million cubic feet a day of dry gas plus 607 barrels a day of NGLs and 58 barrels a day of condensate. We had a 100% working interest in both of these wells.
We’re currently completing another Atoka formation horizontal well, the Moore 10 #2H well. We have a 99% working interest in the Moore well, and it’s about a mile east of our recently completed Methodist Home well, so we would similar results, similar liquid content in that well and in the gas stream that we’re producing from it. We have two rigs running in the Granite Wash play. More details on that play can be found on slide seven in the slide deck.
At the Anadarko Basin Woodford or Cana shale play we’ve just completed and started flowing back our latest QEP operated well and the play the Stroud 1-3H well. It’s very earlier in the flow back history.
We’re selling gas but the well is continuing to clean up, and we’re recovering large volumes of frac water as we report these results. So we don’t have a peak rate to report to you, but the indications from early flow back are that the well will be another strong Cana well. It’s in the liquids-rich part of the fairway, so it will have a significant BTU and liquids uplift.
We have four QEP-operated wells either drilling or waiting on completion in the Cana play. In addition to our own operated wells, QEP also participated in seven gross operated wells drilled by others that were completed and turned to sales since our last call. Our working interest in those outside operated wells range from 1% to 24%. There is more detail on slide eight in our slide back on the Cana play.
Turning to the Williston Basin in North Dakota, since our last call we’ve completed and turned to sales two new QEP-operated middle Bakken horizontal wells.
One was a short lateral and one was a long lateral well with peak rates ranging from 590 to 1,124 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Probably the most important result out of the Williston this quarter is we completed and turned to sales our first three Forks well, the MHA 2-06 well, a long lateral completion in the three Forks went to sales on 4 September at a constrained 24-hour rate of 1,374 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
This well is significant because it validates the prospectivity of roughly the western half of approximately 70,000 acres of net leasehold that are on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, so at the eastern part of our acreage.
Obviously, we’ll need more well results in the three Forks to fully validate the play, but this first well is quite encouraging. We currently on it running one rig in the Bakken Play, one QEP-operated rig.
The second rig, which is the rig that has moved from Pinedale, will be arriving in the next 45 days or so. There is an additional color and a map in slide nine in the slide deck on the Bakken Three Forks play.
Turning to the exploratory front and I’ll put quotes around exploratory, QEP is now drilled and cased our first Niobrara test on what has become now an 84,000 net acre leasehold position in the Wyoming portion of the D-J Basin.
So we’ve increased our acreage position since our last call in the play. Our Borie 16-4H well is a horizontal test. It’s targeting the chalk zones in the Niobrara formation, which as you is the source rock with its full of oil, on a large anticlinal fold on the western part of the basin.
The well is located about 10 miles west of Cheyenne, Wyoming, right along Interstate 80. We drilled the well to a total depth of 14,200 feet and the lateral length, the lateral in zone is roughly 5,200 feet. We plan to complete this well with up to a 20-stage fracture stimulation, so a similar design to a Bakken stimulation.
Given the timing of the completion of the well, we won’t be in a position to discus results until at the earliest our fourth quarter year-end call in February. A map with our acreage, the location of this first well, the Borie well and other key data is included in slide 10.
So in summary QEP’s production growth is being driven by the Haynesville and Pinedale assets, two of the highest quality, lowest cost natural gas assets in North America, but we are also augmenting that growth with strong results from our liquid-rich plays in the Cana and Granite Wash and solid potential for oil production growth from not only the Bakken but also now the Three Forks in the Williston Basin.
With strong results from all of our plays, we’ve again increased our production forecast for 2010. We now expect QEP production to range between 225 Bcfe and 227 Bcfe for this year, and that’s up 19% to 20% from last year.
QEP Field Services, our midstream business, should complete construction of the 150 million cubic foot per day iron horse deep cut cryogenic processing plant, which is located adjacent to our existing Stagecoach hub in the Uinta Basin in the late fourth quarter of this year and the plant should be up and running early next year.
The Iron Horse plant is underwritten by fee-based contracts from third-party producers in the Uinta Basin, so it will benefit immediately as soon as it will start generating EBITDA for our midstream business.
Construction activities continue on Field Services; 420 million cubic feet a day deep cut cryogenic natural gas processing plant at Black’s Fork, which is about 100 miles south of Pinedale in southwestern Wyoming. When completed in the fourth quarter of next year, the Black’s Fork II plant will be fully loaded with volumes dedicated for life of field from the QEP-operated acreage at Pinedale, which is the northern third of the largest gas field on the Rockies.
The Black’s Fork II plant will recover an incremental 15,000 barrels a day of NGL net to QEP Resources. Field Services is also active in northwest Louisiana where it continues to build out the gathering and treating infrastructure for QEP Energy and others in the Haynesville Shale play.
During the third quarter we completed construction and started up a 1,000 GPM amine treatment facility, which is located adjacent to our existing 300 GPM amine facility at Hall Summit in northwest Louisiana. The new facility is designed to treat roughly 350 million cubic feet a day of raw Haynesville and lower Cotton Valley gas to remove CO2, to treat the gas so that it meets pipeline quality specs.
The treatment facilities combined with Field Services’ gathering system allows QEP Energy to sell into multiple interstate pipelines that serve the area, so furtherance of our hub concept of maximizing value of our production stream.
Let me give you a little color on our expectations for the remainder of 2010. As we announced in our release, we now expect our production to range from 225 Bcfe to 227 Bcfe this year.
I know many of you’ve done the math and are wondering why production guidance isn’t higher given our third quarter production volumes. We expect to be at the high end of that guidance range, absent any unforeseen events, but we don’t expect to exceed it dramatically.
As we continue delineating and saving our Haynesville leases, we’re completing more and more wells in very close proximity to existing Haynesville producing wells. In order to avoid damage to those existing wells, we shut in the direct offset to a new well that’s being fracture-stimulated.
So depending on the location of the new well, we can have as many as eight direct existing Haynesville producing wells shut in at any given time. It’s not just our own fracture stimulations activity, it’s also the activity of direct offset operators to our existing wells that would cause us to shut in production.
We’re doing this same thing, that is shutting in offset wells to wells that are being fracture-stimulated in the Granite Wash and Cana plays as well. It’s less of a factor there because of the relatively lower amount of development activity.
Obviously, shut-ins of these wells can have a significant impact on production volumes over the course of the quarter, and as we drill out now the final sections in our Haynesville play, we’ll see more and more impact of direct offset shut-ins.
Also remember that while 54% of our third quarter production volume came from the mid-continent, we still have significant exposure to the Rockies and in particular Pinedale where you’ll remember we suspend completion activity during the coldest months of the year.
As I mentioned earlier, we’ve just completed our 92nd well at Pinedale on our way to about 100 wells total for the year, so we’ll see the normal seasonal impact on production volumes a little earlier at Pinedale than we have in previous years. We’re more efficient and faster at completing wells.
Finally, and this is I think an important point, we are trying not to overdrive growth in dry gas production volumes into this currently very weak natural gas price environment. I know many of you tuned in today to get some color on our plans for next year. Unfortunately because of the timing of the spin-off and our board meetings, the timing of today’s earnings call and our third quarter board meeting in which we discuss our plans for the coming year and seek approval on our capital budgets are reverse this year.
So as a result I’m not going to be able to give guidance on 2011 CapEx or production volumes, and I don’t want to front run our board’s decision-making process.
So I’m going to refrain here from giving you a lot of detail on our plans, other than I’ll give you some general philosophical comments about our planning process, the charge that I gave our asset managers as we prepare to review and present to our board our plans for 2011. So here are some key metrics, sort of key philosophical thoughts that go into our planning process.
First, we intend to live in and around EBITDAX in 2011. We don’t think that anyone listening in on this call will reward us for outspending our EBITDAX in order to drive production growth in a weak natural gas commodity tape.
Second, we’re going to allocate capital to our highest return plays preferentially, and those are obviously the liquids rich gas plays and oil plays.
Third, we are going to strive to maintain operational efficiencies in our dry gas plays to preserve our low-cost advantages that we’ve embedded in our core plays at Pinedale and Haynesville. So that implies a certain level of critical mass or certain level of drilling activity in each of those plays, and very frankly we’re still struggling to figure out what that minimum level is that allows us to preserve the efficiencies.
Fourth, we’re going to press forward as expediently as possible to complete the gas processing projects, because obviously those plants already play on liquids and to the extent that we can accelerate completion of those projects, we can increase liquids production volumes at QEP Resources. Fifth, we’re focused on delivering profitable growth. We believe we can continue to drive mid-teens growth in this business profitably by watching our capital cost and continue to drive efficiencies in our core areas.
So, what does this mean? Our base case plan for the next year fits all of these criteria. Our base case capital budget of 2011 will likely be down a $200 million from the roughly $1.4 billion that we expect to invest this year, and we think we can still propel profitable mid-teens production growth in our E&P business.
Of course, we are in a very dynamic commodity price environment, so as a result our plans are going to remain fluid and will remain fluid even after our board approves our plan for 2011 as we watch the commodity price environment and continue to respond with our operations. After our board meeting in November, which will be on the 16, we will issue a press release summarizing our 2011 capital budget and financial and production guidance for the coming year.
So with that, Shaira, I will ask you to open the line for questions.

Obviously, we’re doing as you guys are doing, we’re listening to the calls of our partners and trying to understand, and we’re obviously having conversations directly with them, understand their plans for capital allocation next year.
One of the big drivers of this year’s capital budget has been third-party activity and you notice that we increased our capital budget slightly for the remainder of this year in part in response to third-party activity in the Haynesville, Cana, and Granite Wash plays where we saw opportunities to participate in wells and we think that we needed to participate in those wells and sort of our inability to instantaneously dial down our own operated activity in response to the overall activity level.
So when I think about it, I think in the Haynesville, we’re going to see a fundamental shift in capital away from the Haynesville as the industry in general drills up the remaining leases. I know from our own portfolio, we’ve got less than 20 remaining sections that we need to preserve with production. So we see the same thing in the adjacent leases that we don’t operate but in which we have an interest. Most of them now have producing wells. So the pressure to drill just to preserve leases in the Haynesville has subsided and will continue to subside. So, we’re forecasting less outside operated capital next year. I don’t have the exact number off the top of my head, but intuitively I think you’d understand that.
On the flip side, in the Cana Shale play we know from the discussions with the other two main operators in the play and from coverage of their comments on activity that we’re going to see an increase in capital allocation to outside operated wells in the liquids-rich plays, and we are also forecasting additional outside operated activity in the Bakken Three Folks where we have working interest in wells that are outside of our core acreage block shown on our maps. So longwinded answer.
I think overall a likely decline in outside operated dollars and maybe a little more predictable than this year because a lot of the activity has been a struggle for us to predict, because it’s driven not by economic so much as by leasehold capture.
I would point out that we are not just blindly participating in wells. We have actually non-consented Haynesville well in the quarter. It was a well that to us didn’t make economic sense even at $6 or $8 gas. It looked like about a 2 Bcf EUR well, and the well was drilled in spite of our non-consent. So we’re not just blindly participating in wells, because we think that there are wells that are being drilled that shouldn’t be drilled at any gas price.

These wells hang in there fairly well. I’m just looking at a table here that I’ve got. First 30 days the average for all of our Bakken wells has been 660 barrels per day on a first 30-day average. I point out that we don’t install facilities in order to capture that flush multi-thousand barrel a day, first 10 or 15-day rate that would obviously up that first 30-day. We just don’t think it makes economic sense. So we probably see a distorted average there.
And then for the Three Forks it’s basically the same. The Three Forks well for the first 30 days was 630 barrels. So when we translate that into EURs, we see EURs in the 400,000 to 600,000 barrel range for these wells and one data point does not make a play, but the Three Forks well looks for all intents and purposes identical to a Bakken well as far as the early performance and EUR.

The quality of those well locations in places like the Haynesville, the Bakken, the Granite Wash, the Cana, the quality of the stuff it’s not in the five-year proved window, is no different than the wells we’re drilling today.
So the challenge that we face and the challenge that our folks are looking at acquisition opportunities to come back to me and present arguments is that we struggle to find things in the acquisition universe, especially when you think about the premiums that are being paid for oily or liquids rich properties that generate full cycle returns that are more attractive than the stuff we’ve already captured in our portfolio. We are doing some organic leasing.
Richard mentioned we spent a little over $90 million this year in leasehold acquisition. A lot of that’s focused on oil plays and we’ve picked up now over 80,000 acres in the Niobrara. We don’t know if it’s going to work or not. I mean it’s too early in the exploration cycle for the Niobrara to really have a firm view on the play in general. We think we need that exposure and that’s a relatively low-cost option. We’re under $400 an acre in our Niobrara acreage, so it has not been a major capital outlay, but it’s a very attractive option to have in our portfolio.

I think the geology is a lot more complicated than we had originally anticipated. For once, the complicated geology was actually positive. Going back and looking at some of the production logs and some of the analyses of the vertical wells that we’ve drilled, a handful of vertical wells we’ve drilled across our acreage, we now see the evidence, now that we know where to look for it, liquids production from the Atoka wash is over our acreage.
So we’re very encouraged by the wetter, more liquids-rich gas streams that we’re seeing in these wells, and obviously it has a very positive impact on the economics of the play. So we think for the broader part of our acreage that the Atoka is going to be a more liquids-rich gas than we had originally anticipated, and is in dramatic contrast to the Atoka section further to the north which must not be connected in the same petroleum system, so therefore it’s an isolated data point.

So we want to see the well results from this play, from the Borie prospect. If the Borie prospect turns out to be commercial, then we could move into the development of that particular prospect fairly quickly.
On the more traditional or basin-centered part of the play, there is going to be a lot of industry wells drilled. There are a lot of industry wells being drilled as we speak, and ultimately we’ll see the results of those wells and that will help us de-risk our acreage without having to drill a lot of QEP-operated wells. Obviously if we see encouragement there, we can start to shift capital towards the Niobrara and dial down some of our other lower return stuff. David, we’re speculating about non-existent results right now. So give us a few quarters to see how the play drills out here.

We have a third-party petroleum engineering firm, Ryder Scott, that prepares all of our proved reserve estimates. As you know, the new SEC rules give a fairly broad interpretive option to producers on how they prove reserves. There is no longer the single direct offset to a producing well constraint, but I would submit to you that I think we’re still relatively conservative on how we book proved reserves.
For instance, in the Haynesville shale play, we have a maximum of two proved locations per 640 acres. Ultimate density in the Haynesville, we think ultimately the play will get drilled up to 80-acre density. We’re going to do some piloting over the next 12 months or so to prove that, but we won’t book four or eight locations per section until we’re absolutely certain that that’s the appropriate density. We had at the yearend last year, even though we had production from the Bakken on our acreage in North Dakota, no proved reserves assigned to the Bakken. So we have been I think very conservative in our approach to reserve bookings.
The comment you made about the relative PUD to PDP ratio is a hallmark of the transition from traditional conventional reserves to the resource play arena where as you correctly point out, a producing well allows you to spin up additional proved and developed location around it and now with the enhanced or expanded definition of proved reserves in the SEC guidelines even additional locations. We’ve tended to be quite I think conservative in our approach to booking undeveloped locations. Does that get at your question? Maybe not.

At Pinedale we have a very well defined and well behaved predictable result from every location that we drill. The reserve assignments have been relatively predictable. The initial rates are very predictable. So at Pinedale, we drill on the appropriate well density to maximize the recovery of the gas in place and then superimposed on that are some constraints that are placed on us because of environmental restrictions that force us to develop the field from south to north. So that’s an external constraint. The Hayneville, it’s too early to know yet whether there are sweet spots or poor quality spots that might ultimately impact the well density.
From everything we’ve seen so far, the acreage that we have is in a broad high quality sweet spot in the reservoir, but we don’t have enough closely spaced well data to see homogeneity or heterogeneity in the reservoir yet. There’s been enough variability, frankly, in completion designs that you’ll need to throw out a lot of the data from the early wells that were frac-ed with ten-stage fracs and with short laterals, etcetera. What we need to do is drill pilot programs at what we believe is the appropriate density and see some longer-term production results before we can opine upon the ultimate density. Again, we think all of our acreage in the Haynesville is economically viable. We want to capture all that acreage. So right now we are focused on drilling wells to save leases with the producing well on each section.

When folks ask about efficiencies, you can see both in the Haynesville and the Pinedale the way we’ve driven the on-cycle times in drilling. We’ve also done the same thing in completions. We average four days to frac a Haynesville well. We are working on multiple wells and at Pinedale at the same time on a pad fracing them and we get a couple of wells out over the course of a couple of days.
So the ability to not only control the iron whether it be drilling rigs or fractures, but I would submit to you that over half of the efficiency gains and the results that we are delivering are the result of the teams that we have put together to execute our capital plans and these teams are comprised of handful of QEP employees and a large number of third parties, whether they’re employees of joint contractors or service companies and then our coterie of consultants that we have hired who are independent contractors that work for us who basically are our proxy in the field. They are very talented. They are in high demand and we strive to maintain a level of activity to keep those core teams together.
So what does that translate into? It’s a minimum rig count in our core plays because ultimately we have to drill a certain number of wells in order to keep a frac crew dedicated to us in a core play and to keep the efficiency machine alive and well.
The thing that is amazing to me if we had said here in 2005 or 2006 at Pinedale we were in the mid-40s on drill times and I would have been excited if someone had told me we could get to the mid-30s and today since our last call we’ve increased or improved our record time at Pinedale down from 11.7 days down to 11.5 days at Pinedale for 14,300 foot well. So it’s not like we are just preserving a baseline of efficiency. We are continuing to drive down well cost and cycle times, and it’s more than half people. I would say it’s probably 70-30 people and iron. You have to have good rigs, you have to have good frac crews, but you have to know how to use them efficiently and that’s a core skill set that we need to preserve.
What are the absolute levels of drilling activity? Is it four rigs at Pinedale, five rigs? I am not sure. We’ll know it when we get there and our challenge is not to go past it because once we go past it, we believe that there is basically a step change in well cost as we lose some of the critical efficiencies. In the Haynesville, is it six rigs, is it five rigs? I don’t know yet, but there are again efficiency losses that result in $1 million or $2 million increases in well cost for typical Haynesville well if we lose the critical mass. So that’s what we’re struggling with. We spend a lot of time in our offsite planning meeting with our asset managers about a month ago trying to get at that question, and it’s not a simple question to answer.

When our Black’s Fork II cryo plant comes on, we’ll go from roughly 6,000 barrels a day of liquids in our Midstream business but to 22,000 barrels a day or 22,500 barrels a day which will start to push the ratio out even more.
As I said, I’m not going to give you details on our forecast for next year because we don’t have a capital budget approved by our Board but as we see a shift in drilling activity in the Cana and the Granite Wash as well as more activity in the Bakken and Three Forks, we’ll continue to see that 85%, 15% mix change. But importantly, Brian, I think about it more on sources of revenue and if we think about even today, our sources of revenue are about 66% from dry gas and 34% from oil and NGLs on a QEP Resources consolidated basis.
With the new plants coming on, with continued emphasis on allocating capital to the wetter portion of our E&P portfolio, I shouldn’t say wet. The revenue mix will start to move towards 50-50 in the current forward commodity price take. So, you’re seeing the diversification not only in our Upstream business but also the benefits of being in the Midstream business and extracting liquids from the gas stream. Pinedale is not a trivial contributor to liquids volumes because of the large volume of gas that we currently produce there.

Again, I don’t want to front-run, our planning meeting with the board, we look at acreage acquisitions as a discretionary item in our budget. It’s just like outside operators activity, it’s hard to predict where opportunities will present themselves to continue to consolidate our existing acreage box, so a fair chunk of the capital we spent this year on leasehold acquisition was acquiring additional interest in the Cana shale play as a result of the force tooling process in Oklahoma.
We also spent a fair amount of capital capturing new leasehold in the Niobrara play. We were already actively leasing there, primarily in the Powder River Basin, but we entered the DJ Basin and we were able to assemble a nice acreage position there before leasehold prices just skyrocketed. I won’t give you the details right now on what I think our leasehold budget will be next year. It won’t be substantially different than what was forecasting the spend this year, probably a little less, but not a lot less.

So you’ve noticed that the most recent wells primarily have been targeting the Atoka Wash as the deeper washes in the section and that’s delivered in order to establish production there and preserve the leases. We originally thought that we were going to have to gut up and do that and suffer basically a dry gas stream from these wells but we needed to establish a commercial production to do it, to preserve our leases. The pleasant surprise has been the amount of liquids associated with the gas in these deeper zones which have made the economics of these wells quite attractive.

That equipment, the construction, offsite construction, if you will, those skids will continue through the winter and they will be trucked out to the plant site and installed when the weather gets better in the spring, but it’s a modular style plant which allows us to not suffer the normal slowdowns that we see, where we are stick building the plant out in Wyoming in the middle of the winter.

First of all, this is, we run our Blacks Fork processing hub as basically at a dew point control hub where we have processed gas and we have bypass gas around Blacks Fork and blended it with processed gas to meet pipeline quality spec. So, today, if you could go out there and instantaneously appear with a plan, you could capture 15,000 barrels a day of liquid right now from the gas that’s going around the Blacks Fork complex and going into interstate commerce in the various interstate pipes and being sold as methane dollars. So that’s why I say my only regret is that we didn’t build the plant two years ago because we would have been capturing that 15,000 barrels a day two years ago.
So that’s an important point because in many instances when you build midstream assets, you have to wait multiple years for the production volumes to catch up with the capacity that you build because you build it in chunks and then you wait for the production volumes to fill that capacity. This is an unusual plant because it’s full day one.
As to the equity molecules, we have a roughly 62% working interest in the northern third of the Pinedale Anticline and as a result, roughly 62% of the molecules following through that plant belong to us and then we are processing the other gas on a keep-whole basis so we are taking the liquids out of the gas stream and we are redelivering to the customer methane molecules the equivalent number of BTUs of methane molecules in exchange for the liquids. Did I get it, right? Okay. I’m looking at Jay Neese.

In the back, in the appendixes we have a series of charts that show gas price sensitivity and rates of return at a variety of NYMEX prices, but we also have just so you can compare apples and apples, we’ve got a BTAX return and BTAX PV10 on a $5 NYMEX gas and $65 oil case. So you can pump through those and see the relative economics of each of our plays.
Now, we have to take one step back from the well at Pinedale and look at the asset from QEP Resources’ prospective because of course the Midstream business Field Services is generating additional cash flow and returns in that business. We don’t cross-subsidize our businesses. So when you look at the economics of a Pinedale well, you are seeing the wellhead economics of the sewerage stream as it leaves the field and you see the netbacks to the E&P company and then there is a separate set of economics that you need to look at for the processing and gathering business downstream of the wellhead and we think we generate 15% plus returns in that business as well.

Pinedale is a very unique asset. It is a very compact accumulation of gas. In fact, there’s probably more gas per square mile or square kilometer at Pinedale than any other gas accumulation I can think of in the world. So because of that compactness, we get a lot of operational efficiencies. We drill our wells from pads. We have a centralized gathering system for our gas and for the liquids phase as they come out of the ground with the gas. So, our operating cost is quite low. We handle all of our produced water with pipes and as a result, we look at cash cost at Pinedale of $0.40 roughly.
When you think about that compared to the Midcontinent region, in the Eastern Midcontinent which is primarily our Haynesville operation, we see cash cost of $0.47 or so. So nearly double and in the Western Midcontinent where we have a lot of produced water handling in our Granite Wash wells, that makes up to 5,000 barrel a day, in some instance, water during initial flow back and we have a lot of older wells, we have operating cost of nearly $0.70, $0.69 on a year-to-date basis. And I don’t think there is an asset in North America that has a lower cash lifting cost than Pinedale. And then if you look at our operations in the Midcontinent region, they are sort of typical in the $0.40 to $0.50 range depending on the assets.
