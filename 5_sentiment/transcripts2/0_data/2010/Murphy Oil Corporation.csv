Net income for the fourth quarter of ‘09 was $318.8 million or $1.65 per diluted share. That compares to net income in the fourth quarter of ‘08 of $127.4 million or $0.67 per diluted share. For the full year of 200",689,"Thanks, Craig and welcome everyone. Net income for the fourth quarter of ‘09 was $318.8 million or $1.65 per diluted share. That compares to net income in the fourth quarter of ‘08 of $127.4 million or $0.67 per diluted share. For the full year of 2009, net income totaled $837.6 million or $4.35 per diluted share, compared to net income in 2008 of $1.74 billion or $9.06 per diluted share.
In 2009, fourth quarter included $185.3 million of after tax benefit, which included after tax interest income of $27 million, from anticipated recovery of royalties paid on certain deepwater oil and gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico.
The interest income is included in our corporate segment with the remaining $158.3 million included in our E&P segment. As you’re probably aware this recovery is as a result of a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirming in 2009 that the U.S. government improperly collected royalties on these leases when oil and gas prices exceeded certain levels.
The ‘09 quarter also included a $31.3 million after tax charge associated with an anticipated reduction of our working interest in Azurite field offshore Eastern Canada due to redetermination process currently underway. There were no unusual items of significance in the 2008 quarter.
Looking at income by segment, E&P segment earnings in the fourth quarter of ‘09 was $339.1 million, compared to $68.6 million in the fourth quarter of ‘08. Higher earnings in the ‘09 quarter were primarily attributable to the previously mentioned anticipated recovery of deepwater Gulf of Mexico royalties.
In 2009 quarter also benefited from higher oil prices, higher natural gas sales volumes and lower exploration expenses. The ‘09 quarter was adversely affected by lower natural gas prices and the redetermination charge.
Crude oil and gas liquids production from continuing operations averaged over 138,000 barrels per day in the ‘09 quarter, compared to 122,300 barrels per day in ‘08 primarily as a result of production from Thunder Hawk in the Gulf of Mexico an Azurite offshore the republic of Congo, both of which commenced in third quarter of ‘09.
Natural gas volumes were 306 million cubic feet a day in the ‘09 quarter compared to 53 million cubic feet a day in ‘08. The increase primarily due to production from Sarawak, which started at September of ‘09 and increased volumes from Tupper and Kikeh, which both started up in December of ‘08.
The downstream segment, the net loss in the fourth quarter of ‘09 of $4.1 million compared to income of $140.5 million in the fourth quarter of ‘08. The main drivers in the income reduction for the ‘09 quarter were significantly weaker margins realized in the U.S. retail business and in U.K. refining.
In corporate segment, net charges of $15.5 million in the fourth quarter of ‘09 compared to net charges of $76 million in the fourth quarter of ‘08. In 2009, we experienced lower foreign exchange losses partially offset by higher net interest expense. 2009 quarter also included the interest benefit from anticipated royalty recovery related to certain Gulf of Mexico leases.
Capital expenditures for 2009 totaled approximately $2.2 billion. Approximately 82% or some $1.8 billion was spent in the E&P segment, $426 million in exploration, and remainder for development projects with Tupper, Kikeh, Sarawak gas, Thunder Hawk and Azurite projects accounting for the bulk of the expenditures.
2010, our budgeted capital expenditures, which were approved by our Board in early December totaled $2.4 billion with approximately 83% or $2 billion for the E&P segment. Of that, approximately $1.5 billion is for development projects, the remainder approximately $500 million is to be spent on exploration activities.
In 2009, we’re very active in acquiring leases especially in the Eagle Ford Shale, but for 2010 will be much more tilted toward exploration drilling activity. Our budget assumed WTI pricing of $65 per barrel and Henry Hub pricing of $5 per Mcf. At year end 2009, Murphy’s long term debt amounted to approximately $1.35 billion or 15.7% of total capital employed, cash, cash equivalents, and short term investments and marketable securities totaled approximately $1.1 billion.
With that I’ll turn it over to Dave.

This quarter closes out my first year as Chief Executive Officer of Murphy Oil and it’s hard to believe an entire year has passed so quickly. 2009 was an uncertain and challenging year, but one for which I assure you that Murphy was ready. Financial flexibility, reserve cash balances and ample credit capacity that we can continue on track with our plan as well as look for buying opportunities.
Historically, we tend to capture quality opportunities, when conditions are at their poorest. This go round we used the low point in North American natural gas prices to expand our footprint at Tupper in British Columbia and aggressively a new trend at Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas.
Our aim is simple, to assimilate an impactful, long term position in high quality, lower cost onshore natural gas to complement our main oil based portfolio. We also stepped into the buyer fuels business and purchased an ethanol plant to balance part of our U.S. retail plant.
Looking back, the three fields promised to come on in 2009 did, Azurite, Thunder Hawk and Sarawak gas. All performed as or above expectations below ground, which is always the key for me. Above ground, slower ramp up at Sarawak gas was vexing, but all three are making important cash flow contribution at the levels we expect.
Continued expansion of our North American natural gas position was targeted for 2009 and to that end we added 42,000 net acres to the Montney, British Columbia position. We sanctioned the Tupper West into the Eagle Ford Shale play in March and by the end of the year are moving on towards 200,000 leased acres having just drilled our first promising well.
Exploration activity was below the level we like due to pairing of the overall budget to live within cash flows as oil prices collapsed. We did have encouraging results with four out of five exploration wells finding potentially develop our projects, of these three will see a close in 2010.
On balance, and given the external circumstances I am pleased with how we performed in 2009, but 2010 gets a fresh opportunity to take our business further upward. For 2010, our capital expenditure budget is $2.4 billion, of which $400 million is allocated to downstream and $2 billion to upstream.
Downstream expenditures include approximately $200 million to build 80 additional retail sites at our program. This is up from the 26 built in 2009. Of the upstream capital, $1.5 billion will be spent on development, major projects including Tupper main, Tupper West, Sarawak gas, Kikeh, Azurite around Eagle Ford, with the remainder, approximately $500 million, as Kevin mentioned to be spent on exploration with 10 meaningful wells across our acreage positions.
Production guidance for the full year 2010 remains just north of 200,000 barrels equivalent a day, which would represent a 23% increase over 2009 volumes, on the back of a full year of production from Azurite, Thunder Hawk and Sarawak gas, as well as startup volumes from the Eagle Ford.
Meanwhile, our major oil development at Kikeh continues to perform nicely at PETRONAS. Importantly, 2010 will be our third consecutive year of meaningful production increases as historical success through drill bit is now translating into important sources of cash, earnings and scale for the company.
As I mentioned last quarter, I feel very good about our reserve bookings for 2009. While analysis is still ongoing and results are still preliminary, we should replace over 150% of the year’s production with a finding and development cost of approximately $17.50, that’s almost 50% lower than last year’s number, and clearly on the right track.
We will see reserve increases from a variety of assets, Kikeh, Tupper, Sarawak Gas and initial bookings at Azurite, reflecting that many of our developments are reaching the required maturity levels to satisfy current SEC booking requirements. Moving to exploration, the dry holes reported in Malaysia during the quarter, while always disappointing, were not particularly impactful to the overall exploration program.
So let me attempt to put them in a proper context. Siakap II was an 11 million barrel prospect targeted as a future subs in time to Kikeh. It was drilled now mainly for informational purposes prior to unitization of our larger Siakap North scope. The unsuccessful well at Siakap II has no bearing on our previously disclosed reserve estimates for that Siakap North field.
Our Jangus number one well, as you recall, was drilled in 2005, and found over 50 meters of net oil cane reservoirs. We drilled the Jangus II well as a far step out to test a separate compartment of a much larger mega feature. We found similar reservoirs to the Jangus I well, but they contain natural gas with little oil.
Two additional separate compartments remain to be tested and we continue to believe the potential remains for the oil portion of the field as tested by the original Jangus number one well. As I mentioned earlier, Murphy is getting back into the business of exploration with many key impact wells in our 2010 schedule.
I would like to see us back at the 12 plus exploration wells per year level we targeted before the 2008 price collapse. At that level of activity and with any acceptable success, we will see growth to our company from that program.
Highlighting our 2010 exploration program includes activity in the Gulf of Mexico. We are currently participating at a 9.375% working interest in the drilling of the Deep Blue prospect in Green Canyon. Deep Blue was what we used to call Nautilus is a high quality forward dip feature for niacin deep targets with predrill reserve estimates between 100 million and 400 million barrels. The well is drilling at intermediate deck and is expected to TD sometime late first quarter.
After that, we will test the prospect near our Dalmatian discovery in DeSoto Canyon that we call BC4. Murphy has a 64% working interest in the prospect, which we estimate to be in the 50 Bcf size range. A discovery here would complement our Dalmatian development that we aim to sanction this year.
In Malaysia, we plan to test a couple of prospects in Block H, where we still believe there is the potential for oil. Targets will be around 100 million barrel range. The first of two wells will commence drilling in the second quarter. In the Republic of Congo, we will explore the area around last year’s Turquoise discovery, which lies 17 miles north of our Azurite oil development.
We will also see the first well in the adjoining Mer Profonde block, success here would open up a whole new play area for us, again for oil targets. In eastern Indonesia we will drill our first well on our offshore Semai II block which Murphy holds a 28.3% interest. This well targeting very large oil and natural gas targets in jurassic aged objectives should spud toward the end of 2010.
In surname where we hold 100% interest, we will plan to drill two wells back to back, starting late in the year, again for 100 plus million barrel oil targets. On balance, our exploration plans for the year weighted towards oil and sizable individual prospects provides attractive exposure to impact reserves.
On the development side, work continues at Tupper where we are currently producing nearly 80 million cubic feet a day and at Tupper west where we will add 180 cubic feet a day at natural gas volumes in second quarter of 2011. We are off to a great start with our Eagle Ford Shale program in south Texas. We recently announced the discovery at our first well, the George Miles number one drilled in McMullen County.
Initial rate of flow from the well was approximately 7.5 million cubic feet a day. This was increased to 11.7 million cubic feet a day once tubing was run. That well is hooked up and making sales at approximately 4 million cubic feet a day and still has a lot of water to come out of the well before we get the improved rate.
We have reached TD on our program’s second well, this one in Karnes County. Frac operations should start within a couple of weeks. That rig is now rigging up to spud Oasis Mineral Company MOH well in LaSalle County. We have added a second rig that should be active for us in mid February. This is being brought forth from our original plans. We will continue to assess the results and evaluate adding additional rigs to this program through the year.
In our downstream business, we’re always undergoing a 30 day turnaround, which should conclude early next month and to a 60 day turnaround at the end of February. Margins in the refining part of the business of course remain challenged. Focus this year is on reliability, optimization and cost control.
On the retail side in the U.S. margins during the quarter were tough during October and November, but December shaped up to be a good month. Sales volumes remained at the 350,000 gallons per month range throughout the quarter. Currently margins are good and we hope they hang in there. In 2010, we will be growing our chain of 1,050 retail locations, by adding an additional 80 sites, which will be a combination of Murphy USA locations at Wal-Mart super centers and our standalone Murphy express offer.
The purchase of ethanol plant in Hankinson, North Dakota in October was time correct with the cast of the asset on attractive below replacement cost price. The plant has been generating net income since we restarted its operations. We expect the ethanol business to be an important contributor to downstream earnings and cash flow this year.
As we entered 2010 it was appropriate to reset our score card with new goals and I would like to share those with you. First goal is that we look to at 10 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in North America to our portfolio and I believe we are two thirds of the way there with our combined acreage position of Tupper and Eagle Ford, as results so far in both areas have been very encouraging. I am pleased to go the rest of the way by expanding our positions in those existing plays or potentially adding a third to our portfolio.
The second item I have on our score card is our U.S. retail offering has been the strongest contributor to our iron business, averaged over the last five years. So for 2010, we will help you understand, why we’d like this piece of business and its value contribution and the third item on the score card and most importantly is that we include meaningful exposure to reserve additions through the drill bit.
With impact exploration wells across our major acreage positions began with a strong emphasis on oil targets. Getting back to exploration at higher levels for us is the key. In closing let me say I’m proud of the way Murphy weathered, unpredictable and challenging conditions of last year and of the quality assets we were able to add to our portfolio.
Throughout the year we maintained our financial discipline while moving quickly to secure the Eagle Ford acreage and achieved a cost effective entry into the mandated ethanol business. This year we aim to move the needle further through exploration and I think we have a portfolio we seemed to do it. In downstream it will be a tough year, but as I mentioned we will be adding 80 locations to our U.S. retail offering.
That concludes my prepared remarks and I am now happy to take your question.

Let me kind of break it down. I think up in Canada, we have the two sanctioned developments for Tupper Main, which is producing and Phase I of Tupper West, probably halfway to 3 Tcf and I can see that doubling and maybe a bit better than that with the acreage we currently have under lease, all at this 160 acre spacing.
On top of that, of course if we can go from 160 acres to 80 acres, there’s additional upside. So I would say that of the two thirds, 10 Tcf better than half is there on acreage we’ve already identified. We’ve drilled a lot of wells. We’re on production and feel real good about what we have.
The Eagle Ford, we ourselves have not drilled many wells. Actually, we’ve really only drilled two wells and only flow tested one well, but we’re in a great location with our acreage in LaSalle and McMullen County, where we have over 100,000 acres in the key part of the play as we see it.
I’m very encouraged with the well that we’ve drilled and very encouraged with the core information that we’re just starting to get in. So if you take any reasonable amount of parameters there, I think you can get our acreage and risked, of course, another three plus TCF. So that’s kind of how I break it down, Mark, in getting towards that 10. Again, the upside of down spacing exists in both those plays.

So I’m actually not surprised that we didn’t find any liquids here. I think the $11.7 million rate is a good rate. We clearly need to dewater that well some more. I think we recovered just over 8% of the water that we put in. Typically, these wells start to show their true quality once you get well north of 10 and so we’re a little way off there. One of the nice things is, we did hook this up and are making sales so I kind of like that. We did find a small concentration of CO2 here, 4%. So we’re going to put a aiming unit on this area and I think once we have that and dewater the well, I think we’ll do much better.
The second well that we’re drilling that we’re getting ready to frac now is up in Karnes County and it is in the oil rich window and so I’m very interested, as all the team here is, to see what we do there. So we’re fortunate to have an acreage position that allows us to access both the oil component, as well as hopefully the higher rate gas components in that play.

I will say that they got rid of the guy that was managing that program and got another guy in charge. The guy that was running that program was me. So I don’t do that anymore. There are smarter, more capable people doing that with that approach. So I will say from that viewpoint, we’ve done that.
If you actually look over the last five or six years, the types of fields that Kikeh is and are, I mean we found Kikeh, we found Kakap, those don’t come around all the time. I think you have to look at the underlying success rate and we have been up and down. Just last year, we actually made some pretty nice attractive discoveries individually, not large, but definitely added to our program.
So I think the issue really is why have we not found another significantly large deal and I think that’s a bigger issue than anything else. I don’t expect every year to find one of those. I think what you do is you put yourself in a position to have a chance. We have been successful in Congo in a new province, an oil field on production and a discovery that followed on and that play is about a one in three type of prospectivity.
So the program is looked at all the time. It’s looked at by people that are new to the company that have new ideas. So I think once we get back to being active, which is critically important. I think you will start to see results from the program. Get back to hopefully where we were before.

We really like Seal and what was happening in that area was that we cut our activity because of budget controls. We did not do the EOR last year that we wanted to do because we were trying to manage our discretionary spend. We’re back to doing that this year. We’re back to adding a pipeline up there, which will give us a fuller season of production and reduce some of the risk on trucking.
If I look at the total play there, primary production we recover about 6% to 7% of the oil in place. If this EOR works and this pilot will tell us a lot this year then you’re likely to go up to, I don’t know, 12%, 13%, 14%, maybe eve 15% of the oil in place and that’s a meaningful number and $30 million, $40 million, $50 million barrel type number.
So I’m very keen to get after that and I think this year we’re in better shape than we were last year or the year before to get after that program. So that’s kind of how I view Seal, I like it and we are going to go back to work
In terms of your F&D question, it’s pretty much a wash with the inclusion of Syncrude. If I look at the top five reserve adds this year, Kikeh, Sarawak gas, Tupper, Azurite, right there and I think the important thing to remember is those major fields we have booked a lot less than 50% of the 2P reserves. So we have a little running room in all of our stars here.

Net income in the first quarter of 2010 was $148.9 million or $0.77 per diluted share and this compares to net income in the first quarter of '09 of $171.1 million or $0.89 per diluted share. The 2010 quarter included $41.3 million or $0.21 per diluted share of after-tax losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies compared to after-tax gains of $26.1 million or $0.14 per share on those transactions in the 2009 quarter.
The 2009 quarter also included income from discontinued operations of almost $100 million or $0.52 per share, as we sold our operations in Ecuador. This income included an after-tax gain of $104 million on that sale. Compared to the 2009 first quarter, the 2010 quarter was favorably impacted by significantly higher worldwide cruel oil prices.
In the downstream part of the business, earnings in the 2010 quarter were negatively affected by significantly lower refining margins and planned shut downs for turnaround in our Monroe, Louisiana and Milford Haven, Wales refineries.
Looking at income by segment, in E&P segment from continuing operations net income in the first quarter 2010 was $247 million compared to income from continuing operations in the first quarter of last year of $50.3 million.
Higher E&P earnings for 2010 were mostly attributable to the previously mentioned higher crude oil prices, which were up about 50%, but higher natural gas sales prices and volumes along with lower exploration expenses also contributed. Crude oil, condensate and gas liquids production for the current quarter averaged approximately 139,100 barrels per day in 2010 slightly lower than the 2009 quarter.
Excluding 2009 production from discontinued operations in Ecuador, quarterly production in 2010 increased 4% over last year. The increase from continuing operations was mostly attributable to production from Thunder Hawk in the Gulf of Mexico and Azurite offshore Republic of Congo, which both started up in the third quarter of last year.
Natural gas volumes were 343 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter of 2010 compared to 111 million cubic feet per day last year. This increase was due to the continued ramp up of production at the tougher field in British Columbia, third quarter 209 of production offshore at Sarawak, Malaysia and higher volumes at Kikeh.
In the downstream segment, a net loss in the first quarter of 2010 was $29.7 million and this compares to net income in the first quarter of last year of $10.8 million. We experienced a pretty good quarter in our US marketing operation, which was reporting net income from that segment of about $9 million and those benefits were more than offset by very poor refining margins of both the US and U.K.
Additionally the manufacturing segment was negatively impacted by significant down time related to turnaround activity at both Monroe and Milford Haven refineries. In order to provide additional insight into our business beginning with first quarter 2010, we've segmented our US downstream operations into its manufacturing and marketing components.
Manufacturing segment includes our two US refineries and an ethanol production facility. The Marketing segment includes retail and wholesale fuel marketing operations along with product supply functions.
In the corporate segment, the net loss in the first quarter of 2010 of $68.4 million and this compares to a net benefit in the first quarter of 2009 of $10.1 million. This unfavorable variance is attributable to losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These losses were generated by a combination of a stronger US dollar compared to the British pound and a weaker US dollar compared to Malaysian Ringgit.
At the end of the first quarter 2010, our long-term debt amounted to a good old $1.2 billion or 14% of total capital employed.
And with that I'll turn it over to David.

Externally, the first quarter of 2010 was a continuation of trends established in the second half of 2009, while crude oil prices remain buoyant around $80, a barrel domestic natural gas prices were at $5 per Mcf. Our portfolio heavily weighted towards oil fared reasonably well.
Production for the first quarter averaged over 196,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of which 70% was oil. Projects we brought on last year continued to progress. We have reached Phase I [path] at SK Gas are still ramping up at Azurite and will later this year bring on another well at Thunder Hawk.
Overall, production for the quarter is above projection despite mechanical challenges at Azurite and equipment issues at SK Gas both now behind us.
Tupper main in British Columbia, Canada continues to impress with rates over 90 million cubic feet a day, as we have improved plant capacity there. Tupper West is on track for our Q2 2011 start up from 180 million cubic feet a day new build plan.
At Kikeh, production is good around 116,000-barrels of oil a day with associated gas of late near 120 million cubic feet of gas per day. Our exploration program this year will be a step up in activity from last years and is off to a good start with successful wells just an ounce at DC4 in the Gulf and Dolfin in Malaysia.
At DC4, the well was drilled to a total depth of 13,195 feet and encountered 156 feet of good quality oil pay in three zones. Going in, we ranked this as most likely a gas prospect given proximity to Dalmatian, which we discovered in 2008 but have been very pleasantly surprised.
We are re-looking at development options but still favor here Dalmatian as a subsea natural gas tie back starting later this year. Further appraisal of the DC4 discovery is being worked as well as re-looking at nearby un-drill prospects.
In Malaysia, the Batai well and Block H oil and gas in non-commercial quantities but the follow on Dolfin well in the same block found 33 feet of nice gas today and we look at this as part of the potential development along with our post gas discoveries at Rotan varies.
Drilling is ongoing at our non-operated Deep Blue prospect in Green Canyon 723, where we are extending total debt and should have results in a month. The meet of this year's exploration program still lies ahead of us with key wells in [Sirna Kongo] in Indonesia and all lining up. All our individually impact full and targeted oil.
Onshore here in the US, we have ongoing lease program in the Eagle Ford play in South Texas and have surpassed 200,000 net acres, equally split between the oil and gas on trends. Today, we have two rigs running and will likely add a third mid-year. Four wells have been drilled, as we assess our lease hold for potential focus development.
In the oil trend our number Drees number one in Karnes County came in at 1462-barrels of oil a day plus 1.25 million cubic feet of gas and had a 30-day production average of 1264-barrels of oil and 1.1 million cubic feet of gas per day. Clearly, a very strong well, and one that sets us up for a nice development.
The second well in this acreage block spud shortly. The other two drilled wells are situated in the gas trend and are in various stages of completion. The earlier reported well test at the George Miles number one well in McMullen County is producing at less than 1 million cubic feet a day.
Here our frac treatment did not open up all of the zones we thought and we are re-looking at our options. We have just completed a previously drilled well Ash Number 1 purchased as part of an acreage drill that's in LaSalle County and clean up is just above 2 million cubic feet a day.
Essentially where our suite spots in the Eagle Ford has been the aim so far. As we start to get feedback, like Drees well, we will transition into development mode focusing on improved well delivery, load costs and production growth.
Our budget for the Eagle Ford this near had a nominal 10 million cubic feet a day and clearly we aim to improve on that. On the beauty of this particular play is the ability to ship focus between the oil to the gas parts as product prices dictate.
Production guidance for the second quarter is estimated to be 188,000 barrels of oil equivalent down from the first quarter mainly due to a mechanical issue of the third party facility causing Murphy to flow at reduced gas rates. We also have well intervention work ongoing at Kikeh subsea oil producing well.
Nevertheless, full-year production guidance is still expected to be at 200,000-barrels of oil equivalent with meaningful production increases from second quarter levels projected by both the third and fourth quarters.
In our downstream business, the quarter concluded with mixed results, as refining margins remain weak and show no indication of sustained improvement. Our Monroe refinery was able to complete a successful turnaround and run crude at name plate capacity enabling the refinery to operate with a positive net margin for a portion of the first quarter, which is always a nice thing to see.
Our Milford Haven refinery in the U.K. is trying to coming back online after a 60-day turnaround with the objective of debottlenecking plant and taking throughput from 108,000-barrels to 130,000-barrels per day. In US retail, we had one of our strongest first quarters for margin contribution, as sales volumes remain steady at over 292,000-gallons per month.
In our biofuels business the ethanol plant in Hankinson, North Dakota continues excellent operating performance as well as making net income despite the ethanol prices experienced during the first quarter.
For the remainder of 2010, our upstream focus will be due to exploration, while working to enhance our North American research plays. The big upside remains with drill bit which is meaningful size later in the year.
Tupper is doing well and will grow. Eagle Ford has a fast start in the oil play and we are learning a lot about the quality of our acreage. In US retail, we continue to grow sites now at 1058 with a further 70 planned by year end. In manufacturing the ability to deliver plant capacity consistently is moving forward, so that we can take advantage of any brightness in an otherwise challenged landscape.
That concludes my prepared remarks and I'm now happy to take your questions.

The latest well is an oil well and the other two were gas wells. The first well we drilled, what we've learned there is not all of the frac zones were open so it's an issue with that particular well bore, the IP on that well was over 11 million and so I think we can go back in and do remedial work there.
Similarly, a new well that we actually acquired when we picked up a piece of acreage, which was drilled in and out of zone. It's just flowing at just over 2 million a day that I mentioned and then so we take a look at that, and then the third well which is the oil well in the Carnes is a great well and today, I was looking this morning before I came in and it's flowing 860-barrels of oil and 770,000 cubic feet. So that's after almost 60 days, 58 days today of production, so a real strong well, and so we're continuing on with our program to appraise our acreage across the three different parts, the oil part, the oil and gas part and the gas part and we'll start to focus in.
We should be spudding here pretty soon another well within the next day or so up in the same oil area and that in Carnes County, and so clearly it's got a lot of potential right now.

What was different here in this well is we found three pay sands and about a third more net pay than was thought, which is always a nice thing to happen including the main sand here that's a nice very clean sand over 100 feet of net cut. And we think that was masked somewhat seismically by the presence of the pay sand above it. So that happens and so I accept that.
Oil versus gas is a little bit of a conundrum here because in this big home section and that's the geologic level we're dealing with, quite often it is oil and quite often it is gas. Our risking here going in was that there was only a slight chance of finding oil. As it turned out all three sands are oil. Geophysically attribute wise there's no difference here at all.
In terms of size we had this as a 50-70 Bcf prospect. I think today, we're at 20 to above 20 million barrels oil here and a part of that is because there's more net pay than we originally planned but also I think we've got a little bit better sense of what we're dealing with here.
We're going to go back and recalibrate this of course. We have a number of other amplitude anomalies here to see what else we can do, so good news, nice to find more pay than prognosed and I have to say finding oil which I regard as being a little higher than gas here some bad news are.

We've drilled a number of wells there and to be honest not had the level of success that we would hope but I think what we're realizing is that it's largely gas, this well found oil as we had hoped but the reservoir quality was not good enough.
We've got probably a couple of Tcf, maybe a bit more than that with this new discovery. I think there's two ways to go here, or actually three ways to go. You can tie into some existing infrastructure, you can develop your own infrastructure, or you can do something floating. I think tying into existing infrastructure or developing new infrastructure is probably the way to go but we're not enough volumes proved up yet to do a standalone.
We're working closely with our partner Carigali and looking what our options are. We have a pretty extensive list of prospects remaining on the block. I don't know that any of them are as big as the biggest ones that we found, but there's a lot of them and so I think there's a large resource here, I think, as we continue to appreciate what was there and what commercial issues are, I think ultimately this will be developed and that's my sense. It won't be quick but I think geologically it's a pretty attractive place.

I was particularly targeting North American natural gas a couple years ago when we talked and I think we've done that through lease acquisitions both at Montney and at the Eagle Ford and the target that we had set, which we've been talking about here recently is to get to about 10 Tcf, because I think that is kind of meaningful for our company and we'll probably with what we've got two thirds of the way there.
So, we didn't have to buy anything to get there and we've got ways to get the remaining distance up to the 10-T either by adding a new play looking at that pretty hard all while continuing to grow in the two we've got. So, I feel that that itch and that gap in our portfolio has been scratched.
If you look at our exploration program in the last, or last year and this year so far, we've drilled 10 wells and made six discoveries that are likely to be developed, which is a pretty good rate and higher than I would hope for, but I'm happy to have it.
The thing that's missing in that is this needle moving discovery and I think that's the issue that we have looking forward but the nice thing looking forward is that this year towards the end of the year and it just happens to be that way, we put a number of needle moving prospects. So, if we can have any sort of success rate, then I'll feel real good about our exploration program both this year and then years going forward. So that kind of negates some of the need to go but acquire things having said that if something looks right we kind of take a hard look at it but don't have to do that.

Other parts of the play, we're still evaluating. I talked about a couple of well results that started off and one of them is not as good. We think we understand what that issue is. We got to get our head around that. We've got a couple of wells that we're in the process of fracing now, we need to see those results.
So, this year, as we set it out was one where we were going to evaluate different pockets of our acreage and we're doing that. The early success in Karnes allows us to immediately focus on that. I'm hopeful that we'll have one or two of these other areas have some attraction and then we'd be able to focus in on those. That's kind of a thought process. And then, I think, two wells and adding the two rigs and adding a third rig will get us a level of activity that will process that data gathering along.

Net income for the second quarter of 2010 was $272.3 million or $0.41 per diluted share and this compares to net income in the second quarter of last year of $158.8 million or $0.83 per diluted share.
For the six months of 2010, we had net income of $421.2 million or $2.18 per diluted share and this compares to net income for the six months period of ‘09 of $329.9 million or $1.72 per diluted share.
There were no unusual items of significance in the 2010 quarter or for the 2010 six months period. However, net income in the second quarter of 2009 included combined net charges of $13.4 million or $0.07 per diluted share for several items.
We had an anticipated reduction of our working interest in the Terra Nova field, offshore Eastern Canada and proposed closing settlements related to the sale of our Ecuador properties which was partially offset by insurance settlements related to property damage at the Meraux, Louisiana refinery.
But in 2009 six months period, the net income number included the above-mentioned Terra Nova redetermination and insurance settlements along with income from discontinued operations, primarily related to the sales of Ecuador properties.
Looking at net income by segment; from the E&P segment, net income from continuing operations in the second quarter of 2010 totaled $219.1 million compared with net income in the corresponding 2009 quarter of $118.3 million. Higher E&P earnings for the 2010 quarter primarily attributable to higher crude oil and natural gas price realization and higher sales volumes.
The 2009 quarter included the previously mentioned Terra Nova redetermination charge. Crude oil and gas liquids production for the current quarter were just shy of 132,000 barrels per day as compared to approximately 118,100 barrels per day in the corresponding 2009 quarter, an almost 12% increase.
This was mostly attributable to production from Thunder Hawk in the Gulf of Mexico and Azurite offshore Republic of the Congo, both of which came on stream in the third quarter of 2009.
Natural gas sales volumes were a company record 348 million cubic feet per day in the second quarter of 2010 compared to 147 million cubic feet per day in the second quarter of last year.
This increase was attributable to the third quarter 2009 start up of production from our field offshore Sarawak, Malaysia, continued ramp up of production at Tupper in British Columbia, and higher third-party demand for our gas at Kikeh.
In the R&M segment, we had net income in the second quarter of 2010 of $83.8 million compared to net income in the second quarter of last year of $27.8 million. The earnings increase in the 2010 quarter was primarily attributable to the U.S. Retail segment where fuel margins averaged $16.02 per gallons, up from $7.08 in the 2009 quarter.
In the Corporate segment, in the second quarter of 2010, we had net charges of $30.6 million and this compares to a net benefit in the second quarter of 2009 of $14.8 million.
These higher charges were attributable to a combination of unfavorable foreign exchange results in 2010, relative with the gains realized in the second quarter of 2009, and also had higher net interest expense due to lower amounts capitalized to development projects. As of June 30, 2010, Murphy’s long-term debt amounted to a bit over $1.2 billion, which is approximately 13.8% of total capital employed.
With that, I’ll turn it over to David.

For the second quarter of 2010, crude prices remained range bound at the upper end of $60 to $80 band despite financial turmoil and higher inventory levels. Natural gas in North America was in plentiful supply and prices reflect that.
Absent stronger economic demand, these conditions are likely to persist. The moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico is causing a reaction. Absent a clear way forward on approvals and requirements to operate, industry is in a holding pattern.
We have mobilized one deepwater rig to Africa and have a platform rig haltingly and only as we can obtain approvals. We are fortunate to have the preponderance of our upstream business activities outside the U.S. and as such, can keep our main growth initiatives moving forward. Our U.S. retail had a very good quarter.
Late last month, we announced our intention to divest our refining business. Those plans are well underway. Second quarter results are showing signs of support as crack spreads improve aided by better operational performance.
Global production for the second quarter averaged 189,951 barrels of oil equivalent per day, slightly ahead of our guidance for the second quarter of 188,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
This increase is mostly attributable to higher output across our Malaysian operations, somewhat offset by lower than expected production from Azurite, where our batch drilling operation is behind schedule. Plans are to bring two producers online in the second half of this year to help catch up that production level.
In Malaysia, our Sarawak gas project is at plan and selling 250 million cubic feet per day gross with the recent operational issues at the third-party facility behind us. In Canada, production remained steady in the second quarter, supplying over 47,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, helped by continued strong performance from the Tupper Main development where production is near 90 million cubic feet per day.
We are making positive strides to increase production further at Tupper West, when our 180 million cubic feet per day facility commenced its operation in the first half of 2011.
We currently have six rigs running in Western Canada between our Montney acreage and our heavy oil property at Seal. In the Gulf of Mexico, our non-operating Deep Blue prospect in Green Canyon 723 remains suspended due to the moratorium.
We further delineated our South Acis gas discovery in SK 311 block in Malaysia and down to Kikeh, three reservoirs leading us to consider development options through our West Patricia facility.
Our exploration program with some very attractive needle moving oil targets is poised to begin in earnest in October. We will drill three oil prospects in the Congo, two on the MPS block and our first well on block MPN. We will also spud two prospects in Suriname and one in Indonesia, all starting in the fourth quarter.
Onshore in the U.S., our operations in the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas are moving ahead nicely. We are continuing to add to our land position now well over 200,000 net acres.
In well operations, we initiated flow-back on JOG Unit #1 well in Karnes County. The well was drilled to a total depth of 15,500 feet with the lateral section of 4,205 feet. The well is currently flowing at 524 barrels of oil per day in the initial clean-up stage.
This well is five miles from our previously announced Drees oil well that IPed at 1,476 barrels of oil per day and now five months later that well is still producing at 435 barrels of oil per day. Plans are to continue to appraise this area with likely sanction of an oil develop later in the year.
Also in the quarter, we completed two wells in the dry gas portion of the play, both wells in La Salle County. In Oasis Minerals M # 1 well was completed in May and came in at a rate of 7.6 million cubic feet per day over 72 barrel flow period. The well was completed with a 3,392 foot lateral and 13 frac stages.
The Crescent C #1 well was drilled to a total depth of 16,550 feet with a 3,360 foot lateral section and 15 frac stages and that well had an IP rate of 13.9 million cubic feet a day. Overall the results have been encouraging and we will add a third rig very soon and accelerate drilling in the oil prone areas of the play.
Production guidance for the third quarter is estimated to be 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down from the second quarter. We are impacted by the previously mentioned slow build at Azurite and temporarily lower production from Kikeh where the failure of a coiled tubing unit during the workover on one well has caused us to wait on a rig to arrive in the fourth quarter to complete the workover program.
The drilling moratorium in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico will also impact production in the second half of the year due to delays in rig operations particularly at Front Runner.
Turning to Downstream operations, U.S. retail ran well from the second quarter, capturing solid margins while maintaining high fuel volumes. Refining saw positive net margins early in the quarter at Meraux and asphalt Sales at Superior allowed U.S. manufacturing to make a nice contribution.
In the U.K., our retail group continues to perform well and note that Haven refinery was coming out of turnaround during the quarter with increasing throughput.
In our bio-fuels business the ethanol plant in Hankinson, North Dakota continues to operate optimally and make positive contributions to net income, despite challenging corn and ethanol prices.
We have signed an intent-to-purchase a partly-completed corn-based ethanol plant in Hereford, Texas. Murphy will complete the facility, which is expected to have production of 115 million gallons per year and start up in the first quarter of 2011.
This is another attractively priced asset to boost our retail supply business, where our two plants will cover close to 50% of our ethanol requirements. Our table is set for the second half of the year led by some exciting and potentially impactful exploration.
In recap, onshore drilling in Texas should lead to a planned oil development in Karnes County, good progress is being made in evaluating the upside of our Seal heavy oil acreage in Canada and in the fourth quarter we should see results of our EOR pilots.
We have also been named operator on the Siakap North oil development in deepwater Malaysia and will be stepping up on our plans to bring that important resource back to Kikeh. U.S. retail is operating well and we are looking for the second half to duplicate first half of the year.
That concludes my prepared remarks and I’m now happy to take your questions.

I see a couple of rigs staying there throughout now and we are talking about plans for next year for our total Eagle Ford position, and without having gone through the budget process, we’re probably likely to have five rigs running in the Eagle Ford through next year. So a pretty much stepped up program for us.

We’ve been spending more money on the wells because we’re drilling them straight for the most part doing some quarrying, a lot of logging and then turning them horizontal. So our well costs are kind of the in the $11 million plus, to drill and to frac them. I expect that our costs will come down for drilling from about 5.5 now on average to something less than 4, and I expect our frac costs which are kind of the in the 4.5 and 5.5 range to get down below 4, over the same types of cracks that we’re doing.
The issue and I think other people will have clearly recognized that in the broader play of Eagle Ford, there’s like 85 rigs, but only 18 cracks spreads. So one of the things we want to do when we get ourselves comfortable in developing is get dedicated frac equipment lined up at the same time we have rigs. I think that will drive costs down and I think it will put more efficiencies into our program.

I think that’s a question that everybody is being asked now and we did have a visit by Secretary Salazar to our offshore Front Runner facility here just recently and that is the only facility that we’re aware of that has a rig on it that has any approvals under NTL-05 to actually conduct operations. I think that says two things.
I think it says, great credit to the folks that we have to be able to pass all of the approvals necessary to allow to go back to work for one particular recompletion, but the second thing, it underscores what the real problem is. The real problem here is less to do with the spill-up thing, than it has to do with all of the approvals, some now unknown and some steps unknown, to be able to get back to work, and I think that is going to dictate how the Gulf is going to look like here over the next 24 months.
We still think we have a good business in the Gulf. It is not a super large piece of our overall business as you point out. We have some developments to do. We made a nice discovery in Soto Canyon, we’d like to appraise, and we’ve got some other things like Samurai need appraising and go to production. But until we get very, very clear understanding of what the approvals are it’s very difficult to make any plans in that business, and so that’s the seminal question that we’re facing.
But for us, I like the business and we’d like to keep going in that business. We sent our rig overseas because of the fear that I just expressed which has actually started to come to fruition here. If we can keep our deepwater rig busy in West Africa, then we probably won’t bring it back. But our plan is right now and I have the option to bring that rig back sometime in the second quarter of next year, but I’m going to have to be real comfortable, we’ve got all the approvals necessary and that won’t be changed to get our work done.

So we think that Turquoise area is somewhat de-risk because we already know that some of the channels work and prospect sizes are in the 100 million barrel-type range. Then going further outboard on Turquoise is the same channel that worked at Turquoise, goes over another bump that we call Cobalt, and again that’s about the same size. So we’re trying to focus in on that area because we believe that the main risks, which were top Seal and charge appear to be better understood there and also it’s a logical place to bring them all together in any development that we’d either want to do standalone or tie back to Azurite.

We’ve got five main reservoirs. We inject water down dip. We maintain the pressure. We sweep the oil. We have excellent connectivity between those water injectors and the producers over a long distance. Our wells are designed that we can shut off the water when the water starts to come to a well. We actually have been surprised that for some of the wells we’ve not seen any water at all. So it’s a little bit of good news in that regard.
We were running a production log on coal tubing here to try and find out in one zone has water started to come to the well because we started to see the first early signs. We actually saw that the water levels at the very bottom of this zone, which we regard as being good, and starting to make a little bit of sand, which often is a precursor of water moving into these wells. At that point, the coal tubing frame failed, so we decided not to continue with that operation, but just wait for a rig that we had got coming in the fourth quarter. So we put that well offline.
So the reason why production is down now is because we switched that well off which was making close to 13,000 barrels a day. We have seen on a couple of other wells a small amount of sand and a very small amount of water, and so we’ve kept those back because what we want to do is go in and replace the screens on these wells, and we’ll do that when the rig arrives. We’ll bring in some new technology and do some things there. So it’s kind of a natural history.
We’ve produced now 94 million barrels in this field. The field is performing great. So it’s just a natural step to do that. We should have the first workover well back early in mid November, 12,000 plus barrels back into the mix here and we should have the whole program done in about four months or so. So, really it’s a this-year event and not a next-year event and we’ll be back up to focus on here once all this is done. That gives you a bit color too.

These are named after local birds. It’s a couple of hundred plus million barrel. You can get pretty exotic with size here because these are basically quite large. And then the second is called Caracara. Again, it’s another bird. It’s actually a much larger prospect, and so its size is quite large, much bigger than the 200 million barrels potential. These are shallow water in the sense that 200 to 300 foot water depth.
So, clearly, a discovery would require appraisal, but it’s not inconceivable to see the timeline from discovery to first oil to be four years, five years or less. And the reason why I am hesitating there is, there is not much exposure and experience to offshore developments there in that country. So there’s a natural approval process that it has to go through and education on how things happen there. So that’s the reason. But post-discovery, we’ve got a pretty good experience of getting on with it. I don’t think that we would get anything other than great support from Suriname to be able to do that.
So again, like we did with Kikeh because it would be a new province, I think the schedule of booking would probably be relatively slow. You get an initial booking I believe and then I think you’ll have see some performance going forward, but those are nice problems to have to make nice discoveries of that size and Jack, I’m looking forward to.

I think in terms of the reserves we feel pretty good about the reserves where we are at with Azurite, the issues for us they have really been mechanical in nature. We had a delay in getting wells completed because we had a persistent issue with these formation integrity valves, the 5V [ph] valves that basically keep your zone away from all the stuff you’re doing at hole before you put the well on production and these things wouldn’t open as they are supposed to. So we had some delay there.
The other downhole issue that we’ve had that has impacted production on the one well is a very poor frac pack. I would say that the performances of the zones are in line.

If we were successful in one of these first two, given their potential size, we clearly have to appraise with multiple wells, because these have the potential of being quite large and I think we also want to come back and do some flow testing to get an idea of what the crude is and what kind of rate and how good the reservoir is, et cetera, et cetera.
So I think early success here is really what we would like. That would allow us to focus in on what we’re going to do as the next phase of drilling begin. Because of sharing this rig with other people in that region, there is the opportunity to cycle back into our acreage with the same equipment. So we have built into our full process here if we had early exploration success coming back next year relatively soon and doing some appraisal work there.

Net income in the third quarter of 2010 was $202.8 million or $1.05 per diluted share, and that compares to net income in the third quarter of ‘09 of $188.9 million or $0.98 per diluted share. For the nine months 2010, we had net income of $624 million or $3.24 per diluted share compared to net income for the nine months of ‘09 of $518.8 million or $2.70 per diluted share.
There were no unusual items of significance in the 2010 quarter or for the 2010 nine months period. The 2009 nine month period did however include $97.8 million or $0.51 a share of income from discontinued operations. This was mostly related to a gain on the sale of our operations in Ecuador in March last year.
Looking at net income by segments; the E&P segment, income from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2010 was $186.7 million compared to net income of $184.1 million in the third quarter of last year.
Slightly higher earnings for the 2010 quarter were primarily due to higher crude oil and natural gas price realizations and higher natural gas sales volumes, partially offset by lower crude oil sales volumes and higher exploration and extraction costs.
Crude oil and liquids prices averaged $65.45 per barrel in the third quarter of this year versus $61.13 last year. North America natural gas prices averaged $4.24 per MCF this year, compared to $3.01 last year, while in Sarawak third quarter 2010 natural gas price realizations averaged $5.71 per MCF compared to $3.31 per MCF last year, an increase of over 72%.
Crude oil and gas liquids production from continuing operations for the current quarter was just under 120,000 barrels per day compared to approximately 131,600 barrels per day in the corresponding 2009 quarter. The decrease was mostly due to lower production from Kikeh offshore Malaysia ahead of our planned rig program.
Natural gas sales volumes more than doubled to 371 million cubic feet per day in the third quarter of this year, compared to 182 million per day in the third quarter of last year. The increase was primarily due to production from gas fields offshore Sarawak, Malaysia, and higher production from the Tupper area in Western Canada.
In the downstream segment, third quarter 2010 net income of $50.6 million compared to net income third quarter of last year of $37.2 million. In North America an earnings increase of approximately $18 million was primarily due to earnings from our ethanol plant in North Dakota, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2009, has a higher merchandising and fuel margins in our retail business. U.K. earnings reduction of about $4.7 million was mostly attributable to lower refining margins.
In the corporate segment, we had net charges in the third quarter 2010 of $34.5 million compared to net charges in third quarter of last year of $32.4 million. The increase in these charges is primarily due to higher administrative costs.
As of September 30, 2010, our long-term debt was a little over $1 billion, 11.4% of total capital employed. I would like to make a final comment regarding our fourth quarter earnings guidance in the press release. We have a rather wide range of $0.50 to $1.15 per share as a result of our ongoing very active exploration program.
Also keep in mind that due to the timing of listings, our projected sales volumes are approximately 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day lower than our projected (inaudible) productions, which of course has a direct effect on projected fourth quarter net income.
With that I’ll turn it back over to David.

290060,114169364,85516,"Murphy Oil Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Murphy Oil Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. In the third quarter benchmark crude prices were range bound fluctuating between $70 and $80 a barrel, however recently prices have reached the $80 mark on the back of improved demand, a rebound in financial markets, a weaker U.S. dollar, a",1717,"Thanks, Kevin. In the third quarter benchmark crude prices were range bound fluctuating between $70 and $80 a barrel, however recently prices have reached the $80 mark on the back of improved demand, a rebound in financial markets, a weaker U.S. dollar, and an impact of a major strike in France. Global petroleum demand is also trending back towards pre-recession levels. Too early to call this a breakout, but it will bear close scrutiny as we work through the winter season.
Natural gas prices here in North America continue to be under pressure, and it’s hard to see any move away from the current $4 fulcrum until supply and demand better balance.
The recent lifting of the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico has had little impact on restoring business there, as no clear path on approvals, nor a consistent way to conduct business is apparent. Effectively, we now have a promatorium. This is directly affecting our Gulf of Mexico business and future plans, and of course is unfortunate.
We are blessed, however, to have the preponderance of our business upstream investments outside the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and here businesses are actively moving forward and helping drive our growth profile.
In our U.S. retail we had a steady quarter with margins coming under pressure in September as crude and wholesale prices trended upwards. In refining, crack spreads only started improving in September off of otherwise moribund levels for the quarter. Here our focus is on the safe reliable operations of those assets and their ongoing divestiture process which remains on track.
Looking at our business segments in closer detail, our global production for the third quarter averaged 181,733 barrels of oil equivalent per day, slightly ahead of our third quarter guidance of 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
This increase is attributable to higher production in Malaysia and in the U.S., where Gulf of Mexico production was favorable due to less hurricane downtime than forecast. This was partly offset by lower volumes at Azurite, Chile and in Canada due to maintenance turnaround activities and well schedule.
Natural gas sales for the quarter averaged 371 million cubic feet per day and Malaysia, Sarawak gas production continues at plan with gross production near 250 million cubic feet per day, and Kikeh gas meet projects with better plant uptime. In Canada, natural gas production was impacted by plant turnaround work on the Tupper main plant as we expanded its capacity.
Production guidance for the fourth quarter is estimated to be 198,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from the third quarter. This will put overall 2010 production just below prior expected levels due to unforeseen downtime at some of our non-operated fields and weather delays at our Kikeh rig program.
Fourth quarter production rates will be bolstered by the startup of another new well at Azurite, a workover program at Kikeh, (inaudible) returning from turnaround, and new wells coming on in the Eagle Ford Shale.
We will continue to see some negative impact in our production from the drilling promatorium in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico due to delays in rig operations particularly at Front Runner.
Looking forward I expect to see 2011 production levels to once again show attractive year-on-year growth. However, we will be impacted by slower Gulf of Mexico activity, maybe lower by 7,000 to 10,000 barrels equivalent per day from earlier projections.
As well as we are focusing towards oil in our Eagle Ford shale program that has already begun. Here we are emphasizing value over volume growth. A range of 210,000 to 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent to-date for 2011 is where I think it will fall. Again how quickly the Gulf of Mexico returns to work being by far the biggest driver in that range.
We recommenced our exploration program in the later part of September and should see results coming in over this quarter. In the U.K., our non-operated prospect adjacent to the Mungo field, did not encounter commercial quantities hydrocarbon and has been expensed as a dry hole.
In Congo, we just finished the Titan #1 well in MPN block, and found a small oil tieback sized accumulation, which is encouraging for nearby prospects, but clearly not what we were hoping for. That rig has now started up in the MPS block where we have three remaining high potential prospects left to drill.
In Suriname we are opening up a new play and will spud the first well very shortly, and in the fourth quarter we’ll start turning the bit in our Indonesian Semai II Block for a very large target. In the Gulf of Mexico, our non-operated Deep Blue prospect in Green Canyon 723 remains suspended. Work will recommence once permits are in place.
Looking forward into 2011 and also 2012, we have a full and impactful exploration program with attractive prospects being tested by over a dozen wells spanning seven countries in 2011 and a similar number in 2012 spanning six countries, including some resumption of activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Our North American resource position provides a nice complement to our global exploration activity and in September we announced entry into a fourth play, this one in Southern Alberta targeting the oil-prone Exshaw formation which is analogous to the Bakken play on the U.S. side of the border. We are moving forward with plans for early drilling next year to appraise our position, which we continue to grow on a now close to 150,000 net acres.
In Western Canada, we have six rigs operating between the Montney acreage at Tupper and our heavy oil operation at Seal. Plans are moving forward to bring on the new Tupper West gas plant with its capacity of 180 million cubic feet a day in the first half of 2011. The Seal and Haynesville recovery pilots are ongoing and we expect to have the results incorporated into our plans in the first quarter of 2011.
Onshore in the U.S. our operations in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas continue to be very encouraging as we focus on the oil-rich areas of the play with three rigs running. In Karnes County, we have two producing wells that together are making over 800 barrels of oil a day.
A third well, the Shendell Unit A [ph] was drilled to a total depth of 16,395 feet with a lateral section of 4,500 feet, and this well is scheduled for completion early this month and will provide the basis for a sanctioned development of this area towards the end of the year.
In Dimmit County, we have drilled three wells and completed one well, the Briggs #1, which is currently producing 175 barrels of oil per day as the well has choked back to maintain a stable rate during this evaluation and clean up period, following its completion. The two other wells, Briggs #2 and #3 will be completed later in fourth quarter. Overall our North American resource acreage is now around 700,000 net acres and strongly weighted towards oil.
Business development remains active for us and we have recently signed an agreement with the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq to acquire 50% interest in the Central Dahuk Block where we will operate. The block covers 619 square kilometers and sits within a world class petroleum province and on trend with recent exploration drilling which has shown much promise. We plan to shoot seismic in 2011 with an exploration well to follow. Other opportunities are being worked and we will open an office in (inaudible) shortly.
Switching to downstream the process to divest our refining and U.K. marketing assets is, as I mentioned earlier, moving forward as planned. Operationally U.S. retail continued its steady performance in the third quarter capturing good margins, while maintaining strong fuel volumes despite rising wholesale prices late in the quarter.
The retail chain expansion continues with year-to-date additions of 38 stores bringing the current station count to a 1,086. U.S. refining margins were under pressure for most of quarter at Meraux until crack spreads improved in September.
Superior asphalt business continued to provide a steady contribution. In September, we reached final agreement with the EPA on a consent decree for both U.S. refineries. This allows those assets to focus on their future safe compliant and reliable operations.
In the U.K. as our retail group continued its steady performance, the Milford Haven refinery was struggling in a difficult Northwest Europe market environment until margin showed some improvement in September. We are scheduling a minor crude unit outage in November to complete some further modifications that will increase crude throughputs to 130,000 barrels a day.
In our renewable fuels business, the ethanol plant in Hankinson, North Dakota continues to be a steady performer with production rate at 120 million gallons per year level. Margins are strong for the quarter as ethanol outpaced the jump in corn prices that concerned over yield forecasts and increased export demand.
Since acquiring the plant in the fourth quarter of 2009, Hankinson has provided a solid financial contribution returning close to $18 million of net income and $28 million of cash flow. We closed on our purchase of the partially built Hereford Texas ethanol plant in August.
Engineering work is ongoing and plant modifications will be completed with startup schedule near the end of first quarter of 2011. The plant is expected to achieve production rates of 115 million gallons per year as production ramps up. During this quarter, of course the EPA announced a waiver for E15 for newer model vehicles. This should help extend the blend world of corn-based ethanol production.
So in summary, we are back actively exploring testing high impact prospects as well as adding new high potential oil opportunities to our portfolio, witness the addition of acreage in South Alberta for the Exshaw play, and the new acreage in Kurdistan. I expect to see this activity continue through the remainder of this year and into 2011 as our budgeted plans become finalized.
Appraisal drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale is encouraging. EOR pilot work at Seal is moving forward nicely. U.S. retail continues to shine and our investment of the refining assets continues to plan.
That concludes my prepared remarks and I’m now happy to take your questions.

Karnes, once we have the results of the Shendell well, we’ll have a better sense of what area we want to include in the development plan, and overall we’ve got six wells to frac between now and the end of the year throughout the program, and so getting more data result was helpful going into a sanction. If you look at the wells that we’ve had on production the longest, one has produced about 140,000 barrels so far, since it came on the Drees well, and then the JOG Unit well that’s produced over 50,000 barrels. So, both very nice wells.
And I think, the Shendell well will hopefully reinforce that. But the Dimmit County well is in a different part of the play and actually behaved differently, but very similar to how other operators wells were doing. And when it came on production it actually made 100% water, and it wasn’t until we recovered about 10% of the water load that we actually started making oil. And so we got the well up to 175 barrels a day on a small choke and we’re just dewatering that well. So, I think it’ll do more, I don’t know what it’ll do, what we want to do is complete the fracing on two of the wells there, and then get a better sense of what we’ve got. But I will say I’m very encouraged by what we have there at Dimmit.

We talk about that acreage being Exshaw play but there really is two other horizons that are equally in our mind today perspective. The Exshaw is the deepest horizon but we see a jurassic [ph] level called Wadden [ph] and a shallow cretaceous level called the Second White Speckled Shale which is a ugly name but that’s what it’s called, is also being perspective and so our appraisal program is going to target some of those horizons to also see if they have some running room as well.

Well, so this is early days yet, but we think what’s happened is that there is likely to have been a seal leak here because we have a very well defined structure that has some faulting through it. The channel system that Titan found stretches basically east-west, and runs into the northern part of the MPS Block. So when I make the comment about encouraging for me and my prospects.
The prospect that I think it upgrades is the RR prospect, which has always been in favor to allow us in the Northeast part of MPS because those same channels run across that. Now that prospect is different because it’s a low relief four-way dip feature, very large, couple of hundred million barrels per channel to channels that clearly won’t have this faulting issue and potential leakage issue, so the results of Titan, I think, upgrade RR and RR is about 15 to 20 kilometers away, maybe a bit less depending on where you drill the well.
So encouraging for that part of the acreage and you really have now got to go back and incorporate the results of this well, take another look at RR, and see when we want to drill it. We did about three years ago conduct a CSCM program, one of these electromagnetic programs on some high grade prospects. One of the prospects that we shot was RR, and it does have a very attractive looking CSCM anomaly and so the combination of Titan’s results and the CSCM I think allow us to be a little more optimistic about RR, so that’s kind of where we are today.

Of that $140 million, $46.5 million is basically appraisal wells in Malaysia. We’re drilling a appraisal well on the Kerisi discovery, so Kerisi #2 that’s in Block K, that will be a subsea tieback to Kikeh. We’re drilling two wells at South Baxius [ph] in Sarawak blocks. We think that maybe an oil plus gas development and we’re trying to get comfortable to be able to sanction that next year.
And we’re appraising a potential Phase III gas discovery that we made at a prospect called Terra [ph]. And so, really we’re spending a little less than $100 million as to exploration exposure, and so that’s kind of the way it will run. Now, as far as timing goes, sometimes you’re not in control of your own destiny and some of our partners, particularly, national oil companies like to announce good news. So, my preference is to not talk about the Congo program until we’re finished, but we just announced about Titan because I thought that was important and so I think we’ll at those as we go along and make the calls as we go.
I will tell you on Congo, we’re drilling two wells at Turquoise 3 and Turquoise 4 in Cobalt and the rig is currently batch setting the Turquoise 3 and Turquoise 4 shallower section. It’s actually in Turquoise 4 now and then it goes to drill Cobalt and then it comes back to finish the wells through their objective section at Turquoise Marine-3 and Marine-4. We have added a deepening to Turquoise Marine-4 as we’ve been working reprocess data. We’ve seen the deepening potential become quite attractive under the Turquoise feature.
As you recall, we have oil in the Miocene section. We now believe that there is some deeper Paleocene and Albian or crustaceous section that could potentially be quite large. I’m talking about couple of 100 million barrel type potential in addition to what we were drilling before. So that may well impact the overall timing here, Evan but we’re excited about it.

Now on trend, the Albian works but it’s a much poor quality overall reservoir section but the structure looks very attractive and is a very nice size feature. So we think for a relatively small incremental amount of money here, $8 million gross. We can go and test something with some significant upside. So we’ve added that to the program from what we’ve from what we previously communicated.

For the nine months of 2010, we had net income of $624 million or $3.24 per diluted share compared to net income for the nine months of '09 of $518.8 million or $2.70 per diluted share. 
There were no unusual items of significance in the 2010 quarter or for the 2010 nine-month period. The 2009 nine-month period did however include $97.8 million or $0.51 a share of income from discontinued operations. This was mostly related to a gain on the sale of our operations in Ecuador in March last year.
Looking at income by segment. The E&P segment, income from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2010 was $186.7 million compared to net income of $184.1 million in the third quarter of last year. Slightly higher earnings for the 2010 quarter were primarily due to higher crude oil and natural gas price realizations, higher natural gas sales volumes, partially offset by lower crude oil sales volumes and higher exploration and extraction costs. 
Crude oil and liquids prices averaged $65.45 per barrel in the third quarter of this year versus $61.13 last year. North America natural gas prices averaged $4.24 per Mcf this year, compared to $3.01 last year while. In Sarawak, third quarter 2010 natural gas price realizations averaged $5.71 per Mcf compared to $3.31 per Mcf last year, an increase of over 72%. 
Crude oil and gas liquids production from continuing operations for the current quarter was just under 120,000 barrels per day compared to approximately 131,600 barrels per day in the corresponding 2009 quarter. The decrease was mostly due to lower production from Kikeh offshore in Malaysia, head of our rig program. 
Natural gas sales volumes more than doubled to 371 million cubic feet per day in the third quarter of this year compared to 182 million per day in the third quarter of last year. The increase was primarily due to production in gas fields offshore Sarawak, Malaysia and higher production from the Tupper area in Western Canada. 
In the Downstream segment, third quarter 2010 net income of $50.6 million compared to net income third quarter of last year of $37.2 million. In North America, an earnings increase of approximately $18 million was primarily due to earnings from our ethanol plant in North Dakota which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the higher merchandising and fuel margins in our Retail business. The U.K. earnings reduction of about $4.7 million was mostly attributable to lower refining margins. 
In the Corporate segment, we had net charges in the third quarter of 2010 of $34.5 million compared to net charges in the third quarter of last year of $32.4 million. The increase in these charges is primarily due to higher administrative cost. 
As of September 30, 2010, our long-term debt was a little over $1 million from 11.4% of total capital employed. 
Now I'd like to make a final comment regarding our fourth quarter earnings guidance in the press release. We have a rather wide range of $0.50 to $1.15 per share, as a result of our ongoing very active exploration program. Also keep in mind that due to the timing of listings, our projected sales volumes are approximately 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day lower than our projected gas productions which of course had a direct effect on projected fourth quarter net income. With that I'll turn it back over to David."

In the third quarter, benchmark crude prices were range that fluctuating between $70 and $80 a barrel. However, recently prices have reached the $80 mark in the back of improved demand, a rebound in financial markets, a weaker U.S. dollar and an impact of a major strike in France. Global petroleum demand is also trending back towards pre-recession levels. 
Too early to call this a breakout, but it will bear close scrutiny as we work through the winter season. Natural gas prices here in North America continue to be under pressure and it's hard to see any move away from the current $4 fulcrum until supply and demand better balance. The recent lifting of the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico has had little impact on restoring business there, as no clear path in approvals nor a consistent way to conduct business is apparent. Effectively we now have a permatorium. This is a directly affecting our Gulf of Mexico business and future plans and of course is unfortunate.
We are blessed however to have the preponderance of our business upstream investments outside the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and here businesses are actively moving forward in helping drive our growth profile. 
In our U.S. retail, we had a steady quarter with margins coming under pressure in September, as crude and wholesale prices trended upwards. In refining, crack spreads only started improving in September otherwise moribund levels for the quarter. Here our focus is on the safe reliable operations of those assets and the ongoing divestiture process which remains on track. 
Looking at our business segments in closer detail, our global production for the third quarter averaged 181,733 barrels of oil equivalent per day, slightly ahead of our third quarter guidance of 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This increase is attributable to higher production in Malaysia and in the U.S. where Gulf of Mexico production was favorable due to less hurricane downtime than forecast. This was partly offset by lower volumes at Azurite, Chile and Canada due to maintenance turnaround activities and well scheduling. 
Natural gas sales for the quarter averaged 371 million cubic feet per day. In Malaysia, Sarawak gas production continues at the plant with gross production near 250 million cubic feet per day and Kikeh as big projections better plant uptime. In Canada, natural gas production was impacted at that turnaround work on the Tupper main practice as we expanded its capacity.
Production guidance for the fourth quarter is estimated to be 198,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from the third quarter. This will put overall 2010 production just below prior expected levels due to unforeseen downtime of some of our non-operated fields and weather delays at our Kikeh rig program. Fourth quarter production rates will be bolstered by the startup of another new well of Azurite a workover program at Kikeh, to Hayley returning from turnaround and new wells coming on in the Eagle Ford Shale. We will continue to see some negative impact in our production from the drilling permatorium in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico due to delays in rig operations, particularly at Front Runner. 
Looking forward, I expect to see 2011 production levels to once again show attractive year-on-year growth. However, we will be impacted by slower Gulf of Mexico activity. Maybe lower by 7,000 to 10,000 barrels equivalent per day from earlier projections. As well as we are focusing towards oil in our Eagle Ford Shale program that has already begun. Here, we're emphasizing value over volume growth. 
A range of 210,000 to 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for 2011 is where I think it will fall. Again how quickly the Gulf of Mexico returns to work being by far the biggest driver in that range.
We recommenced our exploration program in the latter part of September and should see results coming in over this quarter. In the U.K., our non-operated prospect adjacent to the Mungo field did not encounter commercial quantities hydrocarbon and it's been expensed as a dry hole. 
In Congo, we just finished the Titan #1 well in MPN block and found a small oil tieback sized accumulation which is encouraging for nearby prospects, but clearly not what we were hoping for. That rig has now started up in the MPS Block where we have three remaining high potential prospects left to drill. In Suriname, we are opening up a new play and we'll spud the first well very shortly. And in the fourth quarter, we'll start turning the bit in our Indonesian Semai II Block for a very large target. 
In the Gulf of Mexico, our non-operated Deep Blue prospect in Green Canyon 723 remain suspended. Work will recommence once permits are in place. 
Looking forward into 2011 and also in 2012, we have a full and impactful exploration program with attractive prospects being tested by over a dozen wells spanning seven countries in 2011 and a similar number in 2012, spanning six countries, including some resumption of activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Our North American resource position provides a nice complement to our global exploration activity. And in September, we announced entry into a fourth play, this one in Southern Alberta targeting the oil-prone Exshaw formation which is analogous to the Bakken play on the U.S. side of the border. We are moving forward with plans for early drilling next year to a pace our position in which we continue to go on a now close to 150,000 net acres. 
In Western Canada, we have six rigs operating between the Montney acreage at Tupper and our heavy oil operation at Seal. Plans are moving forward to bring on the new Tupper West gas plant, with its capacity of 180 million cubic feet a day in the first half of 2011. the Seal and painful recovery pilots are ongoing and we expect to have the results incorporated into our plans in the first quarter of 2011. 
Onshore in the U.S. our operations in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas continue to be very encouraging, as we focus on the oil-rich areas of the play with three rigs running. 
In Karnes County, we have two producing wells that together are making over 800 barrels of oil a day. The third well addition billion dollars at a was drilled to a total debt of 16,395 feet with a lateral section of 4,500 feet and this well is scheduled for completion early this month and will provide a basis for a section development of this area towards the end of the year. 
In Dimmit County, we have drilled three wells and completed one well that brings number one which is currently producing 175 barrels of oil per day, as the well has choked back to maintain a stable rate during this evaluation and clean-up period following its completion. The two other wells, Briggs #2 and #3 will be completed later in the fourth quarter. 
Overall, our North American resource acreage is now around 700,000 net acres and strongly weighted towards oil. 
Business development remains active for us and we have recently signed an agreement with the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq to acquire 50% interest in the Central Dohuk block where we will operate. The block covers 619 square kilometers and sits within a world-class petroleum province and on trend with recent exploration drilling which has shown much promise. We plan to shoot seismic in 2011, with an exploration well to follow. Other opportunities are being worked and we will open an office in shortly. 
Switching to Downstream, the process to divest our refining and U.K. marketing assets is as I mentioned earlier moving forward as planned. Operationally, U.S. retail continue to steady performance in the third quarter capturing good margins while maintaining strong fuel volumes despite rising wholesale prices late in the quarter. The retail chain expansion continues with year-to-date additions of 38 stores, bringing the current station count to 1,086. U.S. refining margins were under pressure. But most of the quarter at Meraux until crack spreads improved in September. Superior Asphalt business continue to provide a steady contribution. 
In September, we reached final agreement with the EPA on a consent decree for both U.S. refineries. This allows those assets to focus on their future safe compliant and reliable operations. 
In the U.K. as our detail group continued a steady performance the Milford Haven refinery was struggling a difficult northwest Europe environment until margin showed some improvement in September. We are scheduling a minor crude unit outage in November to complete some further modifications that will increase crude throughputs to 130,000 barrels a day. 
In our Renewable Fuels business, the ethanol plant in Hankinson, North Dakota continues to be a steady performer, with production rates at 120 million gallons per year levels. Margins are strong for the quarter as ethanol outpaced the jump in corn prices after concern over yield forecast and increased export demand. 
Since acquiring the plant in the fourth quarter of 2009, Hankinson has provided a solid financial contribution, returning close to $18 million of net income and $28 million of cash flow. We closed in our purchase of the partially built here for tax as ethanol plant in August. 
Engineering work is ongoing and plant modifications will be completed with start-up schedule near the end of the first quarter of 2011. The plant is expected to achieve production rates of 115 million gallons per year as production ramps up. 
During this quarter, of course the EPA announced the waiver for E-15 for newer model vehicles. This should help extend the blend wall for corn-based ethanol production. 
So in summary, we are back actively exploring, testing high-impact prospects, as well as adding new high potential oil opportunities to our portfolio witnessed the addition of acres in South Alberta for the actual play and the new acreage in Kurdistan.
I expect to see this activity continue through the remainder of this year and into 2011 as our budget and plans become finalized. 
Appraisal drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale is encouraging. On our EOR pilot work at Seal is moving forward nicely. U.S. retail continues to shine and our divestment of the refining assets continues to plan. That concludes my prepared remarks and I'm now happy to take your questions."

And overall, we've got six wells to frac between now and the end of the year throughout the program. And so getting more data result was always helpful going into  a sanction. If you look at the wells that we've had on production, the longest one has produced about 140,000 barrels so far since it came on the trees well and then the JOG unit well has produced over 50,000 barrels. So both very nice wells and I think the Shendell well will hopefully reinforce that. The Dimmit County well is in a different part of the play and actually behave differently, but very similar to how other operators' wells were doing. And when it came on production, it actually made 100% water and it wasn't until we recovered about 10% of the water load that we actually started making oil. And so we got the well up to 175 barrels a day on a small choke and we're just dewatering that well. So I think it will do more, I don't know what it will do. What we want to do is complete the frac-ing on two other wells there and then get a better sense of what we've got. But I will say I'm very encouraged by what we have there at Dimmit."

The 10 million barrels in my mind is a small oil accumulation relations buybacks so I would castanet and that direction. and other reason than -- well, so this is early days yet, but we think what's happened is that there is likely to have been a Seal leak year because we have a very well-defined structure that has some faulting through it. The channel system that Titan found stretches basically east-west and runs into the northern part of the MPS Block. So when I make the comment about encouraging for me and my prospects. The prospect that I think it upgrades is the RR prospect which is always been a favorite of ours in the northeast part of MPS because those same channels run across that. Now that prospect is different because it's a low relief for weighted feature, very large, couple of hundred million barrels per channel to channels. That clearly won't have this faulting issue and potential leakage issue. So the results of Titan I think upgrade our RR and RR is about 15 to 20 kilometers away maybe a bit less depending on where you drill the well. And so encouraging for that part of the acreage and you really have now have to go back and incorporate the results of this well take another look at RR and see when we want the drilling. We did about three years ago come up an CSCM program, one of these electromagnetic programs on some high grade prospects . One of the prospect that we shot was RR and it does have a very attractive looking CSCM anomaly and so the combination of Titan's results and the CSCM I think allow us to be a little more optimistic about RR.

If you look at what we're doing in this remainder of the year, it's a lot of exploration expense about $140 million. But let me kind of give you some granularity on that. Of that $140 million, $46.9 million is basically appraisal wells in Malaysia. We are drilling an appraisal well on the Kerisi discovery or Kerisi #2. That's in Block A. That will be a subsea tie back to Kikeh. We are drilling two wells at South benches in Sarawak blocks. We think that maybe an oil plus gas development and we're trying to get comfortable to be able to sanction that next year. And we are appraising a potential Phase III gas discovery that we made add the prospect called. And so really we're spending a little less than $100 million as true exploration exposure. And so that's kind of the way it will run. Now as far as timing goes, sometimes you're not in control of your own destiny and some of our partners, particularly national oil companies like to announce good news. So my preference is to not talk about the Congo program until we are finished. But we just announced about Titan because I thought that was important. And so I think we'll look at those as we go along and make the calls as we ago. I will tell you on Congo. We are drilling two wells at Turquoise. Turquoise 3 and Turquoise 4 in Cobalt and the rig is currently batch setting the Turquoise 3 and Turquoise 4 shallower section. It's actually on Turquoise 4 now. And then it goes to drill Cobalt and then it comes back to finish the wells through their objectives section at Turquoise Marine 3 and 4. We have added a deepening to Turquoise Marine 4. As we've been working reprocessed data, we've seen the deepening potential become quite attractive under the Turquoise feature. As you recall, we have oil in the Miocene section. We now believe that there is some deeper Paleocene and Albian or Cretaceous age section that could potentially be quite large. I'm talking a couple of 100 million-barrel type potential, in addition to what we were drilling for. So that may well impact the overall timing here, Evan. But we're excited about it.

So we think for a relatively small incremental amount of money here, $8 million gross, we can go and test something which a significant upside. So we've added out the program from what we've previously."

Net income in the third quarter of 2010 was $202.8 million or $1.05 per diluted share, and that compares to net income in the third quarter of '09 of $188.9 million or $0.98 per diluted share. 
For the 9 months, 2010, we had net income of $624 million or $3.24 per diluted share compared to net income for the 9 months of '09 of $518.8 million or $2.70 per diluted share. 
There were no unusual items of significance in the 2010 quarter or for the 2010 9-month period. The 2009 9-month period did however include $97.8 million or $0.51 a share of income from discontinued operations. This was mostly related to a gain on the sale of our operations in Ecuador in March last year.
Looking at net income by segments. The E&P segment, income from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2010 was $186.7 million compared to net income of $184.1 million in the third quarter of last year. Slightly higher earnings for the 2010 quarter were primarily due to higher crude oil and natural gas price realizations and higher natural gas sales volumes, partially offset by lower crude oil sales volumes and higher exploration and extraction costs. 
Crude oil and liquids prices averaged $65.45 per barrel in the third quarter of this year versus $61.13 last year. North America natural gas prices averaged $4.24 per Mcf this year, compared to $3.01 last year, while in Sarawak, third quarter 2010 natural gas price realizations averaged $5.71 per Mcf compared to $3.31 per Mcf last year, an increase of over 72%. 
Crude oil and gas liquids production from continuing operations for the current quarter was just under 120,000 barrels per day compared to approximately 131,600 barrels per day in the corresponding 2009 quarter. The decrease was mostly due to lower production from Kikeh offshore in Malaysia ahead of our planned rig program. 
Natural gas sales volumes more than doubled to 371 million cubic feet per day in the third quarter of this year compared to 182 million per day in the third quarter of last year. The increase was primarily due to production from gas fields offshore Sarawak, Malaysia, and higher production from the Tupper area in Western Canada. 
In the downstream segment, third quarter 2010 net income of $50.6 million compared to net income third quarter of last year of $37.2 million. In North America, an earnings increase of approximately $18 million was primarily due to earnings from our ethanol plant in North Dakota, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2009, has a higher merchandising and fuel margins in our retail business. U.K. earnings reduction of about $4.7 million was mostly attributable to lower refining margins. 
In the corporate segment, we had net charges in the third quarter of 2010 of $34.5 million compared to net charges in the third quarter of last year of $32.4 million. The increase in these charges is primarily due to higher administrative costs. 
As of September 30, 2010, our long-term debt was a little over $1 billion, 11.4% of total capital employed. I would like to make a final comment regarding our fourth quarter earnings guidance in the press release. We have a rather wide range of $0.50 to $1.15 per share as a result of our ongoing very active exploration program. Also keep in mind that due to the timing of listings, our projected sales volumes are approximately 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day lower than our projected list of [ph] productions, which of course has a direct effect on projected fourth quarter net income. 
With that I'll turn it back over to David."

In the third quarter, benchmark crude prices were range bound, fluctuating between $70 and $80 a barrel. However, recently, prices have reached the $80 mark on the back of improved demand, a rebound in financial markets, a weaker U.S. dollar and an impact of a major strike in France. Global petroleum demand is also trending back towards prerecession levels. Too early to call this a breakout, but it will bear close scrutiny as we work through the winter season. 
Natural gas prices here in North America continue to be under pressure and it's hard to see any move away from the current $4 fulcrum until supply and demand better balance. 
The recent lifting of the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico has had little impact on restoring business there, as no clear path on approvals, nor a consistent way to conduct business is apparent. Effectively, we now have a permatorium. This is directly affecting our Gulf of Mexico business and future plans and, of course, is unfortunate.
We are blessed however to have the preponderance of our business upstream investments outside the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and here, businesses are actively moving forward and helping drive our growth profile. 
In our U.S. retail, we had a steady quarter with margins coming under pressure in September as crude and wholesale prices trended upwards. In refining, crack spreads only started improving in September off of otherwise moribund levels for the quarter. Here, our focus is on the safe reliable operations of those assets and the ongoing divestiture process which remains on track. 
Looking at our business segments in closer detail, our global production for the third quarter averaged 181,733 barrels of oil equivalent per day, slightly ahead of our third quarter guidance of 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This increase is attributable to higher production in Malaysia and in the U.S., where Gulf of Mexico production was favorable due to less hurricane downtime than forecast. This was partly offset by lower volumes at Azurite, Schiehallion and in Canada due to maintenance turnaround activities and well schedule. 
Natural gas sales for the quarter averaged 371 million cubic feet per day and Malaysia, Sarawak gas production continues at the plan with gross production near 250 million cubic feet per day and Kikeh gas meet projections with better plant uptime. In Canada, natural gas production was impacted by plant turnaround work on the Tupper main plant as we expanded its capacity.
Production guidance for the fourth quarter is estimated to be 198,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from the third quarter. This will put overall 2010 production just below prior expected levels due to unforeseen downtime of some of our nonoperated fields and weather delays at our Kikeh rig program. 
Fourth quarter production rates will be bolstered by the startup of another new well at Azurite, a workover program at Kikeh, Schiehallion returning from turnaround and new wells coming on in the Eagle Ford Shale. 
We will continue to see some negative impact in our production from the drilling permatorium in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico due to delays in rig operations, particularly at Front Runner. 
Looking forward, I expect to see 2011 production levels to once again show attractive year-on-year growth. However, we will be impacted by slower Gulf of Mexico activity, maybe lower by 7,000 to 10,000 barrels equivalent per day from earlier projections. As well as we're focusing towards oil in our Eagle Ford Shale program that has already begun. Here, we're emphasizing value over volume growth. 
A range of 210,000 to 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent to-date for 2011 is where I think it will fall. Again, how quickly the Gulf of Mexico returns to work being by far the biggest driver in that range.
We recommenced our exploration program in the latter part of September and should see results coming in over this quarter. In the U.K., our nonoperated prospect adjacent to the Mungo field did not encounter commercial quantities hydrocarbon and has been expensed as a dry hole. 
In Congo, we just finished the Titane #1well in MPN block and found a small oil tieback sized accumulation, which is encouraging for nearby prospects, but clearly not what we were hoping for. That rig has now started up in the MPN block, where we have 3 remaining high potential prospects left to drill. 
In Suriname, we are opening up a new play and will spud the first well very shortly, and in the fourth quarter, we'll start turning the bit in our Indonesian Semai II Block for a very large target. In the Gulf of Mexico, our nonoperated Deep Blue prospect in Green Canyon 723 remain suspended. Work will recommence once permits are in place. 
Looking forward into 2011 and also 2012, we have a full and impactful exploration program with attractive prospects being tested by over a dozen wells spanning 7 countries in 2011 and a similar number in 2012, spanning 6 countries, including some resumption of activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Our North American resource position provides a nice complement to our global exploration activity. And in September, we announced entry into a fourth play, this one in Southern Alberta, targeting the oil-prone Exshaw formation, which is analogous to the Bakken play on the U.S. side of the border. We are moving forward with plans for early drilling next year to appraise our position, which we continue to go on a now close to 150,000 net acres. 
In Western Canada, we have 6 rigs operating between the Montney acreage at Tupper and our heavy oil operation at Seal. Plans are moving forward to bring on the new Tupper West gas plant with its capacity of 180 million cubic feet a day in the first half of 2011. The Seal and Haynesville recovery pilots are ongoing, and we expect to have the results incorporated into our plans in the first quarter of 2011. 
Onshore in the U.S., our operations in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas continue to be very encouraging as we focus on the oil-rich areas of the play with 3 rigs running. In Karnes County, we have 2 producing wells that together are making over 800 barrels of oil a day. A third well, the Schendel unit A, was drilled to a total debt of 16,395 feet with a lateral section of 4,500 feet, and this well is scheduled for completion early this month and will provide the basis for a sanctioned development of this area towards the end of the year. 
In Dimmit County, we have drilled 3 wells and completed one well, the Briggs [ph] #1, which is currently producing 175 barrels of oil per day as the well has choked back to maintain a stable rate during this evaluation and cleanup period following its completion. The 2 other wells, Briggs [ph] #2 and #3, will be completed later in the fourth quarter. Overall, our North American resource acreage is now around 700,000 net acres and strongly weighted towards oil. 
Business development remains active for us, and we have recently signed an agreement with the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq to acquire 50% interest in the Central Dohuk Block where we will operate. The block covers 619 square kilometers and sits within a world-class petroleum province and on trend with recent exploration drilling which has shown much promise. We plan to shoot seismic in 2011, with an exploration well to follow. Other opportunities are being worked, and we will open an office in Erbil shortly. 
Switching to downstream, the process to divest our refining and U.K. marketing assets is, as I mentioned earlier, moving forward as planned. Operationally, U.S. retail continued its steady performance in the third quarter, capturing good margins while maintaining strong fuel volumes despite rising wholesale prices late in the quarter. 
The retail chain expansion continues with year-to-date additions of 38 stores, bringing the current station count to 1,086. U.S. refining margins were under pressure for most of the quarter at Meraux until crack spreads improved in September. 
Superior asphalt business continued to provide a steady contribution. In September, we reached final agreement with the EPA on a consent decree for both U.S. refineries. This allows those assets to focus on their future safe compliant and reliable operations. 
In the U.K., as our retail group continued a steady performance, the Milford Haven refinery was struggling in a difficult Northwest Europe market environment until margin showed some improvement in September. We are scheduling a minor crude unit outage in November to complete some further modifications that will increase crude throughputs to 130,000 barrels a day. 
In our renewable fuels business, the ethanol plant in Hankinson, North Dakota continues to be a steady performer, with production rates at 120 million gallons per year levels. Margins are strong for the quarter as ethanol outpaced the jump in corn prices that concerned over yield forecasts and increased export demand. Since acquiring the plant in the fourth quarter of 2009, Hankinson has provided a solid financial contribution, returning close to $18 million of net income and $28 million of cash flow. 
We closed on our purchase of the partially built Hereford, Texas ethanol plant in August. Engineering work is ongoing and plant modifications will be completed with startup schedule near the end of the first quarter of 2011. The plant is expected to achieve production rates of 115 million gallons per year as production ramps up. 
During this quarter, of course, the EPA announced a waiver for E15 for newer model vehicles. This should help extend the blend world for corn-based ethanol production. 
So in summary, we are back actively exploring testing high-impact prospects, as well as adding new high potential oil opportunities to our portfolio, witness the addition of acreage in South Alberta for the Exshaw play and the new acreage in Kurdistan.
I expect to see this activity continue through the remainder of this year and into 2011 as our budget and plans become finalized. 
Appraisal drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale is encouraging, and our EOR pilot work at Seal is moving forward nicely. U.S. retail continues to shine, and our divestment of the refining assets continues to plan. 
That concludes my prepared remarks and I'm now happy to take your questions."

If you look at the wells that we've had on production, the longest one has produced about 140,000 barrels so far, since it came on the Drees well, and then the JOC [ph] unit well has produced over 50,000 barrels. So both very nice wells, and I think the Schendel well will hopefully reinforce that. But the Dimmit County well is in a different part of the play and actually behave differently but very similar to how other operators wells were doing. And when it came on production, it actually made 100% water. And it wasn't until we recovered about 10% of the water load that we actually started making oil. And so we got the well up to 175 barrels a day on a small choke, and we've just been dewatering that well. So I think it will do more. I don't know what it will do. What we want to do is complete the frac-ing on 2 other wells there and then get a better sense of what we've got. But I will say, I'm very encouraged by what we have there at Dimmit."

The 10 million barrels in my mind is a small oil accumulation relations tieback, so I would cast a net in that direction. And the reason -- well, so this is early days yet, but we think what's happened is that there is likely to have been a Seal leak here because we have a very well-defined structure that has some faulting through it. The channel system that Titane found stretches basically east-west and runs into the northern part of the MPS Block. So when I make the comment about encouraging for nearby prospects, the prospect that I think it upgrades is the RR prospect, which has always been a favorite of ours, in the northeast part of MPS because those same channels run across that. Now that prospect is different because it's a low relief, 4-way dip feature, very large, couple of hundred million barrels per channel to channels. That clearly won't have this faulting issue and potential leakage issue. So the results of Titane, I think, upgrade our RR and RR is about 15 to 20 kilometers away, maybe a bit less depending on where you drill the well, and so encouraging for that part of the acreage. And you really have now go to back and incorporate the results of this well, take another look at RR and see when we want to drill it. We did about 3 years ago conduct a CSCM program, one of these electromagnetic programs, on some high grade prospects . One of the prospect that we shot was RR, and it does have a very attractive looking CSCM anomaly. And so the combination of Titane's results and the CSCM, I think, allow us to be a little more optimistic about RR. So that's kind of where we are today."

Of that $140 million, $46.5 million is basically appraisal wells in Malaysia. We're drilling an appraisal well on the Kerisi discovery or Kerisi #2. That's in Block K. That will be a subsea tieback to Kikeh. We're drilling 2 wells at South Acis in Sarawak blocks. We think that maybe an oil-plus gas development, and we're trying to get comfortable to be able to sanction that next year. And we're appraising a potential Phase III gas discovery that we made, a prospect called Terra. And so really, we're spending a little less than $100 million as to exploration exposure. And so that's kind of the way it will run. Now as far as timing goes, sometimes you're not in control of your own destiny. And some of our partners, particularly national oil companies, like to announce good news. So my preference is to not talk about the Congo program until we're finished. But we just announced about Titane because I thought that was important. And so I think we'll look at those as we go along and make the calls as we ago. I will tell you on Congo, we're drilling 2 wells at Turquoise, Turquoise 3 and Turquoise 4, in Cobalt. And the rig is currently batch setting the Turquoise 3 and Turquoise 4 shallower section. It's actually on Turquoise 4 now. And then it goes to drill Cobalt, and then it comes back to finish the wells through their objectives section at Turquoise Marine 3 and 4. We have added a deepening to Turquoise Marine 4. As we've been working reprocessed data, we've seen the deepening potential become quite attractive under the Turquoise feature. As you recall, we have oil in the Miocene section. We now believe that there is some deeper Paleocene and Albian or Cretaceous age section that could potentially be quite large. I'm talking a couple of 100 million-barrel type potential in addition to what we were drilling before. So that may well impact the overall timing here, Evan, but we're excited about it.

Net income in the third quarter of 2010 was $202.8 million or $1.05 per diluted share. That compares to net income in the third quarter of '09 of $188.9 million or $0.98 per diluted share.
For the 9 months, 2010, we had net income of $624 million or $3.24 per diluted share compared to net income for the 9 months of '09 of $518.8 million or $2.70 per diluted share. 
There were no unusual items of significance in the 2010 quarter or for the 2010 9-month period. The 2009 9-month period did however include $97.8 million or $0.51 a share of income from discontinued operations. This was mostly related to a gain on the sale of our operations in Ecuador in March last year.
Looking at income by segment. The E&P segment, income from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2010 was $186.7 million compared to net income of $184.1 million in the third quarter of last year. Slightly higher earnings for the 2010 quarter were primarily due to higher crude oil and natural gas price realizations and higher natural gas sales volumes, partially offset by lower crude oil sales volumes and higher exploration and extraction costs. 
Crude oil and liquids prices averaged $65.45 per barrel in the third quarter of this year versus $61.13 last year. North American natural gas prices averaged $4.24 per Mcf this year, compared to $3.01 last year, while in Sarawak, third quarter 2010 natural gas price realizations averaged $5.71 per Mcf compared to $3.31 per Mcf last year, an increase of over 72%. 
Crude oil and gas liquids production from continuing operations for the current quarter was just under 120,000 barrels per day compared to approximately 131,600 barrels per day in the corresponding 2009 quarter. The decrease was mostly due to lower production from Kikeh offshore in Malaysia ahead of our planned rig program. 
Natural gas sales volumes more than doubled to 371 million cubic feet per day in the third quarter of this year compared to 182 million per day in the third quarter of last year. The increase was primarily due to production from gas fields offshore Sarawak, Malaysia, and higher production from the Tupper area in Western Canada. 
In the downstream segment, third quarter 2010 net income of $50.6 million compared to net income third quarter of last year of $37.2 million. In North America, an earnings increase of approximately $18 million was primarily due to earnings from our ethanol plant in North Dakota, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2009, has a higher merchandising and fuel margins in our retail business. The U.K. earnings reduction of about $4.7 million was mostly attributable to lower refining margins. 
In the corporate segment, we had net charges in the third quarter of 2010 of $34.5 million compared to net charges in the third quarter of last year of $32.4 million. The increase in these charges is primarily due to higher administrative costs. 
As of September 30, 2010, our long-term debt was a little over $1 billion, 11.4% of total capital employed. I would like to make a final comment regarding our fourth quarter earnings guidance in the press release. We have a rather wide range of $0.50 to $1.15 per share as a result of our ongoing very active exploration program. Also keep in mind that due to the timing of liftings, our projected sales volumes are approximately 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day lower than our projected level of productions, which of course has a direct effect on projected fourth quarter net income. 
With that I'll turn it back over to David."

In the third quarter, benchmark crude prices were range bound, fluctuating between $70 and $80 a barrel. However, recently, prices have breached the $80 mark on the back of improved demand, a rebound in financial markets, a weaker U.S. dollar and an impact of a major strike in France. Global petroleum demand is also trending back towards prerecession levels. Too early to call this a breakout, but it will bear close scrutiny as we work through the winter season. 
Natural gas prices here in North America continue to be under pressure and it's hard to see any move away from the current $4 fulcrum until supply and demand better balance. 
The recent lifting of the moratorium in the Gulf of Mexico has had little impact on restoring business there, as no clear path on approvals, nor a consistent way to conduct business is apparent. Effectively, we now have a permatorium. This is directly affecting our Gulf of Mexico business and future plans and, of course, is unfortunate.
We are blessed however to have the preponderance of our business upstream investments outside the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and here, businesses are actively moving forward and helping drive our growth profile. 
In our U.S. retail, we had a steady quarter with margins coming under pressure in September as crude and wholesale prices trended upwards. In refining, crack spreads only started improving in September off of otherwise moribund levels for the quarter. Here, our focus is on the safe reliable operations of those assets and the ongoing divestiture process which remains on track. 
Looking at our business segments in closer detail, our global production for the third quarter averaged 181,733 barrels of oil equivalent per day, slightly ahead of our third quarter guidance of 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This increase is attributable to higher production in Malaysia and in the U.S., where Gulf of Mexico production was favorable due to less hurricane downtime than forecast. This was partly offset by lower volumes at Azurite, Schiehallion and in Canada due to maintenance turnaround activities and well scheduling. 
Natural gas sales for the quarter averaged 371 million cubic feet per day. And Malaysia, Sarawak gas production continues at plan with gross production near 250 million cubic feet per day and Kikeh gas beat projections with better plant uptime. In Canada, natural gas production was impacted by plant turnaround work on the Tupper main plant as we expanded its capacity.
Production guidance for the fourth quarter is estimated to be 198,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up from the third quarter. This will put overall 2010 production just below prior expected levels due to unforeseen downtime on some of our non-operated fields and weather delays at our Kikeh rig program. 
Fourth quarter production rates will be bolstered by the startup of another new well at Azurite, a workover program at Kikeh, Schiehallion returning from turnaround and new wells coming on in the Eagle Ford Shale. 
We will continue to see some negative impact in our production from the drilling permatorium in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico due to delays in rig operations, particularly at Front Runner.
Looking forward, I expect to see 2011 production levels to once again show attractive year-on-year growth. However, we will be impacted by slower Gulf of Mexico activity, maybe lower by 7,000 to 10,000 barrels equivalent per day from earlier projections. As well as refocusing towards oil in our Eagle Ford Shale program that has already begun. Here, we're emphasizing value over volume growth. 
A range of 210,000 to 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent to-date for 2011 is where I think we'll fall. Again, how quickly the Gulf of Mexico returns to work being by far the biggest driver in that range.
We recommenced our exploration program in the latter part of September and should see results coming in over this quarter. In the U.K., our non-operated prospect adjacent to the Mungo field did not encounter commercial quantities hydrocarbon and has been expensed as a dry hole. 
In Congo, we just finished the Titane #1 well in MPN block and found a small oil tieback sized accumulation, which is encouraging for nearby prospects, but clearly not what we were hoping for. That rig has now started up in the MPS block, where we have 3 remaining high potential prospects left to drill.
In Suriname, we are opening up a new play and will spud the first well very shortly, then in fourth quarter, we'll start turning the bit in our Indonesian Semai II Block for a very large target. In the Gulf of Mexico, our non-operated Deep Blue prospect in Green Canyon 723 remain suspended. Work will recommence once permits are in place. 
Looking forward into 2011 and also 2012, we have a full and impactful exploration program with attractive prospects being tested by over a dozen wells spanning 7 countries in 2011 and a similar number in 2012, spanning 6 countries, including some resumption of activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Our North American resource position provides a nice complement to our global exploration activity. And in September, we announced entry into a fourth play, this one in Southern Alberta, targeting the oil-prone Exshaw formation, which is analogous to the Bakken play on the U.S. side of the border. We are moving forward with plans for early drilling next year to appraise our position, which we continue to grow on a now close to 150,000 net acres. 
In Western Canada, we have 6 rigs operating between the Montney acreage at Tupper and our heavy oil operation at Seal. Plans are moving forward to bring on the new Tupper West gas plant with its capacity of 180 million cubic feet a day in the first half of 2011. The Seal and Haynesville recovery pilots are ongoing, and we expect to have the results incorporated into our plans in the first quarter of 2011. 
Onshore in the U.S., our operations in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas continue to be very encouraging as we focus on the oil-rich areas of the play with 3 rigs running. In Karnes County, we have 2 producing wells that together are making over 800 barrels of oil a day. A third well, the Shendell [ph] Unit A, was drilled to a total depth of 16,395 feet with a lateral section of 4,500 feet, and this well is scheduled for completion early this month and will provide the basis for a sanctioned development of this area towards the end of the year. 
In Dimmit County, we have drilled 3 wells and completed one well, the Briggs [ph] #1, which is currently producing 175 barrels of oil per day as the well has choked back to maintain a stable rate during this evaluation and cleanup period following its completion. The 2 other wells, Briggs [ph] #2 and #3, will be completed later in the fourth quarter. Overall, our North American resource acreage is now around 700,000 net acres and strongly weighted towards oil.
Business development remains active for us, and we have recently signed an agreement with the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq to acquire 50% interest in the Central Dohuk Block where we will operate. The block covers 619 square kilometers and sits within a world-class petroleum province and on trend with recent exploration drilling which has shown much promise. We plan to shoot seismic in 2011, with an exploration well to follow. Other opportunities are being worked, and we will open an office in Erbil shortly. 
Switching to downstream, the process to divest our refining and U.K. marketing assets is, as I mentioned earlier, moving forward as planned. Operationally, U.S. retail continued its steady performance in the third quarter, capturing good margins while maintaining strong fuel volumes despite rising wholesale prices late in the quarter. 
The retail chain expansion continues with year-to-date additions of 38 stores, bringing the current station count to 1,086. U.S. refining margins were under pressure for most of the quarter at Meraux until crack spreads improved in September. 
Superior asphalt business continued to provide a steady contribution. In September, we reached final agreement with the EPA on a consent decree for both U.S. refineries. This allows those assets to focus on their future safe, compliant and reliable operations. 
In the U.K., as our retail group continued its steady performance, the Milford Haven refinery was struggling in a difficult Northwest Europe market environment until margin showed some improvement in September. We are scheduling a minor crude unit outage in November to complete some further modifications that will increase crude throughputs to 130,000 barrels a day. 
In our renewable fuels business, the ethanol plant in Hankinson, North Dakota continues to be a steady performer, with production rates at 120 million gallons per year level. Margins are strong for the quarter as ethanol outpaced the jump in corn prices that concerned over yield forecasts and increased export demand. Since acquiring the plant in the fourth quarter of 2009, Hankinson has provided a solid financial contribution, returning close to $18 million of net income and $28 million of cash flow. 
We closed on our purchase of the partially built Hereford, Texas ethanol plant in August. Engineering work is ongoing and plant modifications will be completed with startup scheduled near the end of the first quarter of 2011. The plant is expected to achieve production rates of 115 million gallons per year as production ramps up. 
During this quarter, of course, the EPA announced a waiver for E15 for newer model vehicles. This should help extend the blend world for corn-based ethanol production. 
So in summary, we are back actively exploring testing high-impact prospects, as well as adding new high potential oil opportunities to our portfolio, witness the addition of acreage in South Alberta for the Exshaw play and the new acreage in Kurdistan. I expect to see this activity continue through the remainder of this year and into 2011 as our budget and plans become finalized. 
Appraisal drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale is encouraging, and our EOR pilot work at Seal is moving forward nicely. U.S. retail continues to shine, and our divestment of the refining assets continues to plan. 
That concludes my prepared remarks and I'm now happy to take your questions."

Karnes, once we get the results of the Shendell [ph] well, we'll have a better sense of what area we want to include in the development plan. And overall, we've got 6 wells to frac between now and the end of the year throughout the program, and so getting more data is always helpful going into a sanction. If you look at the wells that we've had on production, the longest one has produced about 140,000 barrels so far, since it came on the Drees well, and then the JOG unit well has produced over 50,000 barrels. So both very nice wells, and I think the Shendell [ph] well will hopefully reinforce that. But the Dimmit County well is in a different part of the play and actually behave differently but very similar to how other operator's wells were doing. And when it came on production, it actually made 100% water. And it wasn't until we recovered about 10% of the water load that we actually started making oil. And so we got the well up to 175 barrels a day on a small choke, and we've just been dewatering that well. So I think it will do more. I don't know what it will do. What we want to do is complete the frac-ing on 2 other wells there and then get a better sense of what we've got. But I will say I'm very encouraged by what we have there at Dimmit."

The 10 million barrels in my mind is a small oil accumulation tieback, so I would cast a net in that direction. And the reason -- well, so this is early days yet, but we think what's happened is that there's likely to have been a seal leak here because we have a very well-defined structure that has some faulting through it. The channel system that Titane found stretches basically east-west and runs into the northern part of the MPS Block. So when I make a comment about encouraging for nearby prospects, the prospect that I think it upgrades is the RR [ph] prospect, which has always been a favorite of ours, in the northeast part of MPS because those same channels run across that. Now that prospect is different because it's a low relief, 4-way dip feature, very large, couple of hundred million barrels per channel, 2 channels. That clearly won't have this faulting issue and potential leakage issue. So the results of Titane, I think, upgrade RR [ph] and RR [ph] is about 15 to 20 kilometers away, maybe a bit less depending on where you drill the well, and so encouraging for that part of the acreage. And we really have now go to back and incorporate the results of this well, take another look at RR [ph] and see when we want to drill it. We did about 3 years ago conduct a CSCM program, one of these electromagnetic programs, on some high grade prospects. One of the prospect that we shot was RR[ph], and it does have a very attractive looking CSCM anomaly. And so the combination of Titane's results and the CSCM, I think, allow us to be a little more optimistic about RR [ph]. So that's kind of where we are today."

If you look at what we're doing in this remainder of the year, it's a lot of exploration expense, about $140 million, but let me kind of give you some granularity on that. Of that $140 million, $46.5 million is basically appraisal wells in Malaysia. We're drilling an appraisal well on the Kerisi discovery or Kerisi #2. That's in Block K. That will be a subsea tieback to Kikeh. We're drilling 2 wells at South Acis in Sarawak blocks. We think that maybe an oil-plus gas development, and we're trying to get comfortable to be able to sanction that next year. And we're appraising a potential Phase III gas discovery that we made at a prospect called Terra. And so really, we're spending a little less than $100 million as true exploration exposure. And so that's kind of the way it will run. Now as far as timing goes, sometimes you're not in control of your own destiny. And some of our partners, particularly national oil companies, like to announce good news. So my preference is to not talk about the Congo program until we're finished. But we just announced about Titane because I thought that was important. And so I think we'll look at it as we go along and make the calls as we go. I will tell you on Congo, we're drilling 2 wells at Turquoise, Turquoise 3 and Turquoise 4, in Cobalt. And the rig is currently batch setting the Turquoise 3 and Turquoise 4 shallower section. It's actually on Turquoise 4 now. And then it goes to drill Cobalt, and then it comes back to finish the wells through their objectives section at Turquoise Marine 3 and 4. We have added a deepening to Turquoise Marine 4. As we've been working reprocessed data, we've seen the deepening potential become quite attractive under the Turquoise feature. As you recall, we have oil in the Miocene section. We now believe that there is some deeper Oligocene and Albian or Cretaceous age section that could potentially be quite large. I'm talking a couple of 100 million-barrel type potential in addition to what we were drilling before. So that may well impact the overall timing here, Evan, but we're excited about it.

That's a simple answer. We like the prospectivity in this area. We're near -- it's in the northern part of Kurdistan and adjacent to a couple of other discoveries, their surface and declines that we're drilling. But people tend to make large discoveries there.

But I don't have a problem getting in early, and that's why we're opening an office in Erbil and looking to secure more opportunities. So I would love to be in a position of making a big discovery here than having to worry about how much pipeline capacity I need. But I think that's not going to unique to Al Blanca [ph]. I think that part of the world is highly prospective, and I think those infrastructure issues are being addressed and are going to be addressed in the future."
