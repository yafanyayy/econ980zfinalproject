I'd like to start out by saying that I'm very pleased that we've been able to deliver another strong quarter of earnings results. This is indicative of the underlying momentum of our business, including several new and renewed deals that we have signed over the past several months. I have more to say about some of these deals a little later.In the fourth quarter, we saw net revenue growth of 6% on an as reported basis and 2.2% on a constant currency basis. While the weakening U.S. dollar has created a tailwind for us this quarter, we also saw encouraging signs with regard to key aspects of our business.Gross dollar volumes, or GDV, grew 5.3% on a local currency basis. We experienced continued growth in processed transactions and cross-border volumes have returned to positive growth. We also began to see the impact of some of our deals in our rebate and incentive line.Total operating expenses increased for the quarter, primarily driven by higher marketing investments and severance charges that we spoke to on our last call. And I'm pleased that net income grew 21% for the quarter excluding any special items.We delivered strong financial results for the full year with net revenue growth of 2.1% on an as reported basis or almost 4% on a constant currency basis. Excluding one-time items, we delivered an operating margin improvement of 5.5 percentage points over 2008. Adjusting for special items, as well as a gain from the sale of our remaining interest in Redecard in 2008, net income grew approximately 27% for the year on a constant currency basis. Throughout 2009, we took important steps to improve our expense management and resource alignment to ensure that the company is well-positioned for growth as the global economy continues to improve.With the exception of United States, gross dollar volume grew double-digit during the fourth quarter. We also saw growth of 6.7% in processed transactions around the world. Overall, these results continue to underscore the strength that our global business model affords us even in the current environment.Turning now to some recent trends in the economy and the state of the business in the U.S. and Europe. As we saw last week, U.S. GDP increased at an annual rate of 5.7% for the fourth quarter, primarily driven by exports and inventory building. While the overall trend is reassuring, personal consumption expenditures grew at only 2% for the same period and there is no change to our outlook regarding the U.S. consumer. We continue to be cautious about the health of the consumer as reflected in recent spending trends, as well as the slow pace of real improvement for people's financial security, specifically in housing and unemployment.January's Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index improved 2.3 points, signaling that overall general consumer confidence is stable to slightly improving in the U.S. The short-term outlook was somewhat mixed. Percentage of consumers expecting an improvement in business conditions over the next six months decreased while those anticipating conditions will worsen increased.While home prices were up for several months through November, they are still much below 2007 and home sales for the year dropped sharply by 23%. Although the rate of unemployment has leveled off and most economists do expect an improvement in the second half of 2010, it remains very high at 10%.Our own research indicates a wavering optimism where consumers have grown weary of the slowdown and are preparing for it to last longer than they initially thought. A new mindset seems to be emerging, which suggest that people are looking for opportunities to spend while trying to balance the temptation to consume with the need for restraint due to the realities of the environment.In Europe, the EU consumer sentiment indicator improved somewhat in December, although it remains slightly negative, reflecting a continuing overall pessimistic outlook by euro's own consumer on the financial position of their households, the general economic situation and towards unemployment and the rate of savings. On a more positive note, European business sentiment improved in December, reflecting an expected improvement in general economic activity.In summary, there is some encouraging signs in the recent economic data and consumer sentiment findings. We remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook. Although our assumptions remain unchanged from those I shared with you last quarter. And we don't expect any meaningful global economic improvement until the second half of 2010.Turning to the MasterCard spending pulse data for the U.S. retail sector. Retail sales, and excluding automobiles, increased 2.3% in the fourth quarter with easier year-over-year comparisons supported by higher gasoline prices and a generally healthier holiday shopping season. When you exclude both autos and gas, retail sales grew about 1.6%. The 2009 holiday shopping season returned to a more traditional pattern with sales beginning on Black Friday and then holding momentum through December. This was different from the 2008 season where steep discounting ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday hold a portion of the holiday sales into early November 2008.The net result of the difference is in the 2008 versus the 2009 periods shows a difficult comparison in November and an easier comparison in December of 2009. E-commerce sales benefited from disruptive weather events in the Central region in the U.S. early in the month, and the storms in the East Coast the weekend before Christmas. This weather prevented consumers from traveling to brick and mortar locations and help drive online sales to a 17.7% growth rate in December. E-commerce spending was up over 16% for the fourth quarter.Our analysis shows that retailers did not have to employ broad discounting this holiday season. Inventories appeared to be more aligned with demand, which in turn may be resulting in better financials for retailers and a generally healthier retail environment as we head into 2010.When we look at our MasterCard process volumes and transactions through the first four weeks of January, we see the following. Our cross-border volumes continued to improve across all regions. And we're better than the fourth quarter, which was low single digits. Once again, our Asia-Pacific region continues to demonstrate significant growth on a sequential basis and U.S. cross-border volumes have improved from low single-digit declines and are now trending slightly positive.While not a perfect proxy for gross dollar volume, U.S. processed volume growth continues in the low single-digit range. Process volumes for the rest of the world also continued to improve relative to the fourth quarter.Finally, processed transactions continued to grow in the mid single-digit range tempered by Maestro losses in the U.K. versus last year. I'll now turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our financial results and operational metrics."

Let me begin on Page 3 of the deck where we're focused on the 2009 actuals versus the 2008 non-GAAP column, which excludes special items.As Bob said, we are pleased to cap off 2009 with strong fourth quarter financ",2297,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Page 3 of the deck where we're focused on the 2009 actuals versus the 2008 non-GAAP column, which excludes special items.As Bob said, we are pleased to cap off 2009 with strong fourth quarter financial results. Fourth quarter net revenues grew 6% to $1.3 billion over the comparable period last year. On a constant currency basis, net revenue grew 2.2%. The revenue increase was primarily driven by pricing changes of approximately five percentage points, a 3.9% increase in cross-border volumes and a 6.7% increase in the number of processed transactions. This was tempered by an increase in rebates and incentives.While we have continued our focus on the expense management, the 9.8% increase we saw in total operating expense for the quarter was driven by our plans for higher advertising and marketing spending and additional severance charges. Foreign exchange also contributed 3.2 percentage points to the increase. As a result, our operating income was $468 million for the quarter and the quarterly operating margin was 36.1%. MasterCard's effective tax rate was 35.8% in the fourth quarter of 2009. The decrease was primarily due to a more favorable mix of earnings, a lower state tax rate and a lower provision for tax reserves in the fourth quarter of 2009. We delivered net income of $294 million or $2.24 per diluted share. Please keep in mind that this includes $0.19 worth of severance-related charges.Turning to Page 4. The global diversification of our business continues to underscore our ability to generate significant volume, transactions and revenue from regions outside of the United States, and has thus cushioned our business from some of the declines that we experienced in our U.S. business. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV was up 5.3% on a local currency basis in the fourth quarter and grew 11% on a U.S. dollar converted basis to $674 billion. We've seen good improvement in U.S. GDV, which is down 3.4%. Actually a great improvement from the high single-digit declines in the third quarter. Across the rest of the world, GDV continue to grow a healthy 11% on a local currency basis, or an increase of 21.6% on a U.S. dollar basis.Worldwide credit GDV growth was essentially flat on a local currency basis, improving from the mid single-digit declines in the third quarter. U.S. credit GDV growth continues to improve on a sequential basis but is still down in the low teens range. Credit GDV for the rest of the world continue to grow at 5.4% on a local currency basis or 16.1% on a U.S. dollar basis. Worldwide debit GDV grew 19.7% on a local currency basis. This compares to about 11.5% growth in the fourth quarter of last year and is actually the highest quarterly rate of growth this year.In the U.S., debit GDV volume grew at 10.5% and debit growth for the rest of the world was 31.3%, primarily driven once again by growth in our Asia-Pacific, Middle East Africa region. On a local currency basis, worldwide purchase volume grew 5.7% and U.S. purchase volume declined 1.3% for the quarter driven by a declining credit volume.Let's turn to cross-border volumes. Cross-border volume growth on a local currency basis was up 3.9%. We saw a double-digit growth in our Asia-Pacific, Middle East Africa region, as well as strong cross-border growth across our European businesses. In the U.S., cross-border volume growth was just slightly negative, a vast improvement over the last four quarters when we experienced double-digit declines in each quarter.We did see a decrease in our Latin American region due to a sharp drop off in the Venezuelan cross-border activities. Our cross-border transaction growth in the fourth quarter also refer to the double-digit growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2008. When we look at processed transactions, they increased 6.7% compared with year-ago quarter of $5.9 billion.In Asia-Pacific Middle East Africa and the Latin American regions, processed transactions grew in double-digit rates. With the exception of Europe, all other regions grew at mid to high single-digit rates. Excluding the impact of the last two Maestro portfolios in the U.K. and one U.S. debit portfolio, processed transaction growth would've been in the low double-digit range.The secular shift from cash electronic payment forms continues to provide significant growth opportunities. The number of MasterCard branded cards worldwide declined 1.3% to $966 million for the quarter, primarily as a result of U.S. issuers purchase [ph] accounts [ph]. Excluding the U.S., the rest of the world card issuance grew 7.2%. December 31, 2009, there were approximately $1.6 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued globally. Now let's turn to Page 5. As I mentioned earlier, net revenue for the fourth quarter grew 6% on an as reported basis or 2.2% on a constant currency basis.  Domestic assessments increased 4.9% from the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to increased volumes, partially offset by the repeal of some European pricing. As you know, we agreed to repeal some of our October 2008 pricing actions as part of an interim arrangement with the European commission effective July 2009.Cross-border volume fees increased by 21.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to new pricing implemented during the quarter. Most of which was rebated to customers. Cross-border volume growth of 12.1% on a U.S. dollar basis also contributed to the growth in this revenue line item. Transaction processing fees increased 20.3% compared to the prior period. Pricing changes introduced in the U.S. in April 2009 accounted for approximately half of the increase. Growth in processed transactions account for most of the remaining increase. Other revenues increased 8.8% versus the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily driven by a number of items, such as compliance and penalty fees. All of these factors that I just mentioned resulted in the 13.5% increase in gross revenue.As Bob mentioned earlier, we began to see the impact of some deals that closed in the quarter on the rebates and incentive line. Of the 35.1% increase, approximately two-thirds was due to new and renewed customer agreements and the other third was due to rebates associated with the new cross-border pricing. For the quarter, rebates and incentives represented 30.7% of gross revenues versus the 25.7% in the fourth quarter a year ago. Now we'll turn to Page 6 for some detail on expenses. During the fourth quarter, total operating expenses increased 9.8% excluding special items. This includes severance-related charges of $38 million for the quarter. Without the impact of severance in both this quarter and the year ago quarter, total operating expenses increased 7.4%. Including special items, total operating expenses increased 6.6% on a constant currency basis. The increase was mainly driven by the following: General and administrative expenses increased 1.6% with currency fluctuations accounting for 2.3 percentage points of the increase; G&A included the severance-related charges; excluding those charges for both periods, general and administrative expenses decreased actually 2.3% versus the same period of 2008.Advertising and marketing expense increased by 25.1% versus the year-ago period. This increase represents incremental investments in priority countries including funds originally anticipated to be deployed in the third quarter, and increased in revenues in media, customer marketing and promotions. Foreign currency fluctuations accounted for 5.4 percentage points off the increase. Now let's turn to Page 7 and let's take a quick look at our strong 2009 full year performance, which we are very proud of when you consider the environment that we were facing at this time last year. We delivered net income of $1.5 billion excluding special items or $11.19 per diluted share. Also excluding the gains from the sale of our Redecard investments in 2008, net income grew approximately 27% for 2009. And excluding severance charges in both years, net income grew approximately 32%. We achieved full year net revenue of $5.1 billion, representing growth of 2.1% and on a constant currency basis, net revenue grew 3.9%.Pricing adjustments contributed approximately six percentage points of the growth and net revenue growth for 2009 was also driven by processed transaction growth of 6.9%. These positive factors were partially offset by the impact of lower cross-border volumes on a U.S. dollar basis and higher rebate and incentive.  Total operating expenses for the year declined 6.9%, excluding special items and by 10.5% when you also exclude severance-related charges in both periods. Finally, you saw our 2009 full year operating margins improved by 5.5 percentage points to 44.5% from 39% in 2008, excluding special items in both years. Moving to the cash flow statement and balance sheet highlights on Page 8, we generated $284 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter and ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and current investments of $2.9 billion.Before moving on to our 2010 outlook, I'd just like to spend a minute on one other capital structure item. Many of you have asked about what happens to our Class B stocks upon the fourth anniversary of our IPO on May. As you will recall, following the conversion programs that we have run in the last three years, shares of Class B common stock now represents just over 15% or approximately $20 million of our outstanding shares. Once Class B ownership drops below 15%, as a result of holders' voluntary election to convert the Class M shares and associated voting rights will be automatically be redeemed. Earlier this week, our Board of Directors approved plans for further Class B conversion programs that will begin after May 31. We included summary of these programs in our Form 8-K file earlier this morning.Turning to 2010, we believe the world ahead is a positive one, though there will undoubtedly be some challenges as we navigate through the first half of the year. We're carefully balancing our risks and opportunities and looking at the realities of what's happening across the world. While most economic and consumer indicators are slowly improving, we expect challenges during the first half will be concentrated in the U.S. and in Europe.In the U.S., there is still uncertainty in our industry around the implication of the credit card act. How this plays out will of course determine our customers' actions with respect to their cards businesses. And in Europe, we are making nice progress across the SEPA and Eastern European region. Although as I mentioned earlier, this is being tempered by Maestro losses in the U.K. and the repeal of some 2008 pricing.We are seeing encouraging signs in other parts of the world. For instance in Asia-Pacific and some countries in Latin America continue to expect double-digit volume growth. Additionally, cross-border activity levels are picking up around the world, which as you know is an attractive revenue driver for us.As outlined on Slide 9, the following represents our current view of 2010 on a constant currency basis. We expect that net revenue growth will be better than the 3.9% growth we saw in 2009. Based on what we expect for the first few months of the year, it is unlikely that in 2010, we can get back to our old 12% to 15% average annual net revenue objective.We expect some contribution from pricing though at a lower level than what we saw last year. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth revenue will continue to grow in a trajectory, a bit steeper, than what we've experienced over the past two years, with some variation between the quarters depending on our deal activity. As Bob mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with the number of new and renewed deals that we have signed in 2009 and we look for this momentum to continue into 2010. The results, rebates and incentives line will include the impact of both the 2009 deals, as well as new agreements that we signed in 2010. Also included will be the impact of the new cross-border pricing has a rebate component to it.If you just think about it, rebates and incentives are just another form of reinvestment in our business so it should not be surprising to see this line increase, as we work to drive volume and new business opportunities. Over the last year or so, we have made significant progress in realigning the expense face of our company in response to the realities of the market. We anticipate our total operating expenses will be flat to slightly down. At this point in time, we believe that our expense realignment efforts are essentially behind us. We will continue to invest for future growth, therefore, you should be careful about factoring the entire benefit of the 2009 severance actions into your models.Turning to advertising and marketing. We currently expect to be up mid single-digits from our full year 2009 spend. If the market environment recovers faster than we currently expect, we will then need to reassess and potentially increase our marketing support.In terms of quarterly cadence, similar to past years, spending in the first quarter will be the lowest of the year. We are currently planning for the spend of the remaining three quarters to be relatively equal, although this is something we will be evaluating on quarter-by-quarter basis as the year progresses.Finally, we remain committed to our longer term of objectives of annual margin expansion of three to five percentage points and average net income growth of 20% to 30%. Remember, while all of our objectives are on a constant currency basis, our as reported numbers will include any impact of foreign exchange.We're also assuming an effective tax rate of 34.5% for 2010. Overall, as we look at our performance expectations for 2010, we believe that we will be able to steer through the challenges in order to deliver another solid year. Let me now turn the call back to Bob to cover some recent business highlights."

SunTrust will convert all of its debit card programs to MasterCard. After the conversion, which is expected to begin later this year, SunTrust will issue approximately 5 million MasterCard debit cards. This is a significant win for our U.S. Debit business, and we're very pleased to start of the year with this new partnership.Additionally, SunTrust will be expanding its current commercial offering in the future to include MasterCard commercial credit cards. We look forward to working with SunTrust to enhance the value of their payments business. In January, we renewed and extended our agreement with Woodforest Bank, one of our large debit issuers based in Texas. This includes both our consumer and small-business debit portfolios. We also renewed and extended our agreement with Comerica Bank in December. Both our commercial card and public sector prepaid business with Comerica is included within the scope of this agreement.  We're pleased to continue to work with both Comerica and Woodforest to grow our mutual businesses and to reinforce our already strong partnerships. In a deal that represents both our prepaid expertise and our best in class processing capabilities, ABN AMRO in the Netherlands has selected our IPS processing platform for their prepaid business. IPS was implemented in 2009 and has enabled ABN AMRO to achieve back-office efficiencies, which has led to increased productivity and competitiveness in winning new business.In Germany, WestLB started issuance of the first PAYBACK Maestro debit cards with the initial conversion of their private label portfolio. The new issuance has enabled cardholders to immediately benefit from value adding Maestro functions including worldwide acceptance, secure online shopping through secure code, and contact-less payments with PayPass.  PAYBACK is one of Europe's leading loyalty programs. We're happy to be working with WestLB and PAYBACK. Turning to some recent developments within our innovative platforms group, we're pleased with recent announcements about our MasterCard in Control offering. As many of you know, this is our innovative product that offers financial institutions an array of advanced authorization, routing and alert controls that they can use to create products for their cardholders.In the U.K., Barclaycard will now offer the option of MasterCard in Control functionality. This is the first consumer use of our service that enables cardholders to set spending controls and receive realtime information about their accounts. Features include automated SMS alerts to keep tabs on spending, alerts and blocks for online card spending or high-value transactions, and weekly or monthly budgets with alerts when that budget is reached.These include automated SMS alerts to keep tabs on spending, alerts and blocks for online card spending or high-value transactions and weekly or monthly budgets with alerts when that budget is reached.In Mobile, there are two developments I'd like to highlight. In Canada, we announced a mobile trial with Bank of Montréal and Research In Motion to bring mobile payments to Blackberry smartphones through our MasterCard PayPass Tap & Go contactless technology. In Brazil,  Itau Unibanco and Redecard along with mobile operator Vivo will be the first to use the MasterCard Mobile Payments Gateway to deliver mobile payment solutions to the bank's customers in Brazil. This will allow customers to use their phone as a mobile wallet and link existing credit, debit or prepaid MasterCard or Maestro accounts to their phone to fund mobile-initiated payments.In the transit space, when you couple our leading contactless PayPass technology with the unparalleled speed of our network, it results in great value and efficiencies for both transit systems and cardholders and we've had several new developments. Including in Turkey, we've expanded number of cities that expect PayPass for transit payments. In the U.K., contactless payments went live in Liverpool with Stagecoach's 200 strong bus network and Transport for London is also planning to accept PayPass. In France, the second phase of the public transportation trial with PayPass went live with RATP and La Banque Postale. And in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro, we launched the first contactless payment application for public transportation in Latin America.Overall, we're very pleased with the business momentum we have as we head into the new year. We look forward to working with our customers and merchant partners on these and future opportunities that will make everyday commerce easier and more efficient for everyone involved.I'll now turn the call back over to Barbara, so we can begin taking your questions."

One component where it goes through the gross revenue line. The other component which goes now through the rebates and incentive line. And you typically don't have that, Bob, so that's a new factor.

And that's because of the fairly significant divergence among various markets around the world both from the standpoint of the health of the financial institution and the health of the consumer and the economy. But also from the perspective of different challenges in those market with regard to the evolution of the structure of their payment system. Let me be specific. You still have a lot of ATM transactions in a market like Japan relative to the POS number of transactions that you would expect to see in a more developed market. And so as we went through our planning process, we became very market-focused and those initiatives that we felt would produce the best value for the company. And you will have to go market by market to answer that question. That's not something I'm in a position to do today. The three or four themes that emerged are the ones that I've already mentioned. We've got a lot of focus on the debit and prepaid space around the world. The more affluent consumer has performed better, has gotten through this difficult time better and is an increasing focus of the financial institutions we do business with. And as I already mentioned, our focus on making investments in some of the emerging markets, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and so forth continues to have a high priority for the company, as those are the places where we see greater growth opportunity for the near to midterm future."

Our business model, good capital structure and sound management practices allowed us to remain flexible and adaptable as we weathered the storm.Now some 18 months later, I believe we've emerged even stronger. We've made investments that laid groundwork for future growth. We've sharpened our focus on local market opportunities.

I'd like to start out by saying that I'm very pleased that we've been able to deliver another strong quarter of earnings results. This is indicative of the underlying momentum of our business, including several new and renewed deals that we have signed over the past several months. I have more to say about some of these deals a little later.In the fourth quarter, we saw net revenue growth of 6% on an as reported basis and 2.2% on a constant currency basis. While the weakening U.S. dollar has created a tailwind for us this quarter, we also saw encouraging signs with regard to key aspects of our business.Gross dollar volumes, or GDV, grew 5.3% on a local currency basis. We experienced continued growth in processed transactions and cross-border volumes have returned to positive growth. We also began to see the impact of some of our deals in our rebate and incentive line.Total operating expenses increased for the quarter, primarily driven by higher marketing investments and severance charges that we spoke to on our last call. And I'm pleased that net income grew 21% for the quarter excluding any special items.We delivered strong financial results for the full year with net revenue growth of 2.1% on an as reported basis or almost 4% on a constant currency basis. Excluding one-time items, we delivered an operating margin improvement of 5.5 percentage points over 2008. Adjusting for special items, as well as a gain from the sale of our remaining interest in Redecard in 2008, net income grew approximately 27% for the year on a constant currency basis. Throughout 2009, we took important steps to improve our expense management and resource alignment to ensure that the company is well-positioned for growth as the global economy continues to improve.With the exception of United States, gross dollar volume grew double-digit during the fourth quarter. We also saw growth of 6.7% in processed transactions around the world. Overall, these results continue to underscore the strength that our global business model affords us even in the current environment.Turning now to some recent trends in the economy and the state of the business in the U.S. and Europe. As we saw last week, U.S. GDP increased at an annual rate of 5.7% for the fourth quarter, primarily driven by exports and inventory building. While the overall trend is reassuring, personal consumption expenditures grew at only 2% for the same period and there is no change to our outlook regarding the U.S. consumer. We continue to be cautious about the health of the consumer as reflected in recent spending trends, as well as the slow pace of real improvement for people's financial security, specifically in housing and unemployment.January's Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index improved 2.3 points, signaling that overall general consumer confidence is stable to slightly improving in the U.S. The short-term outlook was somewhat mixed. Percentage of consumers expecting an improvement in business conditions over the next six months decreased while those anticipating conditions will worsen increased.While home prices were up for several months through November, they are still much below 2007 and home sales for the year dropped sharply by 23%. Although the rate of unemployment has leveled off and most economists do expect an improvement in the second half of 2010, it remains very high at 10%.Our own research indicates a wavering optimism where consumers have grown weary of the slowdown and are preparing for it to last longer than they initially thought. A new mindset seems to be emerging, which suggest that people are looking for opportunities to spend while trying to balance the temptation to consume with the need for restraint due to the realities of the environment.In Europe, the EU consumer sentiment indicator improved somewhat in December, although it remains slightly negative, reflecting a continuing overall pessimistic outlook by euro's own consumer on the financial position of their households, the general economic situation and towards unemployment and the rate of savings. On a more positive note, European business sentiment improved in December, reflecting an expected improvement in general economic activity.In summary, there is some encouraging signs in the recent economic data and consumer sentiment findings. We remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook. Although our assumptions remain unchanged from those I shared with you last quarter. And we don't expect any meaningful global economic improvement until the second half of 2010.Turning to the MasterCard spending pulse data for the U.S. retail sector. Retail sales, and excluding automobiles, increased 2.3% in the fourth quarter with easier year-over-year comparisons supported by higher gasoline prices and a generally healthier holiday shopping season. When you exclude both autos and gas, retail sales grew about 1.6%. The 2009 holiday shopping season returned to a more traditional pattern with sales beginning on Black Friday and then holding momentum through December. This was different from the 2008 season where steep discounting ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday hold a portion of the holiday sales into early November 2008.The net result of the difference is in the 2008 versus the 2009 periods shows a difficult comparison in November and an easier comparison in December of 2009. E-commerce sales benefited from disruptive weather events in the Central region in the U.S. early in the month, and the storms in the East Coast the weekend before Christmas. This weather prevented consumers from traveling to brick and mortar locations and help drive online sales to a 17.7% growth rate in December. E-commerce spending was up over 16% for the fourth quarter.Our analysis shows that retailers did not have to employ broad discounting this holiday season. Inventories appeared to be more aligned with demand, which in turn may be resulting in better financials for retailers and a generally healthier retail environment as we head into 2010.When we look at our MasterCard process volumes and transactions through the first four weeks of January, we see the following. Our cross-border volumes continued to improve across all regions. And we're better than the fourth quarter, which was low single digits. Once again, our Asia-Pacific region continues to demonstrate significant growth on a sequential basis and U.S. cross-border volumes have improved from low single-digit declines and are now trending slightly positive.While not a perfect proxy for gross dollar volume, U.S. processed volume growth continues in the low single-digit range. Process volumes for the rest of the world also continued to improve relative to the fourth quarter.Finally, processed transactions continued to grow in the mid single-digit range tempered by Maestro losses in the U.K. versus last year. I'll now turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our financial results and operational metrics."

Let me begin on Page 3 of the deck where we're focused on the 2009 actuals versus the 2008 non-GAAP column, which excludes special items.As Bob said, we are pleased to cap off 2009 with strong fourth quarter financial results. Fourth quarter net revenues grew 6% to $1.3 billion over the comparable period last year. On a constant currency basis, net revenue grew 2.2%. The revenue increase was primarily driven by pricing changes of approximately five percentage points, a 3.9% increase in cross-border volumes and a 6.7% increase in the number of processed transactions. This was tempered by an increase in rebates and incentives.While we have continued our focus on the expense management, the 9.8% increase we saw in total operating expense for the quarter was driven by our plans for higher advertising and marketing spending and additional severance charges. Foreign exchange also contributed 3.2 percentage points to the increase. As a result, our operating income was $468 million for the quarter and the quarterly operating margin was 36.1%. MasterCard's effective tax rate was 35.8% in the fourth quarter of 2009. The decrease was primarily due to a more favorable mix of earnings, a lower state tax rate and a lower provision for tax reserves in the fourth quarter of 2009. We delivered net income of $294 million or $2.24 per diluted share. Please keep in mind that this includes $0.19 worth of severance-related charges.Turning to Page 4. The global diversification of our business continues to underscore our ability to generate significant volume, transactions and revenue from regions outside of the United States, and has thus cushioned our business from some of the declines that we experienced in our U.S. business. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV was up 5.3% on a local currency basis in the fourth quarter and grew 11% on a U.S. dollar converted basis to $674 billion. We've seen good improvement in U.S. GDV, which is down 3.4%. Actually a great improvement from the high single-digit declines in the third quarter. Across the rest of the world, GDV continue to grow a healthy 11% on a local currency basis, or an increase of 21.6% on a U.S. dollar basis.Worldwide credit GDV growth was essentially flat on a local currency basis, improving from the mid single-digit declines in the third quarter. U.S. credit GDV growth continues to improve on a sequential basis but is still down in the low teens range. Credit GDV for the rest of the world continue to grow at 5.4% on a local currency basis or 16.1% on a U.S. dollar basis. Worldwide debit GDV grew 19.7% on a local currency basis. This compares to about 11.5% growth in the fourth quarter of last year and is actually the highest quarterly rate of growth this year.In the U.S., debit GDV volume grew at 10.5% and debit growth for the rest of the world was 31.3%, primarily driven once again by growth in our Asia-Pacific, Middle East Africa region. On a local currency basis, worldwide purchase volume grew 5.7% and U.S. purchase volume declined 1.3% for the quarter driven by a declining credit volume.Let's turn to cross-border volumes. Cross-border volume growth on a local currency basis was up 3.9%. We saw a double-digit growth in our Asia-Pacific, Middle East Africa region, as well as strong cross-border growth across our European businesses. In the U.S., cross-border volume growth was just slightly negative, a vast improvement over the last four quarters when we experienced double-digit declines in each quarter.We did see a decrease in our Latin American region due to a sharp drop off in the Venezuelan cross-border activities. Our cross-border transaction growth in the fourth quarter also refer to the double-digit growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2008. When we look at processed transactions, they increased 6.7% compared with year-ago quarter of $5.9 billion.In Asia-Pacific Middle East Africa and the Latin American regions, processed transactions grew in double-digit rates. With the exception of Europe, all other regions grew at mid to high single-digit rates. Excluding the impact of the last two Maestro portfolios in the U.K. and one U.S. debit portfolio, processed transaction growth would've been in the low double-digit range.The secular shift from cash electronic payment forms continues to provide significant growth opportunities. The number of MasterCard branded cards worldwide declined 1.3% to $966 million for the quarter, primarily as a result of U.S. issuers purchase [ph] accounts [ph]. Excluding the U.S., the rest of the world card issuance grew 7.2%. December 31, 2009, there were approximately $1.6 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued globally. Now let's turn to Page 5. As I mentioned earlier, net revenue for the fourth quarter grew 6% on an as reported basis or 2.2% on a constant currency basis.  Domestic assessments increased 4.9% from the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to increased volumes, partially offset by the repeal of some European pricing. As you know, we agreed to repeal some of our October 2008 pricing actions as part of an interim arrangement with the European commission effective July 2009.Cross-border volume fees increased by 21.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to new pricing implemented during the quarter. Most of which was rebated to customers. Cross-border volume growth of 12.1% on a U.S. dollar basis also contributed to the growth in this revenue line item. Transaction processing fees increased 20.3% compared to the prior period. Pricing changes introduced in the U.S. in April 2009 accounted for approximately half of the increase. Growth in processed transactions account for most of the remaining increase. Other revenues increased 8.8% versus the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily driven by a number of items, such as compliance and penalty fees. All of these factors that I just mentioned resulted in a 13.5% increase in gross revenue.As Bob mentioned earlier, we began to see the impact of some deals that closed in the quarter on the rebates and incentive line. Of the 35.1% increase, approximately two-thirds was due to new and renewed customer agreements, and the other third was due to rebates associated with the new cross-border pricing. For the quarter, rebates and incentives represented 30.7% of gross revenues versus the 25.7% in the fourth quarter a year ago. Now we'll turn to Page 6 for some detail on expenses. During the fourth quarter, total operating expenses increased 9.8%, excluding special items. This includes severance-related charges of $38 million for the quarter. Without the impact of severance in both this quarter and the year ago quarter, total operating expenses increased 7.4%. Including special items, total operating expenses increased 6.6% on a constant currency basis. The increase was mainly driven by the following: General and administrative expenses increased 1.6% with currency fluctuations accounting for 2.3 percentage points of the increase; G&A included the severance-related charges; excluding those charges for both periods, general and administrative expenses decreased actually 2.3% versus the same period in 2008.Advertising and marketing expense increased by 25.1% versus the year-ago period. This increase represents incremental investment in priority countries, including funds originally anticipated to be deployed in the third quarter, and increased investments in media, customer marketing and promotions. Foreign currency fluctuations accounted for 5.4 percentage points of the increase. Now let's turn to Page 7 and let's take a quick look at our strong 2009 full year performance, which we are very proud of when you consider the environment that we were facing at this time last year. We delivered net income of $1.5 billion, excluding special items, or $11.19 per diluted share. Also excluding the gains from the sale of our Redecard investments in 2008, net income grew approximately 27% for 2009. And excluding severance charges in both years, net income grew approximately 32%. We achieved full year net revenue of $5.1 billion, representing growth of 2.1% and on a constant currency basis, net revenue grew 3.9%.Pricing adjustments contributed approximately six percentage points of the growth, and net revenue growth for 2009 was also driven by processed transaction growth of 6.9%. These positive factors were partially offset by the impact of lower cross-border volumes on a U.S. dollar basis and higher rebates and incentives.  Total operating expenses for the year declined 6.9%, excluding special items, and declined 10.5% when you also exclude severance-related charges in both periods. Finally, you saw our 2009 full year operating margins improve 5.5 percentage points to 44.5% from 39% in 2008, excluding special items in both years. Moving to the cash flow statement and balance sheet highlights on Page 8, we generated $284 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter and ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and current investments of $2.9 billion.Before moving on to our 2010 outlook, I'd just like to spend a minute on one other capital structure item. Many of you have asked about what happens to our Class B stocks upon the fourth anniversary of our IPO on May. As you will recall, following the conversion programs that we have run in the last three years, shares of Class B common stock now represents just over 15% or approximately $20 million of our outstanding shares. Once Class B ownership drops below 15%, as a result of holders' voluntary election to convert the Class M shares and associated voting rights will be automatically be redeemed. Earlier this week, our Board of Directors approved plans for further Class B conversion programs that will begin after May 31. We included summary of these programs in our Form 8-K file earlier this morning.Turning to 2010, we believe the world ahead is a positive one, though there will undoubtedly be some challenges as we navigate through the first half of the year. We're carefully balancing our risks and opportunities and looking at the realities of what's happening across the world. While most economic and consumer indicators are slowly improving, we expect challenges during the first half will be concentrated in the U.S. and in Europe.In the U.S., there is still uncertainty in our industry around the implication of the credit card act. How this plays out will of course determine our customers' actions with respect to their cards businesses. And in Europe, we are making nice progress across the SEPA and Eastern European region. Although as I mentioned earlier, this is being tempered by Maestro losses in the U.K. and the repeal of some 2008 pricing.We are seeing encouraging signs in other parts of the world. For instance in Asia-Pacific and some countries in Latin America continue to expect double-digit volume growth. Additionally, cross-border activity levels are picking up around the world, which as you know is an attractive revenue driver for us.As outlined on Slide 9, the following represents our current view of 2010 on a constant currency basis. We expect that net revenue growth will be better than the 3.9% growth we saw in 2009. Based on what we expect for the first few months of the year, it is unlikely that in 2010, we can get back to our old 12% to 15% average annual net revenue objective.We expect some contribution from pricing though at a lower level than what we saw last year. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth revenue will continue to grow in a trajectory a bit steeper than what we've experienced over the past two years, with some variation between the quarters depending on our deal activity. As Bob mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with the number of new and renewed deals that we have signed in 2009, and we look for this momentum to continue into 2010. As a result, the rebate and incentive line will include the impact of both the 2009 deals, as well as new agreements that we signed in 2010. Also included will be the impact of the new cross-border pricing that has a rebate component to it.So if you just think about it, rebates and incentives are just another form of reinvestment in our business, so it should not be surprising to see this line increase, as we work to drive volume and new business opportunities. Over the last year or so, we have made significant progress in realigning the expense base of our company in response to the realities of the market. We anticipate our total operating expenses will be flat to slightly down. At this point in time, we believe that our expense realignment efforts are essentially behind us. We will continue to invest for future growth. Therefore, you should be careful about factoring the entire benefit of the 2009 severance actions into your models.Turning to advertising and marketing. We currently expect to be up mid single-digits from our full year 2009 spend. If the market environment recovers faster than we currently expect, we will then need to reassess and potentially increase our marketing support.In terms of quarterly cadence, similar to past years, spending in the first quarter will be the lowest of the year. We are currently planning for the spend in the remaining three quarters to be relatively equal, although this is something we will be evaluating on a quarter-by-quarter basis as the year progresses.Finally, we remain committed to our longer term of objectives of annual margin expansion of 3 to 5 percentage points, and average net income growth of 20% to 30%. Remember, while all of our objectives are on a constant currency basis, our as reported numbers will include any impact of foreign exchange.We're also assuming an effective tax rate of 34.5% for 2010. Overall, as we look at our performance expectations for 2010, we believe that we will be able to steer through the challenges in order to deliver another solid year. Let me now turn the call back to Bob to cover some recent business highlights."

SunTrust will convert all of its debit card programs to MasterCard. After the conversion, which is expected to begin later this year, SunTrust will issue approximately 5 million MasterCard debit cards. This is a significant win for our U.S. Debit business, and we're very pleased to start off the year with this new partnership.Additionally, SunTrust will be expanding its current commercial offering in the future to include MasterCard commercial credit cards. We look forward to working with SunTrust to enhance the value of their payments business. In January, we renewed and extended our agreement with Woodforest Bank, one of our large debit issuers based in Texas. This includes both our consumer and small business debit portfolios. We also renewed and extended our agreement with Comerica Bank in December. Both our commercial card and public sector prepaid business with Comerica is included within the scope of this agreement.  We're pleased to continue to work with both Comerica and Woodforest to grow our mutual businesses, and to reinforce our already strong partnerships. In a deal that represents both our prepaid expertise and our best in class processing capabilities, ABN AMRO in the Netherlands has selected our IPS processing platform for their prepaid business. IPS was implemented in 2009 and has enabled ABN AMRO to achieve back-office efficiencies, which has led to increased productivity and competitiveness in winning new business.In Germany, WestLB started issuance of the first PAYBACK Maestro debit cards with the initial conversion of their private label portfolio. The new issuance has enabled cardholders to immediately benefit from value adding Maestro functions including worldwide acceptance, secure online shopping through secure code, and contact-less payments with PayPass.  PAYBACK is one of Europe's leading loyalty programs. We're happy to be working with WestLB and PAYBACK. Turning to some recent developments within our innovative platforms group, we're pleased with recent announcements about our MasterCard in Control offering. As many of you know, this is our innovative product that offers financial institutions an array of advanced authorization, routing and alert controls that they can use to create products for their cardholders.In the U.K., Barclaycard will now offer the option of MasterCard in Control functionality. This is the first consumer use of our service that enables cardholders to set spending controls and receive realtime information about their accounts. Features include automated SMS alerts to keep tabs on spending, alerts and blocks for online card spending or high-value transactions, and weekly or monthly budgets with alerts when that budget is reached. These include automated SMS alerts to keep tabs on spending, alerts and blocks for online card spending or high-value transactions and weekly or monthly budgets with alerts when that budget is reached.In Mobile, there are two developments I'd like to highlight. In Canada, we announced a mobile trial with Bank of Montréal and Research In Motion to bring mobile payments to Blackberry smartphones through our MasterCard PayPass Tap & Go contactless technology. In Brazil, Itau Unibanco and Redecard along with mobile operator Vivo will be the first to use the MasterCard Mobile Payments Gateway to deliver mobile payment solutions to the bank's customers in Brazil. This will allow customers to use their phone as a mobile wallet and link existing credit, debit or prepaid MasterCard or Maestro accounts to their phone to fund mobile-initiated payments.In the transit space, when you couple our leading contactless PayPass technology with the unparalleled speed of our network, it results in great value and efficiencies for both transit systems and cardholders and we've had several new developments. Including in Turkey, we've expanded number of cities that expect PayPass for transit payments. In the U.K., contactless payments went live in Liverpool with Stagecoach's 200 strong bus network and Transport for London is also planning to accept PayPass. In France, the second phase of the public transportation trial with PayPass went live with RATP and La Banque Postale. And in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro, we launched the first contactless payment application for public transportation in Latin America.Overall, we're very pleased with the business momentum we have as we head into the new year. We look forward to working with our customers and merchant partners on these and future opportunities that will make everyday commerce easier and more efficient for everyone involved.I'll now turn the call back over to Barbara, so we can begin taking your questions."

Now please keep in mind, we have a number of things going on. We already told you the pricing changes that we made in October of 2009 has a rebate component to it, and we pretty much gave you the numbers which allow you to calculate how much in that particular quarter, rebates related to pricing impacted the rebates and incentive line and that will be pretty much going on for all of 2010.

One component where it goes through the gross revenue line. The other component which goes now through the rebates and incentive line. And you typically don't have that, Bob, so that's a new factor.

In terms of severance, for the whole year of 2009, we had almost $140 million of severance, $139 million of severance in the numbers. Every year, we had usually some small, very small amount of severance. We think that small amount of severance will continue but at this point in time, we believe that by and large done with any employee-related action. So we're not going to foresee a large severance charge at this point in time. Just in terms for us to be helpful in terms of what could drop to the bottom line, it's about a 2.2 year payback of the program. So off that $140 million or so that we spend, you can assume that in 2010 about $70 million to $80 million will drop to the bottom line on the G&A side. Albeit as you heard in my comments, we are reinvesting some of that money in specifically advertising and marketing. As we said, that would go up in the mid-single digit rate. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of help on your model."

They were better than what we saw in the fourth quarter, which was low single-digit growth. Once again, I think regionally there are going to be some variations on that. Asia-Pacific is very strong. They continue to grow on a sequential basis. From the standpoint of the U.S. cross-border volumes have improved from what were low single-digit declines, they're now trending slightly positive. If you look at processed volumes, which are a pretty good indicator but they're not a perfect indicator of what the  eventual gross dollar volume numbers will be that we report.

We have a reasonable amount of energy going in to Asia-Pacific and Latin America. From a product sense, the affluent, the prepaid and the debit.

You still have a lot of ATM transactions in a market like Japan relative to the POS number of transactions that you would expect to see in a more developed market. And so as we went through our planning process, we became very market-focused and those initiatives that we felt would produce the best value for the company.

I'd like to start out by saying that I'm very pleased that we've been able to deliver another strong quarter of earnings results. This is indicative of the underlying momentum of our business, including several new and renewed deals that we have signed over the past several months. I have more to say about some of these deals a little later.In the fourth quarter, we saw net revenue growth of 6% on an as reported basis and 2.2% on a constant currency basis. While the weakening U.S. dollar has created a tailwind for us this quarter, we also saw encouraging signs with regard to key aspects of our business.Gross dollar volumes, or GDV, grew 5.3% on a local currency basis. We experienced continued growth in processed transactions and cross-border volumes have returned to positive growth. We also began to see the impact of some of our deals in our rebate and incentive line.Total operating expenses increased for the quarter, primarily driven by higher marketing investments and severance charges that we spoke to on our last call. And I'm pleased that net income grew 21% for the quarter excluding any special items.We delivered strong financial results for the full year with net revenue growth of 2.1% on an as reported basis or almost 4% on a constant currency basis. Excluding one-time items, we delivered an operating margin improvement of 5.5 percentage points over 2008. Adjusting for special items, as well as a gain from the sale of our remaining interest in Redecard in 2008, net income grew approximately 27% for the year on a constant currency basis. Throughout 2009, we took important steps to improve our expense management and resource alignment to ensure that the company is well-positioned for growth as the global economy continues to improve.With the exception of United States, gross dollar volume grew double-digit during the fourth quarter. We also saw growth of 6.7% in processed transactions around the world. Overall, these results continue to underscore the strength that our global business model affords us even in the current environment.Turning now to some recent trends in the economy and the state of the business in the U.S. and Europe. As we saw last week, U.S. GDP increased at an annual rate of 5.7% for the fourth quarter, primarily driven by exports and inventory building. While the overall trend is reassuring, personal consumption expenditures grew at only 2% for the same period and there is no change to our outlook regarding the U.S. consumer. We continue to be cautious about the health of the consumer as reflected in recent spending trends, as well as the slow pace of real improvement for people's financial security, specifically in housing and unemployment.January's Conference Board Consumer Confidence Index improved 2.3 points, signaling that overall general consumer confidence is stable to slightly improving in the U.S. The short-term outlook was somewhat mixed. Percentage of consumers expecting an improvement in business conditions over the next six months decreased while those anticipating conditions will worsen increased.While home prices were up for several months through November, they are still much below 2007 and home sales for the year dropped sharply by 23%. Although the rate of unemployment has leveled off and most economists do expect an improvement in the second half of 2010, it remains very high at 10%.Our own research indicates a wavering optimism where consumers have grown weary of the slowdown and are preparing for it to last longer than they initially thought. A new mindset seems to be emerging, which suggest that people are looking for opportunities to spend while trying to balance the temptation to consume with the need for restraint due to the realities of the environment.In Europe, the EU consumer sentiment indicator improved somewhat in December, although it remains slightly negative, reflecting a continuing overall pessimistic outlook by euro's own consumer on the financial position of their households, the general economic situation and towards unemployment and the rate of savings. On a more positive note, European business sentiment improved in December, reflecting an expected improvement in general economic activity.In summary, there is some encouraging signs in the recent economic data and consumer sentiment findings. We remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook. Although our assumptions remain unchanged from those I shared with you last quarter. And we don't expect any meaningful global economic improvement until the second half of 2010.Turning to the MasterCard spending pulse data for the U.S. retail sector. Retail sales, and excluding automobiles, increased 2.3% in the fourth quarter with easier year-over-year comparisons supported by higher gasoline prices and a generally healthier holiday shopping season. When you exclude both autos and gas, retail sales grew about 1.6%. The 2009 holiday shopping season returned to a more traditional pattern with sales beginning on Black Friday and then holding momentum through December. This was different from the 2008 season where steep discounting ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday hold a portion of the holiday sales into early November 2008.The net result of the difference is in the 2008 versus the 2009 periods shows a difficult comparison in November and an easier comparison in December of 2009. E-commerce sales benefited from disruptive weather events in the Central region in the U.S. early in the month, and the storms in the East Coast the weekend before Christmas. This weather prevented consumers from traveling to brick and mortar locations and help drive online sales to a 17.7% growth rate in December. E-commerce spending was up over 16% for the fourth quarter.Our analysis shows that retailers did not have to employ broad discounting this holiday season. Inventories appeared to be more aligned with demand, which in turn may be resulting in better financials for retailers and a generally healthier retail environment as we head into 2010.When we look at our MasterCard process volumes and transactions through the first four weeks of January, we see the following. Our cross-border volumes continued to improve across all regions. And we're better than the fourth quarter, which was low single digits. Once again, our Asia-Pacific region continues to demonstrate significant growth on a sequential basis and U.S. cross-border volumes have improved from low single-digit declines and are now trending slightly positive.While not a perfect proxy for gross dollar volume, U.S. processed volume growth continues in the low single-digit range. Process volumes for the rest of the world also continued to improve relative to the fourth quarter.Finally, processed transactions continued to grow in the mid single-digit range tempered by Maestro losses in the U.K. versus last year. I'll now turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our financial results and operational metrics."

Let me begin on Page 3 of the deck where we're focused on the 2009 actuals versus the 2008 non-GAAP column, which excludes special items.As Bob said, we are pleased to cap off 2009 with strong fourth quarter financ",2300,"Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Page 3 of the deck where we're focused on the 2009 actuals versus the 2008 non-GAAP column, which excludes special items.As Bob said, we are pleased to cap off 2009 with strong fourth quarter financial results. Fourth quarter net revenues grew 6% to $1.3 billion over the comparable period last year. On a constant currency basis, net revenue grew 2.2%. The revenue increase was primarily driven by pricing changes of approximately five percentage points, a 3.9% increase in cross-border volumes and a 6.7% increase in the number of processed transactions. This was tempered by an increase in rebates and incentives.While we have continued our focus on the expense management, the 9.8% increase we saw in total operating expense for the quarter was driven by our plans for higher advertising and marketing spending and additional severance charges. Foreign exchange also contributed 3.2 percentage points to the increase. As a result, our operating income was $468 million for the quarter and the quarterly operating margin was 36.1%. MasterCard's effective tax rate was 35.8% in the fourth quarter of 2009. The decrease was primarily due to a more favorable mix of earnings, a lower state tax rate and a lower provision for tax reserves in the fourth quarter of 2009. We delivered net income of $294 million or $2.24 per diluted share. Please keep in mind that this includes $0.19 worth of severance-related charges.Turning to Page 4. The global diversification of our business continues to underscore our ability to generate significant volume, transactions and revenue from regions outside of the United States, and has thus cushioned our business from some of the declines that we experienced in our U.S. business. Worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV was up 5.3% on a local currency basis in the fourth quarter and grew 11% on a U.S. dollar converted basis to $674 billion. We've seen good improvement in U.S. GDV, which is down 3.4%. Actually a great improvement from the high single-digit declines in the third quarter. Across the rest of the world, GDV continue to grow a healthy 11% on a local currency basis, or an increase of 21.6% on a U.S. dollar basis.Worldwide credit GDV growth was essentially flat on a local currency basis, improving from the mid single-digit declines in the third quarter. U.S. credit GDV growth continues to improve on a sequential basis but is still down in the low teens range. Credit GDV for the rest of the world continue to grow at 5.4% on a local currency basis or 16.1% on a U.S. dollar basis. Worldwide debit GDV grew 19.7% on a local currency basis. This compares to about 11.5% growth in the fourth quarter of last year and is actually the highest quarterly rate of growth this year.In the U.S., debit GDV volume grew at 10.5% and debit growth for the rest of the world was 31.3%, primarily driven once again by growth in our Asia-Pacific, Middle East Africa region. On a local currency basis, worldwide purchase volume grew 5.7% and U.S. purchase volume declined 1.3% for the quarter driven by a declining credit volume.Let's turn to cross-border volumes. Cross-border volume growth on a local currency basis was up 3.9%. We saw a double-digit growth in our Asia-Pacific, Middle East Africa region, as well as strong cross-border growth across our European businesses. In the U.S., cross-border volume growth was just slightly negative, a vast improvement over the last four quarters when we experienced double-digit declines in each quarter.We did see a decrease in our Latin American region due to a sharp drop off in the Venezuelan cross-border activities. Our cross-border transaction growth in the fourth quarter also refer to the double-digit growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2008. When we look at processed transactions, they increased 6.7% compared with year-ago quarter of $5.9 billion.In Asia-Pacific Middle East Africa and the Latin American regions, processed transactions grew in double-digit rates. With the exception of Europe, all other regions grew at mid to high single-digit rates. Excluding the impact of the last two Maestro portfolios in the U.K. and one U.S. debit portfolio, processed transaction growth would've been in the low double-digit range.The secular shift from cash electronic payment forms continues to provide significant growth opportunities. The number of MasterCard branded cards worldwide declined 1.3% to $966 million for the quarter, primarily as a result of U.S. issuers purchase [ph] accounts [ph]. Excluding the U.S., the rest of the world card issuance grew 7.2%. December 31, 2009, there were approximately $1.6 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued globally. Now let's turn to Page 5. As I mentioned earlier, net revenue for the fourth quarter grew 6% on an as reported basis or 2.2% on a constant currency basis.  Domestic assessments increased 4.9% from the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to increased volumes, partially offset by the repeal of some European pricing. As you know, we agreed to repeal some of our October 2008 pricing actions as part of an interim arrangement with the European commission effective July 2009.Cross-border volume fees increased by 21.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2008, primarily due to new pricing implemented during the quarter. Most of which was rebated to customers. Cross-border volume growth of 12.1% on a U.S. dollar basis also contributed to the growth in this revenue line item. Transaction processing fees increased 20.3% compared to the prior period. Pricing changes introduced in the U.S. in April 2009 accounted for approximately half of the increase. Growth in processed transactions account for most of the remaining increase. Other revenues increased 8.8% versus the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily driven by a number of items, such as compliance and penalty fees. All of these factors that I just mentioned resulted in a 13.5% increase in gross revenue.As Bob mentioned earlier, we began to see the impact of some deals that closed in the quarter on the rebates and incentive line. Of the 35.1% increase, approximately two-thirds was due to new and renewed customer agreements, and the other third was due to rebates associated with the new cross-border pricing. For the quarter, rebates and incentives represented 30.7% of gross revenues versus the 25.7% in the fourth quarter a year ago. Now we'll turn to Page 6 for some detail on expenses. During the fourth quarter, total operating expenses increased 9.8%, excluding special items. This includes severance-related charges of $38 million for the quarter. Without the impact of severance in both this quarter and the year ago quarter, total operating expenses increased 7.4%. Including special items, total operating expenses increased 6.6% on a constant currency basis. The increase was mainly driven by the following: General and administrative expenses increased 1.6% with currency fluctuations accounting for 2.3 percentage points of the increase; G&A included the severance-related charges; excluding those charges for both periods, general and administrative expenses decreased actually 2.3% versus the same period in 2008.Advertising and marketing expense increased by 25.1% versus the year-ago period. This increase represents incremental investment in priority countries, including funds originally anticipated to be deployed in the third quarter, and increased investments in media, customer marketing and promotions. Foreign currency fluctuations accounted for 5.4 percentage points of the increase. Now let's turn to Page 7 and let's take a quick look at our strong 2009 full year performance, which we are very proud of when you consider the environment that we were facing at this time last year. We delivered net income of $1.5 billion, excluding special items, or $11.19 per diluted share. Also excluding the gains from the sale of our Redecard investments in 2008, net income grew approximately 27% for 2009. And excluding severance charges in both years, net income grew approximately 32%. We achieved full year net revenue of $5.1 billion, representing growth of 2.1% and on a constant currency basis, net revenue grew 3.9%.Pricing adjustments contributed approximately six percentage points of the growth, and net revenue growth for 2009 was also driven by processed transaction growth of 6.9%. These positive factors were partially offset by the impact of lower cross-border volumes on a U.S. dollar basis and higher rebates and incentives.  Total operating expenses for the year declined 6.9%, excluding special items, and declined 10.5% when you also exclude severance-related charges in both periods. Finally, you saw our 2009 full year operating margins improve 5.5 percentage points to 44.5% from 39% in 2008, excluding special items in both years. Moving to the cash flow statement and balance sheet highlights on Page 8, we generated $284 million in cash from operations in the fourth quarter and ended the year with cash, cash equivalents and current investments of $2.9 billion.Before moving on to our 2010 outlook, I'd just like to spend a minute on one other capital structure item. Many of you have asked about what happens to our Class B stocks upon the fourth anniversary of our IPO on May. As you will recall, following the conversion programs that we have run in the last three years, shares of Class B common stock now represents just over 15% or approximately $20 million of our outstanding shares. Once Class B ownership drops below 15%, as a result of holders' voluntary election to convert the Class M shares and associated voting rights will be automatically be redeemed. Earlier this week, our Board of Directors approved plans for further Class B conversion programs that will begin after May 31. We included summary of these programs in our Form 8-K file earlier this morning.Turning to 2010, we believe the world ahead is a positive one, though there will undoubtedly be some challenges as we navigate through the first half of the year. We're carefully balancing our risks and opportunities and looking at the realities of what's happening across the world. While most economic and consumer indicators are slowly improving, we expect challenges during the first half will be concentrated in the U.S. and in Europe.In the U.S., there is still uncertainty in our industry around the implication of the credit card act. How this plays out will of course determine our customers' actions with respect to their cards businesses. And in Europe, we are making nice progress across the SEPA and Eastern European region. Although as I mentioned earlier, this is being tempered by Maestro losses in the U.K. and the repeal of some 2008 pricing.We are seeing encouraging signs in other parts of the world. For instance in Asia-Pacific and some countries in Latin America continue to expect double-digit volume growth. Additionally, cross-border activity levels are picking up around the world, which as you know is an attractive revenue driver for us.As outlined on Slide 9, the following represents our current view of 2010 on a constant currency basis. We expect that net revenue growth will be better than the 3.9% growth we saw in 2009. Based on what we expect for the first few months of the year, it is unlikely that in 2010, we can get back to our old 12% to 15% average annual net revenue objective.We expect some contribution from pricing though at a lower level than what we saw last year. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of growth revenue will continue to grow in a trajectory a bit steeper than what we've experienced over the past two years, with some variation between the quarters depending on our deal activity. As Bob mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with the number of new and renewed deals that we have signed in 2009, and we look for this momentum to continue into 2010. As a result, the rebate and incentive line will include the impact of both the 2009 deals, as well as new agreements that we signed in 2010. Also included will be the impact of the new cross-border pricing that has a rebate component to it.So if you just think about it, rebates and incentives are just another form of reinvestment in our business, so it should not be surprising to see this line increase, as we work to drive volume and new business opportunities. Over the last year or so, we have made significant progress in realigning the expense base of our company in response to the realities of the market. We anticipate our total operating expenses will be flat to slightly down. At this point in time, we believe that our expense realignment efforts are essentially behind us. We will continue to invest for future growth. Therefore, you should be careful about factoring the entire benefit of the 2009 severance actions into your models.Turning to advertising and marketing. We currently expect to be up mid single-digits from our full year 2009 spend. If the market environment recovers faster than we currently expect, we will then need to reassess and potentially increase our marketing support.In terms of quarterly cadence, similar to past years, spending in the first quarter will be the lowest of the year. We are currently planning for the spend in the remaining three quarters to be relatively equal, although this is something we will be evaluating on a quarter-by-quarter basis as the year progresses.Finally, we remain committed to our longer term of objectives of annual margin expansion of 3 to 5 percentage points, and average net income growth of 20% to 30%. Remember, while all of our objectives are on a constant currency basis, our as reported numbers will include any impact of foreign exchange.We're also assuming an effective tax rate of 34.5% for 2010. Overall, as we look at our performance expectations for 2010, we believe that we will be able to steer through the challenges in order to deliver another solid year. Let me now turn the call back to Bob to cover some recent business highlights."

SunTrust will convert all of its debit card programs to MasterCard. After the conversion, which is expected to begin later this year, SunTrust will issue approximately 5 million MasterCard debit cards. This is a significant win for our U.S. Debit business, and we're very pleased to start off the year with this new partnership.Additionally, SunTrust will be expanding its current commercial offering in the future to include MasterCard commercial credit cards. We look forward to working with SunTrust to enhance the value of their payments business. In January, we renewed and extended our agreement with Woodforest Bank, one of our large debit issuers based in Texas. This includes both our consumer and small business debit portfolios. We also renewed and extended our agreement with Comerica Bank in December. Both our commercial card and public sector prepaid business with Comerica is included within the scope of this agreement.  We're pleased to continue to work with both Comerica and Woodforest to grow our mutual businesses, and to reinforce our already strong partnerships. In a deal that represents both our prepaid expertise and our best in class processing capabilities, ABN AMRO in the Netherlands has selected our IPS processing platform for their prepaid business. IPS was implemented in 2009 and has enabled ABN AMRO to achieve back-office efficiencies, which has led to increased productivity and competitiveness in winning new business.In Germany, WestLB started issuance of the first PAYBACK Maestro debit cards with the initial conversion of their private label portfolio. The new issuance has enabled cardholders to immediately benefit from value adding Maestro functions including worldwide acceptance, secure online shopping through secure code, and contact-less payments with PayPass.  PAYBACK is one of Europe's leading loyalty programs. We're happy to be working with WestLB and PAYBACK. Turning to some recent developments within our innovative platforms group, we're pleased with recent announcements about our MasterCard in Control offering. As many of you know, this is our innovative product that offers financial institutions an array of advanced authorization, routing and alert controls that they can use to create products for their cardholders.In the U.K., Barclaycard will now offer the option of MasterCard in Control functionality. This is the first consumer use of our service that enables cardholders to set spending controls and receive realtime information about their accounts. Features include automated SMS alerts to keep tabs on spending, alerts and blocks for online card spending or high-value transactions, and weekly or monthly budgets with alerts when that budget is reached. In Mobile, there are two developments I'd like to highlight. In Canada, we announced a mobile trial with Bank of Montréal and Research In Motion to bring mobile payments to Blackberry smartphones through our MasterCard PayPass Tap & Go contactless technology. In Brazil, Itau Unibanco and Redecard, along with the mobile operator Vivo, will be the first to use the MasterCard Mobile Payments Gateway to deliver mobile payment solutions to the bank's customers in Brazil. This will allow customers to use their phone as a mobile wallet and link existing credit, debit or prepaid MasterCard or Maestro accounts to their phone to fund mobile-initiated payments.In the transit space, when you couple our leading contactless PayPass technology with the unparalleled speed of our network, it results in great value and efficiencies for both transit systems and cardholders. And we've had several new developments, including in Turkey, where we expanded a number of cities that accept PayPass for transit payments. In the U.K., contactless payments went live in Liverpool with Stagecoach's 200 strong bus network and Transport for London is also planning to accept PayPass. In France, the second phase of the public transportation trial with PayPass went live with RATP and La Banque Postale. And in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro, we launched the first contactless payment application for public transportation in Latin America.Overall, we're very pleased with the business momentum we have as we head into the new year. We look forward to working with our customers and merchant partners on these and future opportunities that will make everyday commerce easier and more efficient for everyone involved.I'll now turn the call back over to Barbara so we can begin taking your questions."

So the numbers are not actually comparable in a very easy manner. The second thing that you'll have to factor in, which is a little different I have to say than what we had in the past is what we did on the cross-border pricing increase which we had in October of 2009, which really has two components to it. One component where it goes through the gross revenue line. The other component which goes now through the rebates and incentive line. And you typically don't have that, Bob, so that's a new factor. But we designed that price increase in a particular way in order to encourage our customers for a certain behavior. So and the financial percent [ph] (1:32:52) came out to be that way.

Fortunately, when we headed into the economic crisis at the end of 2008, we did so as a strong company. Our business model, good capital structure and sound management practices allowed us to remain flexible and adaptable as we weathered the storm.Now some 18 months later, I believe we've emerged even stronger. We've made investments that laid in groundwork for future growth. We've sharpened our focus on local market opportunities.

I'd like to start out by saying how pleased I am that we've been able to deliver another strong quarter of earnings results. This is indicative of both the underlying momentum of our business, as well as some encouraging signs of economic recovery in pockets around the world.
In the first quarter, we saw net revenue growth of 13.1% on an as-reported basis, and 10.2% on a constant-currency basis. Gross dollar volume, or GDV, grew 8.3% on a local-currency basis. We continue to see growth in processed transactions, and cross-border volumes have returned to double-digit growth. We maintained solid expense control, which allowed us to expand our operating margin nearly five percentage points from last year's first quarter. All of this helped fuel net income growth of almost 24% for the quarter, or approximately 19% on a constant-currency basis.
We believe that some of the improvements we saw in the quarter can be attributed to recent positive macroeconomic data points. For example, the stabilization of unemployment rates in United States as well as increased consumer confidence, although still at low levels, were likely contributors to increased spending in discretionary categories and to the improvement we saw in U.S. credit volume. While credit growth in the U.S. was still negative for the quarter, we've moved beyond the double-digit declines of 2009. During the month of March, we saw positive growth in processed U.S. credit volume for the first time in approximately 18 months. This trend continue through the first four weeks of April.
Given the challenges we've all faced over the last 18 months or so, it is encouraging to see signs that the global recovery is continuing across a number of countries, specifically in Russia, India, China and Brazil. As many of you are aware, many economists now observe that the global economy has reached a self-sustaining momentum. This is particularly evident across emerging market environments. I recently returned from a series of business meetings across Asia, and I was struck by the overwhelming sentiment of optimism that many of our customers have about their future business opportunities. 
This is in contrast to some of my recent interaction with bankers in the U.S. and Western Europe, who have been more cautious. Nonetheless, we continue to see improvements across a number of economic indicators, which bode well for our business. Excluding the U.S. region, we saw strong GDV growth of approximately 15% on a local-currency basis for the quarter.
I'd now like to introduce Ajay Banga, MasterCard's next Chief Executive Officer and the newest member of the company's Board of Directors. Over the course of the succession planning process, our Board focused on identifying someone who possesses both leadership skills and proven results. Ajay has a career that is rich and bold. His industry knowledge, his deep background in financial services, his experience working in numerous geographies have all prepared him well for this role and make him the perfect CEO to lead MasterCard into the future. As we work together over the past eight months, I have been very impressed by his thoughtful and energetic approach to business. 
For me, it has been challenging and exciting to have led the company for the past 13 years. I'm proud of how our company has demonstrated strong, consistent performance. Importantly, we built an incredible set of assets that offer a true competitive advantage, including: a world-renowned brand and our iconic Priceless advertising platform; a global technology network that is second to none, offering incredible flexibility and customization opportunities for customers; and employees who are deeply experienced, knowledgeable and passionate about the payments business.
I look forward to continuing my current role, and then transitioning to the Executive Vice Chairman role in July. And now, I'd like to turn it over to Ajay to provide some comments on our business."

Let me start off by saying that Bob has just done a tremendous job of positioning MasterCard for continued success. The strong first quarter results that we announced this morning is just one more indication of that positioning. Martina is going to get into the details of the results shortly, so I thought I'd spend a few minutes sharing some of our thoughts and business highlights with you.
The payments industry is still very much a growth industry, not just in the emerging markets where there is an obvious potential for growth all around. But also in the developed world, where there is continued opportunity for growth by market segment, and in new and alternative payment platforms like contactless, mobile, e-commerce and remittances. We're just very fortunate to be part of an industry where the secular shift from paper to electronic forms of payments will drive growth through different economic cycles. 
Our industry and our business have been built on the widespread adoption of credit and debit products globally, and we remain very optimistic about the growth potential of these businesses. We're going to invest our resources in initiatives designed to accelerate our business in key markets around the world and to drive growth beyond that secular momentum. 
To do this, you will find us sharpening our focus on supporting the needs of constituents across the payments industry and diversifying our revenue streams by geography, by customer and by product, including capturing the large opportunity we believe prepaid products represent. Innovation will be key to our future success, so you should expect to see us putting an even higher level of effort in these areas while we continue to innovate in more of the traditional spaces of debit, credit and prepaid. 
I'm sure you will hear a lot more from us about this when we host our annual investment community meeting in September. So let's do a quick review of some of our recent announcements in this area, and let me give you a sense of where we are focusing our efforts. 
Last month, we launched MasterCard Labs, our new global Research and Development organization, focused on payment innovation, aimed at differentiating MasterCard among customers and consumers. MasterCard has contributed significant innovations in the past as well, including PayPass, MoneySend and inControl. The creation of this organization, along with some other recent announcements, underscores our commitment to build solutions with our own, but also with partners to most efficiently and effectively meet the emerging needs of the payment space. Another example is our launched of MasterCard MarketPlace in the United States, powered by a new alliance with Next Jump 
[Next Jump Nation].
MasterCard MarketPlace allows cardholders access to merchant-funded offers from thousands of merchants. What's new and different about it is that shoppers can set what types of offers they want to see, and the MarketPlace then tailor the discounts to shoppers' stated preferences, as well as their interactions and the behavior of shoppers just like them. 
Importantly, merchants are then able to customize offers to groups of people and monitor the results realtime, which in the past have proven to produce industry-leading conversion rates. So it's not just an enhanced check out experience, but an enhanced shopping experience for consumers and a targeted promotions engine for merchants. Think of it more as a Match.com for shopping and with some of the largest online retailer among the over 28,000 participating merchants. They're very excited about what this platform can do for us and our customers. 
I hope you had the chance to sign up and check out the daily overwhelming offers and VIP invitations to exclusive shopping events. 
Our inControl solution continues to gain momentum with recent U.S. commercial wins including JPMorgan, Fifth Third and the First National Bank of Omaha. We're very optimistic we will be able to bring you further daily news in this in the near future.
We're also making progress in the U.S. debit front, but not as you've heard from some cynics, with deals at any price just to gain market share. In addition to the fund trust deal, which we announced back in January, we have signed debit deals with a number of other banks in this past quarter, including Ohio-based FirstMerit Bank, who will be converting their debit and credit portfolios to MasterCard. Additionally, Ally Bank, the online banking unit of GMAC Financial Services, will begin issuing Platinum debit MasterCard cards later this year through their U.S. online, checking and money market account holders.
On the credit front, HSBC renewed their global mass affluent Premier credit relationship with MasterCard. And as part of a long-term contract renewal, MasterCard is now the exclusive brand of choice for HSBC's Premier card program, which is aimed and targeted at affluent customers around the world. 
Prepaid continues to be a high-growth area as we further build our market leadership. On Earth Day recently, the U.S. Treasury announced a green initiative to reduce paper checks. Treasury will leverage the existing Direct Express program with  Comerica Bank that already has more than 1 million MasterCard-branded prepaid cards. Direct Express will be expanded beyond Social Security benefits to now include all Veterans Affairs, Railroad Retirement and Office of Personnel Management benefit recipients that currently receive paper checks.
This conversion process will begin this year with requirements that all new recipients receive payments electronically starting in March 2011, and all existing recipients receive payments electronically starting in March 2013. Being part of this tremendous growth opportunity just validate the efficiency that payment cards deliver over the traditional forms of payment. 
These are just some of our efforts that have made it to the point of public announcement. Stay tuned. We expect to have more to say on a number of fronts as we move through the year and continue to build and bring even more new products and services to the market. I'll now turn it over to Martina to discuss the first quarter financial results in detail. Martina?"

Let me begin on Page 2 of the deck, which shows our reported results. As Bob said, we are very pleased to start off 2010 with strong first quarter financial results.

As Bob said, we are very pleased to start off 2010 with strong first quarter financial results. Revenue grew 13.1% to $1.3 billion over the comparable period last year. On a constant-currency basis, net revenue grew 10.2%. This revenue increase was primarily driven by a 10.9% increase in cross-border volume, and 8.3% increase in gross dollar volume on a local currency basis and a 4.6% increase in a number of process transactions. Pricing contributed approximately five percentage points to net revenue growth.
This growth was somewhat tempered by an increase in rebates and incentives due to the impact of our cross-border pricing structure, customer agreement activity and volume increases. Operating expenses increased 2.2%, primarily due to foreign exchange fluctuations. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, operating expenses were up slightly as we continue to manage our expenses prudently. Our operating income was $700 million for the quarter and resulted in a quarterly operating margin of 53.5%, a 4.9 percentage point improvement over the year ago quarter. We delivered net income of $455 million, or $3.46 per diluted share, up roughly 24% over the first quarter of 2009. 
Turning to Page 3, we are seeing a stronger performance across a number of business drivers, including the strongest volume growth since the third quarter of 2008. And cross-border volumes were back to pretty healthy double-digit growth levels as well.
Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was up 8.3% on a local-currency basis in the first quarter, and grew 14.8% on a U.S. dollar-converted basis to $631 billion. We've continued to see stabilizing trends in U.S. GDV with good sequential improvement in the first quarter, which was down 1.1% as compared to a decline of 3.4% in the fourth quarter last year. Across the rest of the world, GDV continue to grow a healthy 14.7% on a local-currency basis. 
Worldwide credit GDV grew 3.5% on a local-currency basis versus the slight decline in the fourth quarter. This is the first quarter since the fourth quarter of 2008 were worldwide credit GDV was positive. U.S. credit GDV growth continues to improve on a sequential basis, but was still down in the high single-digit range. Credit GDV for the rest of the world grew 9.1% on a local-currency basis. Let's turn to debit.
Worldwide debit GDV grew 18.1% on a local-currency basis. This compares to about 12% growth in the first quarter of last year. In the U.S., debit GDV volume grew 7%. Debit growth for the rest of the world was approximately 33%, primarily driven once again by growth in our Asia Pacific, Middle East Africa region. On a local-currency basis, worldwide purchase volume grew 8.7%. U.S. purchase volume was also slightly positive for the quarter. 
Cross-border volume growth on a local-currency basis was up 10.9%. We saw a double-digit growth in our Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and European region, while our cross-border business in Latin America was good, largely due to the strength of our Brazilian cross-border volume. We continue to see good growth in our U.S. cross-border volumes with strong cross-border acquiring from travels into the United States.
When we look at processed transactions, they increased 4.6%, compared with the year-ago quarter to a $5.4 billion. In Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and the Latin American regions, processed transactions continue to grow at double-digit rates. With the exception of Europe, all other regions grew at mid to high single-digit rates.
The number of MasterCard branded cards worldwide was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis at 957 million cards for the quarter. Excluding the U.S., the rest of the world card issuance grew approximately 7%, demonstrating the continuing growth opportunities for MasterCard from the secular shift from cash to electronic payment forms. As of March 31, 2010, there were approximately 1.6 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued globally.
Now let's turn to Page 4 to discuss the components of revenue. Domestic assessment increased 6.1% from the first quarter of 2010 due to increased volumes and the impact of the April 2009 pricing change, partially offset by the repeal of some European pricing beginning in July 2009. Foreign exchange contributed roughly three percentage points of growth. 
Cross-border volume fees increased 39% versus Q1 '09. A little more than half of this $125 million increase was due to pricing actions during 2009. The remainder was primarily due to cross-border volume growth, which was up 10.9% on a local-currency basis. Foreign exchange contributed approximately three percentage points of growth.
Transaction processing fees increased 16.7% compared to the year-ago period. We continue to benefit from April 2009 U.S. pricing changes, which accounted for approximately 11 percentage points of the increase. The impact of foreign exchange contributed roughly three percentage points of growth. 
Processed transactions grew 4.6% in the quarter and continued to be affected by the loss of certain debit portfolios in the U.K. and the U.S. Excluding the loss of these portfolios, processed transactions grew approximately 10%. Other revenues increased 12.6% versus the first quarter of 2009, primarily driven by compliance and penalty fees.
All of these resulted in an increase of $255 million, or 17.1% in gross revenue. For the quarter, rebates and incentives grew $103 million. Approximately $55 million of this increase was due to rebates associated with our new cross-border pricing structure. The remainder was attributed to new and renewed agreement and volume growth. Overall, rebates and incentives represented 25.2% of gross revenue, versus the 22.6% in the first quarter a year ago.
Now let's turn to Page 5 for some detail on expenses. During the first quarter, total operating expenses increased 2.2% and were up only 0.5% excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. Within total operating expenses, general and administrative expenses increased 2.1%, with currency fluctuations accounting for 1.4 percentage points of the increase. The remaining change in G&A was primarily driven by a 2.9% increase in personnel cost, mainly due to increased payroll taxes related to divesting of equity compensation awards.
Travel and entertainment cost was also up somewhat versus extremely low levels in last year's first quarter. These increases were partially offset by lower severance cost and reduced payroll. Advertising and marketing spend was down 0.7% versus the year-ago period. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, A&M declined about 4% versus the first quarter of 2009 primarily due to lower spend in the U.S. Depreciation, amortization was up as a result of continued investment in data center equipment and capitalized software. 
Moving to the cash flow statement and balance sheet highlights on Page 6. We generated $95 million in cash from operations in the first quarter primarily driven by operating income, partially offset by payments of year end payable litigation settlement payments and the payroll tax liability associated with divesting of equity compensation awards. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of $3.3 billion.
Before getting into some thoughts for full year 2010, let me give you an update of what we've seen recently. While looking at our MasterCard processed volumes through April 28, we see the following. Our cross-border volumes continue to improve across all regions, with a rate of growth a bit higher than the first quarter. We see continued strong growth in our Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa region and Europe region, and some good increases in the U.S. and acquire cross-border volume as more consumers and business people travel to the U.S. 
As Bob said earlier, growth in U.S. credit processed volumes was more positive in April than it was in March. However, when we look at total U.S. processed volume growth in April, it is very similar to the first quarter growth rate due to the tempering effect of the two U.S. debit portfolio losses. Total processed volume growth for the rest of the world in April was also similar to what we saw in the first quarter.
Now let's turn to our thoughts for 2010, please look to Slide 7. In order for our full year 2010 net revenue growth to be as strong as the double-digit growth we saw in the first quarter, we would have to see further improvements in some of the macroeconomic indicators, stronger volume growth and cross-border activity beyond what we are currently forecasting. Remember, as the year progresses, we will see some tempering in top line growth due to the following factors. 
First, we begin to experience tougher comps, given that signs of economic recovery began to show in the second half of 2009. Second, the rollover of a few portfolios will continue to dampen our processed transaction growth. Right now, we expect this to bottom out in the fourth quarter of the year, but we expect processed transaction growth to remain in the single-digit range. We will continue to give you an indication of the adjusted transaction growth rate each quarter in order to demonstrate how the underlying business is performing.
And we continue to expect contra as a percentage of gross revenue to average 26% to 27% for the full year, given our current expectations of volume growth and cross-border volume growth in particular. Therefore, as a percentage of growth order revenue, contra will be a bit higher in the remaining quarters for the year than the 25% level we saw in Q1. Let me remind you, that we always look at rebates and incentives in the context of longer-term net revenue growth.
Overall, we continue to anticipate our total operating expenses to 2010 will be flat to slightly down over 2009 levels including severance charges. Some of the savings obtained from our 2009 severance actions will be reinvested back into the business areas, such as e-commerce and prepaid, as well as some additional marketing efforts. 
Turning to the components of operating expense. General and administrative expense is expected to be down from 2009 levels, including severance. We still expect advertising and marketing to be up, mid-single digits from our full year 2009 spend. While our current full year view for advertising and marketing expense has not changed, our expectations for the quarterly cadence of spend has changed from our initial thoughts. Rather than the absolute level of spend being relatively equal in the remaining three quarters, we now expect the quarterly spend to increase sequentially as we move through the year, and depreciation, amortization will trend upward over the balance of the year due to the impact of increased investments in our business. 
We continue to assume an effective tax rate of 34.5% for 2010. And finally, we remain focused on our objective for the 2009 to 2011 period of annual margin expansion of three to five percentage points and average annual net income growth of 20% to 30%.
Remember, while all of our objectives are on a constant-currency basis, our as-reported numbers will include any impact of foreign exchange. Assuming yesterday's exchange rates hold for the balance of the year, we would expect the current tailwind to revenue we saw in this quarter to be a roughly neutral in the second quarter turning into headwind for the back half of the year. 
As we look at underlying economic indicators, customer relationships and business momentum, we believe we will be able to deliver another solid year. Let me now turn the call to back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

So gateways as such are interesting, but I think all e-commerce strategy goes past the gateways to looking at how you offer cardholders a more rewarding and more finely tuned, unique and personalized offers of online shopping, which is what the MasterCard MarketPlace is about. It also is about giving merchants access to new customers and getting incremental sales from existing customers and reducing the amount of abandoned shopping carts, which is again what the better conversion ratio of things like the MarketPlace is about. And of course, it's about enabling issuers to have a much stronger link with their cardholders. So within MarketPlace, gateways, R&D and our E-commerce business, MasterCard Labs, the mobile strategy, you'll find us focusing on this space in many different ways over the next couple of years."

We have really, we have the cross-border pricing structure in there. For this particular quarter, rebates and incentives grew by $103 million, roughly half of that or $55 million was related to the cross-border pricing structure. In the other half, you can pretty much divvy up between new and renewed agreements, as well as volume growth. And we would expect that for the next few quarters, we are seeing something very similar. The one thing that I just want to highlight a little bit, we do expect SunTrust starting to convert in the fourth quarter.

I have said this publicly. I have said it in employee meetings. You're not first one to ask me this question, as you can imagine. I don't have any plans to dramatically change things than the company's working the right way. People change things when you feel that things are broken. This is not in that kind of form. It's a company with an outstanding track record of revenue growth and profit growth. There are things to do which we are working on, which we have been working on not just since I joined but from earlier. And one of those is to focus on innovation as a way of differentiating our company and our products, both for our clients but also for their customers, the ultimate cardholders and the ultimate payment originators and receivers. So that's kind of how you'll find us very focused. We've got a series of thoughts around innovation. You're going to hear more when we meet in September. But a little bit about can be talked about to date, be it the launch of MasterCard Labs, which is really an attempt to focus on innovation effort by bringing technology and business people together in one organization, with an effort to fast-track ideas and bring them out the door. The second part has to do with ideas in e-commerce and mobile banking and mobile e-commerce. I think it's not, as I said, not just gateways. Gateways are oriented more towards how a merchant experiences the event. There's wallets that are oriented more to our customer experience in the event. But then there's all these other things you can do with things like the MasterCard MarketPlace to make that customer have a more enriching experience and the merchant have a more successful outcome. So you'll see us focusing on e-commerce. You'll see us focusing on prepaid. You'll see us focusing on reward schemes. There's some articles that have come out recently about things they're trying to do with reward schemes. This is all WIP, work in our process. I think on the build versus buy, in all honesty, there's no straight answer to these things. It depends a little bit on what you see in the marketplace, when it fits to just strategic priority. First, it must bring something to you, you do not possess, either in the form of distribution or products or people. Secondly, it must fit with your hurdles in terms of what you expect to make back from the money we invest on behalf of our shareholders. And if it doesn't fit those two primary criteria, we'll build it. And I don't have a real answer. It depends on issue by issue, item by item, circumstance by circumstance. This company invested money a little a while ago in buying Orbiscom to get hold of inControl, which was IP-protected. And I would tell you that we are beginning to see a lot of interest in all my travels in the last -- just three months, I have been to different markets. I've been to Russia, Turkey, Poland, India, the U.K., Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Canada, in addition to the U.S. And I'm telling you that clients everywhere, senior managers and those clients, really understand what inControl is about. Bob has been all over Asia in the last month. He's been to Australia, to Hong Kong, to Singapore, to China and back. And he has the same experience that they've been having on this topic. So, yes -- would that have been a good buy? Yes, because we couldn't have built that ourselves compared to having an intellectually-property-protected item we could have picked up when we bought Orbiscom. So there's no real answer. It's an answer on what's right for that strategic priority. Resources between U.S. and international, I don't know that yet. I don't know the answer to that. I think you will find that the way I look at this business and the way Bob has been looking at it, is that while we believe that the international markets, not just the developing markets by the way, we believe even developed Europe has opportunities that is relatively well positioned in that marketplace. And with some more opportunities coming through it, I believe that the world outside of the United States is an attractive place for our growth. We already get 55% of our revenue from outside of the United States roughly, and that's already higher than a number of other companies in our space. That doesn't mean that we would believe we should invest less in the United States. I think the United States is still the bedrock of our business, and we need to grow there and demonstrate revenue growth in that marketplace. But I think you'll find us thoughtfully investing in both spaces as the opportunities come along."

We've also got the Wal-Mart payroll card recently, which allows us to issue payroll cards to Wal-Mart employees, who otherwise would have taken a check and have to go to a check-casher to get out their cash. So there's a series of these events, the U.S. government Visa -- Martina just talked, she mentioned Italy and the Italian post office. We've also had a deal with Univision for a prepaid card and that appeals directly, as you can imagine, to the kind of community that looks at Univision as a source of news and entertainment vault. And so we're trying to focus our prepaid efforts you will find in many different direction: one, being the government space; two, being the consumer general focus, reloadable space. Those two are very interesting because of the of the profitability and reuse dynamics of those. If you think about a gift card, a gift card is a onetime acquisition with an average of $70 or $80 loaded on it. Whereas a general focus, reloadable or a Social Security card tends to create $800 a month on the average, and people last there for a year or two years. You can imagine the profitability, dynamics of that are more interesting than that of a gift card. It doesn't mean gift cards are not interesting, just means the others are somewhat more attractive. The whole prepaid space, be it corporate payroll and benefits of the medical reimbursement cards, there's just a series of phases with Accor Services, our JV in Europe, that we are working on. So I don't know how to exactly tell you that there'll be something specific that will come  in next 18 months.

As you probably recall, it was over a year ago that we reached an agreement with the European Commission on both debit, as well as consumer credit cross-border interchange fees within Europe. The way that I think I've described this in the past is, is it gave some stability in terms of our issuers and acquirers understanding the nature of what was happening with regard to interchange fees. It's supported the principle of interchange fees that we thought was very important. But it was also done at levels that were lower than what we think is appropriate and necessary to support continued investment in the business by issuers in Europe. And that's why we also indicated that we're continuing our appeal to European Commission decision in the Court of First Instance.

In fact, twice a year is what we are doing right now. It's a structured process. Our issuers and acquirers are very much a part of this whole process, because they have to do work at their end depending on which elements of this upgrade they wish to take into their systems. It just so happens the ones we've done in the recent past had a couple of interesting features; and there one being the remote point redemption methodology, which is yet to be rolled out commercially, and so it's a little premature to talk about it.

And I have the opportunity to meet both Bradesco and Banco do Brasil; which by the way, are actually very more aligned with our competitors and with us. So this question's probably better answered by them in some way. My general sense of where they're trying to go on that, the government of Brazil is trying to go, is to help find a way to increase the level of bankerization. It a bad word, but it's what it means. It's the bankerization, the extent of banking that is provided to individuals in their country. They have made a series of attempts over the last the last seven, eight years, including the expansion of the ability of merchants, drug stores and convenience stores, to even do basic cash availability and transactions of that size on behalf of banks. It's trying to provide access to people to come into the banking system. And I think what they are trying to do with Banco do Brasil and Bradesco, which are very large banks, in addition to Banco Itaú, which is also a very bank -- but these two have attempted to go out and create this new bank in which they are looking for a local debit scheme but also for local use, that's also attached some processing assets into it. In all honestly, I don't expect major changes over the short and medium term. As both these clients -- they were very clear that they intend to the keep issuing other brands. In fact, I specifically understood from them that their commitment and intentions with MasterCard remain exactly the same. So having said that, when somebody launches a local debit scheme in a marketplace, it doesn't back the market. It'll take some business, their percentage away from the global payment schemes. But the global payment schemes bring different things to the table, and the total market should grow as a result of this effort. So I think the opportunity in Brazil is much bigger than this issue share, would either pull down or up. So I think there's so many other opportunities in Brazil to grow the business for us and our competitors. And I think there's a much better position there that we all need to occupy and invest in."

I'm pleased that we've got yet another good quarter to report this morning that highlights the solid fundamentals of our business. Before Martina gets into the details of the results, I'll try to comment on some of the contributing drivers of the quarter, as well as some recent business highlights. 
So the second quarter, we saw net revenue growth of 6.7% as reported and 7.9% on a constant-currency basis. Gross dollar volume grew 8.5% on a local-currency basis and cross-border volume grew 15.2%, both actually continuing their momentum from the first quarter. Process transaction growth was basically, essentially flat for the quarter, due to the continued roll-off of several U.S. and U.K. debit portfolios that we have spoken of on past earnings calls with you. But if you exclude reconversions, underlying transaction growth was around 10%.
Our expense control efforts over the past year have allowed us to deliver an operating margin of 52.6% this quarter, a nine-percentage point expansion over last year's second quarter. We've put all this together, and it helps fuel our net income growth of roughly 31% or 34% on a constant-currency basis.
Some of the progress we saw in the quarter can obviously be attributed to global macroeconomic improvements. And as a global company, we continue to see the non-U.S. markets becoming a bigger contributor to our businesses. 
Today, in fact, the international markets, the markets outside of the United States, account for 55% of our total revenue, up from about 50% just two or three years ago. As in the recent quarters, our volume growth outside the United States outpaced growth in the United States. The Asia/Pacific and Latin America regions delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth, spurred on by, I think, the continued buoyancy in most economies in those regions. And of course, despite challenges in the European macroeconomic scenario, our volume growth in Europe continues to remain healthy. Both domestic and cross-border volumes are driving the growth in these regions.
In the U.S., however, conflicting signals make it difficult to determine if we have moved into a period of real economic recovery. You've all seen the recent economic data around unemployment, retail sales, consumer confidence, and the consensus seems to be that perhaps there will be some ups and downs with respect to economic recovery. This is reflected in our own consumer research and our spending pulse data as well. 
On the one hand, fine dining, luxury retail, furniture spend has been down in recent months. On the other hand, hotel and airline spend is up. So there are mixed signals here, and consumers are likely to remain cautious until employment and housing in the U.S. show signs of sustainable improvement. And I guess they will just continue to look for ways to spend and budget smarter. 
You can see evidence of this in our own U.S. data. MasterCard's process credit volume growth was up slightly in the second quarter, an improvement over the first quarter. But the pace of growth declined as we moved from April to June, driven by consumer credit. However, process debit volume growth remained constant at about 20% for the first two quarters of the year, excluding those portfolio de-conversions we have talked about.
While we're subject to the U.S. market, let me just briefly touch on a piece of the recently signed financial reform act, specifically, the Durbin amendment. I know that everybody is eager to fully understand the impact on our business. But the truth is, we just have to wait for the Fed to develop the regulations and for our customers to react before we will know the full implications, both for the industry and for our company, MasterCard. 
We have spoken to the Fed. We will be working constructively with them as they move into the implementation phase to ensure that they have the necessary inputs to make an informed decision. Regardless of the outcome, we still believe the secular shift to electronic forms of payments will continue; and that fundamentally, U.S. consumers are not going to go back to cash and check as a result of the Durbin amendment. 
Going forward, issuers will need to decide how to meet their customers, their consumers needs for payment products. And we will be there to support their effort, whether it be with credit, charge or prepaid products in addition, of course, to debit. This new situation will present challenges, but I also believe it will present opportunities. And in the past, we as a company has certainly proven our ability to work for them with flexibility and with innovation. And as such, even now, we are exploring various strategies to address the different scenarios that could come about as the Fed goes through its decision making.
In the meanwhile, we are focused on executing our strategies around the globe. As I said earlier, the markets outside of the U.S., the global markets outside of the U.S., account for more than half of our net revenue, and that percentage is growing. We are continuing to pursue many opportunities to grow electronic payments, pushing hard to deliver more convenience, more security for our customers and value for all the other stakeholders. That's why I'll take a few moments to highlight a few recent news items.
Just yesterday, we announced an expansion of our existing relationship with Telefónica, a leading telecom company in Latin America to include a co-brand deal of Mobistar, their leading mobile brand. MasterCard will be the exclusive brand of on Mobistar's co-branded credit cards issued in 11 countries, adding to the two in place in Chile and Brazil already. In addition, we will also process the transactions in the majority of these issuing markets.
We've also recently announced a joint venture with Smart Communications to build a mobile payment infrastructure, kind of like a mobile gateway, starting in Brazil for our customers that'd give consumers access to mobile payments. In China, we launched MoneySend with the Bank of China. So now consumers in China can receive money transfers from friends and family outside of the country. China, by the way, marks the 19th market where MasterCard MoneySend is now enabled.
Sberbank, the largest retail bank in Russia, is actually upgrading its passbook savings accounts to include a Maestro debit card, which will act as the primary tool for consumers to access online and mobile banking. Since this program was started in mid-2009, it's yielded 1.3 million upgrades last year and continues to generate similar results this year. They've also just launched a MasterCard-branded credit card, co-branded with MTS [Mobile TeleSystems], a leading Russian telco, on the MasterCard platform and, of course, carrying on the rollout of the Maestro Momentum cards.
Here in the U.S., I'm pleased that Citi will be leveraging our inControl platform to bring Citi's consumer cardholders, increase controlled security and budgeting capabilities. And in fact, this is the first consumer application of inControl in the U.S. market. 
We also expanded our PayPass transit pilot in New York City beyond the original Lexington Avenue subway line, in collaboration with the MTA [Metropolitan Transportation Authority], the Port Authority and with New Jersey transit (sic) [NJ TRANSIT] to basically make commuting faster and easier. This expanded six-month pilot now includes fast trains, as well as some New York City and NJ TRANSIT bus routes. It's the first payment system to link all three transit agencies, replacing the need for riders to carry specific fare cards for each transit system and, of course, also enables the rider to transfer between systems. Our development of a differentiated solution that allows authorization of the turnstile to take this faster was a critical factor in winning this trial. 
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"

Let me begin on Page 3 of the deck, which shows our reported results. As Ajay said, we are very pleased to deliver another good quarter of solid financials. Net revenue grew 6.7% over last year's second quarter to",1972,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Page 3 of the deck, which shows our reported results. As Ajay said, we are very pleased to deliver another good quarter of solid financials. Net revenue grew 6.7% over last year's second quarter to $1.4 billion. On a constant-currency basis, net revenue grew 7.9%. This revenue growth was primarily driven by a 15.2% increase in cross-border volume and an 8.5% increase in gross dollar volume on a local-currency basis. Additionally, pricing contributed approximately four percentage points to net revenue growth, including the effect of cross-border rebates. All of these positive factors on net revenue was somewhat offset by additional rebates and incentives, primarily due to new and renewed customer agreements as well as rebates related to higher volumes.
Operating expenses declined 10.4% versus last year's second quarter, primarily as a result of lower severance as well as savings due to reduced headcount. Our operating income was $717 million for the quarter and resulted in an operating margin of 52.6%, a 9.1 percentage point improvement over the year-ago quarter. 
We delivered net income of $458 million or $3.49 per diluted share, up roughly 31% over the second quarter of 2009 and 34% on an FX-adjusted basis.
Turning to Page 4. We are seeing stronger performance across a number of business drivers, including continued strong volume growth similar to what we saw in the first quarter. Cross-border volume growth year-over-year was the strongest it had been since the third quarter of 2008. 
Worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was up 8.5% on a local-currency basis in the second quarter and grew 9.8% on a U.S. dollar-converted basis to $656 billion. U.S. GDV was down 0.5%. While not yet a return to positive growth, this is another quarter of sequential improvement compared to a decline of 1.1% in the first quarter of this year. Across the rest of the world, GDV continued to grow, a healthy 14.5% on a local-currency basis.
Worldwide credit GDV grew 6.1% on a local-currency basis. This was also the strongest growth rate we've seen since mid-2008. It was helped by U.S. credit GDV growth which was down only low-single digits, it's best performance in two years. Credit GDV for the rest of the world grew 9.8% on a local-currency basis. 
Worldwide debit GDV grew 13.2% on a local-currency basis. This was against the strong comparison of 13.1% growth in the second quarter of last year. In the U.S., debit GDV volume grew 0.8% and debit growth for the rest of the world was 29%, primarily driven once again by growth in our Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region.
On a local-currency basis, worldwide purchase volume grew 7.9%. Cross-border volume growth on a local-currency basis was up 15.2%. We saw a double-digit growth in Asia/Pacific, Middle East, Africa, primarily driven by activity in Australia, China and Korea. As a matter of interest to some of you, we saw a noticeable increase in travel into South Africa for the World Cup, and volumes were up 79% in June year-over-year on a local-currency basis. We also saw double-digit cross-border volume growth in Europe and in Latin America.    
Looking at process transactions, they were roughly flat, about 0.1% compared to the year-ago quarter to $5.6 billion. In Asia/Pacific, Middle East, Africa and Latin America, process transactions continued to grow at double-digit rates, offset by de-conversions of portfolios in the U.S. and U.K. 
The number of MasterCard-branded cards worldwide was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis at 944 million cards at the end of the quarter. Excluding the U.S., card issuance grew 7% versus the second quarter of 2009, demonstrating the continued growth opportunities for MasterCard from the secular shift from cash to electronic payment form. As of June 30, 2010, there were approximately 1.6 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued globally.
Now let's turn to Page 5 to discuss the components of revenue and their performance relative to last year's second quarter. Domestic assessments increased 11% due to increased volumes and the impact of 2009 and 2010 price increases, partially offset by the repeal of some European pricing beginning in July 2009. 
Cross-border volume fees increased by 34.5%. More than half of the $120 million increase was due to our October 2009 pricing adjustment. The remainder was primarily due to cross-border volume growth, which was up 15.2% on a local-currency basis. 
Transaction processing fees increased 6%. Pricing contributed approximately two percentage points of growth, primarily due to U.S. pricing changes which were implemented in mid-April 2009. Additionally, we had a onetime benefit from the implementation of new authorization parameters. 
As I've said before, process transactions were essentially flat in the quarter and continue to be affected by the loss of certain debit portfolios. Excluding the loss of these portfolios, process transactions grew approximately 10%. However, revenue growth for these line items was impacted less due to the pricing of the portfolios that are rolling off. 
Other revenues decreased 5.2%, primarily driven by lower compliance and research fees. All of this resulted in an increase of $204 million or 12.6% in growth revenue. 
For the quarter, rebates and incentives grew $119 million. Approximately $55 million of this increase was due to rebates associated with last October's revised cross-border pricing structure. The remainder was attributed to new and renewed customer agreements, as well as rebates related to higher volumes. Overall, rebates and incentives represent 25.3% of gross revenue versus 21.2% in last year's second quarter.
Now let's turn to Page 6 for some detail on expenses. During the second quarter, total operating expenses decreased 10.4%. And within total operating expenses, general and administrative expenses decreased 14.5%. The decrease was primarily due to lower personnel expense which was down $83 million, and lower severance drove roughly half of this decrease. The remainder was primarily due to reduced headcount following personnel actions taken 2009, although we are adding talent in growth areas, such as e-commerce, mobile and prepaid. Both advertising and marketing spend and depreciation and amortization were roughly flat for the quarter.
Moving to the cash flow statement and balance sheet highlights on Page 7. We generated $343 million in cash from operations in the second quarter, primarily driven by operating income, partially offset by litigation settlement payments. And we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of $3.5 billion.
Now let's turn to our thoughts for 2010. But before I get into that, let me just give you an update of what we have seen for Maestro card process volumes for the third quarter through July 28. Our cross-border volumes grew approximately 15% globally, which is pretty much the same as the growth rate in the second quarter. The Asia/Pacific region continues to demonstrate the strongest growth while the U.S. saw a little bit of softening, although it still remains positive.
Although not a perfect proxy for GDV, total U.S. processed volumes growth, which was about 1% positive in the second quarter, was down about 2% in July, slightly lower than the month of June due to the continued roll-off of the two debit portfolios. If you were to exclude the impact of those debit portfolios, total U.S. processed volume growth was almost 7% in both June and July.
U.S. credit processed volume is trending flat in July versus the growth of about 1% in the second quarter. And U.S. debit processed volume growth, which was about flat for the second quarter, is now trending down 5% in July, but was up 21% when you exclude the tempering effect of the debit roll-off. 
And in July, total processed volume growth for the rest of the world continued at a similar pace to what we saw in the first and second quarters, or about 13%. Globally, processed transaction growth was just slightly negative, including the impact of the four debit portfolio roll-off, and almost 12% growth, excluding that impact.
Now let's get into the thoughts of 2010, and the following represents our current view, obviously, on a constant-currency basis. We continue to believe that we could see some tempering in top line growth in the second half of 2010 relative to the 9.7% growth we've seen in the first half due to the following factors. 
The first, we begin to experience tougher comps. Given that signs of the economic recovery began to show in the second half of 2009, in particular, in the fourth quarter. Also, the pace of recovery, at least in the U.S., remains uncertain. 
Second, the roll-off of a few debit portfolios will continue to dampen our processed transaction growth. It now appears that the WaMu deconversion would be more concentrated in the second and third quarters than initially thought. As a result, we now expect that this revenue will roll off faster than originally anticipated and our as-reported processed transaction growth will bottom out in the third quarter, not in the fourth quarter.
And we continue to expect contra as a percentage of growth revenue to average 26% to 27% for the full year, likely at the high end of the range given the deal volume we have seen and our current expectation for cross-border volume growth. Additionally, we now expect to see some impact of our new SunTrust deal in the contra line in Q3. However, contra as a percentage of growth revenue will still be highest in Q4 due to the normal seasonality of rebates and incentives.
Overall, we continue to anticipate our total operating expenses for 2010 will be flat to slightly down from 2009 levels, including severance charges. As I had said before, some of the savings obtained from our 2009 severance actions are being reinvested back into the business areas, such as e-commerce, mobile and prepaid, as well as some additional marketing efforts in the second half.
Turning to the components of operating expenses. We continue to expect G&A to be down from 2009 levels, including severance. And while we are currently forecasting advertising and marketing to be up, at most, by mid-single digits from our full year 2009 spend, we will continue to re-evaluate our plan depending on how we see the economic recovery taking hold. We also expect the quarterly spend to increase sequentially over the third and fourth quarters.  And as we said before, we continue to assume an effective tax rate of 34.5% for 2010. 
Now finally, we remain committed to our objective for the 2009 to 2011 period of annual margin expansion of three to five percentage points and average annual net income growth of 20% to 30%. Remember, while all of our objectives are in a constant-currency basis, our as-reported numbers include the impact of foreign exchange. This represented about a 1% headwind to net revenue in the second quarter as we expect that headwind to increase to three to four percentage points if current exchange rates, particularly euro, hold for the balance of the year. We call that the euro averaged about $1.45 for the second half of 2009 versus its current level of about $1.30.
Despite some mixed signals around the U.S. economic recovery, economic growth for the rest of the world is improving. Additionally, the underlying fundamentals of our business remains strong. This enabled us to deliver a good quarter. And as we worked through the challenges of some debit roll-off, we also have new business wins, such as SunTrust and others that we have yet to announce that will begin to contribute later this year. Remember that some contract incentives for new business are recognized early on and only over time you will see the full contribution to net revenue. In total, we believe we can deliver a solid year for 2010 in line with our overall longer-term objectives. 
Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session."

I'm not going to comment on whether that pilot is actually happening or not because none of the actual players in the pilot are confirming what they're doing, so that's what I'm going to go down the path of. But I would tell you this, MasterCard has been partnering with mobile carriers, with handset manufacturers and with banks for many years now, globally, to launch a bunch of NFC. These contactless came on trials, with PayPass, mobile payment tags, person-to-person money transfer services, high phone-smartphone apps, that kind of all helping to get this mobile promise opportunity to come true. In fact, I kind of counted off and brought close to 20 pilot and commercial rollouts around the globe as we speak, and I'll give you a few examples so you would understand where I'm coming from. In the U.K., Barclay's and Orange and MasterCard are the ones working on a similar contactless mobile payments NFC-based technology to pay for goods and services at retailers. There is the PayPass terminal that's been used. In Tokyo, on the other hand, we partnered with Guarantee Bank and with Aviya [ph], which is a leading local mobile operator, to pioneer this mobile NFC payments, and there -- in that case it was using an antenna attached to the sim card. In June, in the U.S., Citi has announced the launch of MasterCard PayPass tags, available for the majority of their credit cards. You can stick that sticker at the back of your mobile device and use it at any of the PayPass-enabled merchants that exist. They've also announced a partnership with Bank of Montréal and Rim, Research In Motion, to bring mobile payments to Blackberry smartphones through a similar MasterCard PayPass technology. We've got programs in Brazil, we've got programs in India, we got programs in Korea, we got programs in Singapore. We've got mobile MasterCard MoneySend service, which is an easy way to transfer money from person to person using the mobile phone or an Internet browser. We can also use this to pay for purchases. It also allows small non-traditional merchants to accept electronic payments. We've got MoneySend app for the iPhone and the Blackberry. We've even got a app for the iPhone App Store where we offer mobile commerce app, including the new MasterCard MarketPlace Overwhelming Offers app. So I have a degree of confidence that these companies are playing, we and others are playing actively in the mobile payment space. I have no doubt that while the business model for the mobile payments is yet to be proven in a tangible way across the world, I have no doubt that it will get proven in some form through these various experiments and trials. That, I have no doubt on. You will find us putting a lot of energy and effort, including these ones I just gave you an example of, including what we just did as simply as a co-brand card with Telefonica, which could open up all kinds of opportunity for prepaid cards, and other things we could do with similar phone companies around the world. I just think that one announcement of an unconfirmed pilot in the United States makes me somewhat cautious about jumping to conclusions about the role that different companies will play in this space. I also believe that finally, the phone partners, the mobile carriers the handset manufacturers, banks, people like us, what we need is an open-payment system. What you do not need is a payment system that is built off one brand. Even our MTA trial that I spoke about in New York, well, right now it's a trial using us. Eventually, we actually expect in a short period of time for that, if it works out, to become a brand-agnostic trial where we may have the advantage of processing more of the transactions because our technology approves those transactions at the turnstile faster, but it'll be brand agnostic. And so to me, I think the real development of growth in mobile commerce requires that kind of way of approaching the opportunity, and I have full confidence and say that we will be very much a part at the center of that developing those new generation of mobile plan payments. So that's how I am with it."

Albeit, what I just would like to make sure that you understand, in 2011 and going forward, it really depends on how cross-border volume growth is going to behave. So you might, depending on how much it will grow, you might see some impact still year-over-year on the growth line as well as on the contra's line. And net-net, as we said before, we expect that there will be only a slight contribution to overall net revenue, positive contribution to overall net revenue."

We've got -- in France, we've begun processing domestic MasterCard transactions for the first time with the launch of, what I talked about in the last call, the Carrefour retailer card, as well as Allcon [ph]. So there's a bunch of these happening. We've got debit MasterCard is now in all four Nordic countries. They're launching the product in Ireland, Turkey, Greece, U.K., Poland. And in April, we actually have mandated e-commerce support for all 300-plus million Maestro cards in Europe. So I think the enormously help would be utilization of these cards for e-commerce. And on the competitive acquiring front, domestic transactions on these cards issued with the Maestro logo are actually starting to be routed through our network, if an acquirer or merchant chooses to do. So we're seeing an incremental volume from that. It's still small numbers, but it's early days in the game. But all in all, I don't think the so-called macroeconomic scenario in Europe has changed any of the on-the-ground desire and reality to go forward with the thinking behind SEPA."

Again, it depends on which quarter you're going to be. But for the second half in total, it's about three to four percentage points. I just also would like to reiterate the rule of thumb that we really give to everybody in terms of looking at our euro exposure. We really think for every $0.01 cent move that the euro moves versus the dollar, that net revenues is impacted by $9 million to $11 million. And then on the operating expense line, the move impacts about $4 million to $5 million. So you're on the operating income line, you have about a move of $5 million to $6 million. And that should allow you to extrapolate depending on what kind of exchange rate you assume for the rest of the year where our results could be coming in from an as-reported basis."

First of all, given all the change that will happen, one of things that could well happen is that the pattern of spend changes from one kind of card used to another kind depending on what kind of consumer incentives get developed over time by issuers or by merchants as they respond to where the Fed comes out on its thinking around these rules. So I'm not sure I could conclude that credit card spend will necessarily decline over time. I'm not even sure that I could conclude that debit cards spend will decline because it will depend on where the interchange number settles down, how the debit card plays a critical or non-critical role in the strategy of retail banks to get DDA through the door with the need for relatively low-cost funding. So this is -- you're asking me to conjecture on 100 permutations and combinations and we're working our way through those. I'm not going to do that conjecturing. But I would tell you this, if you go about what happened in Australia, then you know that what will happen here is that banks will really look at their economic model, they will look at pricing. We are already seeing motion on the so-called, let's say, the soon to happen demise of free checking that people are speculating. I don't if that's true, but I can see some movement on that. You're going to see efforts by the issuers to drop off costs billable for electronic servicing, they'll probably look at their loss programs. You're going to see efforts to cross sell through the DDA even stronger, more enhanced because that the only way you can for that DDA account. You're going to find every bank and us and Visa and everybody else working with regulators to make sure that the pricing costing of a transaction includes the fair compensation for technology, for fraud, for security, for privacy, plus a margin for the capital investor. And those are the kinds of conversations you're going to see, beyond that, conjecturing how the market will shake out and how we'll respond. We just have to be sensible over the next few months. I firmly believe what I said earlier, there will be challenges, but there will be opportunities. And I said this in a somewhat more joking way, this is one time when I'm probably grateful for not having had the highest market share in debit in the United States."

And the market size is the largest to date in the United States; largest by far, not just by a small amount. The factors -- it has many things built into it; everything from Social Security Administration is planning to do. I think we talked about in the last earnings call, but what they're planning to do is that by 2013, every single payment from the Social Security Administration will either go by direct deposit to a bank account that that the receiver has or by a direct load on to a prepaid card that the receiver must then have. It so happens that you've got a great program in place to be the supplier of those prepaid cards through Direct Express and Comerica. And so that kind of driving -- one of the things that's driving prepaid as a space. You know the prepaid cards space has got a large component of consumer reloadable, general-purpose cards. A large component of what the government will provide, which is kind of the example I just gave you, a fairly large component dedicated to payroll and corporate payroll and the like. And then a much smaller component dedicated to gift cards. And in fact, gift cards are what everybody talks about. But in fact, the economics of a gift card are very different from the other three because a gift card is a one-time load of an average of $70 to $80 each time in the U.S. whereas a Social Security card, 1 million of which are already in circulation by the way, have a load of somewhere between $700 to $800 a month. And if a person stays on that payment for a year, you're talking about $9,600 of load compared to $70 to $80 of load on a gift card. So the economics are very different and we are very focused on the government, payroll and consumer general-purpose reloadable. There's obviously a lot of growth to happen outside of the U.S. I think the Telefonica deal is an example, is a great way to think about consumers who may possess phones, but may not possess formalized bank accounts and formalized credit cards as a way of entering into a whole new space. There are similar opportunities would be Accor JV that we signed in Europe, where we look at meal vouchers and company benefit payments that come on to prepaid cards. There's opportunities of mobile payments in Latin America that they're exploring and doing a lot of work with. There's similar things in Asia from India to other locations. So I'm very interested and intrigued by what prepaid could do and how it could be a way of getting so many underbanked, not just unbanked, people to participate in the payment systems. And that's kind of where our effort and energy is going, Jason."

There's actually a series of multiple options that could settle down depending on how the Fed, which has been tasked with starting this actually comes to conclusion over the next nine months in the case of the interchange numbers and 12 months in the case of the other provisions around exclusivity. So there's no way for me to give you one versus the other. And I doubt that even on investor day in September, you're going to know much more by the end about which way the Fed is leaning or thinking. But I would say this to you, does it open up opportunities? I think it opens up both opportunities and challenges depending on which side of the table the Fed comes out on. And my perspective is that when you've got a lower market share, us as well as other players, whatever changes in the game will give us an opportunity to be nimble and respond to it. Having said that, the larger market share players will fight as hard as they can to hold on to their market share. So this is going to be one of those market changing movements that I don't yet know how to predict. But I'm very confident that I will find the opportunities through this for us to keep doing well."

Over the shorter term, both the economy, as we discussed in the U.S. in particular and the regulatory front, represents some challenges. However, MasterCard, I think, has demonstrated over the years that it can find its way through these challenges. On the business front, Martina and I both talked about the fact that we've lost a few debit contracts over the last couple of years that are only now beginning to work their way through our financials. We've also won a few great deals in debit and the emerging payment space, but I think will begin to contribute later this year, but will contribute much more in the next couple of years. We also work very hard to control expenses to manage through the impact of the recent global economic slowdown and I'm still trying to put money into investing in future growth. Again, as Martina mentioned, we're putting some of the savings into e-commerce, mobile, prepaid, that kind of space.
I'm kind of still very optimistic about our future growth prospects. We do business in 210 countries today. And the majority of our revenues come from outside of the United States, which, as of now, showing faster growth. At any given time, I'm going to have challenges in some markets and opportunities in many more. Our global structure, our global construct, I think, contributes to our resilience through cycles and, frankly, to my expectation for long-term growth of our business. As I firmly believe that payment is and will remain a growth industry due to the continued secular trend through electronic payments, the underlying fundamentals of our business remain intact and we are also innovating in order to be best positioned to take advantage of these growth opportunities. That's why I'm very excited to be here. I'm very excited to be leading this company and this team. And once again, thank you for your time today. I'll look forward to seeing many of you at our Investor Day on September 15, and we'll continue the discussion about our business and the strategy for our future. Thanks again."

So in this third quarter, we saw ne",1772,"Thanks, Barbara, and good morning, everyone. Before Martina gets into the details of the results, I thought I would comment on some of the operational drivers in the quarter as well as some recent business highlights. 
So in this third quarter, we saw net revenue growth of 4.7% on an as-reported basis or 7.3% on a constant currency basis. GDV, gross dollar volume, grew 8.45% on a local currency basis, and cross-border volume grew 15.4%, continuing the momentum from the first half of the year. Processed transaction growth was slightly positive for the quarter. And there, we are tempered by the continued roll-off of several U.S. and U.K. debit portfolios. But excluding those deconversions, underlying transaction growth was about 13%. These factors and cost savings are kind of put together would allow us to deliver an operating margin of 53.6% this quarter, a four percentage point expansion over last year's third quarter. And all of this have fueled net income growth of 14.6% or about 19% on a constant currency basis. 
Reflecting relative economic growth trends, our volume growth outside the U.S. outpaced growth in the U.S. The Asia/Pacific and Latin America regions just continue to deliver strong double-digit growth, driven by both domestic and cross-border volumes as the economic expansion is persisting in these markets. And while it's true that a number of the Asian and Latin American economies are showing good growth in domestic demand, the fact is that consumption in the U.S. and Europe still accounts for more than half of global PCE [personal consumption expenditure]. And so for Asia and Latin America to keep growing at these rates for an extended period, we really need to see consumption pick up again in the U.S. and in Europe.
Now aside from that, purchase volumes in Europe remain relatively healthy despite what we all read about the continued macroeconomic situation in the continent. In general, European did not accelerate their spending to the same extent as the other markets did a few years ago, and their response over the last couple of years is also, therefore, more muted. And during the summer holiday season, we continue to see them traveling. And as many of these countries continue to move away from a relatively high percentage of cash transactions, the shift to electronic forms of payment just continues to generate new volume for us.
In the U.S., while the market is looking healthier than it did this time last year, the economy continues to show conflicting signals with the Fed [Federal Reserve System] predicting modest improvements until the second half of next year of 2011. U.S. consumer spending appears to be following those very mixed signals even when looking at our own data. And while our U.S. credit volume growth trend continued to improve, it is being driven by commercial credit. Consumer credit growth remained about flat with the second quarter. This is also consistent with our U.S. SpendingPulse data, where September retail sales showed discretionary spend remained largely in check. And that's in contrast to U.S. debit volumes, which, excluding the debit portfolio roll-off, continued to see growth in the mid-teens.
So now let me touch a little briefly on two regulatory developments here in the U.S. First, we're pleased to have reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice late in the third quarter. After two years of investigation, the DOJ required us to simply clarify the rules that we already had in practice everyday, which allow merchants to discount. 
Second, turning to the financial reform bill, we have little more to report beyond what we communicated at our investor community meeting day on September 15. We're awaiting the Fed's ruling. And until we see it, it's impossible to predict the outcome to either MasterCard or the entire payments industry. At our recent meetings with the Fed, we have continued to have a constructive dialogue as we work to gather a complete picture of the U.S. payments industry. Consistent with what we believe you are hearing, we expect the first drop of the Fed's position sometime in December, and we are planning for the range of outcomes that we talked about earlier. Given our U.S. debit share and as some level of exclusivity will go away, we see upside potential for MasterCard. However, we will have to wait for the Fed's decision to determine the true nature of the impact on our business.
Meanwhile, we remain focused on executing our growth strategy around the globe. And that is to grow our core Debit Prepaid and Processing businesses, Credit, Debit, Prepaid and Processing, both consumer and commercial, to diversify our geographies by investing in high-growth markets, to diversify our customer set by building relationships with merchants, telcos, governments, transit operators and to bring new businesses in emerging areas, such as e-Commerce and mobile payments. So that's the grow, diversify, build strategy we talked about on the 15th of September. We will continue to drive growth on a local level with a focus on an enhanced consumer experience. 
So let me take a moment to highlight a few recent news items. You probably heard about some of these at Investor Day, but I wanted to make sure that we fully reflected the news of the quarter as we speak today. So the affluent segment, you heard us say in September that we were going to focus on wealth managers and airlines to reach this important segment, and I'm pleased to say that we have signed a credit agreement with UBS Switzerland Wealth Management to launch World MasterCard. We also signed a debit agreement with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney here in the U.S. 
We've also recently signed a number of airline co-brands, such as Royal Jordanian Airline and Kingfisher Airlines in India. This is after the momentum in this sector, including some of the previously announced deals with Turkish Airlines and Aeroflot in Russia, and there are others in the pipeline. And building on the success of the Ferrari credit card launched in Spain a few months ago, Santander is now launching a similar co-branded MasterCard in Mexico. And all of these are examples of exciting portfolios given their potential to capture affluent cross-border spend.
Moving to debit. In the U.S., I am delighted to announce that Sovereign Bank will upgrade its nearly 2 million card consumer and commercial debit programs to MasterCard next year in 2011, as they would implement the debit processing capabilities of our IPS [Integrated Processing Solutions] platform. This Sovereign win, combined with our SunTrust and Chevy Chase, now part of Capital One wins, continues to reinforce our debit position in the Eastern part of the United States. These are in addition to the Delta Air Lines and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney deals that we also recently announced.
Overseas, we have signed an exclusive premium debit agreement with Qatar Islamic Bank to convert their portfolio to MasterCard. Qatar Islamic Bank is one of the top five Islamic banks in the world and has a long history with one of our largest competitors. And in Germany, Barclaycard will be converting all of its co-branded local schemes, plus Maestro cards, to Maestro only by year end. And as a result, Maestro will become the domestic brand for these cards. 
In Prepaid, we're working with Bank of China and Travelex to sell the Travelex Cash Passport Prepaid MasterCard, which is processed on our IPS platform. We're also working with courier [ph] issuers to introduce similar Travelex Cash Passport MasterCard cards in Korea. We've have just concluded an enhanced renewal of our agreement with NetSpend, which as you know is one of the leading providers of reloadable prepaid debit cards in the United States. And as an example, overseas, in Poland, we are piloting a chip-enabled football club prepaid card that provides an integrated solution for their fans. The card can be used for transit to the stadium, entrance into the stadium and concessions once inside the stadium.
In the commercial sector, we had signed two new issuer agreements for Smart Data in Germany, and these are in vision to other recent deals that we've talked about with SunTrust and Chase here in the U.S. And given the pickup in business travel spend globally, commercial is just a very attractive segment for us. Commercial cross-border volumes are growing at twice the rate of consumer cross-border volumes, although both are up double digits.
On the Processing front, we signed an agreement with Itaú Unibanco in Brazil to switch their credit transactions. And as a result, we now switched 100% of our issuer's debit and credit transactions in that market of Brazil. In Asia, we made a strategic investment in India-based ElectraCard Services that we believe will accelerate the success of both ElectraCard's and MasterCard's Processing businesses in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa. 
And in the mobile and e-Commerce space, we're pleased to announce that starting in the first quarter of 2011, MasterCard will be expanding our mobile trials by adding on a large U.S. issuer with micro-secure data functionality. MicroSD, micro security data, basically provides functionality, which enables smartphones to be used as payment devices in stores. It's kind of a big step forward towards trading a digital wallet with a host of financial capabilities built into the latest, most sophisticated mobile phones. So this is a sim card-based event, unlike some of the mobile tag events, which we are already doing, and we're trying to do a number of these to test the market. 
Also in the quarter, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China Union Pay to jointly explore opportunities, starting with e-Commerce and cross-border payments. We entered into an agreement with SingTel from Singapore, which has a position on eight markets in ASEAN [Association of South East Asian Nations], one of the larger mobile operators in Asia, to pursue mobile commerce opportunities. We've also recently agreed to work together with Airtel Africa to explore and pursue business opportunities in mobile commerce in Africa.
And finally, I'm of course pleased to announce that we just recently completed our acquisition of DataCash. We are going to hit the ground running in our efforts to further penetrate e-Commerce in Europe and, of course, leverage our combined fraud prevention capabilities across the entire marketplace, including what we do with MiGS [MasterCard Internet Gateway Service] in Asia/Pacific. So we look forward to continuing to report on our progress, not just with DataCash, but also all the other areas I just discussed. 
And I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,113939464,84312,"Mastercard Incorporated, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Page 3 of the deck, which shows our reported results. Net revenue grew 4.7% over last year's third quarter to $1.4 billion. On a constant currency basis, net revenue grew 7.3% driven by volume incr",2007,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Page 3 of the deck, which shows our reported results. Net revenue grew 4.7% over last year's third quarter to $1.4 billion. On a constant currency basis, net revenue grew 7.3% driven by volume increases. This includes growth of 15.4% in cross-border volumes and 8.5% in gross dollar volumes, or GDV, on a local currency basis. Approximately seven percentage points of revenue growth came from pricing, including the effect of cross-border rebates, and this was essentially offset by a net increase in rebates and incentives related to new and renewed customer agreements. 
The 4.1% decline in operating expenses versus last year's third quarter was primarily due to lower severance as well as savings due to reduced headcount. Our operating income was $766 million for the quarter and resulted in a quarterly operating margin of 53.6%, a 4.2-percentage-point improvement over the year-ago quarter. Our effective tax rate declined to 32.3% primarily due to the repatriation of some foreign earnings and a lower state tax rate, offset by some other discrete adjustments. 
We delivered net income of $518 million, up 14.6% over the third quarter of 2009 and up 19% on a constant currency basis. Earnings per share were $3.94 on a diluted basis. We previously mentioned that the acquisition of DataCash would have a 5% dilutive impact for the full year, split across the third quarter and the fourth quarter. We saw $0.02 of this dilution come through in the third quarter and expect the remaining $0.03 to impact the fourth quarter. Also, we separately said that there could be a potential impact of up to $0.05 from hedging transactions we entered into to protect against adverse currency movements on the transaction price. We saw a $0.03 negative impact from this FX hedging in the third quarter. We do not expect to see any further impact from this in the fourth quarter.
Over the next couple of slides, we have updated our presentation of operational metrics to make it a bit easier for you to follow. The regional breakdown of gross dollar volume and purchase volume that you are used to seeing here can still be found in the tables of our earnings release and on our website. 
So on Page 4, you can see that worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was up 8.5% on a local currency basis in the third quarter and grew 7.8% on a U.S. dollar converted basis to $685 billion. U.S. GDV was down 1.7%, and this is in line with what we have seen over the last couple of quarters. Across the rest of the world, GDV continued to grow a healthy 14.9% on a local currency basis. 
Worldwide credit GDV grew 6.4% on a local currency basis, similar to the second quarter. It was helped by U.S. credit GDV growth, which was just slightly down, continuing its trend of quarter-over-quarter improvement. And credit GDV for the rest of the world grew 9.6% on a local currency basis. Worldwide debit GDV continued doubled-digit growth of 12.7% on a local currency basis. In the U.S., we saw debit GDV decline 3%. But excluding the impact of deconversions, U.S. debit growth was 15.8%. Debit growth for the rest of the world was just over 30%, driven by Asia/Pacific, Middle East, Africa and Europe.
Cross-border volumes growth on a local currency basis was up 15.4%. We saw double-digit growth in Asia/Pacific, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Europe with low single-digit growth in the United States.
Now turning to Slide 5. Here you see processed transactions were up 0.6% compared with the year-ago quarter and a little over $5.8 billion. Processed transactions continue to grow at double-digit rates in Latin America and Asia/Pacific, Middle East, Africa, offset by the debit conversions in the U.S. and the U.K. Excluding those portfolio losses, processed transaction growth was 12.9%. We believe the bulk of the deconversions are now behind us and that the third quarter was the bottom in terms of processed transaction growth. Global card growth was about 1% to just over $1.9 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
So now let's turn to Page 6 to discuss the components of revenue in their performance relative to last year's third quarter. Domestic assessments increased 11.4% due to increased volumes and the impact of 2009 and 2010 price increases. Cross-border volumes fees increased by 40.2%, about 2/3 of the $155 million increase was due to our October 2009 pricing adjustments. The remainder was due to cross-border volumes growth, which was up, as I said before, by 15.4% on a local currency basis. Transaction processing fees increased 0.6%. Processed transactions, we just said, were up slightly, continued to be affected by the loss of some debit portfolios. And other revenues decreased 2.4% primarily driven by lower compliance and research fees. So in total, our gross revenue increased by $223 million or 12.9%. 
For the quarter, rebates and incentives grew $159 million, approximately $60 million of this increase was due to rebates associated with last October's cross-border pricing structure. And the remainder was primarily attributed to new and renewed customer agreements, including some of the deals Ajay mentioned earlier. Overall, rebates and incentives represented 26.8% of gross revenue versus 21% in last year's third quarter.
So now let's turn to Page 7 for some detail on expenses. During the third quarter, total operating expenses decreased by 4.1%. And within total operating expenses, general and administrative expenses decreased 6.7% primarily due to lower personnel expense, which itself was down by $50 million. Lower severance drove about half of the personnel expense decrease, and we have taken some of these savings and reinvested them into the business. Therefore, overall G&A was about down by $32 million. So advertising and marketing expense was up 4.7% versus the third quarter of 2009 or 6.2% on a constant currency basis primarily in support of campaigns in developing markets, and our third quarter advertising and marketing spend was lower than expected as some programs got pushed out to the fourth quarter.
Before getting into some thoughts for our full year 2010, let me give you an update of what we are seeing for MasterCard processed volume for the fourth quarter through October 28 of this year. So our cross-border volume grew 17% globally, ahead of the 15% that we saw in the third quarter, and this was due to an uptick in volume growth rates in Europe, Asia/Pacific, Latin America and the U.S. Although not a perfect proxy for GDV, total U.S. processed volume growth, which was about 2% negative for the third quarter, was flat in October and continues to be constrained by the roll-off of two debit portfolios. Excluding the impact of the debit roll-offs, total U.S. processed volume growth was about 9% versus growth of 7% for the second and the third quarters. This is certainly much healthier growth than with what we saw in the third quarter of 2009 when U.S. purchased volume was actually down by 7%. 
U.S. credit processed volume was positive in October, slightly ahead of the growth rate that we saw in the third quarter. U.S. debit processed volume growth continues to be down about single digits, but was up by about 24% when you exclude the tempering effect of the debit roll-off. And in October, total processed volume growth for the rest of the world was about 18%, ahead of the 15% pace we saw in the third quarter due to strength in several regions. Globally processed transaction growth was about 4%, including the impact of the four debit portfolio roll-off and 17% excluding that impact. The growth in both processed volume and processed transactions was in part driven by the Itaú processing agreement that Ajay mentioned as well as healthy, underlying usage trends.
Now on Slide 9. Let me outline our current view of 2010, which remains consistent with what we talked about on September 15. We expect net revenue growth for the second half of 2010 to be somewhat lower than the 9.7% we saw in the first half, and this is driven by the following factors. First, the roll-off of a few debit portfolios through the year end will continue to dampen our processed transaction growth. And our as-reported growth will remain constrained, at least through the first half of 2011 until the anniversary of the bulk of the deconversions, but this will be somewhat mitigated by the impact of new business rolling on over time. 
Second, we continue to expect contra [contra-revenue] as a percentage of gross revenue to average 26% to 27% for the full year even with the simplified structure of our acquirer cross-border assessment fee beginning this quarter. Remember that we will collapse all acquirer cross-border rebates into gross revenue with no impact on net revenue. The slide labeled Appendix A in our deck lays out the adjusted impact through the third quarter had this change been implemented back in January. And since this change has only a modest impact to quarterly rebate and incentive levels, contra as a percentage of gross revenue would still be the highest in the fourth quarter due to new and renewed deals and the normal seasonality of rebate and incentives. 
Now moving on to expenses. Overall, we continue to anticipate our total operating expenses for 2010 to be down slightly versus 2009 levels, including severance charges, as we reinvest in the business and key strategic initiatives. Now turning to the individual components of operating expense. We continue to expect general and administrative expenses to be down slightly from 2009 levels, again, including severance, but fourth quarter will be up more than 10% from the third quarter as a result of continued investments and including the impact of DataCash. Advertising and marketing spend should be up low single digits for the full year. And as we stated previously, up substantially versus the third quarter. And based on our current view, it could actually be a tad higher than last year's fourth quarter advertising and marketing spend. 
As mentioned earlier, we expect an $0.08 dilutive impact on full year EPS from the DataCash acquisition, of which $0.05 has already been booked in the third quarter. And consistent with my comments on Investor Day, our full year 2010 tax rate will be somewhat lower than we previously expected due to a onetime benefit resulting from some of our tax planning efforts. We now expect that our full year tax rate could be as low as 34%. 
So as a result of this, we continue to expect to achieve our objective of at least 20% net income growth for the full year. Now remember, when all of our objectives are on a constant currency basis, our as-reported numbers include the impact of foreign exchange, and this represented a 2.6% headwind to net revenue in the third quarter. And we expect a slight headwind for the fourth quarter, assuming the current exchange rates, particularly the euro, to hold for the balance of the year. Now recall that the euro averaged about $1.47 for the fourth quarter of 2009 versus its current level of about $1.39. 
To date, 2010 has not been without its challenges, including continued mixed signals from the U.S. economy and the roll-off of some debit portfolios. But the fundamentals of our business remain strong with solid volume growth outside the U.S. and a number of new business wins. We are on track to meet our financial objectives for 2010 and want to remind you of our 2011 to 2013 performance objectives that we communicated at our Investor meeting in September. So that it is on a constant currency basis, a net revenue compounded annual growth rate for that period of 12% to 14%,  a minimum operating margin of 50% on an annual basis and an earnings per share compounded annual growth rate of 20% plus over the 2011 to 2013 periods. 
So now, let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session."

I don't know that it's the result of the regulatory increases as much as my general perspective on the business. We're in a growth industry. In the sense that if cash is still 85% of retail transactions around the world and even in developed markets as we talked about on Investor Day, cash still has a fairly strong proportion of retail sales, and I believe that to be the bigger opportunity. And if you want to focus on that, and the right way to focus on that is to find consumer-friendly solutions that answer their needs as to why they should no longer used cash for what they use it for today. And mostly these cash transactions tend to be, in the developed world, for small-ticket items. And that's why I'm interested in contactless. That's why I'm interested in the mobile phone, and those kind of things. In the developing world, those cash transactions are not only for small-ticket items. They could be because of the absence of acceptance in certain parts of the world. That's why I'm so interested in the Indian unique identifier project, which takes acceptance to so many small cities and villages in the Indian system. It could be because in some ways, cash allows a certain amount of tax, let's say planning to use a politically correct word, for a number of these emerging markets. So a number of the central banks and the governments in these emerging markets are actually keen to drive down the use of cash to improve the transparency of their economy and their tax revenues. So I kind of look at all these factors coming together. And I switch back to mobile phones, contactless, acceptance, promotions that explain why you should use a card or a different form factor of electronic payments as compared to cash is kind of heavily driving a lot of our energy. I love to answer your question but that's my effort is. Pricing to me is something you use when you see opportunities for strategic spaces in the markets that either give you a better margin in that market or give you the chance to compete more sensibly in some of these markets. I don't view pricing as an end in itself."

Everything from recruiting and promoting a number of people into jobs that allow this focus that we're talking about to show up. So we've got a whole bunch of people focused on new channels and new clients and customers, we call that our business development function. So a portion of our sales force, both existing people and new people, have been redirected towards that, hence, the effort against governments and telcos and transit operators and merchants as businesses. We've also invested some amount of resources in beefing up our capability in the e-Commerce and mobile space. We're looking at our entire data and figuring out how to make more use of that data. In our Advisors' [MasterCard Advisors] space, we have reclassified Advisors business to bring it closer to our sales force in a number of the regions, so that we can bring what I consider to be a competitive advantage with Advisors at the front end of our sales force. A number banks, as we talked about on Investor Day, do not have access to thousands of people who will give them great insight into portfolio management, we can do that. We have Advisors sales force. Similarly, we've created MasterCard Labs as a way of driving innovation. I think the earlier conversation we had about mobile phones and e-Commerce and those kinds of biometrics in India for payments requires a company that was otherwise very focused on the perfection of its delivery, the reliability of our clearing authorization and settlement system to find a way to take some thoughtful risks on investing in ideas. Out of 10 ideas, eight will probably not do well. And I'm going to have to learn how to cut the cord a little bit fast and smart, while investing in the other two. And so there's a lot of things going here, Adam, and I just gave you a few examples of channels and products and innovation and the kind of people that are focused on it. There's also a great interest that I have, in my own way of looking at business, where I believe that business is earned at the client's office and with their customers. And so, I'm determined to be out there meeting my clients, meeting regulators, meeting opinion leaders and helping to make regulators and opinion leaders on the ground in different countries view MasterCard as a part of the way they grow commerce in their country, rather than a foreign company that merely exist to be able to facilitate its own profitability. I think a lot of -- what I just said has a lot of stuff buried in it, but this is something you'll see unfolding over the next couple of years. I want to make real meaning of the slogan, heart of commerce, not just a statement, a real meaning of that slogan. That's what MasterCard wants to be, at the heart of commerce."

They're starting to get a deeper understanding of how quickly debit is being embraced by consumers in different part of the world if that's where your mind is going. I'd say Europe, debit has always been a part of their life. And a large part of our transaction growth in Europe, which is healthy by the way, is coming from not just new wins but also the fact that SEPA [Single Euro Payments Area] is allowing us to see and process much more transactions. And we're being able to get into a situation like the Barclaycard example in Germany, which by the way is the sixth such bank in Germany where Maestro only is now on their debit card. So Europe, it's about winning space in the competitive space, because debit is already pretty well established. Although I still look on Europe as a growth area because of the amount of cash still used there. So that's Europe. Asia and Latin America, I would say debit is less established as a way of life for consumers, but it's getting there. Australia is much more so than, say, in India would be. India is still very much ATM withdrawal machine than a POS [point of sale] usage machine. So is Mexico, much more in ATM withdrawal machine than a POS usage machine. And so you look at transaction growth, you've got cash inside there as well. So look at purchase growth, you'll begin to see what I'm looking for."

This MOU with CUP [China Union Pay] focuses, one, on the e-Commerce space but, too, on that cross-border space. And in fact, as Walt said on Investor Day, out of the nine co-brands that came out of China in the last, I don't know, nine, 10 months roughly, I may be wrong by a month or two here or there but roughly that number, we've won all of them. And that's partly to do with our relationship with CUP and how we're working together as partners. Now do I think that, that will lead to some dramatic opening up of the Chinese market where the domestic sector will become open to companies like us and our competitors? I don't know. That's something that the Chinese government has to sort through in terms of their willingness to open that sector. There's so much going on in the governmental space between our government here and the Chinese government, so I don't know how to handicap where that'll come out.

And so I don't feel I'm staring at some big change in the way cash is used versus our cards were used. I also think that all the other demographic and social circumstances are still a very strong tailwind, even in the United States, to go away from cash. And I think that younger people, people with more education, more affluence, I see that as another little tailwind, in addition to our experience of having already had this kind of practical rule in the market before the DOJ settlement. So that's kind of a long answer to a simple question, but it's a complex topic, right. And the second part, the MDL [Multi District Litigation] case, nothing new has happened between, let's say, earnings are between the September Investor Day and today. The court heard these oral arguments back in November 2009. They have not ruled on those motions. There is court-recommended mediation going on right now. That mediation is confidential. It's tough for me to tell you where that we'll end up because I would be violating that confidentiality. Do I see some progress in it? Yes. But do I see that going to a place where I can be confident that I see light at the end of the tunnel? Not yet. So that's kind of where we are with the MDL. Will the DOJ settlement impact the MDL litigation case? I don't know yet, but I don't know how to handicap these kind of things. I would rather not to venture into that space and just deal with it as it comes along."

Here's the thing, the clarity around where the financial reform bill was going into full exclusivity idea that came in to the bill, really, happened only a couple months ago if you think back in time. It feels like a lifetime, but it's only a few months ago. A lot of the debit wins we are talking about in reality is what has been going on for a year. SunTrust took a year to go from initial conversations to real success. Sovereign Bank has been going on from a couple of months since I joined the company. I can recall discussions of our Executive Committee around Sovereign Bank. I remember Delta being a discussion from around the time I joined the company. So I would say to you, some of the wins we've got are just good old hard work around what we bring to the party, what our capabilities are and what -- for example, in SunTrust case, they have publicly gone out and said that the reason we won their business was because of the capabilities that MasterCard Advisors brought to the party in terms of portfolio management, and I think those are the kind of things that are helping us. Now going forward, if anything, I'd like to see a little tailwind in that as we get some clarity around the exclusivity. I just don't know what that clarity will be.

One is we're learning on debit as we go along as a company, and we're trying to make real progress in Asia and Latin America with a number of our clients there. We've got segmented offers in debit. We're actually bringing our entire marketing might to the debit table. In Australia, we went through a exercise of really understanding what youth in Australia were looking for from their debit circumstance. And we found that music, youth and debit kind of created a nice holy alliance, and we went after that in a very clever way with a partnership with the a local bank. And that's given us an enormous gains in Australia. So it's really hard work country by country on the debit space. I'd say in Europe, it's a little different. In Europe, it's about making sure that we start getting some benefits from SEPA, and SEPA is a long haul. So don't get me wrong. It doesn't change in one month or six months, but over the course of two or three years. As Javier said at Investor Day, we think that SEPA gives us a real chance to see more transactions, as well as see more of them, on Maestro-only cards or MasterCard-only debit cards as against a co-branded with a local scheme."

The first part is about perception of market share. And I'd say that my general impression from the last year and a half of traveling in Europe is that we're seeing us being the real player on debit, and that we are seeing us picking up some momentum in terms of the SEPA opportunity. I don't think anything would've changed more dramatically than that in a year. One thing I've learned about this business over time is that it takes time to change it upwards or downwards. The debit losses in the U.S. that are rolling off right now are the result of losses two years ago. And the wins we've got just now in Martina's reply to the first question are really stiff that'll roll on over the course of a year, a year and a half. So I'd say nothing would've changed that dramatically in the course of this year. The aspect of banks versus going to a local European solution as against something else, there's always constant dialogue with European banks. And to first of all say our European banks thinking about it will probably be a misnomer because each of them has a different perspective, and that in itself tells you why it's not that easy to get one solution for the whole of Europe. And the second thing is that the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, right. And we've got real answers in the Netherlands, where, as you know, MasterCard Maestro usage has now reached record numbers, and we're making progress in a number of these markets and even in Belgium as well as in other markets of Continental Europe. So I'd say to you that I believe that the economic rationale of taking a global scheme that has the benefit of a 100-plus modifications made to its core systems globally, every year, which comes free to any one market, that benefit is now much clearly understood than it was three years ago. I think that remains a benefit for us on the ground in Europe, whereas technology and our global unified presence brings those 100 changes to every market. For example, we're now amending our system to cope with biometrics for India. Once it's done, and I saw the first transaction work in my own eyes, my palm, actually in India when I was there, you can begin to understand that that'll then be available to every market, including every country in Europe across on our system. If some other country in Europe decides to go to biometrics at some point of time, I can give it to them without a great deal of investment. That, to me, is clearer in the minds of some of those European banks. Some of the others, on the other hand, would still go differently. And it's a constant effort. And that's why SEPA and Europe is not a turn on a dime kind of thing, it's a two-, three-, four-year effort."

Other than the other hand don't have those resources, those are the ones we focus on much more. Having said that, even the bigger ones, when they do their information, they do it based on their own card portfolio. What I can bring to the party, so as anonymized data, is a much bigger perspective of many more cards, not just the ones that are already in their portfolio, which may give them a somewhat unipolar view of what to do with their book.

But different banks have already begun to estimate, as you know, what that number could be. We're talking a very large number of dollars. If you were to add up all the issuer processing fees that would make from banks of that size and scope, you're talking about, even if they were to negotiate back with me till the cows come home, you're talking of a very small difference in that number of revenue that they've lost. What I saw in Australia, when it happened in Australia, and I was at Citibank those days, on the other side of the fence was that the impact had to be made with many other things. One being how you look at a checking account fees, which, as you can see, is already beginning to happen. In fact, right now, they're getting fees on bank accounts that go past checking accounts. They go to different elements of the feature functionality of a checking account. They happen with what you do with debit rewards and how you price those. They'll happen with how you price different services that you give. You may get a pricing on ACH [Automated Clearing House] debit store bank account, which today aren't price that way, which in a number of countries are priced by the way. If you talk to ING DIRECT in the Netherlands, they will tell you that ACH debits are priced. Here, they are not. So there's a series of revenue items that banks will look that I believe are more substantial in size than if you were to talk to some of the leading bankers in this country, they would tell you -- and there's some of the, have been publicly quoted to say, ""They already have really good pricing from the networks."" And I, therefore, am a little less worried about that. I'm much more interested in providing them with more opportunities for thinking through how to make up their revenue as the next couple of years unfolds.

Before Martina gets into the details of the results, I thought I would comment on some of the operational drivers in the quarter as well as some recent business highlights. 
So in this third quarter, we saw net revenue growth of 4.7% on an as-reported basis or 7.3% on a constant currency basis. GDV, gross dollar volume, grew 8.45% on a local currency basis, and cross-border volume grew 15.4%, continuing the momentum from the first half of the year. Processed transaction growth was slightly positive for the quarter. And there, we are tempered by the continued roll-off of several U.S. and U.K. debit portfolios. But excluding those deconversions, underlying transaction growth was about 13%. These factors and cost savings are kind of put together would allow us to deliver an operating margin of 53.6% this quarter, a four percentage point expansion over last year's third quarter. And all of this have fueled net income growth of 14.6% or about 19% on a constant currency basis. 
Reflecting relative economic growth trends, our volume growth outside the U.S. outpaced growth in the U.S. The Asia/Pacific and Latin America regions just continue to deliver strong double-digit growth, driven by both domestic and cross-border volumes as the economic expansion is persisting in these markets. And while it's true that a number of the Asian and Latin American economies are showing good growth in domestic demand, the fact is that consumption in the U.S. and Europe still accounts for more than half of global PCE [personal consumption expenditure]. And so for Asia and Latin America to keep growing at these rates for an extended period, we really need to see consumption pick up again in the U.S. and in Europe.
Having said that, purchase volumes in Europe remain relatively healthy despite what we all read about the continued macroeconomic situation in the continent. In general, Europeans did not accelerate their spending to the same extent as the other markets did a few years ago, and their response over the last couple of years is also, therefore, more muted. And during the summer holiday season, we continue to see them traveling. And as many of these countries continue to move away from a relatively high percentage of cash transactions, the shift to electronic forms of payments just continues to generate new volume for us.
In the U.S., while the market is looking healthier than it did this time last year, the economy continues to show conflicting signals with the Fed [Federal Reserve System] predicting modest improvements until the second half of next year of 2011. U.S. consumer spending appears to be following those very mixed signals even when looking at our own data. And while our U.S. credit volume growth trend continued to improve, it is being driven by commercial credit. Consumer credit growth remained about flat with the second quarter. This is also consistent with our U.S. SpendingPulse data, where September retail sales showed discretionary spend remained largely in check. And that's in contrast to U.S. debit volumes, which, excluding the debit portfolio roll-off, continued to see growth in the mid-teens.
So now let me touch a little briefly on two regulatory developments here in the U.S. First, we're pleased to have reached a settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice late in the third quarter. After two years of investigation, the DOJ required us to simply clarify the rules that we already had in practice every day, which allow merchants to discount. 
Second, turning to the financial reform bill, we have little more to report beyond what we communicated at our investor community meeting day on September 15. We're awaiting the Fed's ruling. And until we see it, it's impossible to predict the outcome to either MasterCard or the entire payments industry. At our recent meetings with the Fed, we have continued to have a constructive dialogue as they work to gather a complete picture of the U.S. payments industry. Consistent with what we believe you are hearing, we expect the first drop of the Fed's position sometime in December, and we are planning for the range of outcomes that we talked about earlier. Given our U.S. debit share and as some level of exclusivity will go away, we see upside potential for MasterCard. However, we will have to wait for the Fed's decision to determine the true nature of the impact on our business.
Meanwhile, we remain focused on executing our growth strategy around the globe. And that is to grow our core Debit Prepaid and Processing businesses, Credit, Debit, Prepaid and Processing, both consumer and commercial, to diversify our geographies by investing in high-growth markets, to diversify our customer set by building relationships with merchants, telcos, governments, transit operators and to bring new businesses in emerging areas, such as e-Commerce and mobile payments. So that's the grow, diversify, build strategy we talked about on the 15th of September. We will continue to drive growth on a local level with a focus on an enhanced consumer experience. 
So let me take a moment to highlight a few recent news items. You probably heard about some of these at Investor Day, but I wanted to make sure that we fully reflected the news of the quarter as we speak today. So the affluent segment, you heard us say in September that we were going to focus on wealth management and airlines to reach this important segment, and I'm pleased to say that we have signed a credit agreement with UBS Switzerland Wealth Management to launch World MasterCard. We also signed a debit agreement with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney here in the U.S. 
We've also recently signed a number of airline co-brands, such as Royal Jordanian Airline and Kingfisher Airlines in India. These add to the momentum in this sector, including some of the previously announced deals with Turkish Airlines and Aeroflot in Russia, and there are others in the pipeline. And building on the success of the Ferrari credit card launched in Spain a few months ago, Santander is now launching a similar co-branded MasterCard in Mexico. And all of these are examples of exciting portfolios given their potential to capture affluent cross-border spend.
Moving to debit. In the U.S., I am delighted to announce that Sovereign Bank will upgrade its nearly 2 million card consumer and commercial debit programs to MasterCard next year in 2011, as they would implement the debit processing capabilities of our IPS [Integrated Processing Solutions] platform. This Sovereign win, combined with our SunTrust and Chevy Chase, now part of Capital One wins, continues to reinforce our debit position in the Eastern part of the United States. These are in addition to the Delta Air Lines and Morgan Stanley Smith Barney deals that we also recently announced.
Overseas, we have signed an exclusive premium debit agreement with Qatar Islamic Bank to convert their portfolio to MasterCard. Qatar Islamic Bank is one of the top five Islamic banks in the world and has a long history with one of our largest competitors. And in Germany, Barclaycard will be converting all of its co-branded local schemes, plus Maestro cards, to Maestro only by year end. And as a result, Maestro will become the domestic brand for these cards. 
In Prepaid, we're working with Bank of China and Travelex to sell the Travelex Cash Passport Prepaid MasterCard, which is processed on our IPS platform. We're also working with Korean issuers to introduce similar Travelex Cash Passport MasterCard cards in Korea. We've just concluded an enhanced renewal of our agreement with NetSpend, which as you know is one of the leading providers of reloadable prepaid debit cards in the United States. And as an example, overseas, in Poland, we are piloting a chip-enabled football club prepaid card that provides an integrated solution for their fans. The card can be used for transit to the stadium, entrance into the stadium and concessions once inside the stadium.
In the commercial sector, we have signed two new issuer agreements for Smart Data in Germany, and these are envisioned by other recent deals that we have talked about with SunTrust and Chase here in the U.S. And given the pickup in business travel spend globally, commercial is just a very attractive segment for us. Commercial cross-border volumes are growing at twice the rate of consumer cross-border volumes, although both are up double digits.
On the Processing front, we signed an agreement with Itaú Unibanco in Brazil to switch their credit transactions. And as a result, we now switched 100% of our issuer's debit and credit transactions in that market of Brazil. In Asia, we made a strategic investment in India-based ElectraCard Services that we believe will accelerate the success of both ElectraCard's and MasterCard's Processing businesses in Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa. 
And in the mobile and e-Commerce space, we're pleased to announce that starting in the first quarter of 2011, MasterCard will be expanding our mobile trials by adding on a large U.S. issuer with micro-secure data functionality. MicroSD, micro security data, basically provides functionality, which enables smartphones to be used as payment devices in stores. It's kind of a big step forward towards creating a digital wallet with a host of financial capabilities built into the latest, most sophisticated mobile phones. So this is a sim card-based event, unlike some of the mobile tag events, which we are already doing, and we're trying to do a number of these to test the market. 
Also in the quarter, we signed a Memorandum of Understanding with China Union Pay to jointly explore opportunities, starting with e-Commerce and cross-border payments. We entered into an agreement with SingTel from Singapore, which has a position on eight markets in ASEAN [Association of South East Asian Nations], one of the larger mobile operators in Asia, to pursue mobile commerce opportunities. We've also recently agreed to work together with Airtel Africa to explore and pursue business opportunities in mobile commerce in Africa.
And finally, I'm of course pleased to announce that we just recently completed our acquisition of DataCash. We are going to hit the ground running in our efforts to further penetrate e-Commerce in Europe and, of course, leverage our combined fraud prevention capabilities across the entire marketplace, including what we do with MiGS [MasterCard Internet Gateway Service] in Asia/Pacific. So we look forward to continuing to report on our progress, not just with DataCash, but also all the other areas I just discussed. 
And I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for a detailed update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,113939464,84411,"Mastercard Incorporated, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2010",2010-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Page 3 of the deck, which shows our reported results. Net revenue grew 4.7% over last year's third quarter to $1.4 billion. On a constant currency basis, net revenue grew 7.3% driven by volume incr",2007,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Page 3 of the deck, which shows our reported results. Net revenue grew 4.7% over last year's third quarter to $1.4 billion. On a constant currency basis, net revenue grew 7.3% driven by volume increases. This includes growth of 15.4% in cross-border volumes and 8.5% in gross dollar volumes, or GDV, on a local currency basis. Approximately seven percentage points of revenue growth came from pricing, including the effect of cross-border rebates, and this was essentially offset by a net increase in rebates and incentives related to new and renewed customer agreements. 
The 4.1% decline in operating expenses versus last year's third quarter was primarily due to lower severance as well as savings due to reduced headcount. Our operating income was $766 million for the quarter and resulted in a quarterly operating margin of 53.6%, a 4.2-percentage-point improvement over the year-ago quarter. Our effective tax rate declined to 32.3% primarily due to the repatriation of some foreign earnings and a lower state tax rate, offset by some other discrete adjustments. 
We delivered net income of $518 million, up 14.6% over the third quarter of 2009 and up 19% on a constant currency basis. Earnings per share were $3.94 on a diluted basis. We previously mentioned that the acquisition of DataCash would have a 5% dilutive impact for the full year, split across the third quarter and the fourth quarter. We saw $0.02 of this dilution come through in the third quarter and expect the remaining $0.03 to impact the fourth quarter. Also, we separately said that there could be a potential impact of up to $0.05 from hedging transactions we entered into to protect against adverse currency movements on the transaction price. We saw a $0.03 negative impact from this FX hedging in the third quarter. We do not expect to see any further impact from this in the fourth quarter.
Over the next couple of slides, we have updated our presentation of operational metrics to make it a bit easier for you to follow. The regional breakdown of gross dollar volume and purchase volume that you are used to seeing here can still be found in the tables of our earnings release and on our website. 
So on Page 4, you can see that worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was up 8.5% on a local currency basis in the third quarter and grew 7.8% on a U.S. dollar converted basis to $685 billion. U.S. GDV was down 1.7%, and this is in line with what we have seen over the last couple of quarters. Across the rest of the world, GDV continued to grow a healthy 14.9% on a local currency basis. 
Worldwide credit GDV grew 6.4% on a local currency basis, similar to the second quarter. It was helped by U.S. credit GDV growth, which was just slightly down, continuing its trend of quarter-over-quarter improvement. And credit GDV for the rest of the world grew 9.6% on a local currency basis. Worldwide debit GDV continued doubled-digit growth of 12.7% on a local currency basis. In the U.S., we saw debit GDV decline 3%. But excluding the impact of deconversions, U.S. debit growth was 15.8%. Debit growth for the rest of the world was just over 30%, driven by Asia/Pacific, Middle East, Africa and Europe.
Cross-border volumes growth on a local currency basis was up 15.4%. We saw double-digit growth in Asia/Pacific, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Europe with low single-digit growth in the United States.
Now turning to Slide 5. Here you see processed transactions were up 0.6% compared with the year-ago quarter and a little over $5.8 billion. Processed transactions continue to grow at double-digit rates in Latin America and Asia/Pacific, Middle East, Africa, offset by the debit conversions in the U.S. and the U.K. Excluding those portfolio losses, processed transaction growth was 12.9%. We believe the bulk of the deconversions are now behind us and that the third quarter was the bottom in terms of processed transaction growth. Global card growth was about 1% to just over $1.9 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
So now let's turn to Page 6 to discuss the components of revenue in their performance relative to last year's third quarter. Domestic assessments increased 11.4% due to increased volumes and the impact of 2009 and 2010 price increases. Cross-border volumes fees increased by 40.2%, about 2/3 of the $155 million increase was due to our October 2009 pricing adjustments. The remainder was due to cross-border volumes growth, which was up, as I said before, by 15.4% on a local currency basis. Transaction processing fees increased 0.6%. Processed transactions, we just said, were up slightly, continued to be affected by the loss of some debit portfolios. And other revenues decreased 2.4% primarily driven by lower compliance and research fees. So in total, our gross revenue increased by $223 million or 12.9%. 
For the quarter, rebates and incentives grew $159 million, approximately $60 million of this increase was due to rebates associated with last October's cross-border pricing structure. And the remainder was primarily attributed to new and renewed customer agreements, including some of the deals Ajay mentioned earlier. Overall, rebates and incentives represented 26.8% of gross revenue versus 21% in last year's third quarter.
So now let's turn to Page 7 for some detail on expenses. During the third quarter, total operating expenses decreased by 4.1%. And within total operating expenses, general and administrative expenses decreased 6.7% primarily due to lower personnel expense, which itself was down by $50 million. Lower severance drove about half of the personnel expense decrease, and we have taken some of these savings and reinvested them into the business. Therefore, overall G&A was about down by $32 million. So advertising and marketing expense was up 4.7% versus the third quarter of 2009 or 6.2% on a constant currency basis primarily in support of campaigns in developing markets, and our third quarter advertising and marketing spend was lower than expected as some programs got pushed out to the fourth quarter.
Before getting into some thoughts for our full year 2010, let me give you an update of what we are seeing for MasterCard processed volume for the fourth quarter through October 28 of this year. So our cross-border volume grew 17% globally, ahead of the 15% that we saw in the third quarter, and this was due to an uptick in volume growth rates in Europe, Asia/Pacific, Latin America and the U.S. Although not a perfect proxy for GDV, total U.S. processed volume growth, which was about 2% negative for the third quarter, was flat in October and continues to be constrained by the roll-off of two debit portfolios. Excluding the impact of the debit roll-offs, total U.S. processed volume growth was about 9% versus growth of 7% for the second and the third quarters. This is certainly much healthier growth than with what we saw in the third quarter of 2009 when U.S. purchased volume was actually down by 7%. 
U.S. credit processed volume was positive in October, slightly ahead of the growth rate that we saw in the third quarter. U.S. debit processed volume growth continues to be down about single digits, but was up by about 24% when you exclude the tempering effect of the debit roll-off. And in October, total processed volume growth for the rest of the world was about 18%, ahead of the 15% pace we saw in the third quarter due to strength in several regions. Globally processed transaction growth was about 4%, including the impact of the four debit portfolio roll-off and 17% excluding that impact. The growth in both processed volume and processed transactions was in part driven by the Itaú processing agreement that Ajay mentioned as well as healthy, underlying usage trends.
Now on Slide 9. Let me outline our current view of 2010, which remains consistent with what we talked about on September 15. We expect net revenue growth for the second half of 2010 to be somewhat lower than the 9.7% we saw in the first half, and this is driven by the following factors. First, the roll-off of a few debit portfolios through the year end will continue to dampen our processed transaction growth. And our as-reported growth will remain constrained, at least through the first half of 2011 until the anniversary of the bulk of the deconversions, but this will be somewhat mitigated by the impact of new business rolling on over time. 
Second, we continue to expect contra [contra-revenue] as a percentage of gross revenue to average 26% to 27% for the full year even with the simplified structure of our acquirer cross-border assessment fee beginning this quarter. Remember that we will collapse all acquirer cross-border rebates into gross revenue with no impact on net revenue. The slide labeled Appendix A in our deck lays out the adjusted impact through the third quarter had this change been implemented back in January. And since this change has only a modest impact to quarterly rebate and incentive levels, contra as a percentage of gross revenue would still be the highest in the fourth quarter due to new and renewed deals and the normal seasonality of rebate and incentives. 
Now moving on to expenses. Overall, we continue to anticipate our total operating expenses for 2010 to be down slightly versus 2009 levels, including severance charges, as we reinvest in the business and key strategic initiatives. Now turning to the individual components of operating expense. We continue to expect general and administrative expenses to be down slightly from 2009 levels, again, including severance, but fourth quarter will be up more than 10% from the third quarter as a result of continued investments and including the impact of DataCash. Advertising and marketing spend should be up low single digits for the full year. And as we stated previously, up substantially versus the third quarter. And based on our current view, it could actually be a tad higher than last year's fourth quarter advertising and marketing spend. 
As mentioned earlier, we expect an $0.08 dilutive impact on full year EPS from the DataCash acquisition, of which $0.05 has already been booked in the third quarter. And consistent with my comments on Investor Day, our full year 2010 tax rate will be somewhat lower than we previously expected due to a onetime benefit resulting from some of our tax planning efforts. We now expect that our full year tax rate could be as low as 34%. 
So as a result of this, we continue to expect to achieve our objective of at least 20% net income growth for the full year. Now remember, when all of our objectives are on a constant currency basis, our as-reported numbers include the impact of foreign exchange, and this represented a 2.6% headwind to net revenue in the third quarter. And we expect a slight headwind for the fourth quarter, assuming the current exchange rates, particularly the euro, to hold for the balance of the year. Now recall that the euro averaged about $1.47 for the fourth quarter of 2009 versus its current level of about $1.39. 
To date, 2010 has not been without its challenges, including continued mixed signals from the U.S. economy and the roll-off of some debit portfolios. But the fundamentals of our business remain strong with solid volume growth outside the U.S. and a number of new business wins. We are on track to meet our financial objectives for 2010 and want to remind you of our 2011 to 2013 performance objectives that we communicated at our Investor meeting in September. So that it is on a constant currency basis, a net revenue compounded annual growth rate for that period of 12% to 14%, a minimum operating margin of 50% on an annual basis and an earnings per share compounded annual growth rate of 20% plus over the 2011 to 2013 periods.

I don't know that it's the result of the regulatory increases as much as my general perspective on the business. We're in a growth industry. In the sense that if cash is still 85% of retail transactions around the world and even in developed markets as we talked about on Investor Day, cash still has a fairly strong proportion of retail sales, and I believe that to be the bigger opportunity. And if you want to focus on that, and the right way to focus on that is to find consumer-friendly solutions that answer their needs as to why they should no longer used cash for what they use it for today. And mostly these cash transactions tend to be, in the developed world, for small-ticket items. And that's why I'm interested in contactless. That's why I'm interested in the mobile phone, and those kind of things. In the developing world, those cash transactions are not only for small-ticket items. They could be because of the absence of acceptance in certain parts of the world. That's why I'm so interested in the Indian unique identifier project, which takes acceptance to so many small cities and villages in the Indian system. It could be because in some ways, cash allows a certain amount of tax, let's say planning to use a politically correct word, for a number of these emerging markets. So a number of the central banks and the governments in these emerging markets are actually keen to drive down the use of cash to improve the transparency of their economy and their tax revenues. So I kind of look at all these factors coming together. And I switch back to mobile phones, contactless, acceptance, promotions that explain why you should use a card or a different form factor of electronic payments as compared to cash is kind of where we’re driving a lot of our energy. I love to answer your question but that's where my effort is. Pricing to me is something you use when you see opportunities for strategic spaces in the markets that either give you a better margin in that market or give you the chance to compete more sensibly in some of these markets. I don't view pricing as an end in itself."

In our Advisors' [MasterCard Advisors] space, we have reclassified Advisors business to bring it closer to our sales force in a number of the regions, so that we can bring what I consider to be a competitive advantage with Advisors at the front end of our sales force. A number of banks, as we talked about on Investor Day, do not have access to thousands of people who will give them great insight into portfolio management, we can do that. We have Advisors sales force. Similarly, we've created MasterCard Labs as a way of driving innovation. I think the earlier conversation we had about mobile phones and e-Commerce and those kinds of biometrics in India for payments requires a company that was otherwise very focused on the perfection of its delivery, the reliability of our clearing authorization and settlement system to find a way to take some thoughtful risks on investing in ideas. Out of 10 ideas, eight will probably not do well. And I'm going to have to learn how to cut the cord a little bit fast and smart, while investing in the other two. And so there's a lot of things going here, Adam, and I just gave you a few examples of channels and products and innovation and the kind of people that are focused on it. There's also a great interest that I have, in my own way of looking at business, where I believe that business is earned at the client's office and with their customers. And so, I'm determined to be out there meeting my clients, meeting regulators, meeting opinion leaders and helping to make regulators and opinion leaders on the ground in different countries view MasterCard as a part of the way they grow commerce in their country, rather than a foreign company that merely exist to be able to facilitate its own profitability. I think a lot of -- what I just said has a lot of stuff buried in it, but this is something you'll see unfolding over the next couple of years. I want to make real meaning of the slogan, heart of commerce, not just a statement, a real meaning of that slogan. That's what MasterCard wants to be, at the heart of commerce."

They're starting to get a deeper understanding of how quickly debit is being embraced by consumers in different part of the world if that's where your mind is going. I'd say Europe, debit has always been a part of their life. And a large part of our transaction growth in Europe, which is healthy by the way, is coming from not just new wins but also the fact that SEPA [Single Euro Payments Area] is allowing us to see and process much more transactions. And we're being able to get into a situation like the Barclaycard example in Germany, which by the way is the sixth such bank in Germany where Maestro only is now on their debit card. So Europe, it's about winning space in the competitive space, because debit is already pretty well established. Although I still look on Europe as a growth area because of the amount of cash still used there. So that's Europe. Asia and Latin America, I would say debit is less established as a way of life for consumers, but it's getting there. In Australia, much more so than, say, in India would be. India is still very much ATM withdrawal machine than a POS [point of sale] usage machine. So is Mexico, much more in ATM withdrawal machine than a POS usage machine. And so you look at transaction growth, you've got cash inside there as well. So look at purchase growth, you'll begin to see what I'm talking about."

But the way I think about China is, while it's relatively attractive and is profitable and it's growing, that's just larger part at the end of the rainbow that you're referring to, which is the domestic processing business. My view about the MOU with China Union Pay is, first of all, I want to make sure that the business we do well today in China, which is the cross-border business both for Chinese traveling overseas and for people traveling into China and for the e-Commerce space, that is consolidated upon and grown attractively. This MOU with CUP [China Union Pay] focuses, one, on the e-Commerce space but, two, on that cross-border space. And in fact, as Walt said on Investor Day, out of the nine co-brands that came out of China in the last, I don't know, nine, 10 months roughly, I may be wrong by a month or two here or there but roughly that number, we've won all of them. And that's partly to do with our relationship with CUP and how we're working together as partners. Now do I think that, that will lead to some dramatic opening up of the Chinese market where the domestic sector will become open to companies like us and our competitors? I don't know. That's something that the Chinese government has to sort through in terms of their willingness to open that sector. There's so much going on in the governmental space between our government here and the Chinese government, so I don't know how to handicap where that'll come out. But my approach to that is we'll see what happens. Let's keep the partnership going. Let's build on what we are good at. Let's make sure it grows even faster. Let's be making them even more impregnable position in that space. And as the partnership develops, let's see where that goes. I just don't know how to handicap it any other way."

There's the value you bring from different products you place with them inControl, EMS [Expert Monitoring Service], fraud solutions, Advisors, all that comes into what I call an integrated pricing opportunity, along with an integrated solution that we're trying and propose to our issuer clients. I think that if you look out in the future, I think that trend of tough negotiations will only increase because that's every business has got pressure on its margins. And I think our job is to really find ways to: One, grow the overall size of the pie, hence, my focus on cash; two, to grow my share because I happen to be a lower share in some markets than some of my bigger competitors; and three, to find intelligent ways to package solutions, which allow me some pricing space.

The first portion was about the DOJ settlement and where I think that discounting will change. I don't actually know that for sure. I can speculate that there will be, in certain cases, a probability of some more discounting for the usage of cash. But to tell you the truth, the total volume of our business that I think will be impacted by that discounting still remains very, very small in my mind, while the second one basically ended up in the right place with, let's say, nearly a clarification of the way we were conducting our business. Having had the experience of having it conducted that way for a while, I don't know that it's going to change a great deal with the settlement. You know what I mean? That's where I'm coming from. And so I don't feel I'm staring at some big change in the way cash is used versus our cards were used. I also think that all the other demographic and social circumstances are still a very strong tailwind, even in the United States, to go away from cash. And I think that younger people, people with more education, more affluence, I see that as another little tailwind, in addition to our experience of having already had this kind of practical rule in the market before the DOJ settlement. So that's kind of a long answer to a simple question, but it's a complex topic, right. And the second part, the MDL [Multi District Litigation] case, nothing new has happened between, let's say, earnings are between the September Investor Day and today. The court heard these oral arguments back in November 2009. They have not ruled on those motions. There is court-recommended mediation going on right now. That mediation is confidential. It's tough for me to tell you where that we'll end up because I would be violating that confidentiality. Do I see some progress in it? Yes. But do I see that going to a place where I can be confident that I see light at the end of the tunnel? Not yet. So that's kind of where we are with the MDL. Will the DOJ settlement impact the MDL litigation case? I don't know yet, but I don't know how to handicap these kind of things.

SunTrust took a year to go from initial conversations to real success. Sovereign Bank has been going on from a couple of months since I joined the company. I can recall discussions of our Executive Committee around Sovereign Bank. I remember Delta being a discussion from around the time I joined the company. So I would say to you, some of the wins we've got are just good old hard work around what we bring to the party, what our capabilities are and what -- for example, in SunTrust case, they have publicly gone out and said that the reason we won their business was because of the capabilities that MasterCard Advisors brought to the party in terms of portfolio management, and I think those are the kind of things that are helping us.

And we found that music, youth and debit kind of created a nice holy alliance, and we went after that in a very clever way with a partnership with a local bank. And that's given us enormous gains in Australia. So it's really hard work country by country on the debit space. I'd say in Europe, it's a little different. In Europe, it's about making sure that we start getting some benefits from SEPA, and SEPA is a long haul. So don't get me wrong. It doesn't change in one month or six months, but over the course of two or three years.

The first part is about perception of market share. And I'd say that my general impression from the last year and a half of traveling in Europe is that we're seeing us being the real player on debit, and that we are seeing us picking up some momentum in terms of the SEPA opportunity. I don't think anything would've changed more dramatically than that in a year. One thing I've learned about this business over time is that it takes time to change it upwards or downwards. The debit losses in the U.S. that are rolling off right now are the result of losses two years ago. And the wins we've got just now in Martina's reply to the first question are really stuff that'll roll on over the course of a year, a year and a half. So I'd say nothing would've changed that dramatically in the course of this year. The aspect of banks versus going to a local European solution as against something else, there's always constant dialogue with European banks. And to first of all say our European banks thinking about it will probably be a misnomer because each of them has a different perspective, and that in itself tells you why it's not that easy to get one solution for the whole of Europe. And the second thing is that the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, right. And we've got real answers in the Netherlands, where, as you know, MasterCard Maestro usage has now reached record numbers, and we're making progress in a number of these markets and even in Belgium as well as in other markets of Continental Europe. So I'd say to you that I believe that the economic rationale of taking a global scheme that has the benefit of a 100-plus modifications made to its core systems globally, every year, which comes free to any one market, that benefit is now much clearly understood than it was three years ago. I think that remains a benefit for us on the ground in Europe, whereas technology and our global unified presence brings those 100 changes to every market. For example, we're now amending our system to cope with biometrics for India. Once it's done, and I saw the first transaction work in my own eyes, my palm, actually, in India when I was there, you can begin to understand that that'll then be available to every market, including every country in Europe across on our system. If some other country in Europe decides to go to biometrics at some point of time, I can give it to them without a great deal of investment. That, to me, is clearer in the minds of some of those European banks. Some of the others, on the other hand, would still go differently. And it's a constant effort. And that's why SEPA and Europe is not a turn on a dime kind of thing, it's a two-, three-, four-year effort."

It's their private data, and I would be making a big mistake by passing that to you. But I will tell you this, where I was coming from in Advisors, some of the bigger banks around the world, in the U.S. and elsewhere, they clearly have excellent individuals in their company who have devoted a large part of time trying to understand their data and manage their portfolios right from more efficient acquisition of clients to utilization, to portfolio management, to bankruptcy prediction, to charge-off prediction, to loyalty schemes and so on. Others, on the other hand, don't have those resources, those are the ones we focus on much more. Having said that, even the bigger ones, when they do their information, they do it based on their own card portfolio. What I can bring to the party, so as anonymized data, is a much bigger perspective of many more cards, not just the ones that are already in their portfolio, which may give them a somewhat unipolar view of what to do with their book. And so those are the two aspects of Advisors that I'm trying to put forward as a competitive edge when our sales force goes to speak to everybody from credit unions to large banks in the U.S. as well as overseas. But I'm sorry, I'm not at liberty to give you a sense of the improvement in a bank's number. That would be inappropriate of me."

As we compete under the Durbin regulation, is MasterCard planning to gain debit market share by competing more aggressively on price or by using non-price ways to get your brand on more debit cards and also to attract merchant's routing decisions? So can you give us some perspective on how the debit market share gains will be achieved and the balance of strategy from pricing versus non-price factors?"

But frankly, all the options we've looked at have a combination of both those things. Even to get merchants to give preferred routing will require a combination of value-added products that they in turn perceive as important to them as well as some pricing benefits. Everybody is negotiating tougher, as I said, these days and earlier. So it's a combination of both. I don't know whether it'll be more weighted to one or the other. The way I look at my life right now is that all I've got here is the possibility of upside. I don't have that business. I'm trying to look at where that business could be positioned with me over a period of time. I would like to get more of it with strategic value-added products and less of it with pricing, but let's see how the game gets played out over the next year or two here."

So as existing contracts come up for renewal, are you expecting more intense sort of pricing concession requests in these upcoming renewals? Since banks are looking at lower debit interchange, maybe they're going to ask for some pricing concessions across both the debit and sort of credit portfolios on the network fee side. Is that something that you're anticipating? Or is that being worried about something that's not likely to transpire?"

But different banks have already begun to estimate, as you know, what that number could be. We're talking a very large number of dollars. If you were to add up all the issuer processing fees that would make from banks of that size and scope, you're talking about, even if they were to negotiate back with me till the cows come home, you're talking of a very small difference in that number of revenue that they've lost. What I saw in Australia, when it happened in Australia, and I was at Citibank those days, on the other side of the fence was that the impact had to be made with many other things. One being how you look at a checking account fees, which, as you can see, is already beginning to happen. In fact, right now, they're getting fees on bank accounts that go past checking accounts. They go to different elements of the feature functionality of a checking account. They happen with what you do with debit rewards and how you price those. They'll happen with how you price different services that you give. You may get a pricing on ACH [Automated Clearing House] debit store bank account, which today aren't price that way, which in a number of countries are priced by the way. If you talk to ING DIRECT in the Netherlands, they will tell you that ACH debits are priced. Here, they are not. So there's a series of revenue items that banks will look that I believe are more substantial in size than if you were to talk to some of the leading bankers in this country, they would tell you -- and there's some of the, have been publicly quoted to say, ""They already have really good pricing from the networks."" And I, therefore, am a little less worried about that. I'm much more interested in providing them with more opportunities for thinking through how to make up their revenue as the next couple of years unfolds. I really believe that that's my role as their partner."

And at this point, we have not repurchased any shares under the program.

And as Martina said, we're on track to meet our 2010 financial objectives, and we remain optimistic for the future to deliver the longer-term financial performance that we first outlined at this recent Investor Meeting in September. 
I believe that we are at the heart of a growth sector. And while we recognize that the industry is changing, we're not going to simply look to see our way through challenges that may arise but are able to convert on the underlying opportunities that they present.
As we reviewed in detail in our Investor Meeting, we believe we have the right growth strategy in place to grow our core business, diversify our customers and geographies and build new businesses in e-Commerce and mobile and other areas. We will partner and invest in innovation that complements our assets, our skills and our position in the payment space. We will be flexible. We will execute this global strategy at a very local level, and this should enable us to continue to deliver strong results. 
And we are building momentum. We have won some good deals and signed some really interesting partnerships across affluent, debit, prepaid, commercial, mobile, e-Commerce. I think all I could say is I look forward to these contributing next year and beyond, along with others still in the pipeline.
