Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining the call today. It's probably a little late in the year for this, but let me wish you all a happy new year and hope 2010 is off to a good start for you all. As we entered 2009, we certainly had some expectations about the environmental circumstances that we would face during the year. With the new administration, we expected some new priorities, although it was difficult at the outset to predict exactly how those new priorities would unfold. Given the work that we do with our customers all around the world, we were absolutely certain that the global security environment had many growing challenges that we needed to face.And like all of you, we watched as the global economy struggled, mindful of the potential pressure that might be applied to our company and certainly, those that might be applied to our suppliers in the form of insufficient liquidity or other impacts that they might face. By about mid-year 2009, we had a pretty good assessment of where the program priority shifts were likely to occur as the new administration made some changes. And several of our programs were terminated, or canceled or capped, some with immediate effect. Now that certainly was a circumstance that we have not seen in prior years.  One that confronted us with some sizable near-term operational and financial challenges that required us to take immediate action to rebalance our portfolio and realign our operations. We did. By strengthening our executive focus on operations and reconstituting the Chief Operating Officer position, by reallocating talent and resources to different parts of the company where we thought they'd be best applied. And by making the difficult, but necessary reductions and consolidations to emerge leaner and in good fighting shape.Even with these additional challenges, we worked to maintain our momentum and our focus and performance in 2009 continued at a high level, achieving record sales, record cash generation, a 20% return on invested capital and achieving our $5 billion segment operating profit goal a year earlier than we had originally planned. Maybe more than anything else, we recognize that we and our customers are facing a new reality as they confront expanding mission requirements and greater fiscal pressure, that's simply not going to go away in the near term.And as the industry leader, we're working now to contain costs, shorten cycle times, improve quality and meet the commitments that we've made by redoubling our focus on operational excellence, which has been a strength of our company with the recognition that we really should see this moment to do a better job. If this sounds a little bit like back to basics, it is just that. Because in our judgment, the best way for us to move forward, to reach our potential and to continue to grow is to increase our focus on the basics of execution because that's what our customers need most from us now. We have very solid fundamentals in this company. We have extraordinary talent and our access to people and ideas is unconstrained. We have resources for investment. We have a creative energy in this company that drives innovation and the competitive spirit that thrives on meeting big challenges and it's a dominant part of our culture, and we have the right long-term view. Our global security strategy is sound. Security needs aren't going away, even with fiscal pressures. They will grow in volume and in diversity.Security here at home and with our trading partners abroad is essential to our economic recovery and growth, to the prosperity of our citizens and to the well-being of many others. Security is so essential that Americans have always invested what was needed, even in times of economic stress and will continue to do so. So while some of our programs and operations were impacted by reprioritization decisions in 2009, our longer-term business prospects have been strongly reinforced. We have commitments to tactical aircraft, airlift, missile defense capabilities and space systems, Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems that lead to situational awareness and the command-and-control systems that allow them to work effectively, seapower through Aegis and Littoral Combat Ship, precision-guided weapons and a variety of other programs, all of which having been strongly supported. We saw evidence of this support in the recently enacted 2010 budget, which solidly funded our programs. I believe we'll also see this support in the 2011 budget, scheduled for release next week, February 1. That budget will likely target some top-line growth and be accompanied by a request for additional overseas contingency operational funds. And I believe we'll see this support sustained throughout the future year defense program and in the Quadrennial Defense Review that's also going to be released next month.With the changes 2009 introduced into our portfolio, we're now in alignment with government priorities and needs. And our back-to-basics approach that emphasizes tight processes that yield predictable results, flexible systems that are adaptable and responsive to the accelerating pace of change and those that can be used by multiple customers and services, will position us well for revenue growth greater than the defense budget, while we drive to meet our goal of expanding our international sales to 20% of our total revenue by 2012. There will be a continuing demand for global security solutions, and that demand will favor those with a proven track record of execution, which has been a hallmark of our success. And we are going to build upon that strength as we drive toward perfect performance.Let me ask Bruce now to give you some further details on 2009. But I would like to come back in a few moments and give you some color on the Joint Strike Fighter before we open the line for your questions. Bruce?"

I'd like to build on Bob's earlier comments regarding our solid performance in 2009 and we've included some charts on our website to help with my discussion. I encourage you to open those charts now and follow along with me as I make my comments.Starting with the fourth quarter sales summary chart, Chart 2. Overall, the corporation grew 13% in the quarter. Three of our four business areas grew at greater than 10% in the quarter. And if you take a look by the individual business areas, the Aeronautics growth was driven by F-35 volume and the C-130 production ramp up. I'll remind you that we had exactly 16 C-130 deliveries in 2009, and we're looking to go to about 26 or so in 2010. Electronic Systems growth was driven by missile defense, tactical missiles and our Simulation and Training business. Move over to Space, Space was driven by a classified satellite delivery in the quarter and also we had a commercial launch where we had no commercial launches in the fourth quarter of 2008.  IS&GS growth was driven mostly by the Defense line of business, with some continued delays on our Civil line of business, lowering the overall growth compared to prior year's fourth quarter. If you now turn to the full-year sales chart, Chart 3. All of our four business areas grew at rates ranging between 4% and 8%. And overall the Corporation grew sales by 6% to a record $45.2 billion.If you now look at Chart 4, you'll see that the quarter's book-to-bill ratio and backlog for each business area. Three of the four business areas had strong bookings with Aeronautics, Electronic Systems and IS&GS, all well above a 1.0 book-to-bill ratio. Space was less than 1.0, but as you saw on the previous chart, it had 28% sales growth in the quarter and this is a business area that typically has orders that sort of come at a lumpy fashion. Significant awards in the quarter included an almost $1 billion order for PAC-3 missile work for the U.S., Taiwan and UAE, 11 C-130Js for the U.S. government and the annual Fleet Ballistic Missile award for around $0.75 billion in space systems. We ended the year with backlog of about $78 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion over third quarter even with the 13% sales growth in the fourth quarter.Turning to Chart 5, cash from operations, 2009 was exceptional for cash generation. It represented our highest total cash generated ever. And it allowed us to make $1.5 billion discretionary contribution into our pension trust. If you recall, during the third quarter, we gave guidance of $3.1 billion of operating cash and assumed a $1 billion pension funding. What we actually did was contribute $1.5 billion of pension funding and yet our operating cash grew from the $3.1 billion to the $3.2 billion level, so a $600 million improvement. We ended the year with $2.7 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet. And I'll close on this chart by saying we're very pleased with this cash performance that allowed us to continue cash deployment practices while making significant contributions to employee pension trust.If you now move to Chart 6, our share repurchases summary. I thought this was an interesting chart in that it shows net share count reduction rather than total share repurchases over time. And what you see is 2009 is the largest year for net share reduction at 5% of shares outstanding. It also shows an impressive record of share reduction since 2005, increasing every year, and total reductions of 15% of shares outstanding in 2005. Updated guidance for share repurchase in 2010 includes $1 billion for repurchases, and I'll remind you that we have 29 million shares in our repurchase at authorization remaining at the end of 2009.If you now look at Chart 7, we'll take a look at earnings per share. The left-hand side of the chart shows our quarter-over-quarter performance for the fourth quarter of 2009 versus the fourth quarter of 2008. The right-hand side of the chart shows the same performance on an annual basis. The quarter had strong EPS growth of 6% but if you adjust for the FAS/CAS impact, the resulting growth is a very strong 18%. On an annual basis, year-over-year GAAP EPS actually dropped by 1%. But I'll remind you that the FAS/CAS change between 2009 and 2008 was almost a $1 swing in earnings per share. Eliminating FAS/CAS, annual EPS grew by 11% to $8.54 per share.Now looking at our guidance change charts beginning with Chart 8, the FAS/CAS pension summary. This reconciles our October guidance with the current guidance. We had a robust 20% return on asset performance in 2009. This greatly outperformed the 8 1/2% assumption in the guidance we provided in October, and it more than offset the 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate at year-end. For information purposes, the final rate at year-end was five and seven-eighths versus the prior year at six and an eight. Lastly, an additional $500 million pension contribution benefited FAS/CAS in 2010 by some $40 million or so. Net of all these changes, 2010 EBIT is about $55 million higher due to reduced FAS/CAS adjustment.Finally, if you'll turn to Chart 9, we'll reconcile the revised 2010 EPS guidance with our October numbers, starting with the October guidance of $7.05 to $7.25 per share. Our reduced share count with the $1 billion included in current guidance increased EPS by $0.15. The reduced FAS pension expense or the $55 million improvement from the previous stage added an additional $0.10, and then the higher interest expense from the additional $1.5 billion of debt we acquired in the fourth quarter reduced EPS by $0.15. So all told, that adds $0.10 to our new guidance of $7.15 to $7.35 per share. With that, Bob will continue with his remarks."

I do want to take a few minutes to update you on the F-35 as there's been much activity and even more speculation about this program. And I want to cover four subjects with you today.Whether the airplane is needed, whether we have",1977,"Thanks very much, Bruce. I do want to take a few minutes to update you on the F-35 as there's been much activity and even more speculation about this program. And I want to cover four subjects with you today.Whether the airplane is needed, whether we have the right approach and by that I mean, whether we're going about this the right way, whether we're emphasizing the right things, how have we been doing on the program to date and importantly, where are we likely to be going in the future. Let's start with the need for the airplane, which has been repeatedly validated and reinforced by the Department of Defense and will again be validated in the 2011 budget submission and in the Quadrennial Defense Review. Here's why.Airpower is key to a broad range of security challenges and missions. That's been true historically, it is true today and it will certainly be true for missions in the future. The aircraft in service today that are meeting these responsibilities are aging because the operational tempo has remained very high. So recapitalization of the tactical aircraft fleet is a very high priority. The proliferation of anti-aircraft radar and missile systems continues, and this is an area we probably don't highlight or talk a lot about. But the sophistication of these systems does create a real threat for tactical aircraft and this threat highlights the value of fifth-generation stealth capabilities embedded in the F-35. And the F-35's ability to penetrate denied airspace is superior. So the F-35 is a high priority because it fills a very critical need.Next, there's the approach we've been taking on the program, which directly aligns with Secretary Gates' principles for guiding what the Department of Defense will buy and what it will not buy. The Secretary wants to use proven technologies. All the technologies on the F-35 are mature. They are modern and they are the best in class and all have been demonstrated. The lift fan works. The lower observability on the airplane is effective. The data links and advanced communications provide unprecedented situational awareness.Secretary Gates also wants to find programs that offer joint service solutions, and the F-35 is the model joint program by design from day one. And performance of the airplane has not been compromised to achieve a level of jointness. In fact, the jointness of the F-35 extends beyond the three U.S. services that will use the airplane, the Air Force, the Navy and the Marine Corps and includes partner countries. So when you think about our overall U.S. security policy on a large front, an essential element of that policy has been to build partner capacity so that we can act with partners together on missions where we have shared values and shared outcomes and that requires interoperability. Not just in the performance of the airplane but in sustainment and support and the Joint Strike Fighter offers all those features.The Secretary wants the ability to incorporate combat experience into the systems and platforms. In other words, be able to adapt and update the system quickly. The architecture of the Joint Strike Fighter is designed to get more information to more people sooner. It has ISR capability built in. It has communications capability built in. It has the flexibility to adapt realtime to mission situations as they unfold. The Secretary has repeatedly said that we should not buy overly exquisite or unique solutions or ones where the costs or other factors will result in our ability to only buy limited quantities. Well we just had this policy debate with the F-22 and F-35 acquisition decisions. Where the F-22 was capped in production at 187 aircraft while there was a full purchase commitment for the full complement of F-35s. And When I look at the volume, the U.S. government is likely to buy along with the volume that foreign buyers are interested in procuring. That number is likely greater than 3,000 airplanes.We think the principles that the Secretary has laid out are spot on, given the circumstances that we together are facing. And our acquisition approach on the F-35 is in complete alignment with the acquisition principles in the department guiding what it will buy. With a validated need and the right acquisition approach, the question is how have we been doing. The short version of this assessment is that we've made great progress in some areas and not as much progress as we had planned in others. We know that the aircraft design is sound. Structural load tests are providing really good information. We know that propulsion systems generate sufficient thrust and that's critical in the case of the STOVL airplane because we won't have any airspeed and that thrust converts completely to lift. In fact, the propulsion system that's on the airplane today is performing at a level superior to the prior engine that enabled us to already fly an earlier version not only in the STOVL configuration but perform at a supersonic level in the same flight, in the same mission. So the engine performance seems to be more than satisfactory. We know that the signature on the airplane is effective and as we've tested the airplane so far, there are no significant or critical design issues. We're coding software today. That software coding is about 80% complete. The stability and reliability of the software is better than we have found it to be in predecessor aircraft. But I think we all recognize there is more software work to go.We're now delivering airplanes off our production line, and flowing those aircraft into the flight test program. 15 of 19 development jets have been delivered, but we are behind in the projection that we made in 2005 relative to aircraft deliveries. And that scheduled deficiency is about six months or so. And that's caused a shortfall in the overall flight test program. But we have received some very positive data from the tests that we have flown in the flight test program, showing excellent aircraft maturity and airplanes that require minimal adjustment or corrective actions after they land. There have been independent assessments of our ability to produce the airplane. One has been the independent manufacturing review team, and that assessment has confirmed the readiness of the production line and our supply chain to continue ramping up the production quantities. And our early learning curve data looks good. That early data is important because of the affordability goal on the aircraft.So today, we're at a critical juncture in the program, the transition from development to production. And this is a high-consequence intersection. It's essential to make good decisions now because this is the point of maximum leverage that will determine the success of the program as we look to the future. And that success will be measured by flowing mission-capable, high-quality jets into operations as quickly as possible at the lowest possible cost with the least amount of risks. And risk here is an important concept. There is complete agreement between our company and the government that we must focus all energy on this critical program. The only question is based on progress to date, based on all that has been achieved and that which has not been achieved, based on all that we have learned and respecting all that we and others know about the development, the testing and the production challenges that are associated with airplanes, what adaptations and what investments should we make now to assure success. We're answering this question even as we speak and I mean literally, in realtime, in ongoing discussions with the Department of Defense.In our discussions, there are different views about risks, different assumptions, different estimates, different projections. Some brought forward by us, some brought forward by the joint estimating team from the Department of Defense, some from the cost analysis and performance evaluation group, some from the test community, some from the services, some come from other resources. This is an entirely healthy process. I've worked with each of these organizations and I've worked with the people who lead and work in these organization, and I can tell you they are professional. They have subject-matter expertise. Their intentions are good and we all have exactly the same goal, recognizing that the Joint Strike Fighter is critical and needed. What do we need to do to assure the success of the program?I know we're still finalizing this approach in our discussions but I thought I'd try to give you my best sense in broad strokes as to the course of action we're pursuing. We all agree that we need stable funding, and I believe that we will see stable funding as we move forward. We all agree that we should invest more resources in the development program to help reduce risk. That means more resources probably in the software development area, probably in the test program, maybe more test assets and more resources there. In conjunction with the discussions that we've had about increased investment, I was asked directly if I would consider converting some of the unearned award fee in the development phase to partly cover the cost of these investments. And I said that I would, because I believe it's absolutely the right thing to do to assure the success of the program. We discussed the production ramp rate. And we want to strike a balance here that recognizes the delivery pressure to date, respects the content of the jet analysis and other views, includes prudent risk management provisions. But also one that promotes an efficient acceleration of volume that supports overall affordability and force structure goals.One innovative approach that's been brought forward would be to set a more conservative lower limit to the program ramp rate based on the jet estimate, with a provision to buy more aircraft if performance on the program warrants the acquisition of more airplanes. Let me try to give you an example here. In the FY '11 budget, that would mean setting a lower limit for production of 42 airplanes that compares to the prior year's 32 airplanes, but setting a target of say, 48 aircraft, if performance and progress continues on the program. In that flexible approach, there's a recognition of risk but also the important incentive and expectation that our government team and our industry team need to try to do better job here. Also discussed in our conversations has been the use of fixed price contracting. If the requirements are stable, and if progress continues on the program, we would certainly consider accelerating the use of a fixed-priced incentive type contract by one full year, from Lot 6 to Lot 5. I want to create the conditions on this program where we can use fixed-price contracts. I want to get the Joint Strike Fighter under a fixed-price contracting methodology. I want to test this airplane thoroughly. I want to have a successful development program. And I want to transition to production and build production volume over time because it's critical that we get these jets into service.I think it's also appropriate for me to take a moment and thank the Secretary of Defense, Deputy Secretary Lynn and Undersecretary of Defense, Ash Carter. For the time that they've invested in the discussions associated with this program, which has been significant, for their professionalism, which has been complete, for a willingness to think creatively and innovatively about new and flexible ways to assure success which they are doing, for their willingness to assign the F-35 the high priority that I and others believe it deserves, and for their commitment to the program and for their continuing the investment stream that the program needs as we move forward.So Boe, I appreciate the time to offer those comments, but why don't we go now to the lines and check in with the callers."

I don't know that I would accept, although I appreciate your comments, I wouldn't accept the notion of an adversarial relationship. Let me tell you what I do see here. We believe, strongly and profoundly, in our ability to deliver this airplane. I don't want this to sound arrogant or filled with hubris. We've built a lot of airplanes. We've actually compiled in our company all the experience that we've had even reaching back the programs like the SR-71, F-117, F-16, F-22, now leading to the Joint Strike Fighter. We care deeply, we care passionately about the commitments that we make. And we are going to deliver this airplane. There are those in the government who have reviewed lots of airplane programs over time. They are smart, they are dedicated, and I think they are equally passionate about their convictions. It is a good thing to bring people together, provided that we share the same set of objectives and outcomes, and I assure you we do. This nation needs to recapitalize the TACAIR fleet. So there has been some energetic discussion that might, from time to time, appear to be contentious because of the strength of the beliefs. But what we've accomplished together over these last weeks and months and these ensuing discussions is a recognition that we're going to drive to a position of accommodation that will stop arguing the relative merits of individual points, and what we'll do is assemble a group of collective points that will create the architecture upon which a successful program will be built. That means that we will go to a more conservative profile on the program because more conservatism here will reduce some of the risks moving forward. As I said, we'll keep the same level of funding but we'll reallocate that funding slightly, moving some additional money into development to assure we're doing the right things in software development, the right things in test and I assure you, Doug, I'm open-minded about any other suggestion that would be on the table as to how to get this program right. But we'll sustain a production ramp rate in this case, a floor of 42 and create the flexibility in the approach to look at the prospect of increasing that ramp rate over time, which I think is a wonderful approach to meeting both the near-term apprehension that has been brought forward in good faith, recognizing where we've done well and we're we've had challenges on the program, but also putting the program on the correct posture. So I think there's an increasing and positive convergence of the views here. And again, I credit people like Secretary Ash Carter and others who have, as you probably know, have worked with us in some cases after long weeks of working in other mission areas that they concentrate on in the Pentagon working through the weekends with us to get this right, so it's very much appreciated. And I don't think you'll see a high-level of, in your phrase, adversarial behavior, as much as you'll see cooperative behavior when we reestablish the kind of production ramp rate development baseline that we all agree upon is necessary for successful program."

There have been occasions where we could have put a jet into the flight test program earlier, but we deliberately did not. And of course, we don't take that action without fully discussing the merits of the action with our government customer. The reason we wouldn't put a jet into the flight test program would be a circumstance where we would know there's going to be a change made to that program, maybe an update to the software, maybe an update to the configuration. And it is part of the ordinary ebb and flow of any development program for systems like this. And therefore, we would not have the asset in place, we would not be able to fly a test mission and the arithmetic scoring of that would say, ""You were supposed to fly test mission, you didn't, you're down one, you're down two."" And all of that arithmetic is fair game. But we believe that we're, in the long term, optimizing the overall flight test profile, because with the software upgrade, the airplane will fly a more proficient test program. There is a risk that if you know there's an update necessary and you don't put it into the airplane, then you'll have to re-fly the sortie, doubling the number of tests then delaying the test program, you just pushed that delay farther out in time where it's actually less rather than greater to the advantage of the program. In that fashion, we and the Joint Program Office and our government customers have been thinking about how you optimize the quality of the flight test program, have it thorough and make sure you're testing the right things in the right sequence. I think one of the issues that arises is, when we watch the day-to-day sausage making, and I will certainly say this about this program, there will never be a program that's living life in HD more than the Joint Strike Fighter. There is a huge microscope on this program. Everything that we do is examined in such incredible granular detail in every way, because it's a transparent program. In one sense, it's a reflection of goodness. But then, it induces a lot of discussion of, ""Oh my God, you found this issue in the software development."" Or there's this issue in the test program, or there's a structural modification necessary, I don't again say this in any arrogant way in the lifespan and experience of building airplanes and complex system, this is not extraordinary. It is not a crisis. The sky is not falling. But when we're subjected to accounts or some views of this and certainly, I think there's some of the views that you're subjected to, it founds at least alarming if not downright catastrophic. It is not. And one way to measure this, Peter, is there has not been a dime of funding taken off this program. The funding's been strongly supported by the department. The program has been strongly reinforced by the department. I would submit to you objectively there is enough evidence out there including a couple of our programs that if the leadership of the Pentagon feels that the system is not needed, or that the approach is unwarranted, or that the execution is at a point where there's real question about the ability the system to perform, they terminate the program. And there's a recent history of program terminations and program cancellations and program restructurings that don't have the support and don't have the funding. And I think we're seeing the exact opposite here. There's a great deal of support on the part of the government. It is what brings to the forefront this energetic discussion that Doug on the prior question called adversarial, but I think it's more energetic and contentious at times, but with the intention of being constructively contentious. So I look at the process here and say we're making good progress. There is a concern about risks. What we want to do with the government, and as I mentioned, the discussions are ongoing, so we're a little limited today, but we won't be limited for very long, we will get a program plan that the entire test community, all the services, the Joint Program Office and the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition agree is the right program, we will have milestones, we will have inch stones for measurement, we will share those milestones with you, and we will score our accomplishments objectively, accurately, carefully and transparently, and we'll be able to measure the progress on the program as we go forward. And I expect to do that and I want to do that, because I think that creates the circumstance where people know there's real value in this airplane, we're making real progress in this airplane, all the things that we believe about the potential of the airplane are, in fact, true and can be made to become real and have these airplanes get into operational service. And that's exactly what we're doing in the process that I've described."

I mean, first of all, the discussions that we've been having with building about acquisition reform really have been mature and adult, and I mean that. For example, I think sometimes sources report in a discussion of our fixed-price contracting, uh-oh, every contract now, irrespective of maturity, irrespective of risks, is going to be required to be assumed by contractors on a firm fixed-price basis. That's not at all the discussion that we've had with any body in the Pentagon. There is no view on their part that one size fits all. There is a very clear appreciation that there are technology readiness levels, there are degrees of complexity in systems, there's the maturity of capabilities. And what we've all agreed to do is to have a constructive discussion that seeks to identify, almost on a case-by-case basis, when a system or program will have the maturity and have the characteristics where fixed price contracting methodology can be applied. I must tell you, Ron, I'm all for that. I like the stability and the visibility and the confidence you have in an environment where requirements are stable and funding is stable, and bring the game into Lockheed Martin, make this our responsibility. Because I think we play a very good game when we have good definition like that, and I like all features of it as do they. We have not been asked to undertake a contract type in any of our program areas, and I'm talking well beyond the F-35 here. And where we have taken fixed-price contracts like in the case of the Littoral Combat Ship, we'd already built one, we'd already understood it. The configuration was frozen, the requirements were set, and that's exactly the kind of environment would expect to see here. There haven't been any other discussions about I think the general elements that you would include in the definition of acquisition reform that have found their way into our Joint Strike Fighter discussions. You would all on the call, and you particularly, Ron, I think would feel very comfortable in these discussions, because we're doing just what you do. We ask what were you supposed to have accomplished? What did you accomplish? How do you value and measure that? And knowing if we're validating the need and validating the approach, and again, the approach of the program couldn't be more consistent with Department of Defense guidelines as to the kind of things the department ought to be investing in. If there's good faith effort by people who know how to build airplanes, if the supply chain is cycling, if the industrial base is performing but not at a level that assuages all the angst about the risk, then what's an appropriate level of risks to incorporate into the program? One element that has arisen is associated with the most recent Acquisition Reform Act. Because that Act that was a careful deliberation by the Congress directed the Department of Defense to load programs into baselines at a more conservative level. And I think I understand the reason for wanting to do that. The discussions were involved and now say let's agree on what that conservative level ought to be and why, what's expected of the government teams and what's expected of us, but let's also see if we can craft some flexibility in the model. So if the performance is better than the conservative assumptions in that baseline, the taxpayers and the services and the people who use and support the airplanes can get the benefit of that. Because we ought to be able to build more airplanes for the same amount of money if less-than-conservative assumptions can be met. We're managers. We're leaders. We want to change the circumstances so that the outcomes that would be associated with the conservative principles aren't the ones that occur. We want to put energy into this, we want to put our experience into it. And our government customers want us to do that, too. So I think we're now working through after, as Bruce mentioned in his comments, after setting the baseline five years ago with puts and takes against performance, we're going to get this realigned, we're going to continue to invest the resources in it. The government is and we are, our talent, our energy and our experience, and we're going to drive to a set of successful outcomes. Going from 32 airplanes to 42 airplanes it's not a bad lift from lot to lot. We'd like to do more than that because we think that will meet mission responsibility sooner."

And that means encouraging every aspect of this business that had a really superb operational and performance year in 2009 to absolutely continue that beat in an interrupted way.

I think one of the observations I've had, Joe, and I think it's embedded in your question about why did you move faster? Why didn't you see more clearly? My sense is, it's just a little harder to look forward in a Services business where there is a not that level of visibility or the uncertainty sort of builds faster sooner. And you have to make some assumptions about how you will perform internally and how markets perform externally, and that was a good lesson I think for me and us to see.

I think we've made real good strides there. And as far as the confidence in 2010 -- as I look at 2010, there is much less reliance on large awards where we need to unseat incumbents as compared to what we did in 2009, and that's allowed for the opportunity for protest in 2009 as well. So we look at 2010, first off, there are fewer large competitions in general and secondly, where there are, in fact, competitions, we tend to be the incumbent. So assuming we do windows contracts, protest by the losing competitor would not reduce the revenue because of our incumbency. And you mentioned the margin, we do have a slight margin improvement year-over-year in IS&GS, and I think that's within our ability to perform at that level."

And I'll use two positions that'll maybe contrast this although they are more than two. The Joint Estimating Team has done a careful analysis of the development of lots of aircraft programs. And they make a set of assumptions here about the things that can go wrong and might go wrong, and it's all a probability assessment. And we do the same thing and others do that. I think we don't have the same conclusion when we look at where we are on the program today and, of course, we're compelled here to look five to ten years out about the kind of things that would happen. We don't have the same conclusions. The Joint Program Office has a set of conclusions that are slightly different than ours, let's say, more time and more cost and let me just assume more risks. And then the Joint Estimating Team even more -- a sense of more risks and more exposure than the Joint Program Office. So we're all talking about essentially the same test program. The question is, what would be the right number of test assets to put into test program? How many fliers do you need to fly cards that have test points that it would allow us to test how many test points before you know, with confidence, the airplane will always do what you want it to do? I'll set up some purely theoretical boundaries. You can't test everything that an airplane can do because you'll test the airplane forever. Now that's not one of the proposals on the table, but it sets the upper bound. So if you're not going to test everything in perpetuity, what are you going to test and when are you going to test it? There are different views about that. There are different views about how much that costs and how much incremental value you might get from a new series of tests to learn what information. As I said, this is not unhealthy. When you bring subject-matter experts together who care, who have deep knowledge, who understand what's going on here, it may take some time to get agreement but you will get agreement, and that's what we're driving for. They're absolutely well-intentioned. We want to test this airplane. We're not going to be associated with a system that doesn't work. I personally believe the F-35 is going to find its way into the panoply of truly great airplanes, truly great airplanes. I think in the future when we look back at this program, we'll all be enormously proud of the work that we have done here. But to get to that point, we've got to do the right things now. I think we saw little microcosms at some of these discussions say on a system like JASSM. We had a reliability challenge on JASSM. Some, and I know you were exposed to some reports of this would suggest maybe in a very alarming way,' this will never work. The program is out of control. It can't be recovered. We didn't have that belief and I hope, Joe, I can convey to you, we don't have that belief because we think we just know better. We didn't have that belief because we're steep into the details of the program, we have terrific subject-matter experts here, we have everything a company would need to do a great job in a technology program like this, and we said we can bring this forward if we can understand the phenomenology, if we can do the analysis, if we can get to the root cause, we can improve this system and here's our new prediction for how it will perform. And on the JASSM case, that worked out well and we work with our customer. It wasn't necessary at every intersect straight and level and smooth, but we got the job done. And I'm absolutely confident we're going to get the job done on the Joint Strike Fighter. I'm confident that the intentions of all the parties are very good. That's been expressed to me in many ways. And that's what we're getting agreement on now. And because the program has three U.S. service variants and it had international content, the field to play is bigger, but essentially that's the process we're on."

When we talked to you in October we thought it was more likely to happen in the 2010 timeframe, it turns out it happened sooner than that, it happened very successfully. So that event was close to a $400 million item in and out itself. On top of that, as I mentioned we have one commercial launch vehicle that went off in the fourth quarter. We have zero commercial launch vehicles in 2010 plan. So if you just take a look at that delta for those two particular items, we're down $500 million for two events that are likely not to occur again in 2010.  Helping to offset that in 2010 frankly is, we're seeing some growth in our advanced VHF, extreme high frequency satellite and some -- as well as the -- some classified space activities on 2010.

It doesn't ever work well for the business. It doesn't serve long-term interest. We don't want to find ourselves ever, and I'll use this is as a hypothetical position where we would build a precision guided system and fly it down the range then we on the other side would be the ones to evaluate the performance of that. That's unhealthy. We know that, we avoid that. That is the kind of conflict of interest that we would avoid. Whether any areas of sensitivity in the work that our company does, we set up firewalls and there are, I think time tested means and mechanisms here that work really effectively for this kind of discussion.  What our company and I think, I could say this, what the industry has asked for is could we get some clarification and some guidance out of the Department of Defense relative to what the rules of engagement here will be? What activities here would be prohibited, what kinds of businesses, what kinds of initiatives, what kinds of pass coders and then we'll go structure our business accordingly, because we are going to play by the rules. We just want to make sure we understand what those rules are. So there is no intention or expectation on our part at the moment to divest any segment of our business if we learn something when the draft guidance is released and my best recollection of the timeline, Heidi, would be probably some time, let me say in February, we're likely to get some draft guidance outlines here for what a conflict of interest policy would look like.

The independent manufacturing review team concluded that we would be in a position to produce about 48 airplanes in that fiscal '11 time period. So when I look at the near term objectives for our desire to improve the ramp rate, I look at that floor moving from 32 airplanes to 42 airplanes on the conservative side and our sense that if we can do better we'd like to go to 48, 48 resides within the range of effective production capability that the line possess now in accordance with the manufacturing review teams of assessment. What they also look at is that think about five year to 10 year out, how do you get to higher rates of production and we're working on those initiatives along with the government."

We've obviously break project constellation down into its component pieces. The spacecraft component, which is our responsibility and the Launch Vehicle segment of the program, which is not our responsibility. On the Orion program, which has to do with the spacecraft, we're doing well, I mean we're executing a program plan, we're accelerating the design, we're testing components and configurations about design. We note that on the Spacecraft side, we've incorporated the flexibility in the spacecraft for, let me say a broader range of missions. And by that, I mean, the spacecraft is configured to be very effective for transit to low earth orbit, as well as in a slightly different configuration being able to complete a lunar mission and even with more adaptations being sufficiently flexible to look at a beyond lunar mission say to Mars. But those are all based on aspirational goals. So if in the ensuing dialogue that you and we and others are looking forward to as to how will the vision for human space flight be altered if it's to be altered, and if that vision were to contract the profile of human space flight moving back from Mars to the moon or pushing the lunar mission off in time, this spacecraft we're working on still has the flexibility to meet the responsibilities of the low earth orbit mission. So in our human space flight portfolio, of course, we focus on flying off the shuttle, which we are doing and we're just head down and focus on assuring we're meeting the criteria associated with the Spacecraft segment. And when we know more, again, we'll be able to update you without any delay, and I guess the only other thing I would add is there was a panel that was commissioned by the administration to look at the human space flight area. They've made some recommendations, but those recommendations have not been incorporated into a new vision or a new program plan and I presume that's part of what the ongoing process is now."

It's not from of fixed price. It would be a year out. I don't want to commence the negotiations with you now on the telephone about points of total assumptions and share lines. We're very facile and familiar with the characteristics of the fixed price incentive contracting methodology. But part of that share line and direct answer to your question, and part of these terms and conditions features will be exactly based on how much we do know. Did we achieve requirement stability? Did we make the progress that we thought we made? When you think of us trying to align the risk profile that we'll undertake with shareholder interest, so I would submit to you that we've made those decisions before. We've been asked to take a fixed-price contract once upon a time. Earlier on in the Littoral Combat Ship program, we did not, we felt we could not even though that was a great desire on our part, quite obviously to get alignment with the customer on a critical mission area that we know today is critical and we believe them to be critical. We could not find the pathway to meet an expectation about a contract type given the nature of the uncertainty that we proceed in that business. That's the standard that we're going to maintain. But I assure you Cai we are not being cold pressured to go do anything. There is a discussion that encourages the government and the industry to work hard on securing the conditions around fixed -- around when fixed-price contracts can be used sooner rather than later. But that is not a mandatory, you must to do this and I think quite honestly, I know I don't speak for everyone in the industry but having come off a year in 2009 when I was Chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association, the general sentiment of the members, but I think is very well understood by the leaders in the Pentagon and the administration is that it is unwise to pay contracts of a fixed-price nature before the environment warrants that. And I would submit to you that fixed price contract didn't work, the key to program success, I guess we would conclude that the A400M is the most successful airplane program in development today. I for one, cannot make that conclusion. So we'll be very prudent. We will keep our risk profile align with that of our shareholders and we will certainly do all we can do to work with our government customers to secure the conditions around which fixed price contracting makes sense."

It has been a key focus area on every program not just our airplane program portfolio, but every program and I would tell you honestly it's a key area in the business of every company that does this. We recognize it, the government recognizes it, and that's why in the development phase of this program, we're talking about putting more software development resources in place to simply assure that if we're running a software load test -- and there were features that were found in that load that required a quick turn around of what are called trouble reports and so forth, we would be able to do that in an expeditious fashion that we would have a system integration lab that would have the capacity in parallel, do multiple tests, because we all know our goal is to accelerate the pace of the program.

And I will say the one thing that I would like to point out just, maybe I'll just go around the business areas here but let's talk about 2010 facing and maybe first quarter specifically, because I think its important that we do",666,"Think of it, mid-5s level. And I will say the one thing that I would like to point out just, maybe I'll just go around the business areas here but let's talk about 2010 facing and maybe first quarter specifically, because I think its important that we do talk that. We're probably going to see a slower ramp to the year in terms of both sales and earnings than maybe our history would suggest and there are several reasons for that and really they hit each of the business areas. So if I start with Aeronautics, we talked about the ramp rate increase on the C-130 program from some 16 to some 26 or so probably a 60% increase in there. Because a lot of these aircraft in 2010 are for first time buyers and a number of them are requiring a special mission packages that go along with the aircraft for these first time buyers, we'll think of this and roll in the aircraft out early and then we'll kind of go into a mission-mod package post production if you will. Such that the actual deliveries of those aircraft will be later in the year than our actual production rate. So you should think of that as the back half of the year being much more heavily loaded with C-130s than the first half and when I say much more heavily, I'm talking 25% of the deliveries in the first half of the year maybe 30% and 70% to 75% deliveries in the second half and again that's just phenomena as a first time buyers and the special packages there going on this particular aircraft.  If I look at space, I think earnings there are also going to be back loaded, particularly due to the equity earnings on the ULA, United Launch Alliance, United Space Alliance joint ventures. I expect to have a very large fourth quarter from an earnings perspective, primarily associated with the United Space Alliance operation and as the shuttle operations come to a close at the end of 2010. So fourth quarter is going to be an earnings spike compared to the rest of year in space. Electronic system, if I just compare that to the first half of 2009. First half of 2009 has the Presidential Helicopter in it and we don't that obviously in 2010. So we're going to have a slower compare to the first half of 2010 for that event. If you just take a look at the 2000 plan in general, I think there are more deliveries or program event from the second half -- than in the first half of the year. And then if I go to IS&GS, it's somewhat similar to the other business areas and if there's probably more back end loaded in the second half than there's in the first half. Also in particular earnings will be light in the first quarter of IS&GS. At least -- I think that will be lighter than the overall margin level in 2009. And this is because of the phasing, again this is a business story that has quite the largest portion of it's overall earnings in the form of a award fees and as we look at the award fee plan in 2010 it is pushed further to the right that it has been historically. Another, I'll call margin improvement opportunities for pragmatic events tend to also be shifted to the right as well. So that first quarter, we think its going to be a little lighter than the rest of the year and overall, just looking at the bottom line of the first quarter and comparing that to what you might expect versus the comparison of 2009, I think we're going to see sales growth and the 1, 2% range compared to last year, I think it's going to be the lowest margin quarter for the year and probably somewhere in the mid-10s could be my outlook as I said earlier today."

But if you just take our performance at the end of 2009 and you assume going forward similar levels of asset returns as we promised in the past the 8.5% return, and we hold the discount rates flat at the current five and seven/eighth. I think I said on the third quarter call that we thought we'd see a fairly significant FAS/CAS increase compared to 2010. It's still fairly significant, but it's lower than it was and you might think of it and kind of the couple of $100 million higher than the FAS/CAS impact in 2010 and you didn't ask it, but I'll throw out 2012 as well since I mentioned that on the third quarter call as well. 2012 kind of current course and speed again 8.5% discount rate or it's going to be 8% return on assets and flat discount rate would actually turn break even or actually a slight income might enforce in 2012."

I hope you had an opportunity to read our earnings release and take a look at our updated guidance. Overall in the quarter our operational tempo and our execution were strong.
Quality levels were good and each business area achieved expected results. In the United States since we last spoke, several events have occurred. The President proposed the defense budget for 2011 at $549 billion which was 3% over 2010 budget levels. 
When we look out over the longer-term the future year defense program, that’s the projection that looks out over a five year horizon, maintains an overall 3% growth projection for DoD and then finally the Quadrennial Defense Review, that more strategically oriented document, was also completed and released and the priorities outlined in the QDR provide a solid level of support for a number of our lines of business and our programs, including the F-35 joint strike fighter for the fleet replacement aircraft, our THAAD, PAC-3, and Aegis systems, for mobile and sea based missile defense, the advanced DHF satellite for space command control communications, and the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance mission the communication supports, and our Littoral combat ship for advanced surface naval combatants. 
Clearly our customers continue to address the dual demand of expanding missions and fiscal pressures and we’re working hard to support them by meeting our commitments, to shorten our cycle times, to overall reduce our costs and focus more on affordability. 
Internationally we see the opportunity horizon expanding with demand aligning well with our product portfolio. And we were pleased with the international awards we saw in the first quarter that included 20 new F-16 aircraft for Egypt, two new C-130J airlifters for Tunisia, Sniper and Lantern targeting systems for Turkey, and a 10 year logistic support contract for New Zealand’s defense forces.
Last year we increased our goal for international revenue such that we’d generate 20% of total revenue from our international business and we’re on track to achieve that goal by 2012, and yesterday we were pleased to see a renewed call for export control reform that was brought forward by Secretary Gates. 
Let me turn to our operations for a moment where I think we had a solid quarter and we met some key objectives in each business area. In aeronautics Ralph Heath and the aeronautics team maintained overall a good operational tempo. And there are three areas that warrant greater discussion. 
The F-35 is getting lots of extra attention, as a result of the restructuring process that addresses risk and positions the program for success and working through the Nunn-McCurdy recertification process. And I think here there may be some confusion about how the restructuring of the program and the Nunn-McCurdy recertification process align.
They are both really borne out of the same fundamental assessment of the program that evaluated our ability to execute and included a variety of estimates of risk factors that could effect the program. The restructuring was initiated to reduce the overall risk of the program in order to facilitate the Nunn-McCurdy recertification. 
When we look at the restructuring segment you’d see a 13 month extension to the system design and development phase of the program while adding $2.8 billion in funding, expanding the resources available on the program to reduce risk by adding software labs or adding resources to the flight test program, very specifically the addition of one United States Navy carrier version of the aircraft to improve our overall ability to turn around test flights.
You’ll see the addition of an additional low rate initial production contract that we refer to as LRIP No. 9. We’ve had a re phasing of the production ramp while incorporating some buy to budget flexibility that means if our program performance is on track there will be an opportunity to add airplanes to the ramp rate, and then revising the program milestones.
The Nunn-McCurdy recertification is led by the Department of Defense, specifically headed by Dr. Ash Carter, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, and we play a supporting role in that process. I think that mechanism has been kicked off, there are five evaluation criteria that have to satisfied, and we believe that process will successfully conclude probably in the June timeframe. 
On the F-35 we’re focused on execution and know we need to improve our performance. And a key objective for us will be to build momentum in the program. That’s momentum as we work to finalize the tasks in the development phase of the program, momentum as we efficiently accelerate the production ramp up of the program, and importantly to build on the accomplishments that are being achieved in the test program.
In that test program two flight tests were particularly meaningful to us, the achievement of the short takeoff and vertical landing of the STOVL aircraft where we were able to measure the behavioral characteristics of the airplane, power, lift, control, stability, all of which were excellent and I think all that observed the test were very pleased with those results.
And the first flight of the mission systems equipped F-35, which happened on April 7th, which demonstrated an avionics capability that no other fighter has demonstrated. So we’re going to continue to focus additional resources on execution and we’ll continue to strengthen the team on the F-35.
In aeronautics we’re also building volume on the C-130J production program. We’ve commented to you over time our desire to expand this phase of the program building on our 16 aircraft delivered last year to 26 airplanes delivered this year. I think we’ve noted that those deliveries are likely to be phased toward the second half of the year but overall demand for the airplane looks very solid and the performance of the aircraft has been really superior. 
Also in aeronautics we’ve been modernizing the C-5 Galaxy aircraft, this is the very heavy lift segment of our US lift component. And putting new engines and essentially new cockpits and new avionics in the aircraft. This program has successfully passed a very rigorous operational test and evaluation set of criteria and has now been certified as effective and mission capable. 
We’ve delivered three of these airplanes to the United States Air Force and the current plans call for us to deliver 52 fully modernized C-5’s by 2016. Its my sense that if we continue to show real value here, real excellence and execution in performance, and if the demands on US airlift continue, there may be opportunities to talk about expanding that number in the future, but here again we’re very much focused on executing the current program of record.
[Marilyn Houston] and her electronics team continue excellent operational performance across the portfolio and I think the Littoral combat ship deserves special mention. Our first Littoral combat ship, the USS Freedom was deployed by the Navy this quarter and it was deployed two years ahead of schedule, and I think the Navy is very proud of that accomplishment and I can certainly tell you that we and our LCS team are very proud of our ability to shorten cycle times which has been a key objective of our company and in alignment with the objectives of our customers. 
In operations the ship’s already intercepted four drug smuggling ships and I think the crew of the Freedom is demonstrating superior performance in their prosecution of important missions. Our second ship, the Fort Worth, is more than 30% complete and is on its planned schedule and cost profiles. 
We’ve submitted our bid for the next 10 ship buy that would result if we were successful in prevailing in the competition to an initial award of two ships and options for eight further ships and the Navy’s decision as to selecting the winning design for the overall 55 ship fleet will probably be undertaken in the third quarter, so we’ll keep you posted and look forward to that. 
I don’t want to play true, the demands we have and focusing on competing for and winning, the instant contract with the United States Navy but I would note one of our objectives has been to try to look to aggregate demand for systems that have solid baselines that are flexible and extensible for a variety of customers and this includes bringing in international customers into baseline programs because the benefits are really quite manifest, very good for US customers because it lowers the cost of every ship the US buys, its very good for the international customers because it has the same cost advantage and its good for us because we have a broader more stable program that let’s us integrate the global supply chain more effectively, get higher quality, and really drive value for everyone.
And so I am pleased that given the nature of the design of our ship, its performance in an operational environment, the steel semi plaining, mono hull design, all of which appeal strongly to a variety of international customers, so as you might expect we’re very focused on assuring we present good value to the United States Navy in our bid. 
Moving to information systems and global services, Linda Gooden and IS&GS team have also achieved a key milestone this quarter with the commencement of their support of the 2010 census program and I know you’ve all heard a lot about the census. The role we play through our DRIS program, is the decennial response integration system, is to conclude form processing and data capture that standardizes the response from potentially more than 300 million American citizens.
The US census effort as you know is crucial to assuring the right resource allocation across the country, its required by the Constitution and we feel confident that we’ll be in a position to enable the Administration to complete and review the census by December. In my judgment our work on the census is a good example of the broad range of information technology programs in support and services that IS&GS provides to a wide variety of US government agencies. 
And finally in our space systems group under Joanne Maguire, we continue to make significant progress on the advanced extremely high frequency satellite system. This is a next generation communication system that’s an essential element in secure military communications and our first spacecraft is moving very close to delivery now in preparation for a launch in mid-2010. 
These new secure communication satellites replace the Milstar series of satellites that many of you are familiar with. To give you a sense of performance and how performance adds to value because I think we spend a lot of time appropriately talking about our cost performance and our schedule performance as we execute contracts, we probably together spend less time talking about capabilities that we’re delivering, a single advanced EHF satellite provides more communications capacity than the entire Milstar constellation that’s flying today. 
So while we face challenges from time to time on cost and schedule we do have meaningful accomplishments in adding to overall value. The capability of systems like the measureable capability improvement on advanced EHF, many of our satellites last considerably longer than their design life which we call mean mission duration so they last longer, that provides value. 
And as I mentioned in the case of LCS we’re able to shorten the cycle time and move resources into the operational theater sooner which is genuine value to customers. On advanced EHV we’re under contract for three satellites but we envision the possible expansion of this constellation to include six satellites as DoD now looks to assure the appropriate priorities for secure communications in space.
Before l leave space systems, we’ve had much discussion with you and others about human space flight and the constellation program for NASA particularly our component of the constellation program the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle. Last Thursday President Obama when visiting the Cape in Florida, outlined a revision for the program calling for a modified version of the Orion capsule to act as an emergency escape vehicle to serve the international space station. 
In the earlier plan that was described in February with the release of the President’s budget submission to Congress, the Orion program was to be eliminated. This new capsule we believe would likely be launched within the next few years and would certainly leverage and utilize the significant technology advances that our team has achieved since the original Orion contract award in 2005 and we’re very much looking forward to continuing work on the space flight program through Orion. 
I think these operational highlights illustrate our corporate wide focus on program execution, on completing key milestones, on continuously improving quality, and importantly on focusing on affordability which our customers need. As I look forward I remain optimistic about our future because our product portfolio remains well supported, based on the recent budget submissions for 2011, based on the revised priorities that have been outlined in the Quadrennial Defense Review and the future year defense programs, and based on the changing security environment globally, and quality of our portfolio as viewed through the eyes of our international customers, where I think there will be more international opportunities. 
We also maintain our interest in the potential that may reside in adjacent and horizon markets as we explore opportunities in cyber security, logistics and sustainment, particularly the logistics and sustainment activities that are improved through the application of information technology resources, prospects for healthcare information technology or energy management, or renewable power generation. 
So we’re carefully examining the quality and changes in those market segments. And I would be very much remiss if I didn’t comment on the quality of our work force because I think our team has had an outstanding quarter and that is very much due to the dedication and professionalism of the women and men who work in our company. They have not allowed themselves to be distracted by the increasing velocity of events or the increasing tempo of activities that we see around the globe.
They’re very much focused on our customers, they’re very much focused on achieving excellence in what they do, and I’m very proud to have the opportunity to represent them and work with them. So let me turn to Bruce and he’ll give you some additional detail on the quarter and then we’ll open it up for your questions.

So starting off with the first quarter sales summary on chart three, overal",778,"Thanks Robert, to help with our discussions today, we’ve included some charts on our website and I would encourage you to open the charts and follow along as I make my comments. So starting off with the first quarter sales summary on chart three, overall the corporation grew 3% in the quarter.
That was actually slightly higher than what I mentioned during the January call. Aeronautics had the strongest growth at 5% over last year’s numbers driven by the F-35 program which grew over 25% when compared to 2009. IS&GS grew 4% with most of that coming from the civil and defense lines of business, and comparisons with the 2009 performance were hurt somewhat because sales for the TMOSS, and remember TMOSS is the ground segment portion of the TSAT program, and the MTA contracts were included in first quarter 2009 results but were terminated in the second quarter of last year.
Electronic systems was flat in compared to last year, this was actually also somewhat higher than expected given that the Presidential helicopter were in our 2009 results and we had growth in missiles, fire control, and training that was able to offset that reduction. 
Space system was also flat versus 2009 and there we had higher activity on the Orion program which was offset by lower activity in our strategic and defensive missiles line of business. Turning now to chart four and our cash flow, we had record cash generation, over $1.6 billion in the first quarter and that did represent the highest quarterly cash from operations in our history.
Due to this strong generation of cash in the quarter we were increased our full year cash from operations guidance by $100 million to $3.3 billion. If you now look at chart five, for a discussion of our net debt and debt maturities, as a result of our strong cash generated in the quarter our net debt is around $1.5 billion.
That combined with no debt maturities until 2013 gives us great flexibility and a strong capital position for a number of years. On the next chart, chart six we’ll discuss our share repurchase activity, you can see we repurchased 6.5 million shares worth over $500 million in the quarter. We’re on track or ahead of our goal to buyback at least a billion dollars of shares this year.
And these actions reduced shares outstanding to 368.5 million, the lowest level in our history and at quarter’s end we also had 22 million shares remaining in our share repurchase authorization. Next I’d like to highlight our earnings per share performance on chart seven, like many other companies this quarter we had an unusual charge as a result of the recently enacted legislation effecting Medicare Part D which we disclosed in an 8-K filing last month. 
That resulted in $0.25 reduction to our EPS and if you adjusted our GAAP EPS for this charge and for the FAS/CAS impact the resulting adjusted EPS would be $1.89 per share. Finally if you turn to chart eight we’ll reconcile the revised 2010 EPS guidance with our January numbers. 
Starting with our January guidance of $7.15 to $7.35 per share, the effect of the Medicare Part D charge I talked about earlier reduced the guidance by $0.25. We were able to offset a portion of that impact through and improved outlook in our investment income and other corporate accounts, and this $0.10 improvement results in a net $0.15 reduction and our new guidance of $7.00 to $7.20 per share. 
So overall a solid quarter and in line with our expectations. As we look forward to the rest of the year we expect the second quarter sales growth over 2009 to be similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. And overall the second half of the year should have higher growth than the first half with the third quarter in particular having higher growth than the fourth quarter. 
We expect margins to remain in the mid to upper 10% range in both the second and third quarters and then move higher in the fourth quarter as we discussed on the last call. We expect cash from operations will be lower in the next three quarters compared with first quarter as we make $1.4 billion in discretionary contributions to our pension trust. 
In particular the second quarter will likely be about a billion dollars lower than the first quarter as we had a $325 million tax refund in the first quarter, a similarly sized tax payment in the second quarter, and our initial pension contribution also beginning in the second quarter. 
With that I think we’re ready for your questions.

So our expectation going forward is probably the next three quarters are going to be somewhat similar to first quarter, maybe a little bit higher than that but then we would expect some movement higher than that in the fourth quarter as we recognize the receipt of some of those awards.

What we are doing now with our customers as we work on what I described as the re base lining of the program is to reorient the scope of work that needs to be done, to highlight those critically important milestones that demonstrate tangible accomplishment, that is something our customers want and insist on and so do we.
Its vitally important to lock up the requirements, to know what’s expected and to be able to put our resources and talent against those expectations such that we have very measureable results at a milestone point. We are then working with customers to allocate the award fee potential that’s embedded in that $614 million to each of those milestones to reflect their relative value.
The degree to which we are able to earn that $614 million is absolutely tied to the degree we are able to execute the requirements that those milestones are associated with. If we are perfect or near perfect in our performance then we ought to be able to recover all or near all of that $614 million. If we aren’t we’ll keep you posted about how much of that we are able to recover.
But I’m very pleased with the quality and the character of the discussions that orient our ability to earn award fee as a function of our demonstrated performance against milestones. In the vernacular this is described as more objective measures of performance rather than subjective measures and I think we all like the objectivity of knowing what we have to do to earn a fee in the SDD program.

I think your question was probably more related to the SDD program, the development program and there we still expect that we’re going to have some ability to have some margin improvement there in the latter part of this year and that’s more associated with the milestones remaining this year, quite frankly at this point then the negotiation of the remaining $614 million of award fees.
That’s something that will effect us more in later years than this year. So, I think your last question concerned CAS harmonization, I think we’re frankly kind of my perspective we’re almost getting late to need in that regard and I think the latest that we’re hearing and it’s a little fuzzy at this point but that the harmonization might in fact actually slip out to 2012. 
I’m not speaking for anyone when I say that but we’re approaching May here and I would have thought we would have had this done by now but we’re not there yet.

Your second question dealt with ULA equity earnings and talked about the spike that I mentioned last call, the spike I’m talking about is actually associated not with ULA its actually associated with USA, the United Space Alliance. That is the entity that provides shuttle operation support and the reason for the increase in the fourth quarter is because as we have the planned wind down of the shuttle program taking place in the fourth quarter we think there are some risks that will be retired at that point that will allow us to make a pretty good increase in the bookings through that joint venture that will flow into our reported results and you will see that. 
There will be a noticeable improvement in our space systems company in its fourth quarter performance versus the other three quarters. ULA was a little higher in the first quarter of this year but expecting it to basically stay similar at that level for the rest of the year, nothing of a timing issue in the first quarter there.

Every airplane program I’ve ever worked on and every airplane program that I’ve reviewed has a similar set of circumstances that they face.
We go through the development program, there are challenges in development. I assure you we do not take these challenges lightly, in fact I would tell you we respect the degree of difficulty in designing and developing and fielding new complex systems as much as anybody on this planet. 
I don’t see anything at all extraordinarily more challenging on the F-35 that should adversely effect our ability to generate profitability and earn Op margins here. In fact there are several features of this program that I rather like. The more volume we have the more stability we have and that’s why we’re working so closely with the Department  now to get a restructured program that increases the probability of success over the long run because that increased probability of success increases our probability of meeting all our expectations including margin expectations.
Having the international content and I would say even with all the varying descriptions about the program that certainly these is no shortage of available today, international interest remains strong with eight partner countries and we have about eight countries who are not in the partnership basis who are making inquiries, so the FMS potential looks healthy as would the direct foreign sales potential. 
So our goal and we addressed it a little bit on the SDD phase is to build momentum and reduce risk and earn to the maximum extent practicable, a segment of that $614 million, be efficient in our ramp up of production where we ought to be able to build upon the risk reduction in the program to improve our margin performance there which I think is well established in the overall behavior program performance and then look to the international marketplace. 
The other feature of the F-35 that I think is very interesting relative to profitability is the overall sustainment opportunity in this program because the architecture is quite different, looking to us and our industry supply chain partners to play a significant role in the sustainment of the airplane over time. That again is going to be dependent upon our ability to execute and deliver value and that’s why we’re so rigorously focused on making sure we’ve got the right resources in the right place at the right time. 
So I think there’s every bit the earning opportunity on the F-35 as we’ve seen on any of our programs.

I’ll tell you that if I look at January, February, March, and April year to date, we’re a little bit below our cumulative plan. We were good in January and let me say February and March and I think we completed the quarter a couple of tests ahead of the, four tests over the plan of 29, so we were at 33. 
In April we plan on 29 incremental flights, we’ve flown five times April to date. We’re delivering more assets into the flight test program so we expected a more vigorous last portion of the month than first portion of the month. In every flight test program and we’re no different here, we face the traditional things of planned maintenance actions, which really effects the phasing of the 29 flights that we wanted to accomplish.
And then unplanned maintenance actions which essentially means you take the airplane after the flight line and actuator doesn’t work, or you get a, because these are instrumented airplanes you get a reading on an instrument that is off nominal, we don’t fly the airplane when we have that occasion because we want to understand, the whole purpose of the test program is to understand the characterization of the airplane.
Or weather delays which we’ve seen, you know I think a fair number of weather issues. We are going to fly this airplane irrespective of all of those challenges. So I tell you the arc of the test program is good to me. We’re accelerating through about 400 tests that we plan for the year 2010 and we’ll keep you posted at each step along the way because it is certainly important that we demonstrate the maturity of the test program.
I would tell you what, my observation is sometimes there’s a more hyperbolic reaction to did you fly at 2:00 today and the consequences of that which I think may be amplify apprehension that isn’t warranted but on the other hand it is absolutely necessary for us to fly more [inaudible] with the 12 flyers that we have to deliver them into the flight test program and demonstrate the maturity of the airplane and we’re doing that. 
And we’re not going to do that in a way that attempts to skirt any test at all and our behavior has very consistently been to put a priority on building a very high quality jet that meets all the key performance parameters and then go test that, not to thrift on any of the performance to try to accomplish a series of tests.

And then we very much routinely look at how we can best deploy that cash. I know you’re familiar with the discussion because its not a new discussion for us. We certainly look at dividend policy, we look at share repurchases, we’ve committed to at least 50% of free cash flow returned to investors because of the strength in our cash generation we’ve exceeded that goal consistently and considerably.

If there are competitive opportunities we have a long I think well understood set of capabilities in not only human space flight but exploration, so we’d be interested but you know those opportunities are going to be characterized by among other things whether we’re asked to invest, what the quality of the investment would look like, would there be a return on investment.
The one thing I think we know about the space environment particularly human space flight, it is a tough demanding environment. In other words the performance levels for escape velocity among other things are so extreme and the performance margins are so tight you really got to be at the top of your game here and we work hard to make sure we are at the top of our game.
The other aspect that aligns with our interests on the overall space component of the business might be opportunities in the United Launch Alliance for more lift capability from the Atlas and the Delta systems that are in ULA but again that’s pretty much a yet to be determined as we see more definition on the NASA plan and strategy going forward but there might be some particularly in the near-term opportunities for ULA.

So I would tell you we’re at the early stages of conceptualizing what would be required and what would be necessary while we’re including in the broader conversation the lessons from the VH-71 program. We have had I think very good experience and really high quality credentials in putting mission systems into helicopters.
And that is an area of specialization for our company and I say respectively we’re good at it.

Now I assure you nobody particularly nobody here, will ever take a step toward releasing the kind of technology that would make our country less secure and that is an immutable condition but we think if we focused a system on really examining with care the most critical technologies and absolutely safeguarding them with rigor and letting the rest of the market flow, it would improve our prospects internationally, we think it would be enormously good for the US economy. 
I think it would probably be part of a formula that would add to job creation and then I look at our company specifically and note we’ve got a mature portfolio. That portfolio includes programs like the F-16, the F-35, the C-130J, air and missile defense programs like THAAD and Patriot and Aegis that already have international content.
I mentioned the prospects, again without over reaching current set of challenges the Littoral combat ship interests me. The prospects of a joint like tactical vehicle that would have not only keen interest in the US but have the ability to build international constituencies. I like that very much because I think those kinds of program opportunities really create an architecture where you can give the very best value for our US government customers and citizens and tax payers who fund those programs, give them the very best industrial opportunities for international suppliers with whom we have great partnerships and also give those foreign governments great access to systems that are not only high quality in and of themselves, but tend to be far more interoperable and far more aligned so that when are nation has to act with other nations, these systems have already been balanced so that they work effectively and well together.
So I do think our goals are achievable here and we build our systems architectures around the prospects that we can secure the technology we can’t release, they’ll be open and extensible and interoperable so that we can include international participants.

Later this year we’re looking to hopefully close on a potential C-130J deal for the UAE worth somewhere on the order of 12 aircraft potentially. There’s also a PAC-3 deal for both Taiwan and UAE towards the latter half of the year. And I’ll just say that as we sit here today we feel good about our ability to get to that 20% because as we, especially as we get towards the end of 2010 a lot of what’s going to materialize in terms of sales in 2012 will be in backlog by the end of 2012.
Specifically the F-16 program and the C-130’s, we can already see the international content that’s going to be delivered in 2012 and we know with a high degree of certainty what that looks like today and that’s what gives us confidence in that 20% number.

We think the intel business stay fairly flat, more a function of just the smaller size of the individual contracts being awarded there. The sheer numbers of contracts we’re seeing in the intelligence side haven’t necessarily changed but the dollar size of those programs has diminished somewhat.

I hope you had an opportunity to read our earnings release and take a look at our updated guidance. Overall in the quarter, our operational tempo and our execution were strong. Quality levels were good and each business area achieved expected results. 
In the United States, since we last spoke, several events have occurred. The President proposed the Defense budget for 2011 at $549 billion, which was 3% over 2010 budget levels. When we look out over the longer term, the future-year Defense program, that's the projection that looks out over a five-year horizon, maintains an overall 3% growth projection for DoD. And then finally, the Quadrennial Defense Review, that more strategically-oriented document, was also completed and released. And the priorities outlined in the QDR provide a solid level of support for a number of our lines of business in our programs including: the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter for the fleet replacement aircraft, our FAD. PAC-3 and Aegis systems for mobile and sea-based missile defense, the advanced VHF Satellite for space command control communications and the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions that communication supports and our Littoral Combat Ship for advanced surface-enabled combatants. Clearly, our customers continue to address the dual demands of expanding missions and fiscal pressures. And we're working hard to support them by meeting our commitments, to shorten our cycle times, to overall reduce our costs and focus more on affordability. 
Internationally, we see the opportunity horizon expanding. With demand aligning well with our product portfolio. And we are pleased with the international awards we saw in the first quarter that included 20 new F-16 aircraft for Egypt, two new C-130J airlifters for Tunisia, Sniper and Lantern Targeting systems for Turkey and a ten-year logistic support contract for New Zealand's Defence Forces. 
Last year, we increased our goal for international revenue, such that we’d generate 20% of total revenue from our international business. And we're on track to achieve that goal by 2012. And yesterday, we were pleased to see a renewed call for export control reform that was brought forward by Secretary Gates. 
Let me turn to our operations for a moment, where I think we had a solid quarter and we met some key objectives in each business area. In Aeronautics, Ralph Heath and the Aeronautics team maintained overall a good operational tempo. And there are three areas that warrant greater discussion. The F-35 is getting lots of extra attention, as a result of the restructuring process that addresses risk and positions the program for success and working through the Nunn-McCurdy recertification process. And I think here, there may be some confusion about how the restructuring of the program and the Nunn-McCurdy recertification process align. They are both really born out of the same fundamental assessment of the program that evaluated our ability to execute and included a variety of estimates of risk factors that could affect the program. The restructuring was initiated to reduce the overall risk of the program in order to facilitate the Nunn-McCurdy recertification. When we look at the restructuring segment, you'd see a 13-month extension to the system design and development phase of the program, while adding $2.8 billion in funding, expanding the resources available on the program to reduce risk by adding software labs or adding resources to the flight test program. Very specifically the addition of one United States Navy carrier version of the aircraft to improve our overall ability to turn around test flights. You'll see the addition of an additional low rate initial production contract that we refer to as LRIP #9. We've had a re-phasing of the production ramp, while incorporating some buy-to-budget flexibility. That means if our program performance is on track, there will be an opportunity to add airplanes to the ramp rate and then revising the program milestones. 
The Nunn-McCurdy recertification is led by the Department of Defense, specifically headed by Dr. Ash Carter, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition Technology and Logistics. And we play a supporting role in that process. I think that mechanism has been kicked off. There are five evaluation criteria that have to be satisfied, and we believe that process will successfully conclude probably in the June time frame. 
On the F-35, we’re focused on execution and know we need to improve our performance. And a key objective for us will be to build momentum in the program. That's momentum as we work to finalize the tasks in the development phase of the program, momentum as we efficiently accelerate the production ramp-up of the program and importantly to build on the accomplishments that are being achieved in the test program. 
In that test program, two flight tests were particularly meaningful to us. The achievement of the short takeoff and vertical landing of the STOVL aircraft, where we were able to measure the behavioral characteristics of the airplane, power lift, controls, stability, all of which were excellent. I think all that observed the tests were very pleased with those results. And the first flight of the mission systems-equipped F-35 which happened on April 7, which demonstrated an avionics capability that no other fighter has demonstrated. So we're going to continue to focus additional resources on execution and we'll continue to strengthen the team on the F-35. 
In Aeronautics, we're also building volume on the C-130J production program. We've commented to you over time our desire to expand this phase of the program, building on our 16 aircraft delivered last year to 26 airplanes delivered this year. I think we've noted that those deliveries are likely to be phased toward the second half of the year. But overall demand for the airplane looks very solid and the performance of the aircraft has been really superior. 
Also in Aeronautics, we've been modernizing the C-5 Galaxy aircraft. This is a very heavy lift segment of our U.S. lift component, and putting new engines and essentially new cockpits and new avionics in the aircraft. This program has successfully passed a very rigorous operational test and evaluation set of criteria and has now been certified as effective and mission-capable. We delivered three of these airplanes to the United States Air Force. And the current plans call for us to deliver 52 fully-modernized C-5s by 2016. It's my sense that if we continue to show real value here, real excellence in execution and performance and if the demands on U.S. airlift continue, there may be opportunities to talk about expanding that number in the future. But here again, we're very much focused on executing the current program of record. 
Marilyn Houston [ph] and our Electronics team continue excellent operational performance across the portfolio. And I think the Littoral Combat Ship deserves special mention. Our first Littoral Combat Ship, the USS Freedom, was deployed by the Navy this quarter. And it was deployed two years ahead of schedule. And I think the Navy is very proud of that accomplishment. And I can certainly tell you that we and our LCS team are very proud of our ability to shorten cycle times, which has been a key objective of our company and in alignment with the objectives of our customers.  In operations, the ship's already intercepted four drug-smuggling ships. And I think the crew of the Freedom is demonstrating superior performance in their prosecution of important missions. 
Our second ship, the Fort Worth, is more than 30% complete and is on its planned schedule and cost profiles. We've submitted our bid for the next 10-ship buy that would result, if we were successful in prevailing in the competition, to an initial award of two ships and options for eight further ships. And the Navy's decision as to selecting the winning design for the overall 55-ship fleet will probably be undertaken in the third quarter. So we'll keep you posted and look forward to that. 
I don't want to play through the demands we're focusing on competing for and winning, the instant contract with the United States Navy. But I would note one of our objectives has been to try to look to aggregate demand for systems that have solid baselines that are flexible and extensible for a variety of customers. And this includes bringing in international customers into baseline programs because the benefits are really quite manifest. It's very good for U.S. customers because it lowers the cost of every ship the U.S. buys. It's very good for the international customers because it has the same cost advantage. And it's good for us because we have a broader, more stable program that lets us integrate the global supply chain more effectively, get higher quality and really drive value for everyone. So I am pleased that, given the nature of the design of our ship, its performance in an operational environment, the steel semi-planning monohull design, all of which appeal strongly to a variety of international customers. So as you might expect, we're very focused on assuring we present good value to the United States Navy in our bid. 
Moving to Information Systems and Global Services, Linda Gooden and the IS&GS team have also achieved a key milestone this quarter, with the commencement of their support of the 2010 Census program. And I know you've all heard a lot about the Census. The role we play through our DRIS program, it’s the Decennial Response Integration System, is to conclude form processing and data capture that standardizes the response from potentially more than 300 million American citizens. The U.S. Census effort, as you know, is crucial to assuring the right resource allocation across the country. It's required by the Constitution. And we feel confident that we'll be in a position to enable the administration to complete and review the Census by December. In my judgment, our work on the Census is a good example of the broad range of information technology programs and support and services that IS&GS provides to a wide variety of U.S. government agencies. 
And finally in our Space Systems group under Joanne Maguire, we continue to make significant progress on the advanced, extremely high-frequency satellite system. This is a next-generation communication system that's an essential element in secure military communications. And our first spacecraft is moving very close to delivery now in preparation for a launch in mid-2010. These new secure communications Satellites replace the Milstar series of Satellites that many of you are familiar with. 
To give you a sense of performance and how performance adds to value, because I think we spend a lot of time, appropriately, talking about our cost performance and our schedule performance as we execute contracts. We probably, together, spend less time talking about capabilities that we're delivering. A single, advanced VHF Satellite provides more communications capacity than the entire Milstar constellation that's flying today. So while we face challenges from time to time on cost and schedule, we do have meaningful accomplishments in adding to overall value, the capability of systems like the measurable capability improvement on advanced VHF. Many of our Satellites last considerably longer than their design life, which we call mean mission duration. So they last longer, that provides value. And as I mentioned in the case of LCS, we were able to shorten the cycle time and move resources into the operational theater’s sooner, which is genuine value to customers.  On advanced VHF, we're under contract for three Satellites. But we envision a possible expansion of this constellation to include six Satellites, as DoD now looks to assure the appropriate priorities for secure communications in space. 
Before I leave space systems, we've had much discussion with you and others about human space flight and the constellation program for NASA, particularly our component of the constellation program, the Orion crew exploration vehicle. Last Thursday, President Obama, when visiting the Cape in Florida, outlined a revision for the program, calling for a modified version of the Orion capsule to act as an emergency escape vehicle to serve the International Space Station. In the earlier plan that was described in February with the release of the President's budget submission to Congress, the Orion program was to be eliminated. This new capsule, we believe, would likely be launched within the next few years and would certainly leverage and utilize the significant technology advances that our team has achieved since the original Orion contract award in 2005. And we're very much looking forward to continuing work on the human space flight program through Orion. 
I think these operational highlights illustrate our corporate-wide focus on program execution; on completing key milestones; on continuously improving quality; and importantly, on focusing on affordability which our customers need. As I look forward, I remain optimistic about our future because our product portfolio remains well-supported, based on the recent budget submissions for 2011; based on the revised priorities that have been outlined in the Quadrennial Defense Review in the future year Defense programs; and based on the changing security environment globally and the quality of our portfolio as viewed through the eyes of our international customers, where I think there will be more international opportunities. 
We also maintain our interest in the potential that may reside in adjacent and horizon markets as we explore opportunities in cyber security, logistics and sustainment, particularly the logistics and sustainment activities that are improved through the application of information technology resources;  prospects for healthcare information technology or energy management or renewable power generation. So we're carefully examining the quality and changes in those market segments. 
And I would be very much remiss if I didn't comment on the quality of our workforce, because I think our team has had an outstanding quarter. And that is very much due to the dedication and professionalism of the women and men who work in our company. They have not allowed themselves to be distracted by the increase in velocity of events or the increasing tempo of activities that we see around the globe. They're very much focused on our customers. They're very much focused on achieving excellence in what they do. And I'm very proud to have the opportunity to represent them and work with them. So let me turn to Bruce, and he'll give you some additional detail on the quarter. And then we'll open it up for your questions."
285827,100779150,56873,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob.

So starting off with the first quarter sales summary on Chart 3. Overall the co",778,"Thanks, Bob. To help with our discussions today, we've included some charts on our website and I would encourage you to open the charts and follow along as I make my comments. So starting off with the first quarter sales summary on Chart 3. Overall the corporation grew 3% in the quarter. That was actually slightly higher than what I mentioned during the January call. Aeronautics had the strongest growth at 5% over last year's number. It's driven by the F-35 program, which grew over 25% when compared to 2009. IS&GS grew 4%, with most of that coming from the Civil and Defense lines of business. And comparisons with the 2009 performance were hurt somewhat, because sales for the TMOS, remember TMOS is the ground segment portion of the TSAT program, and the MTA contracts were included in first quarter 2009 results but were terminated in the second quarter of last year. 
Electronic Systems was flat when compared to last year. This was actually also somewhat higher than expected, given that the presidential helicopter were in our 2009 results. And we had growth in Missiles & Fire Control and training. It was able to offset that reduction. Space System was also flat versus 2009. And there, we had higher activity on the Orion program, which was offset by lower activity in our Strategic and Defensive Missiles line of business. 
Turning now to Chart 4 and our cash flow. We had record cash generation, over $1.6 billion in the first quarter. And that did represent the highest quarterly cash operations in our history. Due to this strong generation of cash in the quarter, we increased our full year cash from operations guidance by $100 million to $3.3 billion. 
If you’ll now look at Chart 5, for a discussion of our net debt and debt maturities. As a result of our strong cash generated in the quarter, our net debt is around $1.5 billion. That, combined with no debt maturities until 2013, gives us great flexibility and a strong capital position for a number of years. 
On the next chart, Chart 6, we'll discuss our share repurchase activity. You can see we repurchased 6.5 million shares, worth over $500 million in the quarter. We're on track or ahead of our goal to buy back at least $1 billion of shares this year. And these actions reduced shares outstanding to 368.5 million, the lowest level in our history. And at quarter's end, we also had 22 million shares remaining in our share repurchase authorization. 
Next, I'd like to highlight our earnings per share performance on Chart 7. Like many other companies this quarter, we had an unusual charge as a result of the recently enacted legislation affecting Medicare Part D., which we disclosed in an 8-K filing last month. That resulted in a $0.25 reduction to our EPS. And if you adjusted our GAAP EPS for this charge and for the FAS/CAS impact, the resulting adjusted EPS would be $1.89 per share. 
Finally, if you turn to Chart 8, we'll reconcile the revised 2010 EPS guidance with a January numbers. Starting with our January guidance of $7.15 to $7.35 per share, the effect of the Medicare Part D charge I talked about earlier reduced the guidance by $0.25. We were able to offset a portion of that impact through an improved outlook in our investment income and other corporate accounts. And this $0.10 improvement, results in a net $0.15 reduction in our new guidance on $7 to $7.20 per share. 
So overall a solid quarter and in line with of our expectations. As we look forward to the rest of the year, we expect the second quarter sales growth over 2009 to be similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. And overall, the second half of the year should have higher growth in the first half, with the third quarter in particular having higher growth than the fourth quarter. We expect margins to remain in the mid to upper 10% range in both the second and third quarters and then move higher in the fourth quarter as we discussed on the last call. We expect cash from operations will be lower in the next three quarters compared with first quarter, as we make $1.4 billion in discretionary contributions to our pension trust. In particular, the second quarter will likely be about $1 billion lower than the first quarter, as we had a $325 million tax refund in the first quarter, a similarly sized tax payment in the second quarter, and our initial pension contributions also beginning in the second quarter. With that, I think we're ready for questions. Sean?"

So our expectation going forward, Rob, is probably the next three quarters are going to be somewhat similar to first quarter of maybe a little bit higher than that. But then we would expect some movement higher than that in the fourth quarter as we recognized the receipt of some of those award fees."

That is something our customers want and insist on. And David, so do we. It's vitally an important to lock up the requirements, to know what's expected, and to be able to put our resources and talent against those expectations, such that we have very measurable results at a milestone point. We are then working with customers to allocate the award fee potential that's embedded in that $614 million, to each of those milestones to reflect their relative value. The degree to which we are able to earn that $614 million is absolutely tied to the degree we are able to execute the requirements that those milestones are associated with. If we are perfect or near-perfect in our performance, then we ought to be able to recover all or near all of that $614 million. If we aren't, we'll keep you posted about how much of that we are able to recover. But I’m very pleased with the quality and the character of the discussions that orient our ability to earn award fee as a function of our demonstrated performance against milestones.

And I think we all like the objectivity of knowing what we have to do to earn a fee in the SDD program."

It's actually associated with USA, the United Space Alliance. Think of that as the entity that provides shuttle operations support. And the reason for the increase in the fourth quarter is because as we have the planned wind down of the shuttle program taking place in the fourth quarter, we think there's some risks that will be retired at that point that will allow us to make a pretty good increase in the bookings through that joint venture that’ll flow in to our reported results. And you will see that. They’ll be a noticeable improvement in our Space Systems Company in its fourth quarter performance versus the other three quarters.

I don’t want to say historically because that sounds like too long a time horizon, but I'm old enough now that I've done this a few times. Every airplane program I’ve ever worked on and every airplane program that I’ve reviewed has a similar set of circumstances that they face. We go through the development program, there are challenges in development. I assure you we do not take these challenges lightly. In fact, I would tell you we respect the degree of difficulty in designing and developing and fielding new complex systems as much as anybody on this planet. I don't see anything at all extraordinarily more challenging on the F-35 that should adversely affect our ability to generate profitability and earn out margins here. In fact, there are several features of this program that I rather like. The more volume we have, the more stability we have. And that's why we're working so closely with the Department now to get a restructured program that increases the probability of success over the long run. Because that increased probability of success increases our probability of meeting all our expectations, including margin expectations. Having the international content, and I would say even with all the varying descriptions about the program that certainly there is no shortage of available today, international interest remains strong with eight partner countries and we have about eight countries who are not in the partnership basis who were making inquiries. So the FMS potential looks healthy as would the direct foreign sales potential. So our goal, and we addressed it a little bit on the SDD phase, is to build momentum and reduce risk and earn to the maximum extent practical a segment of that $614 million, be efficient in our ramp up of production, where we ought to be able to build upon the risk reduction in the program to improve our margin performance there, which I think is well established in the overall behavior program -- performance. And then look to the international marketplace. The other feature of the F-35 that I think is very interesting relative to profitability, is the overall sustainment opportunity in this program, because the architecture is quite different. Looking to us and our industry supply chain partners to play a significant role in the sustainment of the airplane over time. That again is going to be dependent upon our ability to execute and deliver value. And that's why we're so rigorously focused on making sure we've got the right resources and the right place at the right time. So I think there's every bit the earning opportunity on the F-35 as we've seen on any of our programs."

And in that building momentum, I think there are going to be some periods where we do better than plan and some periods where we don't do as well as planned, but my goal here is to look at the long-term trend and the opportunities and make sure we're responding properly. I'll tell you that if I look at January, February, March and April year-to-date, we’re a little bit below our cumulative plan. We were good in January and let me say February and March. And I think we completed the quarter a couple of tests ahead of the -- four tests over the plan of 29, so we were at 33. In April, we plan on 29 incremental flights. We’ve flown five times April to date. We're delivering more assets into the flight test program so we expected a more vigorous last portion of the month than first portion of the month. In every flight test program, and we're no different here, we faced the traditional things of planned maintenance actions, which really affects the phasing of the 29 flights that we wanted to accomplish. And then unplanned maintenance actions, which essentially means you take airplane out to the flight line and an actuator doesn't work. Or you get -- because these are instrumented airplanes, you get a reading on an instrument that is off nominal. We don't fly the airplane when we have that occasion because we want to understand -- the whole purpose of a test program is to understand the characterization of the airplane. Or weather delays, which we've seen -- I think a fair number of weather issues. We are going to fly this airplane irrespective of all of those challenges. So I tell you the arc of the test program is good to me. We’re accelerating through about 400 tests that we planned for the year 2010. And we'll keep you posted at each step along the way because it is certainly important that we demonstrate the maturity of the test program. I would tell you what -- my observation is sometimes, there's a more hyperbolic reaction to: did you fly at 2:00 today and the consequences of that, which I think maybe amplify apprehension, that isn't warranted. But on the other hand, it is absolutely necessary for us to fly more sorties with the 12 flyers that we have, to deliver them into the flight test program and demonstrate the maturity of the airplane. And we're doing that. And we're not going to do that in a way that attempts to skirt any test at all. And our behavior has very consistently been to put a priority on building a very high quality jet that meets all the key performance parameters and then go test that, not to thrift on any of the performance to try to accomplish a series of tests."

We look at share repurchases. We’ve committed to at least 50% of free cash flow return to investors because of the strength in our cash generation. We’ve exceeded that goal consistently and considerably. And we look at the string-of-pearls acquisition strategy, which we want continue to do, but were very selective in those acquisitions. So I assure you that we're very focused on both sides of the equation: the ability to go generate cash because we've earned that and then also how we can best deploy that cash to the interest of our shareholders. And that will include taking a look at dividend policy. We've had double-digit increases, I think for seven years on the dividend policy. It will include a careful examination of our repurchase strategy and philosophy that's really been based on opportunistic share repurchases.

If there are competitive opportunities, we have a long well-understood set of capabilities in, not only human space flight, but exploration. So we'd be interested, but you know those opportunities are going to be characterized by among other things whether we're asked to invest, what the quality of investment would look like, would there be a return on investment. The one thing I think we know about the space environment, particularly human spaceflight, it is a tough demanding environment. In other words, the performance levels for escape velocity, among other things, are so extreme and the performance margins are so tight, you really got to be at the top of your game here. And we work hard to make sure we are at the top of our game. The other aspect that aligns with our interest on the overall space component of the business might be opportunities in the United Launch Alliance. For more lift capability from the Atlas and the Delta systems that are in ULA. But again that’s pretty much yet to be determined as we see more definition on the NASA plan and strategy going forward.

We do this a lot as you would expect and our observations about the system are very clear. We have a lot of really good people working in the government overseeing a process to assure that we don't diminish the security of our country because we allow technologies to escape. The people are good; the process is not as effective as it should be. And what we've asked the people to do is to essentially work harder and harder and harder and more diligently in a process that isn't serving us well because the process is too broad and too amorphous. And in that broadness, it slows down the overall tempo of companies like ours to effectively compete in an accelerating global marketplace.

We think it’d be enormously good for the U.S. economy. I think it would probably be part of a formula that would add to job creation. And then I look at our company specifically and note we've got a mature portfolio. That portfolio includes programs like the F-16, the F-35, the C-130J, Air and Missile Defense programs like FAD and Patriot and Aegis that already have international content. I mentioned the prospects, again without overreaching a current set of challenges. The Littoral Combat Ship interests me. The prospects of a joint light tactical vehicle that would have not only key interest in the U.S. but have the ability to build international constituency. I like that very much because I think those kinds of program opportunities really create an architecture where you can give the very best value for our U.S. government customers and citizens and taxpayers who fund those programs, give them the very best industrial opportunities for international suppliers, with whom we have great partnerships. And also give those foreign governments great access to systems that are not only high quality in and of themselves, but tend to be far more interoperable and far more aligned so that when our nation has to act with other nations, these systems have already been balanced so that they work effectively and well together. So I do think our goals are achievable here and we build our system’s architectures around the prospects that we can secure the technology we can't release. They’ll be open and extensible and interoperable so that we can include international participants."

You asked for some kind of specifics as far as how we go about achieving the objective of 20% of sales in 2012. We start off -- we had a good first quarter other than I think Bob hit several of these. But we did have the F-16 buy to Egypt for 20 aircraft. We also had sale of some Sniper Targeting, Sniper and Lantern, actually, Targeting and Navigation pods for Turkey, and we had the two aircraft that Bob mentioned for C-130Js with Tunisia. Later this year, we're looking to hopefully close a potential C-130J deal for the UAE worth somewhere on the order of 12 aircraft potentially. There’s also a PAC-3 deal for both Taiwan and UAE towards the latter half of the year. And I'll just say as we sit here today we feel good about our ability to get to that 20% because as we sit –- especially as we get towards the end on 2010, a lot of what's going to materialize in terms of sales in 2012 will be in backlog by the end of 2012. Specifically, the F-16 program and the C-130s, we can already see the international content that’s going to be delivered in 2012. I think we know with a high degree of certainty what that looks like today and that’s what gives us confidence in the 20% number."

We think the Intel business will stay fairly flat, more a function of just the smaller size of individual contracts being awarded there. The sheer numbers of contracts we are seeing in the Intelligence side haven’t necessarily changed, but the dollar size of those programs has diminished somewhat. So our growth is going to be driven by those two LOBs, Civil and Defense, and we still feel that somewhere in the 6% to 8% range for the year is achievable.

I hope you had an opportunity to read our earnings release and take a look at our updated guidance. Overall in the quarter, our operational tempo and our execution were strong. Quality levels were good and each business area achieved expected results. 
In the United States, since we last spoke, several events have occurred. The President proposed the Defense budget for 2011 at $549 billion, which was 3% over 2010 budget levels. When we look out over the longer term, the future-year Defense program, that's the projection that looks out over a five-year horizon, maintains an overall 3% growth projection for DoD. And then finally, the Quadrennial Defense Review, that more strategically oriented document, was also completed and released. And the priorities outlined in the QDR provide a solid level of support for a number of our lines of business in our programs including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter for the fleet replacement aircraft, our FAD. PAC-3 and Aegis systems for mobile and sea-based missile defense, the advanced VHF Satellite for space command control communications and the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions that communication supports and our Littoral Combat Ship for advanced surface-enabled combatants. Clearly, our customers continue to address the dual demands of expanding missions and fiscal pressures. And we're working hard to support them by meeting our commitments, to shorten our cycle times, to overall reduce our costs and focus more on affordability. 
Internationally, we see the opportunity horizon expanding. With demand aligning well with our product portfolio. And we are pleased with the international awards we saw in the first quarter that included 20 new F-16 aircraft for Egypt, two new C-130J airlifters for Tunisia, Sniper and Lantern Targeting systems for Turkey and a ten-year logistic support contract for New Zealand's Defence Forces. 
Last year, we increased our goal for international revenue, such that we’d generate 20% of total revenue from our international business. And we're on track to achieve that goal by 2012. And yesterday, we were pleased to see a renewed call for export control reform that was brought forward by Secretary Gates. 
Let me turn to our operations for a moment, where I think we had a solid quarter and we met some key objectives in each business area. In Aeronautics, Ralph Heath and the Aeronautics team maintained overall a good operational tempo. And there are three areas that warrant greater discussion. The F-35 is getting lots of extra attention, as a result of the restructuring process that addresses risk and positions the program for success and working through the Nunn-McCurdy recertification process. And I think here, there may be some confusion about how the restructuring of the program and the Nunn-McCurdy recertification process align. They are both really born out of the same fundamental assessment of the program that evaluated our ability to execute and included a variety of estimates of risk factors that could affect the program. The restructuring was initiated to reduce the overall risk of the program in order to facilitate the Nunn-McCurdy recertification. When we look at the restructuring segment, you'd see a 13-month extension to the system design and development phase of the program, while adding $2.8 billion in funding, expanding the resources available on the program to reduce risk by adding software labs or adding resources to the flight test program, very specifically the addition of one United States Navy carrier version of the aircraft to improve our overall ability to turn around test flights. You'll see the addition of an additional low rate initial production contract that we refer to as LRIP #9. We've had a re-phasing of the production ramp, while incorporating some buy-to-budget flexibility. That means if our program performance is on track, there will be an opportunity to add airplanes to the ramp rate and then revising the program milestones. 
The Nunn-McCurdy recertification is led by the Department of Defense, specifically headed by Dr. Ash Carter, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition Technology and Logistics. And we play a supporting role in that process. I think that mechanism has been kicked off. There are five evaluation criteria that have to be satisfied, and we believe that process will successfully conclude probably in the June time frame. 
On the F-35, we’re focused on execution and know we need to improve our performance. And a key objective for us will be to build momentum in the program. That's momentum as we work to finalize the tasks in the development phase of the program, momentum as we efficiently accelerate the production ramp-up of the program and importantly to build on the accomplishments that are being achieved in the test program. 
In that test program, two flight tests were particularly meaningful to us. The achievement of the short takeoff and vertical landing of the STOVL aircraft, where we were able to measure the behavioral characteristics of the airplane, power lift, controls, stability, all of which were excellent and I think all that observed the tests were very pleased with those results. And the first flight of the mission systems-equipped F-35 which happened on April 7, which demonstrated an avionics capability that no other fighter has demonstrated. So we're going to continue to focus additional resources on execution and we'll continue to strengthen the team on the F-35. 
In Aeronautics, we're also building volume on the C-130J production program. We've commented to you over time our desire to expand this phase of the program, building on our 16 aircraft delivered last year to 26 airplanes delivered this year. I think we've noted that those deliveries are likely to be phased toward the second half of the year. But overall demand for the airplane looks very solid and the performance of the aircraft has been really superior. 
Also in Aeronautics, we've been modernizing the C-5 Galaxy aircraft. This is a very heavy lift segment of our U.S. lift component, and putting new engines and essentially new cockpits and new avionics in the aircraft. This program has successfully passed a very rigorous operational test and evaluation set of criteria and has now been certified as effective and mission-capable. We’ve delivered three of these airplanes to the United States Air Force. And the current plans call for us to deliver 52 fully modernized C-5s by 2016. It's my sense that if we continue to show real value here, real excellence in execution and performance and if the demands on U.S. airlift continue, there may be opportunities to talk about expanding that number in the future. But here again, we're very much focused on executing the current program of record. 
Marilyn Houston [ph] and her electronics team continue excellent operational performance across the portfolio. And I think the Littoral Combat Ship deserves special mention. Our first Littoral Combat Ship, the USS Freedom, was deployed by the Navy this quarter. And it was deployed two years ahead of schedule. And I think the Navy is very proud of that accomplishment. And I can certainly tell you that we and our LCS team are very proud of our ability to shorten cycle times, which has been a key objective of our company and in alignment with the objectives of our customers. In operations, the ship's already intercepted four drug-smuggling ships. And I think the crew of the Freedom is demonstrating superior performance in their prosecution of important missions. 
Our second ship, the Fort Worth, is more than 30% complete and is on its planned schedule and cost profiles. We've submitted our bid for the next 10-ship buy that would result, if we were successful in prevailing in the competition, to an initial award of two ships and options for eight further ships. And the Navy's decision as to selecting the winning design for the overall 55-ship fleet will probably be undertaken in the third quarter. So we'll keep you posted and look forward to that. 
I don't want to play through the demands we're focusing on competing for and winning, the instant contract with the United States Navy. But I would note one of our objectives has been to try to look to aggregate demand for systems that have solid baselines that are flexible and extensible for a variety of customers. And this includes bringing in international customers into baseline programs because the benefits are really quite manifest. It's very good for U.S. customers because it lowers the cost of every ship the U.S. buys. It's very good for the international customers because it has the same cost advantage. And it's good for us because we have a broader, more stable program that lets us integrate the global supply chain more effectively, get higher quality and really drive value for everyone. So I am pleased that, given the nature of the design of our ship, its performance in an operational environment, the steel semi-planning monohull design, all of which appeal strongly to a variety of international customers. So as you might expect, we're very focused on assuring we present good value to the United States Navy in our bid. 
Moving to Information Systems and Global Services, Linda Gooden and the IS&GS team have also achieved a key milestone this quarter, with the commencement of their support of the 2010 Census program. And I know you've all heard a lot about the Census. The role we play through our DRIS program, it’s the Decennial Response Integration System, is to conclude form processing and data capture that standardizes the response from potentially more than 300 million American citizens. The U.S. Census effort, as you know, is crucial to assuring the right resource allocation across the country. It's required by the Constitution. And we feel confident that we'll be in a position to enable the administration to complete and review the Census by December. In my judgment, our work on the Census is a good example of the broad range of information technology programs and support and services that IS&GS provides to a wide variety of U.S. government agencies. 
And finally in our Space Systems group under Joanne Maguire, we continue to make significant progress on the advanced, extremely high-frequency satellite system. This is a next-generation communication system that's an essential element in secure military communications. And our first spacecraft is moving very close to delivery now in preparation for a launch in mid-2010. These new secure communications Satellites replace the Milstar series of Satellites that many of you are familiar with. 
To give you a sense of performance and how performance adds to value, because I think we spend a lot of time, appropriately, talking about our cost performance and our schedule performance as we execute contracts. We probably, together, spend less time talking about capabilities that we're delivering. A single, advanced VHF Satellite provides more communications capacity than the entire Milstar constellation that's flying today. So while we face challenges from time to time on cost and schedule, we do have meaningful accomplishments in adding to overall value, the capability of systems like the measurable capability improvement on advanced VHF. Many of our Satellites last considerably longer than their design life, which we call mean mission duration. So they last longer, that provides value. And as I mentioned in the case of LCS, we were able to shorten the cycle time and move resources into the operational theaters sooner, which is genuine value to customers. On advanced VHF, we're under contract for three Satellites. But we envision a possible expansion of this constellation to include six Satellites, as DoD now looks to assure the appropriate priorities for secure communications in space. 
Before I leave Space Systems, we've had much discussion with you and others about human space flight and the constellation program for NASA, particularly our component of the constellation program, the Orion crew exploration vehicle. Last Thursday, President Obama, when visiting the Cape in Florida, outlined a revision for the program, calling for a modified version of the Orion capsule to act as an emergency escape vehicle to serve the International Space Station. In the earlier plan that was described in February with the release of the President's budget submission to Congress, the Orion program was to be eliminated. This new capsule, we believe, would likely be launched within the next few years and would certainly leverage and utilize the significant technology advances that our team has achieved since the original Orion contract award in 2005. And we're very much looking forward to continuing work on the human space flight program through Orion. 
I think these operational highlights illustrate our corporate-wide focus on program execution; on completing key milestones; on continuously improving quality; and importantly, on focusing on affordability which our customers need. As I look forward, I remain optimistic about our future because our product portfolio remains well supported, based on the recent budget submissions for 2011; based on the revised priorities that have been outlined in the Quadrennial Defense Review in the future year Defense programs; and based on the changing security environment globally and the quality of our portfolio as viewed through the eyes of our international customers, where I think there will be more international opportunities. 
We also maintain our interest in the potential that may reside in adjacent and horizon markets as we explore opportunities in cyber security, logistics and sustainment, particularly the logistics and sustainment activities that are improved through the application of information technology resources, prospects for healthcare information technology or energy management or renewable power generation. So we're carefully examining the quality and changes in those market segments. 
And I would be very much remiss if I didn't comment on the quality of our workforce, because I think our team has had an outstanding quarter. And that is very much due to the dedication and professionalism of the women and men who work in our company. They have not allowed themselves to be distracted by the increasing velocity of events or the increasing tempo of activities that we see around the globe. They're very much focused on our customers. They're very much focused on achieving excellence in what they do. And I'm very proud to have the opportunity to represent them and work with them. So let me turn to Bruce, and he'll give you some additional detail on the quarter. And then we'll open it up for your questions."
285827,100779150,57433,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. To help with our discussions today, we've included some charts on our website and I would encourage you to open the charts and follow along as I make my comments. So starting off with the first quarter sales summary on Chart 3. Overall, the",780,"Thanks, Bob. To help with our discussions today, we've included some charts on our website and I would encourage you to open the charts and follow along as I make my comments. 
So starting off with the first quarter sales summary on Chart 3. Overall, the corporation grew 3% in the quarter. That was actually slightly higher than what I mentioned during the January call. Aeronautics had the strongest growth at 5% over last year's number. It was driven by the F-35 program, which grew over 25% when compared to 2009. IS&GS grew 4%, with most of that coming from the Civil and Defense lines of business. And comparisons with the 2009 performance were hurt somewhat, because sales for the TMOS, and remember TMOS is the ground segment portion of the TSAT program, and the MTA contracts were included in first quarter 2009 results but were terminated in the second quarter of last year. 
Electronic Systems was flat when compared to last year. This was actually also somewhat higher than expected, given that the presidential helicopter were in our 2009 results. And we had growth in Missiles, Fire Control & Training that was able to offset that reduction. Space System was also flat versus 2009. And there, we had higher activity on the Orion program, which was offset by lower activity in our Strategic and Defensive Missiles line of business. 
Turning now to Chart 4 and our cash flow. We had record cash generation, over $1.6 billion in the first quarter. And that did represent the highest quarterly cash from operations in our history. Due to this strong generation of cash in the quarter, we increased our full year cash from operations guidance by $100 million to $3.3 billion. 
If you’ll now look at Chart 5, for a discussion of our net debt and debt maturities. As a result of our strong cash generated in the quarter, our net debt is around $1.5 billion. That, combined with no debt maturities until 2013, gives us great flexibility and a strong capital position for a number of years. 
On the next chart, Chart 6, we'll discuss our share repurchase activity. You can see we repurchased 6.5 million shares, worth over $500 million in the quarter. We're on track or ahead of our goal to buy back at least $1 billion of shares this year. And these actions reduced shares outstanding to 368.5 million, the lowest level in our history. And at quarter's end, we also had 22 million shares remaining in our share repurchase authorization. 
Next, I'd like to highlight our earnings per share performance on Chart 7. Like many other companies this quarter, we had an unusual charge as a result of the recently enacted legislation affecting Medicare Part D., which we disclosed in an 8-K filing last month. That resulted in a $0.25 reduction to our EPS. And if you adjusted our GAAP EPS for this charge and for the FAS/CAS impact, the resulting adjusted EPS would be $1.89 per share. 
Finally, if you turn to Chart 8, we'll reconcile the revised 2010 EPS guidance with a January numbers. Starting with our January guidance of $7.15 to $7.35 per share, the effect of the Medicare Part D charge I talked about earlier reduced the guidance by $0.25. We were able to offset a portion of that impact through an improved outlook in our investment income and other corporate accounts. And this $0.10 improvement, results in a net $0.15 reduction in our new guidance on $7 to $7.20 per share. 
So overall a solid quarter and in line with of our expectations. As we look forward to the rest of the year, we expect the second quarter sales growth over 2009 to be similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. And overall, the second half of the year should have higher growth in the first half, with the third quarter in particular having higher growth than the fourth quarter. We expect margins to remain in the mid to upper 10% range in both the second and third quarters and then move higher in the fourth quarter as we discussed on the last call. We expect cash from operations will be lower in the next three quarters compared with first quarter, as we make $1.4 billion in discretionary contributions to our pension trust. In particular, the second quarter will likely be about $1 billion lower than the first quarter, as we had a $325 million tax refund in the first quarter, a similarly sized tax payment in the second quarter, and our initial pension contributions also beginning in the second quarter. With that, I think we're ready for questions. Sean?"

That's reflected more than anything else because of the timing of award fees. I always like to remind people, that IS&GS has the largest percentage of its operating profit that it receives in the form of award fees. And this particular year 2010, has a greater abundance of that award fee pool in the second half of the year, most specifically in the fourth quarter this year. That's just the way the contracts kind of fell out this year. So our expectation going forward, Rob, is probably the next three quarters are going to be somewhat similar to first quarter of maybe a little bit higher than that. But then we would expect some movement higher than that in the fourth quarter as we recognized the receipt of some of those award fees."

What we are doing now with our customers, as we work on what I’ve described as the re-base lining of the program, is to re-orient the scope of work that these to be done, to highlight those critically important milestones that demonstrate tangible accomplishment. That is something our customers want and insist on. And David, so do we. It's vitally an important to lock up the requirements, to know what's expected, and to be able to put our resources and talent against those expectations, such that we have very measurable results at a milestone point. We are then working with customers to allocate the award fee potential that's embedded in that $614 million, to each of those milestones to reflect their relative value. The degree to which we are able to earn that $614 million is absolutely tied to the degree we are able to execute the requirements that those milestones are associated with. If we are perfect or near-perfect in our performance, then we ought to be able to recover all or near all of that $614 million. If we aren't, we'll keep you posted about how much of that we are able to recover. But I’m very pleased with the quality and the character of the discussions that orient our ability to earn award fee as a function of our demonstrated performance against milestones. In the vernacular, this is described as more of objective measures of performance rather than subjective measures. And I think we all like the objectivity of knowing what we have to do to earn a fee in the SDD program."

Your second question dealt with ULA equity earnings and talked about the spike that I mentioned last call. The spike I'm talking about is actually associated not with ULA. It's actually associated with USA, the United Space Alliance. Think of that as the entity that provides shuttle operations support. And the reason for the increase in the fourth quarter is because as we have the planned wind down of the shuttle program taking place in the fourth quarter, we think there are some risks that will be retired at that point that will allow us to make a pretty good increase in the bookings through that joint venture that’ll flow into our reported results. And you will see that. That’ll be a noticeable improvement in our Space Systems Company in its fourth quarter performance versus the other three quarters.

I don’t want to say historically because that sounds like too long a time horizon, but I'm old enough now that I've done this a few times. Every airplane program I’ve ever worked on and every airplane program that I’ve reviewed has a similar set of circumstances that they face. We go through the development program. There are challenges in development. I assure you we do not take these challenges lightly. In fact, I would tell you we respect the degree of difficulty in designing and developing and fielding new complex systems as much as anybody on this planet. I don't see anything at all extraordinarily more challenging on the F-35 that should adversely affect our ability to generate profitability and earn out margins here. In fact, there are several features of this program that I rather like. The more volume we have, the more stability we have. And that's why we're working so closely with the Department now to get a restructured program that increases the probability of success over the long run. Because that increased probability of success increases our probability of meeting all our expectations, including margin expectations. Having the international content, and I would say even with all the varying descriptions about the program that certainly there is no shortage of available today, international interest remains strong with eight partner countries and we have about eight countries who are not in the partnership basis who were making inquiries. So the FMS potential looks healthy as would the direct foreign sales potential. So our goal, and we addressed it a little bit on the SDD phase, is to build momentum and reduce risk and earn to the maximum extent practical a segment of that $614 million, be efficient in our ramp up of production, where we ought to be able to build upon the risk reduction in the program to improve our margin performance there, which I think is well established in the overall behavior program -- performance. And then look to the international marketplace. The other feature of the F-35 that I think is very interesting relative to profitability, is the overall sustainment opportunity in this program, because the architecture is quite different. Looking to us and our industry supply chain partners to play a significant role in the sustainment of the airplane over time. That again is going to be dependent upon our ability to execute and deliver value. And that's why we're so rigorously focused on making sure we've got the right resources and the right place at the right time. So I think there's every bit the earning opportunity on the F-35 as we've seen on any of our programs."

And in that building momentum, I think there are going to be some periods where we do better than plan and some periods where we don't do as well as planned, but my goal here is to look at the long-term trend and the opportunities and make sure we're responding properly. I'll tell you that if I look at January, February, March and April year-to-date, we’re a little bit below our cumulative plan. We were good in January and let me say February and March. And I think we completed the quarter a couple of tests ahead of the -- four tests over the plan of 29, so we were at 33. In April, we plan on 29 incremental flights. We’ve flown five times April to date. We're delivering more assets into the flight test program so we expected a more vigorous last portion of the month than first portion of the month. In every flight test program, and we're no different here, we faced the traditional things of planned maintenance actions, which really affects the phasing of the 29 flights that we wanted to accomplish. And then unplanned maintenance actions, which essentially means you take airplane out to the flight line and an actuator doesn't work. Or you get -- because these are instrumented airplanes, you get a reading on an instrument that is off nominal. We don't fly the airplane when we have that occasion because we want to understand -- the whole purpose of a test program is to understand the characterization of the airplane. Or weather delays, which we've seen -- I think a fair number of weather issues. We are going to fly this airplane irrespective of all of those challenges. So I tell you the arc of the test program is good to me. We’re accelerating through about 400 tests that we planned for the year 2010. And we'll keep you posted at each step along the way because it is certainly important that we demonstrate the maturity of the test program. I would tell you what -- my observation is sometimes, there's a more hyperbolic reaction to did you fly at 2:00 today and the consequences of that, which I think maybe amplify apprehension, that isn't warranted. But on the other hand, it is absolutely necessary for us to fly more sorties with the 12 flyers that we have, to deliver them into the flight test program and demonstrate the maturity of the airplane. And we're doing that. And we're not going to do that in a way that attempts to skirt any test at all. And our behavior has very consistently been to put a priority on building a very high quality jet that meets all the key performance parameters and then go test that, not to thrift on any of the performance to try to accomplish a series of tests."

And then we very much routinely look at how we can best deploy that cash. I know you're familiar with the discussion because it's not a new discussion for us. We certainly look at dividend policy. We look at share repurchases. We’ve committed to at least 50% of free cash flow returned to investors because of the strength in our cash generation. We’ve exceeded that goal consistently and considerably. And we look at the string-of-pearls acquisition strategy, which we want continue to do, but we’re very selective in those acquisitions. So I assure you that we're very focused on both sides of the equation: the ability to go generate cash because we've earned that and then also how we can best deploy that cash to the interest of our shareholders.

It will include a careful examination of our repurchase strategy and philosophy that has really been based on opportunistic share repurchases.

If there are competitive opportunities, we have a long, I think, well-understood set of capabilities in, not only human space flight, but exploration. So we'd be interested, but you know those opportunities are going to be characterized by among other things whether we're asked to invest, what the quality of the investment would look like, would there be a return on investment. The one thing I think we know about the space environment, particularly human spaceflight, it is a tough, demanding environment. In other words, the performance levels for escape velocity, among other things, are so extreme and the performance margins are so tight, you really got to be at the top of your game here. And we work hard to make sure we are at the top of our game. The other aspect that aligns with our interests on the overall space component of the business might be opportunities in the United Launch Alliance. For more lift capability from the Atlas and the Delta systems that are in ULA.

So I mentioned earlier here, Peter, the compliment to Secretary Gates on advancing again the discussion of providing genuine reform to the export control policies of the country. We do this",496,"Yes, I’ll start up and Bruce will back up with a little detail. So I mentioned earlier here, Peter, the compliment to Secretary Gates on advancing again the discussion of providing genuine reform to the export control policies of the country. We do this a lot as you would expect and our observations about the system are very clear. We have a lot of really good people working in the government overseeing a process to assure that we don't diminish the security of our country because we allow technologies to escape. The people are good; the process is not as effective as it should be. And what we've asked the people to do is to essentially work harder and harder and harder and more diligently in a process that isn't serving us well because the process is too broad and too amorphous. And in that broadness, it slows down the overall tempo of companies like ours to effectively compete in an accelerating global marketplace. And I assure you nobody, particularly nobody here, will ever take a step toward releasing the kind of technology that would make our country less secure. And that is an immutable condition. But we think if we focused a system on really examining with care the most critical technologies and absolutely safeguarding them with rigor and letting the rest of the market flow, it would improve our prospects internationally. We think it’d be enormously good for the U.S. economy. I think it would probably be part of a formula that would add to job creation. And then I look at our company specifically and note we've got a mature portfolio. That portfolio includes programs like the F-16, the F-35, the C-130J, Air and Missile Defense programs like FAD and Patriot and Aegis that already have international content. I mentioned the prospects, again without overreaching a current set of challenges. The Littoral Combat Ship interests me. The prospects of a joint light tactical vehicle that would have not only key interest in the U.S. but have the ability to build international constituency. I like that very much because I think those kinds of program opportunities really create an architecture where you can give the very best value for our U.S. government customers and citizens and taxpayers who fund those programs, give them the very best industrial opportunities for international suppliers, with whom we have great partnerships. And also give those foreign governments great access to systems that are not only high quality in and of themselves, but tend to be far more interoperable and far more aligned so that when our nation has to act with other nations, these systems have already been balanced so that they work effectively and well together. So I do think our goals are achievable here and we build our system’s architectures around the prospects that we can secure the technology we can't release. They’ll be open and extensible and interoperable so that we can include international participants."

You asked for some kind of specifics as far as how we go about achieving the objective of 20% of sales in 2012. We start off -- we had a good first quarter other than I think Bob hit several of these. But we did have the F-16 buy to Egypt for 20 aircraft. We also had sale of some Sniper Targeting, Sniper and Lantern, actually, Targeting and Navigation pods for Turkey, and we had the two aircraft that Bob mentioned for C-130Js with Tunisia. Later this year, we're looking to hopefully close a potential C-130J deal for the UAE worth somewhere on the order of 12 aircraft potentially. There’s also a PAC-3 deal for both Taiwan and UAE towards the latter half of the year. And I'll just say as we sit here today we feel good about our ability to get to that 20% because as we sit –- especially as we get towards the end on 2010, a lot of what's going to materialize in terms of sales in 2012 will be in backlog by the end of 2012. Specifically, the F-16 program and the C-130s, we can already see the international content that’s going to be delivered in 2012.

We think the Intel business will stay fairly flat, more a function of just the smaller size of individual contracts being awarded there. The sheer numbers of contracts we are seeing in the Intelligence side haven’t necessarily changed, but the dollar size of those programs has diminished somewhat. So our growth is going to be driven by those two LOBs, Civil and Defense, and we still feel that somewhere in the 6% to 8% range for the year is achievable.

I hope you had an opportunity to read our earnings release and take a look at our updated guidance. Overall in the quarter, our operational tempo and our execution were strong. Quality levels were good and each business area achieved expected results. 
In the United States, since we last spoke, several events have occurred. The President proposed the Defense budget for 2011 at $549 billion, which was 3% over 2010 budget levels. When we look out over the longer term, the future-year Defense program, that's the projection that looks out over a five-year horizon, maintains an overall 3% growth projection for DoD. And then finally, the Quadrennial Defense Review, that more strategically oriented document, was also completed and released. And the priorities outlined in the QDR provide a solid level of support for a number of our lines of business in our programs including the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter for the fleet replacement aircraft, our FAD. PAC-3 and Aegis systems for mobile and sea-based missile defense, the advanced VHF Satellite for space command control communications and the intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions that communication supports and our Littoral Combat Ship for advanced surface-enabled combatants. Clearly, our customers continue to address the dual demands of expanding missions and fiscal pressures. And we're working hard to support them by meeting our commitments, to shorten our cycle times, to overall reduce our costs and focus more on affordability. 
Internationally, we see the opportunity horizon expanding. With demand aligning well with our product portfolio. And we are pleased with the international awards we saw in the first quarter that included 20 new F-16 aircraft for Egypt, two new C-130J airlifters for Tunisia, Sniper and Lantern Targeting systems for Turkey and a ten-year logistic support contract for New Zealand's Defence Forces. 
Last year, we increased our goal for international revenue, such that we’d generate 20% of total revenue from our international business. And we're on track to achieve that goal by 2012. And yesterday, we were pleased to see a renewed call for export control reform that was brought forward by Secretary Gates. 
Let me turn to our operations for a moment, where I think we had a solid quarter and we met some key objectives in each business area. In Aeronautics, Ralph Heath and the Aeronautics team maintained overall a good operational tempo. And there are three areas that warrant greater discussion. The F-35 is getting lots of extra attention, as a result of the restructuring process that addresses risk and positions the program for success and working through the Nunn-McCurdy recertification process. And I think here, there may be some confusion about how the restructuring of the program and the Nunn-McCurdy recertification process align. They are both really born out of the same fundamental assessment of the program that evaluated our ability to execute and included a variety of estimates of risk factors that could affect the program. The restructuring was initiated to reduce the overall risk of the program in order to facilitate the Nunn-McCurdy recertification. When we look at the restructuring segment, you'd see a 13-month extension to the system design and development phase of the program, while adding $2.8 billion in funding, expanding the resources available on the program to reduce risk by adding software labs or adding resources to the flight test program, very specifically the addition of one United States Navy carrier version of the aircraft to improve our overall ability to turn around test flights. You'll see the addition of an additional low rate initial production contract that we refer to as LRIP #9. We've had a re-phasing of the production ramp, while incorporating some buy-to-budget flexibility. That means if our program performance is on track, there will be an opportunity to add airplanes to the ramp rate and then revising the program milestones. 
The Nunn-McCurdy recertification is led by the Department of Defense, specifically headed by Dr. Ash Carter, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition Technology and Logistics. And we play a supporting role in that process. I think that mechanism has been kicked off. There are five evaluation criteria that have to be satisfied, and we believe that process will successfully conclude probably in the June time frame. 
On the F-35, we’re focused on execution and know we need to improve our performance. And a key objective for us will be to build momentum in the program. That's momentum as we work to finalize the tasks in the development phase of the program, momentum as we efficiently accelerate the production ramp-up of the program and importantly to build on the accomplishments that are being achieved in the test program. 
In that test program, two flight tests were particularly meaningful to us. The achievement of the short takeoff and vertical landing of the STOVL aircraft, where we were able to measure the behavioral characteristics of the airplane, power lift, controls, stability, all of which were excellent and I think all that observed the tests were very pleased with those results. And the first flight of the mission systems-equipped F-35 which happened on April 7, which demonstrated an avionics capability that no other fighter has demonstrated. So we're going to continue to focus additional resources on execution and we'll continue to strengthen the team on the F-35. 
In Aeronautics, we're also building volume on the C-130J production program. We've commented to you over time our desire to expand this phase of the program, building on our 16 aircraft delivered last year to 26 airplanes delivered this year. I think we've noted that those deliveries are likely to be phased toward the second half of the year. But overall demand for the airplane looks very solid and the performance of the aircraft has been really superior. 
Also in Aeronautics, we've been modernizing the C-5 Galaxy aircraft. This is a very heavy lift segment of our U.S. lift component, and putting new engines and essentially new cockpits and new avionics in the aircraft. This program has successfully passed a very rigorous operational test and evaluation set of criteria and has now been certified as effective and mission-capable. We’ve delivered three of these airplanes to the United States Air Force. And the current plans call for us to deliver 52 fully modernized C-5s by 2016. It's my sense that if we continue to show real value here, real excellence in execution and performance and if the demands on U.S. airlift continue, there may be opportunities to talk about expanding that number in the future. But here again, we're very much focused on executing the current program of record. 
Marilyn Houston [ph] and her electronics team continue excellent operational performance across the portfolio. And I think the Littoral Combat Ship deserves special mention. Our first Littoral Combat Ship, the USS Freedom, was deployed by the Navy this quarter. And it was deployed two years ahead of schedule. And I think the Navy is very proud of that accomplishment. And I can certainly tell you that we and our LCS team are very proud of our ability to shorten cycle times, which has been a key objective of our company and in alignment with the objectives of our customers. In operations, the ship's already intercepted four drug-smuggling ships. And I think the crew of the Freedom is demonstrating superior performance in their prosecution of important missions. 
Our second ship, the Fort Worth, is more than 30% complete and is on its planned schedule and cost profiles. We've submitted our bid for the next 10-ship buy that would result, if we were successful in prevailing in the competition, to an initial award of two ships and options for eight further ships. And the Navy's decision as to selecting the winning design for the overall 55-ship fleet will probably be undertaken in the third quarter. So we'll keep you posted and look forward to that. 
I don't want to play through the demands we're focusing on competing for and winning, the instant contract with the United States Navy. But I would note one of our objectives has been to try to look to aggregate demand for systems that have solid baselines that are flexible and extensible for a variety of customers. And this includes bringing in international customers into baseline programs because the benefits are really quite manifest. It's very good for U.S. customers because it lowers the cost of every ship the U.S. buys. It's very good for the international customers because it has the same cost advantage. And it's good for us because we have a broader, more stable program that lets us integrate the global supply chain more effectively, get higher quality and really drive value for everyone. So I am pleased that, given the nature of the design of our ship, its performance in an operational environment, the steel semi-planning monohull design, all of which appeal strongly to a variety of international customers. So as you might expect, we're very focused on assuring we present good value to the United States Navy in our bid. 
Moving to Information Systems and Global Services, Linda Gooden and the IS&GS team have also achieved a key milestone this quarter, with the commencement of their support of the 2010 Census program. And I know you've all heard a lot about the Census. The role we play through our DRIS program, it’s the Decennial Response Integration System, is to conclude form processing and data capture that standardizes the response from potentially more than 300 million American citizens. The U.S. Census effort, as you know, is crucial to assuring the right resource allocation across the country. It's required by the Constitution. And we feel confident that we'll be in a position to enable the administration to complete and review the Census by December. In my judgment, our work on the Census is a good example of the broad range of information technology programs and support and services that IS&GS provides to a wide variety of U.S. government agencies. 
And finally in our Space Systems group under Joanne Maguire, we continue to make significant progress on the advanced, extremely high-frequency satellite system. This is a next-generation communication system that's an essential element in secure military communications. And our first spacecraft is moving very close to delivery now in preparation for a launch in mid-2010. These new secure communications Satellites replace the Milstar series of Satellites that many of you are familiar with. 
To give you a sense of performance and how performance adds to value, because I think we spend a lot of time, appropriately, talking about our cost performance and our schedule performance as we execute contracts. We probably, together, spend less time talking about capabilities that we're delivering. A single, advanced VHF Satellite provides more communications capacity than the entire Milstar constellation that's flying today. So while we face challenges from time to time on cost and schedule, we do have meaningful accomplishments in adding to overall value, the capability of systems like the measurable capability improvement on advanced VHF. Many of our Satellites last considerably longer than their design life, which we call mean mission duration. So they last longer, that provides value. And as I mentioned in the case of LCS, we were able to shorten the cycle time and move resources into the operational theaters sooner, which is genuine value to customers. On advanced VHF, we're under contract for three Satellites. But we envision a possible expansion of this constellation to include six Satellites, as DoD now looks to assure the appropriate priorities for secure communications in space. 
Before I leave Space Systems, we've had much discussion with you and others about human space flight and the constellation program for NASA, particularly our component of the constellation program, the Orion crew exploration vehicle. Last Thursday, President Obama, when visiting the Cape in Florida, outlined a revision for the program, calling for a modified version of the Orion capsule to act as an emergency escape vehicle to serve the International Space Station. In the earlier plan that was described in February with the release of the President's budget submission to Congress, the Orion program was to be eliminated. This new capsule, we believe, would likely be launched within the next few years and would certainly leverage and utilize the significant technology advances that our team has achieved since the original Orion contract award in 2005. And we're very much looking forward to continuing work on the human space flight program through Orion. 
I think these operational highlights illustrate our corporate-wide focus on program execution; on completing key milestones; on continuously improving quality; and importantly, on focusing on affordability which our customers need. As I look forward, I remain optimistic about our future because our product portfolio remains well supported, based on the recent budget submissions for 2011; based on the revised priorities that have been outlined in the Quadrennial Defense Review in the future year Defense programs; and based on the changing security environment globally and the quality of our portfolio as viewed through the eyes of our international customers, where I think there will be more international opportunities. 
We also maintain our interest in the potential that may reside in adjacent and horizon markets as we explore opportunities in cyber security, logistics and sustainment, particularly the logistics and sustainment activities that are improved through the application of information technology resources, prospects for healthcare information technology or energy management or renewable power generation. So we're carefully examining the quality and changes in those market segments. 
And I would be very much remiss if I didn't comment on the quality of our workforce, because I think our team has had an outstanding quarter. And that is very much due to the dedication and professionalism of the women and men who work in our company. They have not allowed themselves to be distracted by the increasing velocity of events or the increasing tempo of activities that we see around the globe. They're very much focused on our customers. They're very much focused on achieving excellence in what they do. And I'm very proud to have the opportunity to represent them and work with them. So let me turn to Bruce, and he'll give you some additional detail on the quarter. And then we'll open it up for your questions."

To help with our discussions today, we've included some charts on our website and I would encourage you to open the charts and follow along as I make my comments. So starting off with the first quarter sales summary on Chart 3. Overall, the",780,"Thanks, Bob. To help with our discussions today, we've included some charts on our website and I would encourage you to open the charts and follow along as I make my comments. 
So starting off with the first quarter sales summary on Chart 3. Overall, the corporation grew 3% in the quarter. That was actually slightly higher than what I mentioned during the January call. Aeronautics had the strongest growth at 5% over last year's number. It was driven by the F-35 program, which grew over 25% when compared to 2009. IS&GS grew 4%, with most of that coming from the Civil and Defense lines of business. And comparisons with the 2009 performance were hurt somewhat, because sales for the TMOS, and remember TMOS is the ground segment portion of the TSAT program, and the MTA contracts were included in first quarter 2009 results but were terminated in the second quarter of last year. 
Electronic Systems was flat when compared to last year. This was actually also somewhat higher than expected, given that the presidential helicopter were in our 2009 results. And we had growth in Missiles, Fire Control & Training that was able to offset that reduction. Space System was also flat versus 2009. And there, we had higher activity on the Orion program, which was offset by lower activity in our Strategic and Defensive Missiles line of business. 
Turning now to Chart 4 and our cash flow. We had record cash generation, over $1.6 billion in the first quarter. And that did represent the highest quarterly cash from operations in our history. Due to this strong generation of cash in the quarter, we increased our full year cash from operations guidance by $100 million to $3.3 billion. 
If you’ll now look at Chart 5, for a discussion of our net debt and debt maturities. As a result of our strong cash generated in the quarter, our net debt is around $1.5 billion. That, combined with no debt maturities until 2013, gives us great flexibility and a strong capital position for a number of years. 
On the next chart, Chart 6, we'll discuss our share repurchase activity. You can see we repurchased 6.5 million shares, worth over $500 million in the quarter. We're on track or ahead of our goal to buy back at least $1 billion of shares this year. And these actions reduced shares outstanding to 368.5 million, the lowest level in our history. And at quarter's end, we also had 22 million shares remaining in our share repurchase authorization. 
Next, I'd like to highlight our earnings per share performance on Chart 7. Like many other companies this quarter, we had an unusual charge as a result of the recently enacted legislation affecting Medicare Part D., which we disclosed in an 8-K filing last month. That resulted in a $0.25 reduction to our EPS. And if you adjusted our GAAP EPS for this charge and for the FAS/CAS impact, the resulting adjusted EPS would be $1.89 per share. 
Finally, if you turn to Chart 8, we'll reconcile the revised 2010 EPS guidance with a January numbers. Starting with our January guidance of $7.15 to $7.35 per share, the effect of the Medicare Part D charge I talked about earlier reduced the guidance by $0.25. We were able to offset a portion of that impact through an improved outlook in our investment income and other corporate accounts. And this $0.10 improvement, results in a net $0.15 reduction in our new guidance on $7 to $7.20 per share. 
So overall a solid quarter and in line with of our expectations. As we look forward to the rest of the year, we expect the second quarter sales growth over 2009 to be similar to what we experienced in the first quarter. And overall, the second half of the year should have higher growth in the first half, with the third quarter in particular having higher growth than the fourth quarter. We expect margins to remain in the mid to upper 10% range in both the second and third quarters and then move higher in the fourth quarter as we discussed on the last call. We expect cash from operations will be lower in the next three quarters compared with first quarter, as we make $1.4 billion in discretionary contributions to our pension trust. In particular, the second quarter will likely be about $1 billion lower than the first quarter, as we had a $325 million tax refund in the first quarter, a similarly sized tax payment in the second quarter, and our initial pension contributions also beginning in the second quarter. With that, I think we're ready for questions. Sean?"

That's just the way the contracts kind of fell out this year.

That is something our customers want and insist on. And David, so do we. It's vitally an important to lock up the requirements, to know what's expected, and to be able to put our resources and talent against those expectations, such that we have very measurable results at a milestone point. We are then working with customers to allocate the award fee potential that's embedded in that $614 million, to each of those milestones to reflect their relative value. The degree to which we are able to earn that $614 million is absolutely tied to the degree we are able to execute the requirements that those milestones are associated with.

It's actually associated with USA, the United Space Alliance. Think of that as the entity that provides shuttle operations support. And the reason for the increase in the fourth quarter is because as we have the planned wind down of the shuttle program taking place in the fourth quarter, we think there are some risks that will be retired at that point that will allow us to make a pretty good increase in the bookings through that joint venture that’ll flow into our reported results. And you will see that. That’ll be a noticeable improvement in our Space Systems Company in its fourth quarter performance versus the other three quarters.

I don’t want to say historically because that sounds like too long a time horizon, but I'm old enough now that I've done this a few times. Every airplane program I’ve ever worked on and every airplane program that I’ve reviewed has a similar set of circumstances that they face. We go through the development program. There are challenges in development. I assure you we do not take these challenges lightly. In fact, I would tell you we respect the degree of difficulty in designing and developing and fielding new complex systems as much as anybody on this planet. I don't see anything at all extraordinarily more challenging on the F-35 that should adversely affect our ability to generate profitability and earn out margins here. In fact, there are several features of this program that I rather like. The more volume we have, the more stability we have. And that's why we're working so closely with the Department now to get a restructured program that increases the probability of success over the long run. Because that increased probability of success increases our probability of meeting all our expectations, including margin expectations. Having the international content, and I would say even with all the varying descriptions about the program that certainly there is no shortage of available today, international interest remains strong with eight partner countries and we have about eight countries who are not in the partnership basis who were making inquiries. So the FMS potential looks healthy as would the direct foreign sales potential. So our goal, and we addressed it a little bit on the SDD phase, is to build momentum and reduce risk and earn to the maximum extent practical a segment of that $614 million, be efficient in our ramp up of production, where we ought to be able to build upon the risk reduction in the program to improve our margin performance there, which I think is well established in the overall behavior program -- performance. And then look to the international marketplace. The other feature of the F-35 that I think is very interesting relative to profitability, is the overall sustainment opportunity in this program, because the architecture is quite different. Looking to us and our industry supply chain partners to play a significant role in the sustainment of the airplane over time. That again is going to be dependent upon our ability to execute and deliver value. And that's why we're so rigorously focused on making sure we've got the right resources and the right place at the right time. So I think there's every bit the earning opportunity on the F-35 as we've seen on any of our programs."

And in that building momentum, I think there are going to be some periods where we do better than plan and some periods where we don't do as well as planned, but my goal here is to look at the long-term trend and the opportunities and make sure we're responding properly. I'll tell you that if I look at January, February, March and April year-to-date, we’re a little bit below our cumulative plan. We were good in January and let me say February and March. And I think we completed the quarter a couple of tests ahead of the -- four tests over the plan of 29, so we were at 33. In April, we plan on 29 incremental flights. We’ve flown five times April to date. We're delivering more assets into the flight test program so we expected a more vigorous last portion of the month than first portion of the month. In every flight test program, and we're no different here, we faced the traditional things of planned maintenance actions, which really affects the phasing of the 29 flights that we wanted to accomplish. And then unplanned maintenance actions, which essentially means you take airplane out to the flight line and an actuator doesn't work. Or you get -- because these are instrumented airplanes, you get a reading on an instrument that is off nominal. We don't fly the airplane when we have that occasion because we want to understand -- the whole purpose of a test program is to understand the characterization of the airplane. Or weather delays, which we've seen -- I think a fair number of weather issues. We are going to fly this airplane irrespective of all of those challenges. So I tell you the arc of the test program is good to me. We’re accelerating through about 400 tests that we planned for the year 2010. And we'll keep you posted at each step along the way because it is certainly important that we demonstrate the maturity of the test program. I would tell you what -- my observation is sometimes, there's a more hyperbolic reaction to did you fly at 2:00 today and the consequences of that, which I think maybe amplify apprehension, that isn't warranted. But on the other hand, it is absolutely necessary for us to fly more sorties with the 12 flyers that we have, to deliver them into the flight test program and demonstrate the maturity of the airplane. And we're doing that. And we're not going to do that in a way that attempts to skirt any test at all. And our behavior has very consistently been to put a priority on building a very high quality jet that meets all the key performance parameters and then go test that, not to thrift on any of the performance to try to accomplish a series of tests."

We look at share repurchases. We’ve committed to at least 50% of free cash flow returned to investors because of the strength in our cash generation. We’ve exceeded that goal consistently and considerably. And we look at the string-of-pearls acquisition strategy, which we want continue to do, but we’re very selective in those acquisitions. So I assure you that we're very focused on both sides of the equation: the ability to go generate cash because we've earned that and then also how we can best deploy that cash to the interest of our shareholders.

If there are competitive opportunities, we have a long, I think, well-understood set of capabilities in, not only human space flight, but exploration. So we'd be interested, but you know those opportunities are going to be characterized by among other things whether we're asked to invest, what the quality of the investment would look like, would there be a return on investment. The one thing I think we know about the space environment, particularly human spaceflight, it is a tough, demanding environment. In other words, the performance levels for escape velocity, among other things, are so extreme and the performance margins are so tight, you really got to be at the top of your game here. And we work hard to make sure we are at the top of our game. The other aspect that aligns with our interests on the overall space component of the business might be opportunities in the United Launch Alliance.

Well, the timing is a little bit off on the horizon. We’re looking at requests for information.

Well, the timing is a little bit off on the horizon. We’re looking at requests for information. As the administration now looks to -- based on all that was learned on the VH-71 program, what the right definition, what the right systems components, what the right mission profile would be for a replacement for the presidential helicopter. So I would tell you we’re at the early stages of conceptualizing what would be required and what would be necessary, while we're including in the broader conversation the lessons from the VH-71 program. We have had, Ron, I think very good experience and really high-quality credentials in putting mission systems into helicopters. And that is an area of specialization for our company I'd say respectfully, we're good at it. And we've had a relationship with Sikorsky on the MH-60 Romeo and Sierra helicopter programs where we play that role in a Sikorsky platform in a fashion that's been good for Sikorsky, good for us and I think highly valued by our customers. And so it's the basis of that relationship and the quality of the interface and interaction that we've had there. And our own reflection that we have learned a lot on the VH-71 program and I personally believe much of the mission systems work that was done under that contract would be certainly valuable to take a serious look at. And our relationship with Sikorsky our experience of working together, being the mission system integrator on their airframes, it's been a good and productive one that's familiar to us, familiar to them and has given good value to customers and that's why we did what we did."

We do this",496,"Yes, I’ll start up and Bruce will back up with a little detail. So I mentioned earlier here, Peter, the compliment to Secretary Gates on advancing again the discussion of providing genuine reform to the export control policies of the country. We do this a lot as you would expect and our observations about the system are very clear. We have a lot of really good people working in the government overseeing a process to assure that we don't diminish the security of our country because we allow technologies to escape. The people are good; the process is not as effective as it should be. And what we've asked the people to do is to essentially work harder and harder and harder and more diligently in a process that isn't serving us well because the process is too broad and too amorphous. And in that broadness, it slows down the overall tempo of companies like ours to effectively compete in an accelerating global marketplace. And I assure you nobody, particularly nobody here, will ever take a step toward releasing the kind of technology that would make our country less secure. And that is an immutable condition. But we think if we focused a system on really examining with care the most critical technologies and absolutely safeguarding them with rigor and letting the rest of the market flow, it would improve our prospects internationally. We think it’d be enormously good for the U.S. economy. I think it would probably be part of a formula that would add to job creation. And then I look at our company specifically and note we've got a mature portfolio. That portfolio includes programs like the F-16, the F-35, the C-130J, Air and Missile Defense programs like FAD and Patriot and Aegis that already have international content. I mentioned the prospects, again without overreaching a current set of challenges. The Littoral Combat Ship interests me. The prospects of a joint light tactical vehicle that would have not only key interest in the U.S. but have the ability to build international constituency. I like that very much because I think those kinds of program opportunities really create an architecture where you can give the very best value for our U.S. government customers and citizens and taxpayers who fund those programs, give them the very best industrial opportunities for international suppliers, with whom we have great partnerships. And also give those foreign governments great access to systems that are not only high quality in and of themselves, but tend to be far more interoperable and far more aligned so that when our nation has to act with other nations, these systems have already been balanced so that they work effectively and well together. So I do think our goals are achievable here and we build our system’s architectures around the prospects that we can secure the technology we can't release. They’ll be open and extensible and interoperable so that we can include international participants."

Later this year, we're looking to hopefully close a potential C-130J deal for the UAE worth somewhere on the order of 12 aircraft potentially. There’s also a PAC-3 deal for both Taiwan and UAE towards the latter half of the year. And I'll just say as we sit here today we feel good about our ability to get to that 20% because as we sit –- especially as we get towards the end on 2010, a lot of what's going to materialize in terms of sales in 2012 will be in backlog by the end of 2012.

We think the Intel business will stay fairly flat, more a function of just the smaller size of individual contracts being awarded there.

So our growth is going to be driven by those two LOBs, Civil and Defense, and we still feel that somewhere in the 6% to 8% range for the year is achievable.

We have a lot to update you on today, and I would like to get right to it so I'll proceed on the basis that you’ve had a chance to read the earnings release and see our updated guidance. I'd like to start with an operational overview then I'll walk you through the highlights on a business area by business area basis.
In Aeronautics, there are three programs I want to cover, and I want to start with the F-35 program, as the Joint Strike Fighter remains our program of greatest opportunity and greatest challenge. And I want to spend a bit more time on some additional detail with you here so that you have a good feel for where we are in the program. 
In the quarter, the government completed the Nunn-McCurdy recertification process, finding the F-35 to be essential to national security and a high priority. Extensive cost assessments and risk analyses were conducted and evaluated by DoD, highlighting areas requiring additional focus, adding resources to the development program and flight test and in software development while lowering the near-term production ramp rate by 122 airplanes. 
The program executive officer, that's the senior-most government official on the program, that position was elevated from a two-star billet to a three-star billet, and Admiral Dave Venlet, a superbly qualified professional with lots of relevant experience, is now in this role. In recognizing that there are program uncertainties and risks remaining, DoD called for a series of what will be routine ongoing reviews to monitor performance and to make adjustments, and the first of these reviews under Admiral Venlet, known as a technical baseline review, is now underway and likely to be completed by the end of the year.
Let me look at the program now in two segments or phases. First, the System Development and Demonstration phase. The work here I regard as the front end of the program, where it's essential to get the design, the development of the aircraft and the test of the aircraft and its systems right. I think of this as the nonrecurring part of the program. It's important to get it right here to assure that our customers get systems that meet their needs, and I think it's critical here to focus on overall performance to assure we get it right. 
And then I'll talk about the Production phase of the program, which includes long-term aircraft delivery profiles that we think on the Joint Strike Fighter are likely to extend over decades. In my mind, this is where the majority of the costs reside and this is where affordability will ultimately be determined, so here it's critical to focus on costs. We are now at a critical juncture on the program as I think you all know of transitioning from the development program more fully into the production program. 
In the System Development and Demonstration segment of the program, we're about 80% complete. We have 15 of 19 test articles currently being evaluated, and the four remaining are in build. This 19 test article total excludes the prospect of an additional carrier variant that was discussed during the Nunn-McCurdy recertification process. Of the 19 aircraft, 13 are fliers in the flight test program and six are structural test articles, and all of those six structural test articles either are in test or have completed their test. And of the 13 fliers, nine have now flown.
In the quarter, we added the first carrier variant to the test fleet and the early reports from this airplane are that it’s flying very well. Also on the carrier variant, we completed a successful drop test of the ground test article, which simulates the intensity of carrier landings. Now here envision dropping the airframe from progressive heights that go up to about 12 feet. And in this test program, we noticed no failures or no load exceedances. So that's a very good set of results from this important test which is essential in demonstrating the structural integrity necessary for carrier operations. 
In testing the conventional takeoff and landing variant, early flights already exceed the 7G loading conditions which is good. Static testing or measuring the ultimate strength of the airframe is complete with no structural failures, and we've begun durability testing to verify that the airframe will meet the plane’s 8,000-hour life. 
We have two airplanes equipped with mission systems: one short takeoff and vertical landing and one conventional takeoff and landing. These mission systems aircraft give us early insight as to the performance of advanced avionics, like the Active Electronically Scanned Array Radar, the electronic warfare systems, the communications suite, the advanced targeting system and so forth. The goal here is to get some sense of sensor fusion or the ability to assemble information from different systems to generate greater levels of situational awareness, not just for the pilot, but for all those who would have information streams linked to the Joint Strike Fighter, and I think all are pleased with the early results of the test of the mission systems airplanes.
Let me give you some detail on the status of the flight test program. Year-to-date through June, we've flown 136 flights against the plan of 118 flights, so overall, we've had a good tempo and we're running ahead in total numbers. When I break down that total for you by variant, you will see that the conventional takeoff and landing airplane has flown 56x against the plan of 22, and the carrier variant has flown 6x against the plan of one. So we're getting solid early performance here, performance on flights that was better than planned. And we're getting good feedback from the airplanes, and all this is very positive. 
On the STOVL airplane, we have flown 74x against a plan of 95x. Here, we wanted to accomplish more vertical landings, satisfy more test points and get more information sooner, but we've thus far been unable to do so, so the question becomes why are the CTOL and the CV aircraft running ahead of plan as STOVL runs behind plan. The answer lies in the early reliability of selected components on the STOVL aircraft where we're seeing failure rates that are higher than predicted. Now, I'd describe these components to you as the ones you would probably not view as major systems like the engine, which is working very well. Recall we’ve flown supersonic and we’ve hovered with the airplane. Or the lift fan or the control laws or other such major components. The components that are failing are more of the things that would appear either smaller or more ordinary like thermal cooling fans, door actuators, selected valves or switches or components of the power system. So when these components don't work because of their initial low reliability, we don't fly, and we don't fly because assuring safety is our uncompromised highest priority. And often, the maintenance action to address these components takes longer than you think given the less significant nature of the parts involved. In some cases, we've had to remove the engine to get access to the component, and because we're in the early stages of flight test where we all exercise an abundance of caution, it's important to perform an additional series of tests when you take the engine out including ground tests, which consumes a lot of time to get to a more ordinary part like a cooling fan. We're now working with our customers on a variety of actions to address the STOVL flight test pressure.
They include identifying the troublesome components and working with suppliers to understand and improve their reliability. Perhaps examining supplier manufacturing processes or examining whether we need to have them change the design of the parts or change the sparing or provisioning on the program simply to have more parts available. Given what we've seen, both we and our customer subject matter experts believe this component reliability condition can be corrected and the inherent reliability can and will be improved. 
Together, we're also looking at ways to improve the overall flight test efficiency with the goal of improving tempo. Here we'll look at rephasing activities, adding some selective resources that we have already begun to do, looking at additional aircraft instrumentation and perhaps looking at different concepts of operation. And let me give you one example of the family of things we might consider here. 
We'll look at hot-pitting the aircraft which means that we don't turn the engine off on the airplane, we refuel it with the engine running, and we go fly again on the theory that when the aircraft is flying well and when weather conditions are cooperating, we keep flying the airplane as much as possible. This will reduce the turnaround time of the jets, and interestingly, it could create a condition where we have fewer flights because the flight is actually measured at the end of the mission where we shut the engine off. If we don't shut the engine off to get more data by reducing turnaround time, we have fewer flights, but we can certainly generate more information which is the essential purpose and the ultimate goal of the flight test program. So we are working with customers throughout the test community to envision ways to get more utility out of the assets that we have. 
During my last visit to Pax River where the Navy is testing the airplane. Going through not only a series of reviews, but walking the facility and the flight line, talking to the pilots who were flying the airplane and all those working on the aircraft, getting the advice of subject matter experts and meeting with Navy leadership, you just couldn't help being very impressed with the quality of the team, and this is a fully integrated test force, which means that the United States Navy, the United States Marine Corps personnel are working in conjunction with other government personnel and industry personnel in a completely seamless way. The subject matter experts that are at Pax River are genuinely impressive. They have lots of experience, and they have lots of relevant knowledge, and they are a first-rate team, and they're working smart and they're working hard, and we have the full and complete engagement of senior Navy and Marine Corps leadership. So I want to take a minute to extend my thanks and appreciation for their professionalism and dedication as they work on this flight test program.
Also in the SDD phase, we're developing software for the Joint Strike Fighter in five blocks. The second block of software, known as Block 0.5, which is the first Mission System software, is now flying on two airplanes. This block includes about 5.5 million lines of code. The early experience here is the software is of very good quality and functionality and importantly, it's demonstrating stable performance so we've been very pleased with the results here, although it took a little longer and required more resources than planned to deliver this block into the test program. 
Block 1.0 is now in development and scheduled to be released later in the third quarter. This block will add about another 1 million lines of code to the prior software. With this software delivery, the airplane will have more than 80% of its total software. We're going to spend a concentrated effort with our customers over the next several months during the technical baseline review process that I described earlier, looking at the overall software program, examining stability, quality, complexity, productivity, and we'll make adjustments accordingly appropriate because getting the right software on the program that demonstrates full mission capability is absolutely critical as a component of the SDD phase. 
In the production segment, we have 31 airplanes in the first three low-rate initial production lots, flowing in fabrication or assembly. We previously received long lead authorization for Lot 4 at 32 airplanes. We're now negotiating Lot 4 at present, receiving a very thorough and detailed review by the government customer that we expected. And Lot 4 will likely result in a fixed-price incentive-type contract when the negotiations conclude. And DoD also authorized $522 million for long-lead material associated with the next low-rate initial production option that's LRIP 5 at 42 airplanes. 
We continue to see improved cost performance, and our learning curve projections including those associated with Lot 4, continue to support long-term affordability objectives. And I think it's fair to say that the production cost trends overall remain on the favorable side of prior estimates which is where we all want them to be.
As with any accelerating production program, we do have some challenges. And our focus here is on retiring risks, working with the supply chain on phasing and quality and reliability and schedule maintenance, on reducing travels or out-of-cycle installations that put pressure on aircraft delivery schedule which we're seeing and working with the government independent manufacturing review team as they continue their assessment in the next regularly scheduled review cycle. 
On some other matters, we have an agreement on the corrective action plan to improve our EBMS system and appreciate the help we've received to establish a better foundation here. And international partners continue to express interest. The Italian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement for a $1 billion final assembly and check-out facility that we used for aircraft for Italy and the Netherlands. This is part of our worldwide supply chain strategy. 
Canada recently reaffirmed interest in 65 airplanes, and Israel continues to look at Joint Strike Fighter as a potential FMS buyer. On balance, then taken as a whole. The Joint Strike Fighter is showing strength in many areas of accomplishment with some areas needing more focus. In flight test, the conventional takeoff and landing aircraft, this is the airplane that will be sold in the greatest numbers and the carrier variant are doing well and STOVL needs more attention. In software development, quality, functionality and stability are good, and we need to focus on productivity. And in production, our learning curves support overall cost reduction and affordability objectives, and we need to address some schedule pressures.
On the C-130J airplane, our production buildup from 16 aircraft last year to 26 this year is on track. We delivered six airplanes in the second quarter, and customer interest here remains strong. In the second quarter, we received orders from Kuwait and Israel. On the C-5 modernization program, we inducted the third airlifter into the line. I think you’ll recall overall plans called for 52 airplanes to be modernized by 2016, and we think this approach to life extension provides great value to customers. 
In Electronic Systems, let me highlight two areas. In Ballistic Missile Defense, our FAD program achieved its seventh consecutive successful target intercept, demonstrating the ability to destroy a unitary target in the lower earth atmosphere, known as an endoatmospheric intercept, and this success expands again the operational envelope for this proven and capable system. This system is strongly supported as a DoD priority and offers both domestic and international sales potential.
On the Littoral Combat Ship program, our second ship, the Forth Worth, remains on cost and on schedule with now 55% of the construction completed. Our offer for the 10-ship buy has been submitted and we should learn of the Navy's decision, we think, sometime in August. We have been listening very carefully to the Navy and their expectations and have fashioned a low-risk cost-competitive approach to the program on a vessel that we think would also be of interest to international buyers. 
In Information Systems and Global Solutions on the Next Generation Identification System for the FBI, we've begun to fully develop and deploy a new capability to transform how law enforcement officials will search a wanted-person database. 
In one of our horizon market initiatives, we were pleased the Tech America Foundation named Lockheed Martin's Ironclad the Most Innovative Cybersecurity and Authentication Technology of the year. Ironclad is a new technology that shrinks a laptop's hard drive, operating system, software applications and files onto a secure USB flash drive. This program's another example of leveraging our overall expertise in data security as we work to provide cyber protection solutions to customers.
Lastly in IS&GS, earlier this month we were awarded a contract by DoD to manage the Special Operation Forces Support Activity, a contract known as SOFSA. This award with a value up to $5 billion over the next 10 years, represents a reinstatement of a contract that we had initially won last year and enables us to move forward to support our nation's special operation forces. As a result of our recent organizational realignment, the SOFSA contract will be managed by Electronic Systems as we move forward. 
Finally, our Space Systems team continues to demonstrate progress on the Orion program. By successfully completing the flight test of the Launch Abort system. The system pulls the crew module away from the launch vehicle during an emergency and will significantly improve crew safety for future human space flight. 
Other progress includes the successful completion of Phase I Safety Reviews of NASA's Human Rating Requirements addressing the design and operational concepts for the capsule. 
Beyond operations, on May 8 Secretary Gates challenged the Department of Defense to examine its internal cost structure and overhead expenses, with a goal to change the way the Department does business. Secretary Gates outlined a goal to save more than $100 billion over five years beginning in fiscal 2012 by reducing unnecessary expenses. The objective is to redeploy adequate funds to pay for troops and modernization while sustaining a growing top line defense budget. 
On June 28, Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Ash Carter, outlined his new focus to acquisition professionals in the defense industry. The new initiatives are designed to achieve cost savings in the defense acquisition system to enable funding for war provider capability, to grow at approximately 3% annually while maintaining a vibrant and financially healthy defense industry. We understand this new reality of escalating demands on our customers and increasing constraints on the resources available to achieve their missions. This new reality requires that we adapt and drive affordability to ensure that we're doing everything possible to make every dollar count. 
In support of these initiatives, we've implemented a number of actions. First, we've rebalanced our IS&GS portfolio, announcing plans to divest most of our Enterprise Integration Group and the Pacific Architects and Engineers unit. And there seems to be a good level of interest in these businesses. We also realigned our Readiness & Stability Operations in our Savi Technology business from IS&GS to Electronic Systems. These actions will strengthen our focus and our performance over the long run and help provide the best most affordable solutions to customers.
We've implemented a voluntary executive separation program designed to reduce layers of management, improve affordability, tighten reporting relationships and allow for more direct lines of communication both inside and outside the company. We reduced our presence at the Farnborough Air Show by 50%. We've cut our advertising budgets and reduced our travel expenses, and we're going to continue to work at every aspect of this company with a focus on reducing costs. These actions reflect that new reality and are designed to enable us to continue to deliver the best value to customers while positioning us for financial success for our shareholders. 
Even with this changing domestic framework, we continue to see strong alignment of our portfolio with overall program priorities, and believe we will grow more than the rate of growth in the base defense budget. 
And internationally, we see solid and expanding demand for our portfolio of products and continue to drive on our goal of increasing international business content to approximately 20% of corporate revenues by 2012. Well, with that slightly longer summary for you, I want to turn the call over to Bruce for some additional detail on the second quarter financial results, and then we'll open it up for your questions."

As we've done in prior calls, we've included charts on our website to help with this part of the discussion, and at this time, I’d encourage you to open the charts and follow along as I make my comments.Let's begin with Chart 3, which is",1122,"Thanks, Bob. As we've done in prior calls, we've included charts on our website to help with this part of the discussion, and at this time, I’d encourage you to open the charts and follow along as I make my comments.
Let's begin with Chart 3, which is just a reminder that all financials in today's web charts reflect the impact of the portfolio-shaping we announced earlier this quarter. First, Pacific Architects & Engineers was moved from the continuing results of IS&GS and to discontinued operations as we have decided to sell that business. As a result of this, we have lowered our sales guidance for the expected level of annual sales, but we were able to offset the earnings impact and our EPS guidance as you'll see on a later chart. EIG on the other hand will remain in continuing operations as we evaluate a sale versus a spinoff to our stockholders. 
Finally, we realigned our Readiness & Stability Operations, our RSO business, from IS&GS into Electronic Systems where it will be combined with Simulation, Training & Support to form the Global Training & Logistics line of business.
If you now turn to Chart 4 and our second quarter sales summary, overall, the Corporation grew 3% in the quarter, with all four business areas achieving growth above prior year’s levels. IS&GS had the highest growth of 6%, due primarily to growth in our civil line of business due to work with the census program and other IT work for numerous federal agencies. 
Electronic Systems generated revenue of $3.5 billion, with 4% growth in the quarter. This was driven primarily by global trending and logistics and tactical missiles at Missiles & Fire Control. Aeronautics grew 2% in the quarter, primarily from expansion on the F-35 low-rate initial production contracts and higher C-130 deliveries. 
Space Systems grew 1% in the quarter due to expansion in Government Satellites and growth in the Orion crew exploration vehicle work. This was tempered somewhat by the wind-down of the external tank fabrication resulting from the upcoming retirement of the shuttle fleet.
If we now look at Chart 5 and our Cash From Operations. Again this quarter cash was very strong as we generated in excess of $1.2 billion. And I'll point out, this was after making a cash contribution of $350 million to our pension trust in the quarter. The $2.9 billion through the first half of the year represents $500 million more than at this time last year. And looking forward to the second half of the year, we remain committed to contributing at least $1.05 billion additionally to reach our previously announced $1.4 billion in discretionary contributions to our pension plans. This remaining contribution to achieve the $1.4 billion level will be made entirely in the third quarter. And because of the strong cash generation this quarter, we are increasing our full year cash from operations guidance to at least $3.4 billion or $100 million above our prior projection of $3.3 billion.
If you now look at Chart 6 for a discussion on our ongoing activities in share repurchases. We increased our share repurchases by almost 50% above first quarter levels, repurchasing 9.7 million shares for $782 million. This brings the year-to-date level to 16.2 million shares for $1.3 billion, well above our stated goal to allocate $1 billion for share repurchases in 2010. Our share repurchase actions brought our balance sheet shares outstanding to around 360 million at the end of the quarter, a new low level in the corporation's history. 
Our next chart, Chart 7, will highlight our debt exchange that took place in the quarter. This chart shows all of our bond maturities over time which graphically shows that there are no debt maturities until 2013 which we've mentioned in the past. The yellow portion of the bars shows the amount of our high coupon bonds that were exchanged for new 30-year debt in 2040. Coupons range from 7.2% to 8.5% versus our new debt with a coupon rating of 5.72%. As the chart says, this extended our maturity while lowering the average coupon of our overall portfolio.
Moving next to Chart 8 and our Earnings Per Share performance, second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.96. This reflects a 5% increase from our prior level of $1.87. And the improvements resulted from improved operational performance and lower share count. On the right-hand side of the chart, the adjusted EPS of $2.41 per share increased 16% above last year's level, including the discontinued operations items, and $0.19 for the FAS/CAS adjustment. Finally, I'd like to turn to our full year 2010 EPS guidance reconciliation on Chart 9.
From what we provided in April, we were able to increase our guidance by $0.15 to a level of $7.15 to $7.35 per share due to our reduced share count outlook and improved operational performance in Space Systems. This level includes the impact of removing the annual earnings for PAE. 
Moving down the chart to our GAAP EPS outlook including discontinued operations, our outlook is for $7.45 to $7.65 per share, which includes the PAE earnings removed from continuing operations, plus a tax benefit from the difference between our book and tax basis which is required to be recognized as we classify PAE as being held for sale. 
I'll remind you that the values on this chart do not consider the effects of our previously announced voluntary executive separation program, and we'd expect to have that impact quantified during our third quarter earnings call. 
Overall, the second quarter results were solid and particularly strong in the area of cash from operations. As I look forward to the rest of the year, I think we'll continue to see that second half revenue will have higher growth than the first half, with overall margins fairly consistent with what we experienced in the first half. We expect third quarter cash to be down considerably as we make the over $1 billion investment in the pension plan payments to get to the $1.4 billion level we've previously discussed.
One final comment before we open for questions. We're revising our prior practice and we'll now wait until January to provide our initial financial guidance for 2011. We're still seeing tremendous volatility in both stock market performance and interest rate movement, and on top of that, cash harmonization still remains undecided at this time. So because of that we believe it makes more sense to wait until we have these numbers at year end rather than provide interim numbers in October. I also think this aligns us more closely with what our peers are doing in this area. And with that, I think we’re ready for your questions. Devon?"

I will tell you from my point of view, as we will take a fixed-price incentive type contract here, we certainly want to get this right so that we understand the risks and expectations. I think, there's a corollary for the people on the government's team to want to get it right from their point of view. So I don't feel that there's any particular distress here. There is no particular pressure. I just think it's a genuine effort for everybody to want to get it right. My feel is we're a couple of weeks away to finalize it. As I said, the ongoing discussions are fulsome. They are interactive and we are exchanging views and listening to proposals and counterproposals and options and thoughts and things. So I will tell you it's gone a little longer, but I would not characterize it as getting off track in some way. On redoing the SDD contract, I think that's going to take a bit of time, and I think that's going to take a bit of time because as I mentioned to you, there are a couple of reviews that I think we should all begin to internalize as ordinary and even routine on a program of this nature, and it might even grow to be routine on other programs that meet a threshold in the Department of Defense. In our case, it’s a technical baseline review that’s already commenced, and I think will be done -- I will tell you, October or November, I don't control the date on that, but we're certainly working in close conjunction with the review team, as well as an update to the independent manufacturing review team. And that's how I phased in my mind, Joe, the likely resolution of matters remaining in the SDD phase of the contract."

As you said, you're right at the 11.8% margin in the quarter, and I kind of think of that, as I compare it to last year's second quarter, as we've got much more F-35 volume bringing in with it lower margins than the rest of the portfolio. We also have in the quarter three additional C-130s, and those bring with it typically probably higher margin than the overall portfolio. Those are being offset by reductions in both the F-16 and F-22 program so that's kind of how we got to the second quarter here. I'll give you just a – I just found it kind of interesting as I was looking through some of the data, George, just to put it in perspective. For the first half of 2010, the development program that Bob mentioned for the F-35, the SDD contract, is 2/3 of what it was in the first half of 2009. While the LRIP contracts, think of these as the early production contracts, is twice what it was in the first half of 2009 so you see the phenomenon where we're shifting significantly from the SDD contract over to the LRIP contracts. As far as why we're seeing some downside in the second half of the year, you're right that there are higher C-130J sales both quantity-wise and dollar-wise in the second half of the year. But at the same time, we're seeing some acceleration overall of F-35 activity and of course, that brings with it the lower margins in total that the F-35 program brings with it. There was -- you mentioned a profit step-up. There was profit step up in the LRIP contracts in the first half of the year, and we're not seeing likely a step-up in the second half of the year and that's another reason why it will be down in the second half versus the first half."

You asked about dividend yield, Rich, and I'll say, we always take a look at that in the third quarter time frame. We'll do that again with the board of directors at the September board of directors meeting.

On the equity, well let’s back up, Myles, and just give you kind of an overview of Space in general. Space had a very strong first half, a very strong second quarter. And as I look at the second half of the year, I think that scenario where we potentially have some better performance coming in even than what we're showing in our guidance numbers there. It’s a real strong performance coming out of Space, particularly on the EBIT side of that. And I think as I teed up likely, I've lost track if I did that in the fourth quarter call, but I know I did in the first quarter call. I talked about there being a spike in the fourth quarter in Space Systems’ margins primarily because of the cessation of the Shuttle program and some profit adjustments we’d made there. I'll point out that our current guidance does not include the effects of that adjustment as a result of the fly-out of the shuttle. It's kind of right on the bubble as to whether that's going to be a fourth quarter event of 2010 or if it's going to roll over into 2011. But right now, that is not in our planning for the 2010 time frame. Once that final event has happened for the United Space Alliance and the plight of the shuttle, we would expect to see the equity earnings of that drop fairly dramatically. You should think of it in between the two of them, I want to say, between the United Launch Alliance, and the United Space Alliance, probably somewhere in the order of $200 million worth of equity earnings in total. U.S.A. is probably 2x to 3x the size of – excuse me, United Launch Alliance is 2x to 3x the size of United Space Alliance. So the impact won’t be the full $200 million obviously. We show that reduction and I gave you guidance, I think, in the third quarter of last year. We talked about longer-term views of Space's margins, Space segment’s margins. And I still think that even with the reduction in the U.S.A. equity earnings, the margin level that we're seeing for Space can sustain primarily because of some adjustments we're expecting to see in some of our government satellite contracts. So I don't see a large margin cliff coming, going from 2010 to 2011."

I can tell you the members were talking with or working hard and very focused on developing a balanced approach. Balanced with regard to funding, balanced with regard to probabilities of success, certainly balanced with regard to overall risk, and there is an interest in leveraging the investments that have been made in Orion, and Orion's performance continues to be rated as very good on a programmatic basis. So we think they're trying to develop a formula that gives them flexibility going forward, and we think that Orion will play a role in that flexible approach. Perhaps first as a crew rescue vehicle, which I think we talked considerably about, not launching astronauts from the earth, but sending the capsule to the space station such that in an emergency, the crew could evacuate, get on the crew rescue vehicle and return to Earth. But also having flexibility in the Orion configuration that over time it can evolve into a crew exploration or crew transport vehicle, that would include lifting astronauts from the earth. And of course, the capsule discretion in Orion is also unfolding with regard to a variety of propulsion systems. What rocket or type of rockets will be available to ride, when. So there’s a pretty comprehensive review right now, but our sense is that we performed well, that individuals see the merit and risk reduction associated with Orion. And that there will be a role for the Orion spacecraft in some fashion as the strategy unfolds. And I think we'll learn a lot more about this in the second half."

I do envision the program as having two discrete components as I mentioned in the remarks: the Development phase and the Production phase. The Development phase, while lasting a number of years, is the shorter phase and for me, the criticality there is invest everything you need to invest, to get a full emission-capable system while focusing in the Production program on driving out the costs of recurring production of that fully mission capable system. So we saw through the Nunn-McCurdy process and we may see in an iteration or two in the future, some adaptations or adjustments associated with making sure we're allocating resources in a smart way to get everything we need to have on the program. Now in that Development phase, I would say resides at least part of your concern about requirements creep. I will tell you, we're not seeing requirements creep or the generation of a lot of new things. Let me say in some significant or major way, and I attribute a great deal of appreciation to customers who came forward early and who made sure that the airplane would meet their operational needs and focus, and I think Admiral Dave Venlet here is a real strength because he brings an operator's background and he ran the Naval Air Systems command. And he understands how to think in terms of operational needs and he works with his colleagues in that way. We will see the manifestation of these developments of how well we're doing in demonstrating the performance of the airplane. And if there are any additional features we’ll probably see that unfold in the test program where people might, under reasonable circumstances, want to see some tests added to demonstrate or assure some aspect of the overall performance. We may see it in some software, but I pretty much think, and has been reinforced by the tests that we've completed, the hardware is progressively locking into a good configuration. And there are no major technical showstoppers to date on the program. We believe that. I believe all in the government who have responsibilities of overseeing the program believe that. So for me, I know the numbers of airplanes are big, the size of the program is large, and therefore the cost numbers are significant. But I think within a substantially large program, we're seeing adaptations that we’d expect to see. But again, I want to disabuse you of any sense you might have that requirements turn or creep are driving either our performance on the airplane or within the program or the overall cost of the program because that's really not a source of cost concern at present."

I think your starting premise there that programs that we discussed in the second quarter of last year that caused the margin pressure last year, that the performance on those programs is largely behind us and that, and I'd say that's true. What we are seeing though is that if you take a look at the newly configured IS&GS. We still operate under the Civil, the Defense and the Intelligence line of businesses. And you should probably think of those businesses as comprising probably about 40% Civil and roughly 30% Defense and Intelligence, and what we're seeing happening is that the Civil piece is growing at a very, very fast clip relative to the other two. In fact, the other two in the second quarter, actually Intelligence was fairly flat. Defense business was actually slightly down. And so while we're seeing in the quarter both Defense and the Intelligence lines of business doing, I'll say, north of double-digit margins, the growth that we're seeing in Civil, think of that as kind of the high-single digit kind of business is offsetting that performance in the Defense and Intelligence and resulting in kind of a flattishness in the margins that you're talking about overall. Relative to the backlog, I think some of it is just the timing of orders. I don't particularly see -- speak to backlog in general for the corporation, not just IS&GS, but we don't truly have a whole lot of large-scale competitive orders. The largest one of note obviously is the Littoral Combat Ship which should be decided next month. Most of the rest of our orders across all the business areas, not just IS&GS, you should think of them in the form of farm and follow-on orders. And I'll say in particularly in IS&GS this year is particularly spiky in the fourth quarter where a large number -- it's always high to begin with, but this year seems a bit abnormally high for the number of orders in the fourth quarter versus the rest of the year. I think overall, this backlog in general, we ended up a little bit down in the second quarter compared to some. Some of those because of the delays frankly, and getting the LRIP 4 negotiation done out of Aeronautics, but actually I still look forward to the rest of the year for backlog. I think we're going to see growth in the third quarter and then growth in the fourth quarter as well, and I would expect that we probably end the year close to where we started the beginning of 2010 with."

I note that the architecture of the program is such and the nature of the program design is such that most nations, I think, pretty soberly look out at a set of risks. The risks haven't really gone away, and one of the considerable risks is the proliferation of surface-to-air capabilities, think of area denial capabilities so what might have appeared more routine with regard to the use of tactical airplanes in the past is going to be anything but routine in the future because of these area denial circumstances. I think it’s human nature that almost everybody doesn’t want to think about the circumstances, but some people are forced to think, ""What happens if there's unrest? What happens if there's instability?"" So I think that’s one driver of looking and balancing economic needs and security needs. I think there still is a sense that we need to recapitalize on a security front. I think also, the way we’ve integrated global supply chain here. So many of the discussions that we are all quite familiar with on these types of programs extend beyond security to issues of economics and employment and interest, and that all makes a great deal of sense to us and I'm sure you as well. The Joint Strike Fighter architecture, in addition to being an interoperable system that shares the design and development on the security capabilities, also shares a component of the industrial base and it's very strongly integrated into the fabric of the program. So if you think of it in these terms, there is a bit of offset on the economic viability or vitality front because this generates value economically as well as consuming value economically. I think we have seen countries like Italy recommit particularly with the final assembly and check-out, a facility they were looking at the range of 131 airplanes. Norway has committed. We know that Denmark is running a competition, and they’ll make a determination. The Netherlands and the United Kingdom are reviewing the program. Previously, they have been favorable. And Canada recently committed to 65 just to round it up. Turkey committed to 100 airplanes. But we're also seeing early expressions of foreign military sales prospects, and three of those countries, in addition to Israel that is thinking about a total of 75 airplanes, three of those countries include Singapore, Japan and South Korea, I think very much in alignment with the framework of your question that either there will be additional demand from countries like Singapore, Japan, Korea and others in Asia or potentially offsetting demand. And I would think that over time, we would see an additional area of interest emerge and that would be the Middle East, where we have very important security cooperation relationships between our government and many governments in the region. And probably in a fashion not terribly dissimilar from the Korean Peninsula, there's a region of potential instability or at least concern there. Whether it also be proliferation of systems and sophistication and area denial that would highlight the advantage of a fifth-generation airplane like the Joint Strike Fighter, so we may see some interest a little beyond the scope of our planning right now emerging from the Middle East. Our sense is if you make the right investments in the development program to get a fully mission-capable airplane, if we keep our focus on production, work near-term production pressures and make sure that these are affordable airplanes at the acquisition price by driving down the learning curves and assuring just a sufficient level of volume to give us the volume to drive down the curves, keeping stability in that supply chain, we’ll create the most affordable, most capable fighter that still will have interest in Europe. Will probably have growing interest in Asia and growing interest in the middle East."

I'm very proud of the workforce here. I think they are first-rate. Their technical skills are high and their commitment is on a -- these are professionals who believe in the mission and will do everything and anything they possibly can to be successful. Our job is to create the climate. So I think you can look at the things we’re engaged in now. Portfolio reshaping is a careful examination of all of the lines of business and all the activities that we are in. And we want to make sure we're tightly aligned. We're proud of the PA&E business. These individuals in the business do great work around the country, but the customer demand is moving in a way that is progressively moving away from our strategic orientation, and we're realistic about that. In the case of EIG, we're enormously proud of our 40-year-plus franchise here that we built, but we recognize that customers want to raise the bar on even the perception of OCI, of conflicts of interest and we’re going to respond, I think, professionally and well there. We'll work on cost reduction. On the F-35 we’re going to work on getting it right. There isn't any human alive who has even come approximately close to programs like this, who don't appreciate the challenges involved. I think I'm grateful that we're working with a customer who understands this, a customer who is committed to getting it right, a customer who will add resources to a development program when they believe that's a prudent investment in the long-term viability, and I think they should speak in a voice that has expectations of us, to be focused on cost and to do all the things we know how to do to get this right. I want to stay focused on attracting the best talent to this company and assuring that we’re giving them a high-vitality environment to work in because the commitments we're making on the F-35 today are not commitments that will be extinguished in four quarters. It will be here for decades from now so we do think of the business in terms of generational evolutions, and we're focused on that. I don't see in any way, and I know this is in your question, Howard, the velocity of events or the volatility associated with changes diminishing in the near term. I think you and us and everybody involved in this process is simply going to have to prepare for a more robust set of circumstances, and we're working to try to build that robustness in our processes and in our strategic planning and in the agility with which we adapt to changing circumstances which we think they’re going to continue and they're going to require more agility. Those are the kind of things we're thinking about. You and others will measure how well we're able to do."

So specifically to your question about Canada, there is very little discussion about some need for extraordinary tailoring of the air vehicle configuration or its mission systems because, frankly, it's already in there. There will be discussions, I think on a country-by-country basis that make a lot of sense about how those nations and those militaries will best support the airplane. And so there may be some tailoring of support requirements that would include some levels of industrial participation and so forth. I'll tell you that I believe you're not unfamiliar with this, and we are certainly not unfamiliar to this. Even as we just look back at our F-16 experience. There are various ways that we can help to support or enable customers to improve their operational availability, improve their mission capability and so forth.

First off, this is an IDIQ contract and we’re in the middle of about a, I think it's 120-day transition period to move from the previous prime contractor to ourselves. So we're in the early stages of recognizing any high level of activity frankly on that program. Going forward on kind of a steady state basis at least near-term as we look into 2011, I would think from what I know of the contract, we're probably going to expect somewhere in the, say, $400 million to $500 million a year range in sales. And I’ve thought a lot about your question on the war exposure and, frankly, my reaction is I'm not sure I know what the normal is for this activity. I mean, special operation troops are so engaged all over the world in any event that I'm not sure how much of that changes as a result of, say, a slowdown in Iraq or Afghanistan for instance. So that activity has not seen a whole lot of change from what we could tell for a number of years, but I will say all those years included the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. So I don't know that I have a very crisp answer for you there other than I’m not really sure what’s going to happen there."

I'm not trying to put words into Dr. Carter's mouth but I think spiritually, notionally, this is very much aligned with the kind of initiatives that we all ought to be thinking about, and it is absolutely the right thing to do to tighten up span of control, to improve reporting, to lower the cost structure, to be effective and efficient in a time where efficiency matters more rather than less. And that would certainly be part of a conversation we would have about whether the costs are allowable because they're very good returns, we think, for both the customer and we think for ourselves.

We welcome that review because it gives us a lot of insight. I think they’ve looked at a multiple of airplanes year-over-year that history instructs all of us. Let me say with some latitude would more or less be optimal. Now that's not tied down to a specific aircraft or two or maybe three, depending upon volume. But it is a multiplier of about 1.5. So if you wanted to hold a number in your head that may be a nominal point of departure, you might think that every year, you're adding about half again the number to keep that 1.5 multiple. It varies a little on how much automation you have in the factory, how much machine pace versus labor pace. I don't want to get into all the gory details unless the audience here does which I suspect not, but it is a little sensitive to that. What's really fundamental to this overall affordability issue, in addition to volume, which is embedded in your question and important is what costs are you starting at and coming down from? And what learning curve is most likely to be able to be fit to those costs? And that's the curve against which volume matters. And right now, on the things that are favorable about the program, I know there's more work to do, but on things that look good on the program with more of the cost being in production, the early learning curve data and the early initial cost positions look pretty good. And of course, we're going to have to work really hard to hold and sustain that good profile, and we're looking to help from the government to help us do that, and we'll be able to give you an update at the completion of the Independent Manufacturing Review Team updated assessment that we think is coming up here in the next two quarters. And that will probably run concurrently at least in part with the technical baseline review. And it’ll give us all good sensitivity about where we think we are, where the government thinks we are, where we need to make adaptations. So we're not overly sensitive in the near-term to production quantities, but we're mindful that in the long run, you've got to keep the volume balanced with the overall learning curves, balanced with the overall cost architecture, and we'll be working on that."

I think maybe the bigger question there is what's happening with the discount rates because we have more liabilities than we have assets in the plan. And as far as the discount rates are concerned, if we were to strike a line in the sand right now because of where we sit from an interest rate perspective, it would probably down somewhat and so as I said in my opening comments, one of the reasons why we are pushing out the guidance for 2011 into the January column instead of October is because of the volatility we're seeing here both on the asset side as well as the interest rate side frankly."

I hope this call finds you well and maybe finding some ways to survive the heat of this summer. We have a lot to update you on today, and I would like to get right to it so I'll proceed on the basis that you’ve had a chance to read the earnings release and see our updated guidance. I'd like to start with an operational overview then I'll walk you through the highlights on a business area by business area basis.
In Aeronautics, there are three programs I want to cover, and I want to start with the F-35 program, as the Joint Strike Fighter remains our program of greatest opportunity and greatest challenge. And I want to spend a bit more time on some additional detail with you here so that you have a good feel for where we are in the program. 
In the quarter, the government completed the Nunn-McCurdy recertification process, finding the F-35 to be essential to national security and a high priority. Extensive cost assessments and risk analyses were conducted and evaluated by DoD, highlighting areas requiring additional focus, adding resources to the development program and flight test and in software development while lowering the near-term production ramp rate by 122 airplanes. 
The program executive officer, that's the senior-most government official on the program, that position was elevated from a two-star billet to a three-star billet, and Admiral Dave Venlet, a superbly qualified professional with lots of relevant experience, is now in this role. In recognizing that there are program uncertainties and risks remaining, DoD called for a series of what will be routine ongoing reviews to monitor performance and to make adjustments, and the first of these reviews under Admiral Venlet, known as a technical baseline review, is now underway and likely to be completed by the end of the year.
Let me look at the program now in two segments or phases. First, the System Development and Demonstration phase. The work here I regard as the front end of the program, where it's essential to get the design, the development of the aircraft and the test of the aircraft and its systems right. I think of this as the nonrecurring part of the program. It's important to get it right here to assure that our customers get systems that meet their needs, and I think it's critical here to focus on overall performance to assure we get it right. 
And then I'll talk about the Production phase of the program, which includes long-term aircraft delivery profiles that we think on the Joint Strike Fighter are likely to extend over decades. In my mind, this is where the majority of the costs reside and this is where affordability will ultimately be determined, so here it's critical to focus on costs. We are now at a critical juncture on the program as I think you all know of transitioning from the development program more fully into the production program. 
In the System Development and Demonstration segment of the program, we're about 80% complete. We have 15 of 19 test articles currently being evaluated, and the four remaining are in build. This 19 test article total excludes the prospect of an additional carrier variant that was discussed during the Nunn-McCurdy recertification process. Of the 19 aircraft, 13 are fliers in the flight test program and six are structural test articles, and all of those six structural test articles either are in test or have completed their test. And of the 13 fliers, nine have now flown.
In the quarter, we added the first carrier variant to the test fleet and the early reports from this airplane are that it’s flying very well. Also on the carrier variant, we completed a successful drop test of the ground test article, which simulates the intensity of carrier landings. Now here envision dropping the airframe from progressive heights that go up to about 12 feet. And in this test program, we noticed no failures or no load exceedances. So that's a very good set of results from this important test which is essential in demonstrating the structural integrity necessary for carrier operations. 
In testing the conventional takeoff and landing variant, early flights already exceed the 7G loading conditions which is good. Static testing or measuring the ultimate strength of the airframe is complete with no structural failures, and we've begun durability testing to verify that the airframe will meet the plane’s 8,000-hour life. 
We have two airplanes equipped with mission systems: one short takeoff and vertical landing and one conventional takeoff and landing. These mission systems aircraft give us early insight as to the performance of advanced avionics, like the Active Electronically Scanned Array Radar, the electronic warfare systems, the communications suite, the advanced targeting system and so forth. The goal here is to get some sense of sensor fusion or the ability to assemble information from different systems to generate greater levels of situational awareness, not just for the pilot, but for all those who would have information streams linked to the Joint Strike Fighter, and I think all are pleased with the early results of the test of the mission systems airplanes.
Let me give you some detail on the status of the flight test program. Year-to-date through June, we've flown 136 flights against the plan of 118 flights, so overall, we've had a good tempo and we're running ahead in total numbers. When I break down that total for you by variant, you will see that the conventional takeoff and landing airplane has flown 56x against the plan of 22, and the carrier variant has flown 6x against the plan of one. So we're getting solid early performance here, performance on flights that was better than planned. And we're getting good feedback from the airplanes, and all this is very positive. 
On the STOVL airplane, we have flown 74x against a plan of 95x. Here, we wanted to accomplish more vertical landings, satisfy more test points and get more information sooner, but we've thus far been unable to do so, so the question becomes why are the CTOL and the CV aircraft running ahead of plan as STOVL runs behind plan. The answer lies in the early reliability of selected components on the STOVL aircraft where we're seeing failure rates that are higher than predicted. Now I'd describe these components to you as the ones you would probably not view as major systems like the engine, which is working very well. Recall we’ve flown supersonic and we’ve hovered with the airplane, or the lift fan or the control laws or other such major components. The components that are failing are more of the things that would appear either smaller or more ordinary like thermal cooling fans, door actuators, selected valves or switches or components of the power system. So when these components don't work because of their initial low reliability, we don't fly, and we don't fly because assuring safety is our uncompromised highest priority. And often, the maintenance action to address these components takes longer than you think given the less significant nature of the parts involved. In some cases, we've had to remove the engine to get access to the component, and because we're in the early phases of flight test where we all exercise an abundance of caution, it's important to perform an additional series of tests when you take the engine out including ground tests, which consumes a lot of time to get to a more ordinary part like a cooling fan. We're now working with our customers on a variety of actions to address the STOVL flight test pressure.
They include identifying the troublesome components and working with suppliers to understand and improve their reliability. Perhaps examining supplier manufacturing processes or examining whether we need to have them change the design of the parts or change the sparing or provisioning on the program simply to have more parts available. Given what we've seen, both we and our customer subject matter experts believe this component reliability condition can be corrected and the inherent reliability can and will be improved. 
Together, we're also looking at ways to improve the overall flight test efficiency with the goal of improving tempo. Here we'll look at rephasing activities, adding some selective resources that we have already begun to do, looking at additional aircraft instrumentation and perhaps looking at different concepts of operation. Now let me give you one example of the family of things we might consider here. 
We'll look at hot-pitting the aircraft, which means that we don't turn the engine off on the airplane, we refuel it with the engine running, and we go fly again on the theory that when the aircraft is flying well and when weather conditions are cooperating, we keep flying the airplane as much as possible. This will reduce the turnaround time of the jets, and interestingly, could create a condition where we'd have fewer flights because a flight is actually measured at the end of the mission where we shut the engine off. If we don't shut the engine off to get more data by reducing turnaround time, we have fewer flights, but we can certainly generate more information, which is the essential purpose and the ultimate goal of the flight test program. So we are working with customers throughout the test community to envision ways to get more utility out of the assets that we have. 
During my last visit to Pax River, where the Navy is testing the airplane, in going through not only a series of reviews, but walking the facility and the flight line, talking to the pilots who were flying the airplane and all those working on the aircraft, getting the advice of subject matter experts and meeting with Navy leadership, you just couldn't help being very impressed with the quality of the team. And this is a fully integrated test force, which means that the United States Navy, the United States Marine Corps personnel are working in conjunction with other government personnel and industry personnel in a completely seamless way. The subject matter experts that are at Pax River are genuinely impressive. They have lots of experience and they have lots of relevant knowledge, and they are a first-rate team and they're working smart and they're working hard, and we have the full and complete engagement of senior Navy and Marine Corps leadership. So I want to take a minute to extend my thanks and appreciation for their professionalism and dedication as they work on this flight test program.
Also in the SDD phase, we're developing software for the Joint Strike Fighter in five blocks. The second block of software, known as Block 0.5, which is the first Mission System software, is now flying on two airplanes. This block includes about 5.5 million lines of code. The early experience here is the software is of very good quality and functionality and importantly, it's demonstrating stable performance. So we've been very pleased with the results here, although it took a little longer and required more resources than planned to deliver this block into the test program. 
Block 1.0 is now in development and scheduled to be released later in the third quarter. This block will add about another 1 million lines of code to the prior software. With this software delivery, the airplane will have more than 80% of its total software. We're going to spend a concentrated effort with our customers over the next several months during the technical baseline review process that I described earlier, looking at the overall software program, examining stability, quality, complexity, productivity, and we'll make adjustments accordingly appropriate because getting the right software on the program that demonstrates full mission capability is absolutely critical as a component of the SDD phase. 
In the production segment, we have 31 airplanes in the first three low-rate initial production lots, flowing in fabrication or assembly. We previously received long lead authorization for Lot 4 at 32 airplanes. We're now negotiating Lot 4 at present, receiving a very thorough and detailed review by the government customer that we expected. And Lot 4 will likely result in a fixed-price incentive-type contract when the negotiations conclude. And DoD also authorized $522 million for long-lead material associated with the next low-rate initial production option that's LRIP 5 at 42 airplanes. 
We continue to see improved cost performance, and our learning curve projections including those associated with Lot 4, continue to support long-term affordability objectives. And I think it's fair to say that the production cost trends overall remain on the favorable side of prior estimates which is where we all want them to be.
As with any accelerating production program, we do have some challenges. And our focus here is on retiring risks, working with the supply chain on phasing and quality and reliability and schedule maintenance, on reducing travels or out-of-cycle installations that put pressure on aircraft delivery schedule which we're seeing and working with the government independent manufacturing review team as they continue their assessment in the next regularly scheduled review cycle. 
On some other matters, we have an agreement on the corrective action plan to improve our EBMS system and appreciate the help we've received to establish a better foundation here. And international partners continue to express interest. The Italian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement for a $1 billion final assembly and checkout facility that we used for aircraft for Italy and the Netherlands. This is part of our worldwide supply chain strategy. 
Canada recently reaffirmed interest in 65 airplanes, and Israel continues to look at Joint Strike Fighter as a potential FMS buyer. On balance, then taken as a whole. The Joint Strike Fighter is showing strength in many areas of accomplishment with some areas needing more focus. In flight test, the conventional takeoff and landing aircraft, this is the airplane that will be sold in the greatest numbers and the carrier variant are doing well and STOVL needs more attention. In software development, quality, functionality and stability are good, and we need to focus on productivity. And in production, our learning curves support overall cost reduction and affordability objectives, and we need to address some schedule pressures.
On the C-130J airplane, our production buildup from 16 aircraft last year to 26 this year is on track. We delivered six airplanes in the second quarter, and customer interest here remains strong. In the second quarter, we received orders from Kuwait and Israel. On the C-5 modernization program, we inducted the third airlifter into the line. I think you’ll recall overall plans called for 52 airplanes to be modernized by 2016, and we think this approach to life extension provides great value to customers. 
In Electronic Systems, let me highlight two areas. In Ballistic Missile Defense, our FAD program achieved its seventh consecutive successful target intercept, demonstrating the ability to destroy a unitary target in the lower earth atmosphere, known as an endoatmospheric intercept, and this success expands again the operational envelope for this proven and capable system. This system is strongly supported as a DoD priority and offers both domestic and international sales potential.
On the Littoral Combat Ship program, our second ship, the Forth Worth, remains on cost and on schedule with now 55% of the construction completed. Our offer for the 10-ship buy has been submitted and we should learn of the Navy's decision, we think, sometime in August. We have been listening very carefully to the Navy and their expectations and have fashioned a low-risk cost-competitive approach to the program on a vessel that we think would also be of interest to international buyers. 
In Information Systems and Global Solutions on the Next Generation Identification System for the FBI, we've begun to fully develop and deploy a new capability to transform how law enforcement officials will search a wanted-person database. 
In one of our horizon market initiatives, we were pleased the Tech America Foundation named Lockheed Martin's Ironclad the Most Innovative Cybersecurity and Authentication Technology of the year. Ironclad is a new technology that shrinks a laptop's hard drive, operating system, software applications and files onto a secure USB flash drive. This program's another example of leveraging our overall expertise in data security as we work to provide cyber protection solutions to customers.
Lastly in IS&GS, earlier this month we were awarded a contract by DoD to manage the Special Operation Forces Support Activity, a contract known as SOFSA. This award with a value up to $5 billion over the next 10 years, represents a reinstatement of a contract that we had initially won last year and enables us to move forward to support our nation's special operation forces. As a result of our recent organizational realignment, the SOFSA contract will be managed by Electronic Systems as we move forward. 
Finally, our Space Systems team continues to demonstrate progress on the Orion program. By successfully completing the flight test of the Launch Abort system. The system pulls the crew module away from the launch vehicle during an emergency and will significantly improve crew safety for future human space flight. 
Other progress includes the successful completion of Phase I Safety Reviews of NASA's Human Rating Requirements addressing the design and operational concepts for the capsule. 
Beyond operations, on May 8 Secretary Gates challenged the Department of Defense to examine its internal cost structure and overhead expenses, with a goal to change the way the Department does business. Secretary Gates outlined a goal to save more than $100 billion over five years beginning in fiscal 2012 by reducing unnecessary expenses. The objective is to redeploy adequate funds to pay for troops and modernization while sustaining a growing top line defense budget. 
On June 28, Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Ash Carter, outlined his new focus to acquisition professionals in the defense industry. The new initiatives are designed to achieve cost savings in the defense acquisition system to enable funding for war provider capability, to grow at approximately 3% annually while maintaining a vibrant and financially healthy defense industry. We understand this new reality of escalating demands on our customers and increasing constraints on the resources available to achieve their missions. This new reality requires that we adapt and drive affordability to ensure that we're doing everything possible to make every dollar count. 
In support of these initiatives, we've implemented a number of actions. First, we've rebalanced our IS&GS portfolio, announcing plans to divest most of our Enterprise Integration Group and the Pacific Architects and Engineers unit. And there seems to be a good level of interest in these businesses. We also realigned our Readiness & Stability Operations in our Savi Technology business from IS&GS to Electronic Systems. These actions will strengthen our focus and our performance over the long run and help provide the best most affordable solutions to customers.
We've implemented a voluntary executive separation program designed to reduce layers of management, improve affordability, tighten reporting relationships and allow for more direct lines of communication both inside and outside the company. We reduced our presence at the Farnborough Air Show by 50%. We've cut our advertising budgets and reduced our travel expenses, and we're going to continue to work at every aspect of this company with a focus on reducing costs. These actions reflect that new reality and are designed to enable us to continue to deliver the best value to customers while positioning us for financial success for our shareholders. 
Even with this changing domestic framework, we continue to see strong alignment of our portfolio with overall program priorities, and believe we will grow more than the rate of growth in the base defense budget. 
And internationally, we see solid and expanding demand for our portfolio of products and continue to drive on our goal of increasing international business content to approximately 20% of corporate revenues by 2012. Well, with that slightly longer summary for you, I want to turn the call over to Bruce for some additional detail on the second quarter financial results, and then we'll open it up for your questions."

As we've done in prior calls, we've included charts on our website to help with this part of the discussion, and at this time, I’d encourage you to open the charts and follow along as I make my comments.
Let's begin with Chart 3, which is just a reminder that all financials in today's web charts reflect the impact of the portfolio-shaping we announced earlier this quarter. First, Pacific Architects & Engineers was moved from the continuing results of IS&GS and to discontinued operations as we have decided to sell that business. As a result of this, we have lowered our sales guidance for the expected level of annual sales, but we were able to offset the earnings impact and our EPS guidance as you'll see on a later chart. EIG on the other hand will remain in continuing operations as we evaluate a sale versus a spinoff to our stockholders. 
Finally, we realigned our Readiness & Stability Operations, our RSO business, from IS&GS into Electronic Systems where it will be combined with Simulation, Training & Support to form the Global Training & Logistics line of business.
If you now turn to Chart 4 and our second quarter sales summary, overall, the Corporation grew 3% in the quarter, with all four business areas achieving growth above prior year’s levels. IS&GS had the highest growth of 6%, due primarily to growth in our civil line of business due to work with the census program and other IT work for numerous federal agencies. 
Electronic Systems generated revenue of $3.5 billion, with 4% growth in the quarter. This was driven primarily by global trending and logistics and tactical missiles at Missiles & Fire Control. Aeronautics grew 2% in the quarter, primarily from expansion on the F-35 low-rate initial production contracts and higher C-130 deliveries. 
Space Systems grew 1% in the quarter due to expansion in Government Satellites and growth in the Orion crew exploration vehicle work. This was tempered somewhat by the wind-down of the external tank fabrication resulting from the upcoming retirement of the shuttle fleet.
If we now look at Chart 5 and our cash from operations. Again this quarter cash was very strong as we generated in excess of $1.2 billion. And I'll point out, this was after making a cash contribution of $350 million to our pension trust in the quarter. The $2.9 billion through the first half of the year represents $500 million more than at this time last year. And looking forward to the second half of the year, we remain committed to contributing at least $1.05 billion additionally to reach our previously announced $1.4 billion in discretionary contributions to our pension plans. This remaining contribution to achieve the $1.4 billion level will be made entirely in the third quarter. And because of the strong cash generation this quarter, we are increasing our full year cash from operations guidance to at least $3.4 billion or $100 million above our prior projection of $3.3 billion.
If you now look at Chart 6 for a discussion on our ongoing activities in share repurchases. We increased our share repurchases by almost 50% above first quarter levels, repurchasing 9.7 million shares for $782 million. This brings the year-to-date level to 16.2 million shares for $1.3 billion, well above our stated goal to allocate $1 billion for share repurchases in 2010. Our share repurchase actions brought our balance sheet shares outstanding to around 360 million at the end of the quarter, a new low level in the corporation's history. 
Our next chart, Chart 7, will highlight our debt exchange that took place in the quarter. This chart shows all of our bond maturities over time which graphically shows that there are no debt maturities until 2013 which we've mentioned in the past. The yellow portion of the bars shows the amount of our high coupon bonds that were exchanged for new 30-year debt in 2040. Coupons ranged from 7.2% to 8½% versus our new debt with a coupon rating of 5.72%. As the chart says, this extended our maturity while lowering the average coupon of our overall portfolio.
Moving next to Chart 8 and our earnings per share performance. Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.96. This reflects a 5% increase from our prior level of $1.87. And the improvements resulted from improved operational performance and lower share count. On the right-hand side of the chart, the adjusted EPS of $2.41 per share increased 16% above last year's level, including the discontinued operations items, and $0.19 for the FAS/CAS adjustment. 
Finally, I'd like to turn to our full year 2010 EPS guidance reconciliation on Chart 9. From what we provided in April, we were able to increase our guidance by $0.15 to a level of $7.15 to $7.35 per share due to our reduced share count outlook and improved operational performance in Space Systems. This level includes the impact of removing the annual earnings for PAE. 
Moving down the chart to our GAAP EPS outlook including discontinued operations, our outlook is for $7.45 to $7.65 per share, which includes the PAE earnings removed from continuing operations, plus a tax benefit from the difference between our book and tax basis, which is required to be recognized as we classify PAE as being held for sale. 
I'll remind you that the values on this chart do not consider the effects of our previously announced voluntary executive separation program, and we'd expect to have that impact quantified during our third quarter earnings call. 
Overall, the second quarter results were solid and particularly strong in the area of cash from operations. As I look forward to the rest of the year, I think we'll continue to see that second half revenue will have higher growth than the first half, with overall margins fairly consistent with what we experienced in the first half. We expect third quarter cash to be down considerably as we make the over $1 billion investment in the pension plan payments to get to the $1.4 billion level we previously discussed.
One final comment before we open for questions. We're revising our prior practice and we'll now wait until January to provide our initial financial guidance for 2011. We're still seeing tremendous volatility in both stock market performance and interest rate movement, and on top of that, cash harmonization still remains undecided at this time. So because of that we believe it makes more sense to wait until we have these numbers at year end rather than provide interim numbers in October. I also think this aligns us more closely with what our peers are doing in this area. 
And with that, I think we’re ready for your questions. Devon?"

I will tell you from my point of view, as we will take a fixed-price incentive type contract here, we certainly want to get this right so that we understand the risks and expectations. I think, there's a corollary for the people on the government's team to want to get it right from their point of view. So I don't feel that there's any particular distress here. There is no particular pressure. I just think it's a genuine effort for everybody to want to get it right. My feel is we're a couple of weeks away to finalize it. As I said, the ongoing discussions are fulsome. They are interactive and we are exchanging views and listening to proposals and counterproposals and options and thoughts and things. So I will tell you it's gone a little longer, but I would not characterize it as getting off track in some way. On redoing the SDD contract, I think that's going to take a bit of time, and I think that's going to take a bit of time because as I mentioned to you, there are a couple of reviews that I think we should all begin to internalize as ordinary and even routine on a program of this nature, and it might even grow to be routine on other programs that meet a threshold in the Department of Defense. In our case, it’s a technical baseline review that’s already commenced, and I think will be done -- I will tell you, October or November, I don't control the date on that, but we're certainly working in close conjunction with the review team, as well as an update to the independent manufacturing review team. And that's how I phased in my mind, Joe, the likely resolution of matters remaining in the SDD phase of the contract."

We also have in the quarter three additional C-130s, and those bring with it typically probably higher margin than the overall portfolio. Those are being offset by reductions in both the F-16 and F-22 program so that's kind of how we got to the second quarter here. I'll give you just a – I just found it kind of interesting as I was looking through some of the data, George, just to put it in perspective. For the first half of 2010, the development program that Bob mentioned for the F-35, the SDD contract, is 2/3 of what it was in the first half of 2009. While the LRIP contracts, think of these as the early production contracts, is twice what it was in the first half of 2009 so you see the phenomenon where we're shifting significantly from the SDD contract over to the LRIP contracts. As far as why we're seeing some downside in the second half of the year, you're right that there are higher C-130J sales both quantity-wise and dollar-wise in the second half of the year. But at the same time, we're seeing some acceleration overall of F-35 activity and of course, that brings with it the lower margins in total that the F-35 program brings with it. There was -- you mentioned a profit step-up. There was profit step up in the LRIP contracts in the first half of the year, and we're not seeing likely a step-up in the second half of the year and that's another reason why it will be down in the second half versus the first half."

On the equity, well let’s back up, Myles, and just give you kind of an overview of Space in general. Space had a very strong first half, a very strong second quarter. And as I look at the second half of the year, I think that scenario where we potentially have some better performance coming in even than what we're showing in our guidance numbers there. It’s a real strong performance coming out of Space, particularly on the EBIT side of that. And I think as I teed up likely, I've lost track if I did that in the fourth quarter call, but I know I did in the first quarter call. I talked about there being a spike in the fourth quarter in Space Systems’ margins primarily because of the cessation of the Shuttle program and some profit adjustments we’d made there. I'll point out that our current guidance does not include the effects of that adjustment as a result of the fly-out of the shuttle. It's kind of right on the bubble as to whether that's going to be a fourth quarter event of 2010 or if it's going to roll over into 2011. But right now, that is not in our planning for the 2010 time frame. Once that final event has happened for the United Space Alliance and the plight of the shuttle, we would expect to see the equity earnings of that drop fairly dramatically. You should think of it in between the two of them, I want to say, between the United Launch Alliance, and the United Space Alliance, probably somewhere in the order of $200 million worth of equity earnings in total. U.S.A. is probably 2x to 3x the size of – excuse me, United Launch Alliance is 2x to 3x the size of United Space Alliance. So the impact won’t be the full $200 million obviously. We show that reduction and I gave you guidance, I think, in the third quarter of last year. We talked about longer-term views of Space's margins, Space segment’s margins. And I still think that even with the reduction in the U.S.A. equity earnings, the margin level that we're seeing for Space can sustain primarily because of some adjustments we're expecting to see in some of our government satellite contracts. So I don't see a large margin cliff coming, going from 2010 to 2011."

I can tell you the members were talking with or working hard and very focused on developing a balanced approach. Balanced with regard to funding, balanced with regard to probabilities of success, certainly balanced with regard to overall risk, and there is an interest in leveraging the investments that have been made in Orion, and Orion's performance continues to be rated as very good on a programmatic basis. So we think they're trying to develop a formula that gives them flexibility going forward, and we think that Orion will play a role in that flexible approach. Perhaps first as a crew rescue vehicle, which I think we talked considerably about, not launching astronauts from the earth, but sending the capsule to the space station such that in an emergency, the crew could evacuate, get on the crew rescue vehicle and return to Earth. But also having flexibility in the Orion configuration that over time it can evolve into a crew exploration or crew transport vehicle, that would include lifting astronauts from the earth. And of course, the capsule discretion in Orion is also unfolding with regard to a variety of propulsion systems. What rocket or type of rockets will be available to ride, when. So there’s a pretty comprehensive review right now, but our sense is that we performed well, that individuals see the merit and risk reduction associated with Orion. And that there will be a role for the Orion spacecraft in some fashion as the strategy unfolds. And I think we'll learn a lot more about this in the second half."

I do envision the program as having two discrete components as I mentioned in the remarks: the Development phase and the Production phase. The Development phase, while lasting a number of years, is the shorter phase and for me, the criticality there is invest everything you need to invest, to get a full emission-capable system while focusing in the Production program on driving out the costs of recurring production of that fully mission capable system. So we saw through the Nunn-McCurdy process and we may see in an iteration or two in the future, some adaptations or adjustments associated with making sure we're allocating resources in a smart way to get everything we need to have on the program. Now in that Development phase, I would say resides at least part of your concern about requirements creep. I will tell you, we're not seeing requirements creep or the generation of a lot of new things. Let me say in some significant or major way, and I attribute a great deal of appreciation to customers who came forward early and who made sure that the airplane would meet their operational needs and focus, and I think Admiral Dave Venlet here is a real strength because he brings an operator's background and he ran the Naval Air Systems command. And he understands how to think in terms of operational needs and he works with his colleagues in that way. We will see the manifestation of these developments of how well we're doing in demonstrating the performance of the airplane. And if there are any additional features, we’ll probably see that unfold in the test program where people might, under reasonable circumstances, want to see some tests added to demonstrate or assure some aspect of the overall performance. We may see it in some software, but I pretty much think, and has been reinforced by the tests that we've completed, the hardware is progressively locking into a good configuration. And there are no major technical showstoppers to date on the program. We believe that. I believe all in the government who have responsibilities of overseeing the program believe that. So for me, I know the numbers of airplanes are big, the size of the program is large, and therefore, the cost numbers are significant. But I think within a substantially large program, we're seeing adaptations that we’d expect to see. But again, I want to disabuse you of any sense you might have that requirements, churn or creep are driving either our performance on the airplane or within the program or the overall cost of the program because that's really not a source of cost concern at present."

I think your starting premise there that programs that we've discussed in the second quarter of last year that caused the margin pressure last year, that the performance on those programs is largely behind us and that, and I'd say that's true. What we are seeing though is that if you take a look at the newly configured IS&GS. We still operate under the Civil, the Defense and the Intelligence line of businesses. And you should probably think of those businesses as comprising probably about 40% Civil and roughly 30% Defense and Intelligence, and what we're seeing happening is that the Civil piece is growing at a very, very fast clip relative to the other two. In fact, the other two in the second quarter, actually Intelligence was fairly flat; Defense business was actually slightly down. And so while we're seeing in the quarter both Defense and the Intelligence lines of business doing, I'll say, north of double-digit margins, the growth that we're seeing in Civil, think of that as kind of the high-single digit kind of ROSS business is offsetting that performance in the Defense and Intelligence and resulting in kind of a flattishness in the margins that you're talking about overall. Relative to the backlog, I think some of it is just the timing of orders. I don't particularly see -- and I'll speak to backlog in general for the corporation, not just IS&GS, but we don't truly have a whole lot of large-scale competitive orders. The largest one of note obviously is the Littoral Combat Ship, which should be decided next month. Most of the rest of our orders across all the business areas, not just IS&GS, you should think of them in the form of farm and follow-on orders. And I'll say in particularly in IS&GS this year is particularly spiky in the fourth quarter where a large number -- it's always high to begin with, but this year seems a bit abnormally high for the number of orders in the fourth quarter versus the rest of the year. I think overall, this backlog in general, we ended up a little bit down in the second quarter compared to some. Some of those because of the delays frankly, and getting the LRIP 4 negotiation done out of Aeronautics, but actually I still look forward to the rest of the year for backlog. I think we're going to see growth in the third quarter and then growth in the fourth quarter as well, and I would expect that we probably end the year close to where we started the beginning of 2010 with."

I note that the architecture of the program is such and the nature of the program design is such that most nations, I think, pretty soberly look out at a set of risks. The risks haven't really gone away, and one of the considerable risks is the proliferation of surface-to-air capabilities, think of area denial capabilities so what might have appeared more routine with regard to the use of tactical airplanes in the past is going to be anything but routine in the future because of these area denial circumstances. I think it’s human nature that almost everybody doesn’t want to think about the circumstances, but some people are forced to think, ""What happens if there's unrest? What happens if there's instability?"" So I think that’s one driver of looking and balancing economic needs and security needs. I think there still is a sense that we need to recapitalize on a security front. I think also, the way we’ve integrated global supply chain here. So many of the discussions that we are all quite familiar with on these types of programs extend beyond security to issues of economics and employment and interest, and that all makes a great deal of sense to us and I'm sure you as well. The Joint Strike Fighter architecture, in addition to being an interoperable system that shares the design and development on the security capabilities, also shares a component of the industrial base and it's very strongly integrated into the fabric of the program. So if you think of it in these terms, there is a bit of offset on the economic viability or vitality front because this generates value economically as well as consuming value economically. I think we have seen countries like Italy recommit particularly with the final assembly and checkout, a facility they were looking at the range of 131 airplanes. Norway has committed. We know that Denmark is running a competition, and they’ll make a determination. The Netherlands and the United Kingdom are reviewing the program. Previously, they have been favorable. And Canada recently committed to 65 just to round it up. Turkey committed to 100 airplanes. But we're also seeing early expressions of foreign military sales prospects, and three of those countries, in addition to Israel that is thinking about a total of 75 airplanes, three of those countries include Singapore, Japan and South Korea, I think very much in alignment with the framework of your question that either there will be additional demand from countries like Singapore, Japan, Korea and others in Asia or potentially offsetting demand. And I would think that over time, we would see an additional area of interest emerge and that would be the Middle East, where we have very important security cooperation relationships between our government and many governments in the region. And probably in a fashion not terribly dissimilar from the Korean Peninsula, there's a region of potential instability or at least concern there. Whether it also be proliferation of systems and sophistication and area denial that would highlight the advantage of a fifth-generation airplane like the Joint Strike Fighter, so we may see some interest a little beyond the scope of our planning right now emerging from the Middle East. Our sense is if you make the right investments in the development program to get a fully mission-capable airplane, if we keep our focus on production, work near-term production pressures and make sure that these are affordable airplanes at the acquisition price by driving down the learning curves and assuring just a sufficient level of volume to give us the volume to drive down the curves, keeping stability in that supply chain, we’ll create the most affordable, most capable fighter that still will have interest in Europe. Will probably have growing interest in Asia and growing interest in the Middle East."

There’s things that we’re doing enormously well in this company, but we have spoken, I think, with great clarity about a new reality that we’re all facing, and every one of us is going to face a new reality every day and it’s going to require us to behave differently. I'm very proud of the workforce here. I think they are first-rate. Their technical skills are high and their commitment is on a -- these are professionals who believe in the mission and will do everything and anything they possibly can to be successful. Our job is to create the climate. So I think you can look at the things we’re engaged in now. Portfolio reshaping is a careful examination of all of the lines of business and all the activities that we are in. And we want to make sure we're tightly aligned. We're proud of the PA&E business. These individuals in the business do great work around the country, but the customer demand is moving in a way that is progressively moving away from our strategic orientation, and we're realistic about that. In the case of EIG, we're enormously proud of our 40-year-plus franchise here that we built, but we recognize that customers want to raise the bar on even the perception of OCI, of conflicts of interest and we’re going to respond, I think, professionally and well there. We'll work on cost reduction. On the F-35 we’re going to work on getting it right. There isn't any human alive who has even come approximately close to programs like this, who don't appreciate the challenges involved. I think I'm grateful that we're working with a customer who understands this, a customer who is committed to getting it right, a customer who will add resources to a development program when they believe that's a prudent investment in the long-term viability, and I think they should speak in a voice that has expectations of us, to be focused on cost and to do all the things we know how to do to get this right. I want to stay focused on attracting the best talent to this company and assuring that we’re giving them a high-vitality environment to work in because the commitments we're making on the F-35 today are not commitments that will be extinguished in four quarters. It will be here for decades from now so we do think of the business in terms of generational evolutions, and we're focused on that. I don't see in any way, and I know this is in your question, Howard, the velocity of events or the volatility associated with changes diminishing in the near term. I think you and us and everybody involved in this process is simply going to have to prepare for a more robust set of circumstances, and we're working to try to build that robustness in our processes and in our strategic planning and in the agility with which we adapt to changing circumstances which we think they’re going to continue and they're going to require more agility. Those are the kind of things we're thinking about. You and others will measure how well we're able to do."

There's been a huge amount of collaboration, and that collaboration includes the configuration, and I think you will probably hear when we explore opportunities in the future more oriented toward foreign military sales the discussions about how much flexibility there will be in the configuration, but I’ll tell you a considerable amount of flexibility is already built in the configuration to meet the demands that the operational command in various countries would have because that was the point of developing the kind of partnership and consortium we have on the F-35. So specifically to your question about Canada, there is very little discussion about some need for extraordinary tailoring of the air vehicle configuration or its mission systems because, frankly, it's already in there. There will be discussions, I think on a country-by-country basis that make a lot of sense about how those nations and those militaries will best support the airplane. And so there may be some tailoring of support requirements that would include some levels of industrial participation and so forth. I'll tell you that I believe you're not unfamiliar with this, and we are certainly not unfamiliar to this. Even as we just look back at our F-16 experience. There are various ways that we can help to support or enable customers to improve their operational availability, improve their mission capability and so forth. In the Joint Strike Fighter, at least in the near-term, it doesn’t look like there'll be a lot of configuration adaptability as much as there’ll be flexibility in approaches for sustainment support."

First off, this is an IDIQ contract and we’re in the middle of about a, I think it's 120-day transition period to move from the previous prime contractor to ourselves. So we're in the early stages of recognizing any high level of activity frankly on that program. Going forward on kind of a steady state basis at least near-term as we look into 2011, I would think from what I know of the contract, we're probably going to expect somewhere in the, say, $400 million to $500 million a year range in sales. And I’ve thought a lot about your question on the war exposure and, frankly, my reaction is I'm not sure I know what the normal is for this activity. I mean, special operation troops are so engaged all over the world in any event that I'm not sure how much of that changes as a result of, say, a slowdown in Iraq or Afghanistan for instance. So that activity has not seen a whole lot of change from what we could tell for a number of years, but I will say all those years included the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. So I don't know that I have a very crisp answer for you there other than I’m not really sure what’s going to happen there."

I'm not trying to put words into Dr. Carter's mouth but I think spiritually, notionally, this is very much aligned with the kind of initiatives that we all ought to be thinking about, and it is absolutely the right thing to do to tighten up span of control, to improve reporting, to lower the cost structure, to be effective and efficient in a time where efficiency matters more rather than less. And that would certainly be part of a conversation we would have about whether the costs are allowable because they're very good returns, we think, for both the customer and we think for ourselves. And the goal of Secretary Carter's initiatives are to find these areas that work for the government and work for us. So I’ve felt. I think Bruce and others here have felt, that this is very much in alignment with the general sense of what we ought to be doing.

The Independent Manufacturing Review Team, Cai, which is not a Lockheed Martin-staffed organization, but a government-staffed organization. We work supporting them and in concert with them. They’ve done a review of the program. They will do another review of the program. I think, it's likely they'll continue to review the program. We welcome that review because it gives us a lot of insight. I think they’ve looked at a multiple of airplanes year-over-year that history instructs all of us. Let me say with some latitude would more or less be optimal. Now that's not tied down to a specific aircraft or two or maybe three, depending upon volume. But it is a multiplier of about 1.5. So if you wanted to hold a number in your head that may be a nominal point of departure, you might think that every year, you're adding about half again the number to keep that 1.5 multiple. It varies a little on how much automation you have in the factory, how much machine pace versus labor pace. I don't want to get into all the gory details unless the audience here does which I suspect not, but it is a little sensitive to that. What's really fundamental to this overall affordability issue, in addition to volume, which is embedded in your question and important is what costs are you starting at and coming down from? And what learning curve is most likely to be able to be fit to those costs? And that's the curve against which volume matters. And right now, on the things that are favorable about the program, I know there's more work to do, but on things that look good on the program with more of the cost being in production, the early learning curve data and the early initial cost positions look pretty good. And of course, we're going to have to work really hard to hold and sustain that good profile, and we're looking to help from the government to help us do that, and we'll be able to give you an update at the completion of the Independent Manufacturing Review Team updated assessment that we think is coming up here in the next two quarters. And that will probably run concurrently at least in part with the technical baseline review. And it’ll give us all good sensitivity about where we think we are, where the government thinks we are, where we need to make adaptations. So we're not overly sensitive in the near-term to production quantities, but we're mindful that in the long run, you've got to keep the volume balanced with the overall learning curves, balanced with the overall cost architecture, and we'll be working on that."

Good morning, everyone. As our release this morning outlined, operational performance continued at a good pace during the third quarter and we achieved solid financial results, including sales expansion of 6% and continued exceptiona",2964,"Great. Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone. As our release this morning outlined, operational performance continued at a good pace during the third quarter and we achieved solid financial results, including sales expansion of 6% and continued exceptional cash flow generation. 
Our focus on operating cash has been the centerpiece of our strategy that enables sustained investments in the business and sustained returns to shareholders through share repurchases and increases in our dividend. And I think this strategy is working well, as evidenced by our ability to increase the quarterly dividend by 19% this quarter, extending our double-digit dividend increase since the three consecutive years.
Let me start with an update on matters relating to the external environment, which we're operating in, and address some emerging trends. When we last spoke in July, I highlighted what we termed the new reality that we're facing. Greater security need is emerging, with fewer resources available to meet them. To address this environment, the Defense Department has continued to clarify its objective of implementing major changes in the way equipment and services are procured from contractors, with the goal to save more than $100 billion over the next five years from overhead and other accounts without negatively affecting warfighters.
Once realized, these savings would be invested in new equipment and applied to preserve troop strength even as military budgets flatten in the future. On September 14, Under Secretary for Defense Acquisition Dr. Ash Carter provided additional detail into 23 areas of improvement to make the department's procurement offices and defense contractors more efficient. These actions were broadly characterized into five major areas: Targeting affordability and controlling cost growth, incentivizing productivity and innovation in industry, promoting real competition, improving tradecraft in services acquisition and reducing non-productive processes and bureaucracy.
Within each of these categories, there are more specific areas of focus like advancing the use of should cost modeling, eliminating redundant government reporting and review requirements, shortening acquisition cycle times and increasing the use of fixed-price incentive type contracts. Since the implementation of these initiatives by the department was planned to be phased in over time, we've not yet seen their total effect on our business and we've been advised that some areas will require additional study and be subject to more detailed future guidance.
We have, however, agreed to the use of a fixed-price incentive type contracts on our F-35 program in the Lot 4 Low Rate Initial Production lot, which I'll cover later in greater detail, and we certainly welcome the focus on shortening cycle times, as we're seeing the opposite effect. Components of the acquisition process have been consuming more time. Some negotiations have taken longer. Some awards have been delayed, all having the effect of putting pressure on future growth prospects. So we're looking forward to working with the department and seeing some tangible results from these streamlining initiatives, and we'll keep you posted as they unfold.
Relative to our strategic focus of cost reduction and efficiency initiatives, we're making good progress. We've entered into an agreement to divest our Enterprise Integration Group to Veritas Capital for $815 million in cash. While this transaction is subject to government antitrust review, we expect to close before year end. 
Our Pacific Architects & Engineers unit continues to see solid interest from potential buyers, and we're on a timeline that supports closure either wait in the fourth quarter of this year or early in the first quarter next year. These actions, plus the rebalancing of our Global Logistics & Training  business, will provide a more crisp focus for our operations.
We also previously announced the implementation of a voluntary executive separation program, designed to rightsize the company, reduce layers of management, enhance affordability, tighten reporting relationships and allow for more direct lines of communications, both inside the company and with our customers. This program has been a solid success, with approximately 600 employees participating. We will backfill some of these positions, but not all of them, and we've already begun the process of organizational transition and knowledge transfer as we move to a more efficient model.
I want to thank those executives who are participating for their valuable contributions and many years of service to our company and to our customers. Their work has been professional and it's been highly valued. Our focus on reducing overhead costs, travel expenses and capital expenditures continues, with a renewed emphasis on working with our supply chain. With approximately 2/3 of the cost of our products procured from vendors, we must continue to drive down costs and improve quality, delivery and reliability. These actions are essential to enable us to deliver the best value to customers and financial performance for shareholders.
Turning to operational performance, we had a solid quarter, with key accomplishments across all business areas. In Aeronautics, I'll highlight three programs where special attentions awarded. On F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, we continue to see progress across many areas of the program, but challenges remaining in others. 
In the flight test program, the overall tempo of flights continues to ramp up, as evidenced by completion of 133 flights this quarter or almost as many flights in the quarter as the 136 that were completed during the first six months of this year. This acceleration in the flight test program was planned and expected. Flight test performance continued ahead of plan on both the conventional takeoff and landing in the carrier variants, while the short takeoff and vertical landing of flight completions remain behind schedule. Overall, we're 26 flights ahead of plan through September and are tracking towards achievement of the planned 394 flights for the year.
Looking at some detail. The CTOL variant is 61 flights ahead of plan and the carrier variant is 5 flights ahead of plan, while the STOVL variant is 40 flights behind plan. STOVL aircraft component reliability continues to be the principal focus area. We're pursuing a multi-faceted approach to improve tempo that is working to obtain higher levels of spare components and parts from vendors to keep the aircraft in a flight-ready condition, while completing the analysis and corrective action planning to address the root cause conditions. 
On the software front, we are about 85% complete with the development of over 15 million lines of code, but much work remains. The software flying  now has shown good stability and good functionality, but more resources will be needed to complete software build and test. We're adding an additional software integration line and additional staff to increase capacity and improve productivity.
I thought it might be interesting to give you an example of a day in the life of complex systems development. During routine ground testing of the F-35 fuel management subsystem, a software anomaly was detected. While we never experience this problem in flight, testing indicated the potential that a fuel boost pump could shut down. Upon detection, flight operations were immediately suspended as a prudent precaution, a corrective modification to the software was immediately undertaken by the fuel system supplier and flight testing was resumed, limiting the impact to the flight test schedule to about a week. 
To the uninitiated, this may not seem like all that much. But from my point of view, it's a model of professionalism in the government industry partnership where testing was undertaken with rigor, roles and responsibilities were clear, high standards were maintained and safety was paramount.
The process was transparent and effective and resulted in a better airplane, without taking on any unnecessary risks. 
Production activities continue to ramp up at Fort Worth, with low-rate initial production work yielding good progress on factory cost performance, but with some schedule pressure. Solid cost performance and learning curve data enabled us to reach agreement on price with the government this quarter on the Low-Rate Initial Production Lot 4 contract for 32 aircraft under a fixed-price incentive-type contract structure. With a 50-50 share line and a 120% ceiling, this contract will be challenging and will require focused attention on execution.
We're working through the normal process to definitize the contract. And once finalized, the Lot 4 contract will bring the total backlog of production aircraft to 63. International support for the program continues to evolve. We were pleased with Canada's announcement to acquire the F-35 as their next-generation fighter aircraft, as well as the Israeli government signing a Letter of Offer and Acceptance for procurement of the F-35 their future fighter fleet. 
The United Kingdom is completing a far-reaching strategic review, the results of which will be known shortly. In fact, I believe Prime Minister David Cameron is presenting the details of the plan now. Our sense is that the plan will result in the reduction in the number of Joint Strike Fighters to be purchased from below the original planning number, which is 138 aircraft. 
We also believe they are likely to go to the carrier version of the airplane as compared to the original planning, which was the short takeoff and vertical landing variant, as they proceed with two aircraft carriers, one configured with a catapult that supports the carrier variant operations. As I've said, the Prime Minister is, I believe, releasing some additional details of the plan now, even as we speak.
We further sense that both partner and non-partner countries will continue their planning for the F-35. Some may reduce quantities or delay the onset of production and others may increase and accelerate their buy, and we'll do all that we can to be flexible and supportive as our customers evolve their concepts of operations and their recapitalization needs. 
In the system design and development program, the government's technical baseline review or TBR continues and is scheduled to be complete next month. While the results of this comprehensive assessment are not yet available, let me give you my overall sense of the progress.
I believe that many independent government assessments of the inherent capabilities of the F-35 system affirm its fundamental value, not just below observability but in the power of its mission systems. Work done to date on the air vehicle supports expectations of low signature and sound structural integrity and durability. The propulsion system is performing well, and the onboard systems are phenomenal, and pilots immediately recognize their strength.
The combination of an advanced radar and sensor system, along with an integrated communication suite, not only distinguish the F-35, but enhance and enable many other military assets that the F-35 will work with, thereby improving their value as well. This capability is needed and valued, and continued investment in the program is warranted. The TBR then is specifically focusing on both areas of accomplishment and areas of need. With the negotiation of the Lot 4, it appears the cost of the production program are likely to be favorable to prior estimates, while the development program will need more resources in software development and flight test. 
The TBR process is dedicated to developing a solid set of realistic and executable planning assumptions, so that the program can be rebaseline as directed in the Nunn-McCurdy process and that additional resources can be applied. We recognize that long-term confidence in the program must be earned over time by executing and meeting commitments and the baseline resulting from the TBR process is an essential foundational requirement.
Moving to the C-130J., we continue to ramp up production levels, as customers expand their fleets. The Government of Oman recently executed new contract for two airlifters. And on the production line, we delivered seven aircraft and remain on track to our planned delivery of 26 aircraft this year. Robust domestic and international demand remains consistent with our planning assumptions.
The C-5 Galaxy achieved an important milestone in the modernization program, with delivery of the first production C-5M aircraft to the Air Force Mobility Command. With current plans calling for the modernization of 52 C-5 airlifters by 2016, delivery rates on these modernized aircraft will be ramping up to meet customer requirements. This ramp up was supported by the government's approval to proceed to full-rate production. 
I'm very proud of our team's contribution in fueling that modernized C-5M, as it provides significantly enhanced capabilities and improved mission readiness to the United States Air Force. With the C-5M providing twice the capability and costing less than half of other U.S. strategic airlifters, the value to the user community and the taxpayer is compelling and the program aligns well with DoD initiatives on cost savings, efficiency and affordability improvements.
While accomplishments in Aeronautics are many, I was disappointed by the decertification of our EVMS system. We're committed to the highest standards in process and performance measurement systems. And at Fort Worth, we've not maintained these standards. We will correct the deficiencies that have been identified. We know what to do. We know how to do it, and we're working closely with government subject matter experts on corrective actions. 
Among other factors, implementation of accurate earned value management system measurement criteria requires stable, fully-defined baselines for each program, as well as some performance measurement history against which validation can occur. This takes time. For the F-35, we will need performance history against the baseline that will be produced by the TBR, a process that will likely take 18 months or so. But when we are complete, we'll have a best-in-class system.
Turning to Electronic Systems. The team is doing a good job across the portfolio. Two areas merit special recognition this quarter: The Littoral Combat Ship and missile defense activities. On the Littoral Combat Ship program, our second vessel, the Fort Worth, remains on cost and on schedule, with more than 60% of the construction completed. Lessons learned from construction of our initial ship have resulted in improved efficiency and a 30% reduction in labor hours on our second ship. 
We look forward to the Navy's decision expected later this quarter to select the single design and the initial award of the 10-ship order.  Current Navy procurement plans continue to support a 55-ship fleet. 
In ballistic missile defense, key progress was achieved with successful completion of the critical design review on the medium extended air defense system. This next-generation mobile air and missile defense system will replace currently fielded defense capabilities. MEADS provides full 360-degree coverage and can defend up to 8x more area than current systems. Cost efficiencies are also achievable in the MEADS design due to fewer system elements and lower lifecycle costs.
Moving to Information Systems & Global Solutions. Our team working on the Airborne and Maritime/Fixed Station Joint Tactical Radio System, the program known as AMF JTRS, successfully transferred data and live streaming video over an internet protocol wideband network between multiple air and ground nodes. I know that's a mouthful. But what that means is that this exercise demonstrated the technical maturity of key AMF JTRS hardware elements in a rotary wing environment and brings secure, realtime, interoperable communications to the warfighter one step closer to reality.
In the area of new contract awards, I was very pleased to see our IS&GS team expand their multi-decade relationship in providing information technology support and solutions to the Social Security Administration. Under the $2.8 billion seven-year ID/IQ contract, IS&GS will complete for task orders to provide a broad range of IP support. We watched the ongoing transformation at the Administration as they work to support the health and economic well-being of millions of Americans, and we're proud to play a role.
Finally, let me cover two important satellite programs and space systems. The team successfully launched the first Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellite. This is a technologically advanced military communication system that provides highly secure survivable global communications for warfighters operating on ground, sea and air platforms. Advanced EHF remains a top priority in DoD, and there's a potential for future additional satellite awards above the three satellites currently under contract. After launch, our first satellite experienced a failure of one of its orbit right raising engines. We're now working on an alternative method of moving into final orbit, while still preserving the full planned orbital life of the satellite.
We also completed a critical design review on the Global Positioning System III contract. Completion of this milestone validates the design to ensure it needs more fighter and civil requirements and allows the program to begin the production phase. GPS III improved navigation, position and timing services with signals 3x more accurate and powerful than current GPS systems. Space Systems is currently working under a $3 billion contract to build up to 12 satellites for the United States Air Force.
Finally, I've described for you many times my admiration for our workforce and the quality of our leadership team. I was very pleased to see Linda Gooden, Marilyn Hewson and Joanne Maguire recently named among the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business by Fortune Magazine; and our General Counsel, Maryanne Lavan, recognized on Washington Post. They are exceptional leaders, whose talent and contributions are widely recognized inside and outside of our company; and we are very, very proud of them.
In the near term, we recognize we're working in a more challenging environment, as our customers face more volatility that will likely pressure our revenue growth, and as we face pension headwinds, that will likely increase pressure on earnings. I have unshakable confidence in our future, however, because of the quality of our portfolio and the quality of our people and our collective willingness to do all that is necessary to effectively navigate this new reality.
Let me turn the call over to Bruce now to provide some additional detail on the third quarter financial results and some initial color on emerging trends and their potential impact on 2011's financials. And then Bruce and I will come back and take your questions. Bruce?"
285827,114406912,80195,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. We've posted charts on our website to help with our discussion today. And at this time, I'd encourage you to open the charts and follow along with me as I make my comments.Let's begin with Chart 3 and a summary of significant portfolio shap",1166,"Thanks, Bob. We've posted charts on our website to help with our discussion today. And at this time, I'd encourage you to open the charts and follow along with me as I make my comments.
Let's begin with Chart 3 and a summary of significant portfolio shaping and affordability actions we took this quarter. First, we're pleased with the value we received with the announced sale of our EIG business for $815 million. And as a reminder, with the announced sale, the operating results for EIG have been classified as discontinued operations. As a result, we've lowered our 2010 sales and segment profit outlook by the amounts we expect EIG to contribute. Other than this movement to discontinued operations, our guidance remains unchanged for the year. And finally, we do anticipate that this sale will close by year end. 
As for PAE, as Bob said, we will expect to close that transaction later this year or early in 2011. And moving down the same chart to our voluntary executive separation program, we have about 600 employees participating in the program, and I'm sure you saw our 8-K announcing the $178 million pretax charge for the program. Over the next few weeks or months, we'll be working with our customer to agree on the timing of recovery of the program cost and the amount of recurring savings that it will generate going forward. We would expect to recover majority of the program cost in the future as we price new business.
If you'll now turn to Chart 4 in our third quarter sales summary. Overall, the corporation grew 6% in the quarter. Electronic Systems had the strongest growth at 10%, due primarily to the third quarter deliveries of our Persistent Threat Detection System or PTDS in the quarter. This contract began earlier this year and all deliveries occurred in this quarter. 
Both Aeronautics and IS&GS grew at 7% in the quarter, with the growth in Aeronautics driven by the F-35 program and C-130 deliveries. Growth at IS&GS was driven by the 2010 census program and our efforts at the DOE Hanford site. Space Systems sales were 5% lower than last year due to the absence of the commercial satellite sale. We had none this quarter versus one in the third quarter of last year.
Chart 5 shows our revised sales guidance, with EIG in discontinued operations. Again, the only change was removing the sales for EIG from the IS&GS projections. Looking at the end of the year for each of the business areas, I would expect Electronic Systems and IS&GS to be at the high end of their ranges. Space Systems to be at the low end of its range and Aeronautics to likely be in the middle of its range.
Chart 6 shows the same guidance changes for segment profit. Again, looking at where we expect to end the year, I'd expect Electronic Systems, Space Systems and Aeronautics to be at the high end of their ranges, while IS&GS will be towards the lower end of its range.
Moving to Chart 7 and our cash flow performance. Again, this quarter, cash was very strong, as we generated over $500 million in cash, while contributing over $1 billion to our pension plans. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated $3.4 billion in cash from operations, while contributing $1.4 billion to our pension plans. Without this contribution, our operating cash through the first three quarters would've been $4.8 billion or more than $1 billion more than last year through the same period.
Looking forward to the rest of the year, we were able to keep our guidance at $3.4 billion of operating cash, while planning for an additional $800 million of pension contributions in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year contribution level to $2.2 billion.
Turning to Chart 8. We'll look at our dividend and yield increases over the last five years. With the 19% increase in dividends we announced in the quarter, our yield at the current share price is just under 4%. And if you annualize the dividend increase, the yield exceeds 4%. Combined with our share repurchases, we have returned 76% of our year-to-date free cash flow to shareholders. We'll speak to our share repurchase activity on the next chart, Chart 9.
Year-to-date, we've repurchased almost 20 million shares for just under $1.6 billion. That brings our current shares outstanding to less than 360 million, a 4.1% decrease since the beginning of the year. 
On our next chart, Chart 10, we'll show our continuing earnings per share outlook compared to last quarter's outlook. In June, we provided guidance of $7.15 to $7.35 per share. Of course, in this quarter, we had $178 million charge for our VESP, which impacted the outlook for the year by $0.31 per share. And moving the results of EIG in discontinued operations lowered our continuing earnings per share by an additional $0.11 per share.
A number of other items led to an overall $0.02 increase resulting in our new EPS guidance of $6.75 to $6.95 per share. 
Finally, I'd like to give you a brief update on what we see as emerging trends as we head into 2011.
We still plan to provide our detailed guidance in January, but wanted you to have an idea of the trends we're seeing as we sit here today. For the top line, we expect our sales from continuing operations next year to grow at low single-digit growth rate over this year. Aeronautics will have another year of strong growth, driven by the F-35 program and C-130 deliveries. Electronic Systems will be flattish compared with this year, losing the benefits of the PTDS sales we have this year in addition to delays in expected awards from the Littoral Combat Ship and additional Fed production.
IS&GS will likely have a slight decrease since we finished the 2010 census this year and lose that activity in 2011. In addition, we are expecting the federal IT market to shrink some 2% to 3% in 2011 compared with 2010. Between the PTDS and census programs, we have nearly $1 billion in 2010 sales that will not be replicated in 2011. Space Systems will also remain relatively flat compared with 2010, as we've been saying for some time now.
We expect segment profit to be similar to the 2010 level, will result in lower ROS compared with 2010. And as we look at our pension expense on a FAS/CAS basis, our asset returns thus far are favorable compared with our long-term assumption of 8.5% return, while the rates used to determine our discount rate have declined significantly throughout the year. In addition, we are now assuming that CAS harmonization will be effective in 2012 rather than in 2011. The combination of each of these items leads us to believe that the FAS/CAS drag on our EPS will grow considerably in 2011. 
With that, I think we're ready for your questions. Devon, if you please open up the lines."

And so what we've tended to do in the past is establish some fairly long-term purchase agreements that provide us stability in both the supply, as well as the pricing. But think of that ability to aggregate the overall supply amongst a lot of different suppliers in our base is bringing us the best prices.

However, notionally, we've had discussions with the Department of Defense acquisition team as we've extended these conversations about affordability initiatives in thinking through the prospect of increasing material prices and the greater need for us to act like a strategic buyer. And that's why there's notion of long-term contracts, long-term predictability, multi-year procurement have been advanced by I think the industry community broadly because that will allow us to get the best possible price that's really in any set of market conditions even if there were to be some upward price pressure. You also asked the question about capacity constraints here. We planned our programs in a flexible way so that we're not experiencing any capacity shortfalls today at all. And on our major programs like the C-130 as an example, we've been able to go from 16 to 26 to approximately 36 based on optimizing the investment that we've made. To date, we'd be able to do same thing on the Joint Strike Fighter. We think our Littoral Combat Ship offering has been thought through in a similar set of circumstances. So we've tried to balance our view about capacity in assuring that we have gated investments, we call them gated, or we want to get greater knowledge before we make entirely speculative investments about what the future horizon will look like. We try to build as much flexibility in the capacity that we have. We also have thought through the prospect of potentially building down. If there were more headwind, can build down and still not lose the bubble on affordability or profitability of the F-16 line is probably a good historical example of the ability to scale up as global circumstances change and customers' recapitalization needs vary and then to build down and then to build back up.

I think in past call, I've talked about the thought that we like to be able to achieve about a 10% ROS about the time we hit the middle of this decade or when we hit the full-rate production profile in our production contracts. And I still think that's the case. I still think this contract enabled us to do that. We wouldn't have agreed to it if we didn't think we could execute to it. It's probably a little tighter in terms of the risk elements of it on the share line and the ceiling that I would have otherwise liked, but I think that puts a little bit of a premium on us to focus on our execution. But I think we're capable of doing that."

So there's additional discipline in the process, and that's not just on our side, it's on the government side. And notwithstanding Lot 4, but let me give you just a sense about this movement from cost-type to fixed-price-type contract. There's less flexibility overall in a fixed-price-type contract, and that requires, let me say, some behavioral change. And I'll make up an overly simplified illustration. It doesn't really have much to do with Lot 4, but in a cost reimbursable environment, if we agreed that we were going to meet every quarter, and the government would say, ""We'd rather meet monthly."" Our first response is where and when and what subject matter expert should we bring. Under a fixed-price contract, we will say, ""We are going to need to submit a change order to you to change the contract budget baseline to now include the provision for the cost of meeting monthly."" That's a behavioral difference. So I think we're all trying to go into this environment with our eyes open. As Bruce said, the wristband gets a little tighter on our side. The discipline, I think, it's cranked up on both sides. We lose a little flexibility but we think the advantages of taking on modestly more risk or diminishing flexibility will be born out by improved performance on the program. And that's what we're all focused on."

Last year, about this time, we provided you guidance not just for the year 2010 expectation, and we've tried to give a little longer-term view of what we're expecting to see. I think during that call, I talked about sales in 2011 as kind of being at the mid-single-digit level. We're now talking about more like the low-single-digit level and the three of the items that you mentioned from the press release, what of the reasons for that diminished outlook, I'll give you a couple of examples maybe to highlight each of what we're talking about there. One on the delays, think of hurdles like the Littoral Combat Ship, which we are assuming in our numbers in 2011 as a win when we talk about the growth rate we're seeing over 2010. But we had expected when we were talking last year for that award to have been sometime in the early summer of this year. We're now talking about a November award potentially. So think of that being almost six months of delay there. It doesn't change obviously the overall expectation of sales for the Littoral Combat Ship, but I guess it does change the phasing. So we're going to ship some of those sales to the right and push some of the early ramp rate in 2011 over into 2012. Same exact thing is happening with the Fed production lots. We'd expect to get those earlier in the year. It looks like they will be later in the year. And it's the same time kind of delayed ramp up in the higher Fed production that we're seeing there. On the cancellation side, the best example I think I can give to you there is we do have contract for IS&GS called the FBI Sentinel project, which is really a case management study or case management program where we were doing development to enable a lot of greater capability of that system. And I think in large part due to budget pressures within the Federal budget, the decision was made to stop doing further production on that activity and instead essentially do with what you got and go more into an operations and maintenance phase going forward as opposed to a development phase. So not so much at cancellation as a scope production, in fact, reflecting I think the new reality we're talking about. And then on the adjacent market scenario, really, what we're talking about there is the energy market, and specifically, there it says the concentrated solar power market. When we talked to you last year at this time, we had in play a potential deal we're looking at providing for Arizona power municipality that it turns out didn't happen for a number of reasons. But we also thought there were a number of smaller arrangements around the country that we're going to materialize. And as we sit here today, again, I think, frankly because of some of the fiscal pressures we're seeing and the tax revenues going down, I think we're seeing a delay in those particular types of projects. And Bob, do you want to add anything to that?"

Doug, I would tell you that obviously, we only speak for ourselves, but I'm going to guess we're not the only one seeing the phenomena that Bruce has described to you. Even as early as April of 2009, when Secretary Gates had a number of program decisions and announcements, some of which impacting our company, some of which impacting others, we began to communicate with you and others. Our sense is and the phrase we view this new reality and a big part of that new reality was the fiscal challenges that our nation is facing and the need to adapt to some fiscal discipline. As a result, we're seeing I think some building of the pressure on that horizon. Bruce gave you some illustrations about delays and cancellations. As we watched the bills work their way through to the Congress, I think there was a level of interest that drew our attention in the Senate Appropriations Committee Mark because they talked about a number of programs. I don't think that, if I get the math right, I think the number is 41 programs. They may have described as being delayed in some fashion. The result of which was they're withholding some funding to see if those delays were going to be recovered or whether they were going to be persistent. So I think there's a broader observation of the process slowing down a  little. And that's why among the affordability initiatives that Dr. Carter released, we are keenly interested in adding our full-throated voice in any experience we have in our energy and focusing on shortening the cycle time, not only because it will help remedy the discussion that Bruce just had with you now about the onset of revenue recognition, but we pulled that all the way through to the floor structure and military capability that can beat our own. And we don't want to see that process delayed either because the real value of the systems we work on, if you think of returns on their value, commences when they get fielded and put into operational service. So I think we have joined objectives and initiatives with the administration in getting this right. But our job here is to make sure that we're as clear and transparent and can you be the best of our professional judgment as we look out over a pretty complicated landscape and give you a feel what we have for the future. I'll also say, we've not hesitated in taking actions here that would be consistent with our appraisal of this future. Even as far back as 2009, we began consolidations where our program baselines were being changed. We've gone through some pretty painful reductions in force, and that's something we've worked hard to avoid, but we can't avoid the reality of sizing the workforce to the volume of work that we have to accomplish with the government. We've elected some divestitures here that we've described to you fully to help us focus and really meet new sets of expectations into the markets that we serve, but also to help us get greater operational focus. We talked about the voluntary separation program. We've been scrubbing our expense budgets and our capital budgets, and really focusing on generating operational cash, which we think is a very important focus area. As we adapt to the new reality, which we are committed to adapting to in running this business well, we think it's very sound judgment in our part to focus on cash so that we can certainly weather any financial challenges we have, but also very much prepare for what we believe will be a re-establishment of the growth trajectory for the business in the future as we go through these early rounds of budget examination to see what new baselines will look like. I like the priorities our programs enjoy. I like the support that we've had in the President's budget with the administration. I like the support that we've had in Congress overall. As a statement about the portfolio, I think we align well with military and intelligence community needs, In some markets, we'll probably accelerate. In some, we'll have a little pressure, and we'll do our best to have sound judgment here as we allocate resources. Do not overinvest in emerging or adjacent market area so that we have if the difficulties in returning value on those investments and we'll stay very focused and we'll do our best to keep you advised in advance of our experiencing these challenges."

You asked about pension, dividend, share repos and the actions we took in the quarter and what that means for the future. Maybe I'll start off with pension just to begin with because that's such a big moving piece of the whole discussion. As I stated in my prepared remarks, we are now assuming that the cash formulization is effective in 2012 versus 2011, that actually has the effect of lowering the cash number in 2011 from what we expect and that's one of the contributors to the additional FAS/CAS GAAP relative to EPS that I talked about earlier. Now discount rates are significantly lower. I don't think it's a great surprise to anyone. They're lower now, and they weren't end of the last year. And we still need to see how much change we're going to see between now and the year end. Relative to the $2.2 billion, we'd like to give a little bit of a tutorial relative to the risk of funding the requirements of our pension plans. The EESA, which obviously is the law that governs our pension plans in general, basically treats the discount rate different than either our FAS valuation or our CAS. And that the discount rate for EESA is for all intents and purposes kind of set now going into next year. So think of it as a 24-month moving average. So we kind of know what that is now. And with the contributions to get us to the 2.2 and where we expect our asset returns to be by the end of the year, we think that this additional contribution amount will get us to the 80% funded level at the start of 2011 relative to an EESA measurement perspective, which gets us in line with the expectations of the PPA, the Pension Protection Act, that becomes effective for us in 2011. And in that scenario, unless there are future changes beyond 2011 in the form of lower discount rates or obviously lower asset returns, we would not expect to have to make additional discretionary contributions into the fund as we've done for the last few years. In essence, on the baseline of EESA requirements for contributions will be what it takes to keep the fund funded, not just at the 80%, to actually grow that number over time. So a lot of what we've talked about recently in terms of discretionary contributions we would not expect to have to make anywhere near that level going forward. On the dividend, we took a look at where we sat from a dividend perspective and our growth prospects, and we just felt that, and I should say we talked an awful lot of investors as well, who felt that in today's environment, a strong cash generating company with a strong dividend yield was looked upon favorably. And so we did that consciously under that assumption. And on the share repurchases, we probably were a little bit lighter in the quarter here this year. We still expect to continue, although as you compare the first three quarters of last year, actually, we're up compared to our last year. I think some of that was just the phasing that we did in the first half of the year. I don't see that changing, Joe, as we go forward because we still -- the 50% of free cash flow going forward that we've done for quite some time is still our plan. And I think your last question concerned the EIG net receipt that we expect to get from that. And we would expect the net out about $0.5 billion. Think of it relative to EIG sale. And we would continue to use them, and I'll just characterize it as our general purpose use of cash for all the sorts of three things that we talked about earlier."

And so far, I believe we've been able to do that. And I try to highlight a little of the Lot 4 F-35. There will be some behavioral changes and there will be some discipline, and there will be some reduction and flexibility. We won't jigger around the configuration. We'll have a tighter bandwidth on performance all around. And I believe the government is up for that, and we are certainly up for that, and we know how to do this. The breadth and depth of our portfolio has been such that we've got lots of experience across the company. And what we're working on now is to make sure that we're populating that experience across the company, so that perhaps if there are organizations who in the recent past have not had familiarity with fixed-price incentive-type contracts, they're becoming a lot smarter about fixed-priced contracting environments today, as we think our government customers would want us to be so that we don't fail to meet the execution of responsibilities and commitments that we make.

When you don't have as thorough an understanding about content or what is exactly deliverable, we try to take that on earlier with full cooperation from our customer because our customer wanted us to step up and embrace some of this fixed-price incentive contract modeling. So it isn't again that we say no, we can't do that. Our view quite honestly is we can do a lot of things provided that conditions are consistent to warrant the contracting methodology and the architecture in the contract."

First, if I go back to my early days, when I was starting my career with Fort Worth working the F-16 program, every single F-16 contract in production was an FPI contract. So we've had this experience now for, in my case, almost 30 years. And as I look at the F-35 in particular, not to directly answer your question relative to target price and margin and so forth, but I found more the interesting thing as I looked at as we take a look at the cost, the target cost on the LRIP 1 aircraft, so was worth two aircraft buy, and compare that with a target cost of LRIP 4, the cost of the LRIP 4 aircraft are about half as much as the cost of the LRIP I aircraft. So think of that in 31 aircraft down in the production line, we've lowered the cost on those aircraft by half. And the other aspect that I look at from a risk perspective, Bob described as far as working this contract is, I very much view the LRIP 4 contract as the risk we're taking on has continued I'll say performance down the learning curve, I think we have a good understanding between ourselves and the government relative to concurrency risks with new signings in the STD contracted, the development contracts, such that, that will not sort of bleed over onto the LRIP 4 contract. And it's because of that, that I ultimately felt comfortable getting the agreement for the contract with the terms that we have."

Actually, I think we probably know about as much of the U.K. decision on F-35 as you do. You have to sort of filter out the things that are being described and discussed as the process is unfolding from the actual results of the process. It's a very comprehensive review that's been undertaken in the United Kingdom. It's very broad. It's very deep. It's very forward looking. I don't even think the exact numbers of airplanes to be procured that haven't been determined, as I'm sure, which is typical of all national security planners that we deal with in our international and domestic community. We try to work through concepts of operations, likely future scenarios, how much equipment we'll need to be capable on what they do accomplish or what task. So I believe we are watching the results flow out of the U.K. sort of in process. Where some determinations have been made, I think the judgment to move away from STOVL to the carrier variant, and I'm going to make some guesses here, Peter, but that decision might be made to enhance interoperability, to enable potentially U.S. aircraft to land on U.K. aircraft carriers where French aircraft or vice versa so. I think the experience we have and the judgments are made on capability, total expense, lifecycle costs, interoperability, flexibility and that's what we're seeing in the U.K. And we'll have to see what ultimate judgments are made about airplanes. Let's just stick with the F-35 for a while. We've longed expected that there would be substantial movement over time in the total estimated volumes of airplanes that being procured, whether they're U.S. airplanes for the Air Force, the Navy or the Marine Corps or whether they're for our international partners. The model we've offered before, the one that we think is the most relevant with the situation we face today on the F-35 is the F-16 started it a little more than 900 airplanes grew into 4,400 airplanes in 26 countries. We're still seeing follow-on orders from those countries to backfill support, extend their fleet. I very much believe that will be the case for the F-35. And I know governments now are facing tough economic conditions, but they're also facing very tough security environments. I do believe this airplane has already demonstrated the fundamental capability that caused individuals to recognize it's enormous value. So I'd rather suspect we'll see it in the case of the U.K. reduction in the quantity, but we'll also see cases like Israel who was not an investing partner in the core program who's come forward in the queue. They've talked about 75 airplanes in total. They'd like to get the first tranche like 18 to 20 or whatever that number will be sooner. I believe other governments and countries in the Middle East, in the Asia Pacific theater, are also recognizing very significant security challenges. I think some of those countries are feeling less pressured in their fiscal environments. They might have more resources and may look at the current circumstances with regard to the U.K. or maybe other countries who are lessening the buy or delaying the buy, it's an opportunity to get in the queue and to buy airplanes. Our focus here has to be on execution, and we're not going to allow ourselves to be distracted. We are certainly not overly concerned or hyperventilating. I expect there will be some ebb and flow in quantities and timing and even aircraft types. But we've got a very capable program foundation here. We talk a lot about STOVL because it deserves to have the conversations since it's 40 flights behind its schedule and we're having some component failures. The time we spent there caused us to talk less about the CTOL and the CV version that are really flying very well. And I assure you that the United States Navy and the United States Air Force are very excited about the prospects and performance of this program and recognize the contribution we can make by delivering this capability as newer international partners. So I'll tell you again, get a seat with a seat belt on it because this is not the first discussion we're going to have with international partners about quantities or aircraft types or timing. There will be more. Our goal is to stay close to those customers, support them in every possible way we can, give them very realistic appraisals about our performance and what they should expect, not just on cost and pricing and availability, but aircraft capability. Extending this discussion beyond the F-35. When we look at the international marketplace, we still see growth opportunities for our business. Our portfolio is well populated with the kinds of capabilities that governments place a high priority on like missile defense. And I know we can't get a talk definitively about the Littoral Combat Ship, but I really believe deeply in that mission and deeply in the concept of a ship of this class in the Littorals. And I'm confident other international governments do as well. So there would be international opportunities there for the C-130. We believe they're strong interest. We're not done delivering F-16s yet and have significant campaigns under way that support the evolution of F-35 quantities. So our sense is we are living in a world that has a lot of security challenges notwithstanding the economic pressures. What's really going to matter is do you have a mature portfolio? Have you demonstrated that the systems that you're working on actually work when they're placed into service they do? And can you deliver according to the commitments that are under the contract? And those are the fundamental details we focus on without allowing ourselves to be distracted. So I don't see a dramatic diminution or change in the expectations for international growth. We're committed to staying on that pattern. We'll redouble some efforts in our international support community. Will flow resources talented people executive presence there and then we'll work with U.S. government here. As we develop the budget for 2012, figure out what will happen through the continuing resolution and the potential lame-duck session for the 2011 funding and keep you advised."

What happened was what I expected. So I won't comment more about that. I just find it interesting. So more than 70% of those who have accepted the voluntary executive separation program are retirement eligible, which means they could walk out the door today. And I'll be very candid in my selection of language with you. It isn't as though the actions that we've taken or that I've authorized here have taken us off the cliff. These folks were going to leave in the next couple of years anyway. And the question in our mind was how do you want to orchestrate the environment in which seasoned senior folks are going to leave. And we elected to take ourselves to a position rather than allow circumstances to envelop us and take us a place that we have not planned for or couldn't adequately predict what the outcome would be. So years ago, we began planning through a series of executive rotations, perhaps you're familiar with the phrase full spectrum leadership. The investment in the center for leadership excellence here to begin to populate set of experience through rotation of assignments and broadening experiences in this company, a way of talent. There was not retirement eligible to date recognizing we've got a demographic shift not just in our company in our industry but throughout our government, where those baby boomers are going to go to retirement, and they're going to go no matter what you and I do. So the best program was part of a much broader articulated strategy of how to transition through generational change in our company without losing the bubble on execution or programs so we began to link executives through mentoring program and through experiential relationships so that we would grow the population underneath the senior leaders who are about to depart. And you added an important component here. The phasing of executive responsibility. So let's do some math. 600 or so people will leave between now and February. Our sense was that they would be leaving in the relatively near term anyway. We've begun early phasing in a variety of ways where it makes sense to do that. We won't backfill the entire complement of 600 executives because a principal goal for us is to get leaner, more streamlined to rightsize the business but we will backfill, while we consolidate and realign our organizational focus. We think that makes us stronger, not weaker. And we'll have people who will be placed into these realigned executive responsibilities who have had experience who do have contact with those who will be departing and in some cases, under the direct tutelage of those who will be leaving. And I will say this about the professional workforce that we have, including our retirees today and are soon-to-become retirees or in the VEST program. They care deeply about the mission. They care deeply about this company and there is not one who would fail to help a colleague even after they were took apart in February. So I think we're very well aligned to face the reality that we're all facing. And others I guess will go about this in an approach that they think makes sense. This approach in our judgment was exactly the way we ought to navigate in this new reality knowing we're going to face the challenges that we're facing. So I think we're very well positioned here. I don't expect a single blip on the program. I don't expect any difficulty. We have plenty of phasing in time, which we are doing now, and we'll continue to stay very focused on this. It's not just going to be through February, but when new people go to new assignments at any time under any set of conditions, we try to give them more rather than less help, to make sure we're all getting grounded and our expectations are clear and communications are crisp. We are prepared to do that and have means and mechanisms in place now to help facilitate that. So I'm pleased you asked the question because I think we haven't talked a lot about beyond the numbers, what do you expect in an operating environment from the company as you move forward, and your question gave us an opportunity to highlight that a bit."

Thanks, Jerry.  Good morning, everyone.  As our release this morning outlined, operational performance continued at a good pace during the third quarter and we achieved solid financial results, including sales expansion of 6% and continued exceptional cash flow generation.
Our focus on operating cash has been the center piece of our strategy that enables sustained investment in the business and sustained returns to shareholders through sharing purchases and increases in our dividend, and I think this strategy is working well as evidence by our ability to increase the quarterly dividend by 19% this quarter, extending our double digit dividend increase 3 consecutive years.
Let me start with an update on matters relating to the external environment which we’re operating in, and address some emerging trends.
When we last spoke in July, I highlighted what we termed the new reality that we’re facing.  Greater security means emerging with fewer resources available to meet them.  To address this environment the Defense Department has continued to clarify its objective of implementing major changes in the way equipment services are procured from contractors with a goal to save more than a $100 billion over the next 5 years, from overhead and other accounts without negatively affecting war fighters.
Once realized these savings would be invested in new equipment and applied to reserve troop strength, even as military budgets flatten in the future.
On September the 14th, under Secretary Defense Acquisition, Dr. Ash Carter, provided additional detail into 23 areas of improvement to make the department’s procurement offices and Defense contractors more efficient.
These actions were broadly characterized into 5 majority areas targeting affordability and controlling cost growth instead of [inaudible] productivity and innovation in industry, promoting real competition, improving trade craft in services acquisition and reducing non-productive processes in bureaucracy.
Within each of these categories, there are more specific areas of focus, like advancing the use of should cost modeling, eliminating redundant government reporting and review requirements, shortening acquisition cycle times, and increasing the use of fixed price incentive type contracts.
Since implementation of these initiatives by the department was planned to be phased in over time, we’ve not yet seen their total effect on our business.  And we’ve been advised that some areas will require additional study and be subject to more detail future guidance. 
We have however, agreed to be use of a fixed price incentive type contract on our F-35 program in the Lot-4 low rate initial production lot, which I’ll cover later in greater detail.  And we certainly welcome the focus on shortening cycle times, as we’re seeing the opposite effect.  
Components of the acquisition process have been consuming more time.  Some negotiations have taken longer, some awards have been delayed.  All having the effect of putting pressure on future growth prospects.
So we’re looking forward to working with the department and seeing some tangible results from these streamlining initiatives and we’ll keep you posted as they unfold.
Relative to our strategic focus, cost reduction, and efficacy initiatives, we’re making good progress.  We’ve entered into an agreement to the rest of enterprise integration group, to Varitop capital for $815 million in cash.  While this transaction is subject to government anti-trust review, we expect to close before year end.
Our Pacific Architects and engineers unit continues to see solid interest from potential buyers, and we’re on a timeline that supports closure, either late in the fourth quarter of this year, or early in the first quarter next year.
These actions, plus the rebalancing of our global logistics and training business, will provide a most crisp focus for our operations.
We also previously announced implementation of a voluntary executive separation program, designed to right size the company, reduce layers of management, enhance affordability, tighten reporting relationships, and allow for more direct lines of communication both inside the company and with our customers.
This program has been a solid success with approximately 600 employees participating.  We will backfill some of these positions but not all of them.  And we’ve all ready begun the process of organizational transition of knowledge transfer as we move to a more efficient model.
I want to thank those executives who are participating for their valuable contribution, and many years of service to our company and to our customers.  Their work has been professional and it’s been highly valued.
Our focus on reducing overhead cost, travel expenses, and capital expenditures continues with a renewed emphasis on working with our supply chain.  With approximately two thirds of the cost of our products procured from vendors, we must continue to drive down cost and improve quality, delivery, and reliability. 
These actions are essential to enable us to deliver the best value to customers and financial performance for shareholders.
Turning operational performance, we had a solid quarter with key accomplishments across all business areas. In Aeronautics, I’ll highlight 3 programs where special attention warrant. 
On the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, we continue to see progress across many areas of the program, but challenges remaining in others. 
In the flight test program, the overall tempo of flights continues to ramp up, as evidence by completion of 133 flights this quarter, or almost as many flights in the quarter as the 136 that were completed during the first 6 months this year.  This acceleration in the flight test program was planned, and expected.  Flight test performance continue to head a plan on both the conventional takeoff and landing, and the carrier variants, while the short take off and the vertical landing of flight completions remain behind schedule.  Overall, we’re 26 flights ahead of plan through September, and are tracking toward achievement of the plan 394 flights for the year.
Looking at some detail, the CTOL variant is 61 flights ahead of plan and the carrier variant is 5 flights ahead of plan, while the STOVL variant is 40 flights behind plan.  STOVL aircraft component reliability continues to be the principle focus area.  We’re pursuing a multi-faceted approach to improve tempo that is working to obtain higher levels of spare components and parts from vendors, to keep the aircraft in a flight ready condition while completing the analysis and corrective action planning to address the root cause conditions.  
On the software front, we’re about 85% complete with the development of over 15 million lines of code, but much work remains.  The software flying now has shown good stability and good functionality, but more resources will be needed to complete software build and test.  We’re adding an additional software integration line and additional staff to increase capacity and improve productivity.
I thought it might be interesting to give you an example of a day in the life of complex systems development.  During routine ground testing of the F-35 fuel management subsystem, a software anomaly was detected.  While we never experienced this problem in flight, testing indicated the potential that a fuel boost pump could shut down.  Upon detection, flight operations were immediately suspended as a prudent precaution.  A corrective modification to the software was immediately undertaken by the fuel systems supplier, and flight testing was resumed limiting the impact to the flight test schedule to about a week. So again, initiated this may not seem like all that much, but from my point of view it’s a model of professionalism in the government industry partnership we’re testing was undertaken with rigor, roles in responsibilities were clear, high standards were maintained and safety was paramount.  The process was transparent and effective and resulted in a better airplane without taking on any unnecessary risk.
Production activities continue to ramp up at Fort Worth with low rated initial production work yielding good progress on factory cost performance, but with some schedule pressure.  Solid cost performance and learning curve data enabled us to reach agreement on price with the government this quarter, on the low rate initial production Lot-4 contract, the 32 aircraft under a fixed price incentive type contract structure.  With a 50/50 share line and a 120% sealing, this contract will be challenging and will require focused attention on execution.  
We’re working through the normal process to definitize the contract, and once finalized, the Lot-4 contract will bring the total backlog of production aircraft to 63.  
International support for the program continues to evolve.  We were pleased with Canada’s announcement to acquire the F-35 as their next generation fighter aircraft, as well as the Israeli government signing a letter of offer in acceptance for procurement of the F-35 for their future fighter fleet.  The United Kingdom is completing it’s far reaching strategic review.  The results of which will be known shortly.  In fact, I believe, Prime Minister David Cameron, is presenting the details of the plan now. 
Our sense is that the plan will result in the reduction in the number of Joint Strike Fighters to be purchased from below the original planning number which is 138 aircrafts.  We also believe they’re are likely to go to the carrier version of the airplane as compared to the original planning which was the short takeoff and vertical landing variant.  As they proceed with 2 aircraft carriers, 1 configured with a catapult that supports the carrier variant operations.  As I said, the Prime Minister is, I believe releasing some additional details of the plan, now even as we speak.
We further sense that both partner and non-partner countries will continue their planning for the F-35.  Some may reduce quantities or delay the onset of production in others, may increase and accelerate their buy.  And we’ll do all that we can to be flexible and supportive as our customers give all their concepts of operation and their recapitalization needs.
In the System Design and Development program, the governments technical baseline review, or TBR continues and is scheduled to be complete next month.  While the results of this comprehensive assessment are not yet available, let me give you my overall sense of the progress.  
I believe the many independent government assessments of the inherent capabilities of the F-35 system, affirm its fundamental value.  Not just in low observability, but in the power of its missions system.  Work done to date on the air vehicle support expectations of low signature and sound structural integrity in durability, the propulsion system is performing well and the on board systems are phenomenal.  And pilots immediately recognize their strength.  The combination of an advanced radar and sensor system along with an integrated communication suite, not only distinguish the F-35 but enhance and enable many other military assets for the F-35 will work with, thereby, improving their value as well.  This capability is needed, and valued, and continued investment in the program is warranted. 
The TBR then, is specifically focusing on both areas of accomplishment and areas of need.  With a negotiation of Lot-4 it appears the cost of the production program are likely to be favorable to prior estimate while the development program will need more resources in software development and flight test.  The TBR process is dedicated to developing its solid set of realistic and executable planning assumption, so that the program can be rebase lined as directed in the Nunn-McCurdy process, and that additional resources can be applied.
We recognize the long-term confidence in the program must be earned over time by executing and meeting commitments, and the baseline resulting from the TBR process, is an essential foundational requirement.
Moving to the C-130 J, we continue to ramp up production levels as customers expand their fleets.  The Government of [Iran], recently executed a new contract for 2 airlifters, and on the production line we delivered 7 aircraft and remain on track to a plan delivery of 26 aircraft this year.  Robust, domestic, and international demands remain consistent with our planning assumptions.  Received by Galaxy, achieved an important milestone in the modernization program with delivery of the first production C-5M aircraft to the air force mobility command.  With current plans calling for the modernization of 52 C-5 airlifters by 2016, delivery rates on these modernized aircraft will be ramping up to meet customer requirements.
This ramp up was supported by the government’s approval to proceed to full rate production.  I’m very proud of our team’s contribution and fielding the modernized C-5M as it provides significantly enhanced capabilities and improved mission readiness for the United States Air Force.  With the C-5M providing twice the capability, and costing less than half of other U.S. strategic airlifters, the value to the user community and the tax payer is compelling, and the program aligns well with DoD initiatives on cost savings, efficacy, and affordability improvements.
While accomplishments in Aeronautics are many, I was disappointed by the decertification of our EBMS system.  We’re committed to the highest standards in process and performance measurement systems.  And at Fort Worth, we’ve not maintained these standards.  We will correct the deficiencies that have been identified, we know what to do, we know how to do it, and we’re working closely with government subject matter experts on corrective actions.
Among other factors, implementation of accurate earned value management system measurement criteria requires stable, fully defined baselines for each program as well as some performance measurement history against which validations can occur. This takes time.  For the F-35, we’ll need performance history against the baseline that will be produced by the TBR, a process that will likely take 18 months or so.  But when we’re complete, we’ll have a best in class system. 
Turning to electronics systems, the team is doing a good job across the portfolio.  Two areas merit special recognition this quarter.  The Littoral combat ship and missile defense activity.  On the Littoral combat ship program, our second vessel at Fort Worth remains on cost and on schedule with more than 60% of the construction completed.  Lessons learned from construction of our initial ship that resulted in improved efficacy and a 30% reduction in labor hours on our second ship.  We look forward to the Navy’s decision, expected later this quarter to select a single design and the initial award of the Kinship order.  Current Navy procurement plans continue to support a 55 ship fleet.    
In Ballistic Missile Defense, key progress was achieved with successful completion of the critical design review on the medium extended air defense system.  This next generation mobile air and missile defense system will replace currently fielded defense capability.  MEADS provides full 360 degree coverage and can defend up to 8 times more area than current systems.  Cost efficiencies are also achievable in the MEADS design due to fewer system elements and lower life cycle cost.
Moving to Information Systems and Global Solutions, our team, working on the airborne and Maritime Fixed Station Joint Tactical Radio System, the program known as AMFM Gitters, successfully transferred data and live streaming video over an internet protocol wideband network between multiple air and ground nodes.  I know that’s a mouthful but what that means is that this exercise demonstrated the technical maturity of key AMFM Gitters hardware elements in a rotary wing environment and bring secure real-time, interoperable communications to the war fighter, one step closer to reality.  
In the area of new contract awards, I was very pleased to see our IS and GS team extend their multi decade relationship in providing information technology support and solutions to the Social Security Administration.  Under the $2.8 billion, 7 year IBIQ contract IS&GS will compete for task orders to provide a broad range of IT support.  We’ve watched the ongoing transformation at the Administration as they work to support the health and economic well-being of millions of Americans and we’re proud to play a role. 
Finally, let me cover two important satellite programs in space systems.  The team successfully launched the first advanced extremely high frequency satellite.  This is a technologically advanced military communication system that provides highly secure, survivable global communication for war fighters operating on ground, sea, and air platforms.  Advanced DHF remains a top priority in DoD, and there’s a potential for future additional satellite awards above the three satellites currently under contract.  After launch, the first satellite, experienced a failure of one of its orbit right rising engines.  We’re now working on an alternative method of moving into final orbit while still preserving the full planned orbiter life for the satellite.
We also completed the critical design review on the global positioning system 3 contract.  Completion of this milestone validates the design to insure it meets war fighter and civil requirements, and allows the program to begin the production phase.  GPS3 improves navigation, position, and timing services with signals 3 times more accurate and powerful than current GPS systems.  Space systems is currently working under a $3 billion contract to build up to 12 satellites for the United States Air Force.  
Finally, I’ve described for you, many times, my admiration for our workforce, and the quality of our leadership team.  I was very pleased to see Linda Gooden, Marilynn Houston, and Joann Maguire recently named among the 50 most powerful women in business by Fortune Magazine and our general council Mary Ann Lavin recognized by the Washington Post.  They are exceptional leaders whose talent and contributions are widely recognized inside and outside of our company.  And we are very, very proud of them.  
In the near-term we recognize we’re working in a more challenging environment as our customers face more volatility that will likely pressure our revenue growth, and as we face pension headwind that will likely increase pressure on earnings.  I have unshakable confidence in our future however, because of the quality of our portfolio and the quality of our people, and our collective willingness to do all that is necessary to affectively navigate this new reality.  
Let me turn the call over to Bruce now to provide some additional detail on the third quarter financial results, and some initial color on emerging trends and there potential impact on 2011 financials, and then Bruce and I will come back and take your questions, Bruce.

285827,114406912,80231,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives"," Thanks Bob.  We posted charts on our website to help with our discussion today, and at this time I’d encourage you to open the charts and follow along with me as I make my comments.Let’s begin with chart 3, a summary of significant of portfolio s",1167," 
Thanks Bob.  We posted charts on our website to help with our discussion today, and at this time I’d encourage you to open the charts and follow along with me as I make my comments.
Let’s begin with chart 3, a summary of significant of portfolio shaping and affordability actions we took this quarter.  First we’re pleased with the value we’ll receive with the announced sale of our EIG business for $815 million.  And as a reminder, with announced sale, the operating results for EIG have been classified as discontinued operations.  
As a result, we’ve lowered our 2010 sales and segment profit outlook by the amounts we expect EIG to contribute.  Other than this movement to discontinue operations, our guidance remains unchanged for the year. 
And finally, we do anticipate that this sale will close by year end.  As for PAE, as Bob said, we will expect to close that transaction later this year or early in 2011.  And moving down the same chart, to our voluntary executive separation program we have about 600 employees participating in the program and I’m sure you saw our AK announcing the $178 billion pretax charge for the program.  Over the next few weeks or months, we’ll be working with our customer to agree on the timing of recovery of the program cost in the amount of recurring savings that will generate going forward.      We would expect to recover majority of the program cost in the future as we price new business.  
You can now turn to chart 4 in our third quarter sales summary.  Overall the corporation grew 6% in the quarter.  Electronic Systems had the strongest growth at 10%, due primarily to the third quarter deliveries of our Persistent Threat Detection System or PTDS in the quarter.  This contract began earlier this year and all deliveries occurred in this quarter.      Both Aeronautics and IS&GS grew at 7% in the quarter with a growth in Aeronautics driven by the F-35 program and C-130 deliveries.  Growth at IS&GS was driven by the 2010 census program and our efforts at the Doe [inaudible] site.  Space Systems' sales were 5% lower than last year due to the absence of the commercial satellite sale; we had none this quarter versus 1 in the third quarter of last year.
Chart 5 shows our revised sales guidance with EIG and discontinued operations.  Again, the only change was removing the sales for EIG from the IS&GS projections.  Looking at the end of the year for each of the business areas, I would expect Electronic Systems and IS&GS to be at the high-end of their ranges.  Space Systems' to be at the low end of its range, and Aeronautics to likely be in the middle of its range.  
Chart 6 shows the same guidance changes for segment profit.  Again, looking at where we expect to end the year, I’d expect Electronic Systems, Space Systems, and Aeronautics to be at the high end of their ranges while IS&GS will be towards the lower end of its range.
Moving to chart 7 and our cash flow performance, again this quarter cash was very strong as we generated over $500 million in cash while contributing over $1 billion to our pension plans.  On a year-to-date basis, we have generated $3.4 billion in cash from operations while contributing $1.4 billion to our pension plans.  Without this contribution our operating cash through the first three quarters would have been $4.8 billion or more than $1 billion more than last year through the same period.  
Looking forward to the rest of the year, we were able to keep our guidance at $3.4 billion of operating cash while planning for an additional 800 million of pension contributions in the fourth quarter bringing our full year of contribution level to $2.2 billion.  
Turning to chart 8 we’ll look at our dividends and yield increases over the last 5 years.  With a 19% increase in dividends, we announced in the quarter our yield at the current share price is just under 4% and if you annualize the dividend increase, the yield exceeds 4%.  Combined with our share repurchases, we returned 76% of our year-to-date pre-cash flow to shareholders.  We’ll speak to our share repurchase activity on the next chart, chart 9.
Year-to-date we’ve repurchased almost 20 million shares for just under $1.6 billion.  That brings our current shares outstanding to less than 360 million.  A 4.1% decrease since the beginning of the year.  
On our next chart, chart 10, we’ll show our continuing earnings per share outlook compared with last quarter’s outlook.  In June we provided guidance of $7.15 to $7.35 per share.  Of course in this quarter we had the $178 billion charge for our vest which impacted the outlook for the year by $0.31 per share.  And moving the results of EIG into discontinued operations lowered our continuing earnings per share by an additional $0.11 per share. 
A number of other items committed to an overall two-set increase resulting in our new EPS guidance of $6.75 to $6.95 per share.
Finally, I’d like to give you a brief update on what we see as emerging trends as we head into 2011.  We still plan to provide our detailed guidance in January but wanted you to have an idea of the trends we’re seeing as we sit here today.  For the top line we expect our sales for continuing operations next year to grow at low single digit growth rate over this year.  Aeronautics will have another year of strong growth driven by the F-35 program and C-130 deliveries.  Electronic Systems will be flattish compared with this year, losing the benefits of the PTDS sales we have this year in addition to delays and expected rewards for the littoral combat ship, and additional bad production.  IS&GS will likely have a slight decrease as we finish the 2010 census this year, and lose that activity in 2011.  
In addition, we’re expecting the Federal IT market to shrink from 2 to 3% IN 2011 compared with 2010.  Between the PTDS and census program, we had nearly $1 billion in 2010 sales that will not be replicated in 2011.
Space Systems will also remain relatively flat compared with 2010 as we’ve been saying for some time now.  We expect segment profit to be similar to the 2010 level will result in lower [Ross] compared with 2010.  And as we look at our pension expense on a FASB CAS basis, our asset returns this far are favorable compared with our long-term assumption of 8 ½% return while the rates used to determine our discount rate have declined significantly throughout the year.  In addition, we are now assuming that CAS harmonization will be effective in 2012 rather than in 2011.  The combination of each of these items leads us to believe that the FASB CAS drag on our EPS will grow considerably in 2011.  With that, I think we’re ready for your questions.  Jevon, if you’d please open up the lines.

It may surprise some folks but in all honesty, we don’t buy a lot of the commodities and the metals and so forth that we use to build our products.  As it turns out, we tend to aggregate the demands for that - for those products and commodities and instead we let a lot of our suppliers use those aggregated demands to purchase those materials.  
And so what we tended to do in the past is establish some fairly long-term purchase agreements that provide us stability in both the supply as well as the pricing.  But think of that ability to aggregate the overall supply amongst a lot of different suppliers in our bases bring us the best prices.  
And I’ll tell you, relative to the specifics you cited, I’m not aware of any issues with our ability to acquire or price fluctuation or that it’s out of the ordinary of what we’re seeing today.

However, notionally we’ve had discussions with the Department of Defense Acquisition Team as we’ve extended these conversation about affordability initiatives in thinking through the prospect of increasing material prices and the greater need for us to act like a strategic buyer.  And that’s why this notion of long-term contract, long-term predictability, multi-year procurements have been advanced by - I think the industry community broadly because that will allow us to get the best possible prices really in any set of market conditions, even if there were to be some upward price pressure.  
Also, you asked the question about capacity constraints here.  We planned our program in a flexible way so we’re not experiencing any capacity shortfalls today at all.  And on our major program, take a C-130 as an example, we’ve been able to go from 16 to 26 to approximately 36 based on optimizing the investment that we’ve made.  To date, we’d be able to do the same thing on the Joint Strike Fighter.  We think our Littoral Combat Ship offering has been thought through in a similar set of circumstances.  
So we try to balance our view about the capacity in assuring that we have gated investments.  We call them gated, or we want to get a greater knowledge before we make entirely speculative investments about what the future horizon will look like.  We try to build as much flexibility in the capacity that we have.  And we also have thought through the prospect of potentially building down.  If there were more headwind, can we build down and still not lose the bubble on affordability or profitability.  The F-16 line is probably a good historical example of the ability to scale up as global circumstances change and customers - recapitalize needs vary and then to build down and build back up.
So the lessons that we’ve learned there we try to populate throughout the company.

I would characterize it as still enabling us to have the kind of margin expansion on the product program that I’ve been talking about in the past.

And I still think that’s the case.  I still think this contract enabled us to do that.  We wouldn’t have agreed to it if we didn’t think we could execute to it.  
It’s probably a little tighter in terms of the risks elements of it on the Share Line and the sealing that I would have otherwise liked.  But I think that puts a little bit of a premium on us to focus on our execution, but I think we’re capable of doing that.

So there’s additional discipline in the process and that’s not just on our side, it’s on the government side.  
And not withstanding Lot-4, but let me give you just a sense about this movement from cost-type, to fixed-price type contract.  There’s less flexibility overall in a fixed-price type of contract and that requires some behavioral changes.  You know, I’ll make up an overly simplified illustration.  It doesn’t really have much to do with Lot-4, but in a cost-reimbursable environment, if we agree that we are going to meet every quarter and the government would say we’d rather meet monthly, our first response is where, and when and what subject matters experts should we bring.  
Under a fixed-price contract, we will say we’re going to need to submit a change order to you to change the contract budge baseline to now include provision for the costs of meeting monthly.  That’s a behavioral difference.  
So I think we’re all trying to go into this environment with our eyes open.  As Bruce said, the wristband gets a little tighter on our side; the discipline, I think, gets cranked up on both sides.  We lose a little flexibility but we think the advantages of taking on modestly more risk or diminishing flexibility will be worn out by improved performance on the program and that’s what we’re all focused on.

You know, last year about this time we provided you guidance, not just for the year 2010 expectations, we tried to get a little longer-term view of what we’re expecting to see and I think during that call I talked about sales in 2011 as kind of being at the mid-single-digit level.  We’re now - we’re now talking about more like the low-single-digit level.  And in the items that you mentioned from the press release, the reasons for that diminished outlook - I’ll give you a couple of examples maybe to highlight each of what you’re talking about there.  
One on the delays, think of hurdles like the Littoral Combat Ship, which we are assuming in our numbers of 2011 as a win when we talk about the growth rate we’re seeing over 2010.  But we had expected when we were talking last year for that award to have been sometime in early summer of this year.  We’re now talking about a November award potentially.  So think of that being, you know, almost six months of delay there.  It doesn’t change obviously the overall expectations of sales for the Littoral Combat Ship, but it does - it does change the phasing.  So we’re going to shift some of those sales to the right and push some of the early ramp rate in 2011 over into 2012.  
The same exact thing is happening with the FAD, production loss.  We’d expect to get those earlier in the year.  It looks like they’ll be later in the year and it’s the same kind of delayed ramp up in the higher FAD production that we’re seeing there.  
On the cancellation side, the best example I think I can give to you there is we do a contract for  IS&GS called the FDI Sentinel Project which is really a case-management study or a case-management program where we were doing development to enable a lot greater capability of that system.  And I think in a large part due to the budget pressures within the Federal budget, but the decision was made to stop doing further production on that activity and instead essentially do with what you’ve got and go more into an operations and maintenance phase going forward as opposed to a development phase.  
So not so much a cancellation as a scope reduction.  In fact, reflecting I think the reality we’re talking about.  
And then on the adjacent market scenario, really we’re talking about there’s the energy market, and specifically there’s the concentrated solar power market.  We had talked to you last year at this time.  We had in play a potential deal we were looking at providing for Arizona Power Municipality.  As it turned out, it didn’t happen for a number of reasons, but we also thought there were a number of smaller arrangements around the country that were going to materialize.  And as we sit here today, again I think because - and frankly because of some of the fiscal pressures we’re seeing and the tax revenues going down, I think we’re seeing a delay in those particular types of projects.  And Bob, I’m [inaudible].

I would tell you that obviously we only speak for ourselves, but I’m going to guess we’re not the only one speaking to the predominant of the [inaudible] as described to you.  Even as early as April of 2009 when Secretary Gates had a number of program decisions and announcements, some of which impacted our company and some in which impacted others, we began to communicate to you and others our sense and the praise we viewed in this new reality.  And big part of that new reality was the fiscal challenges that our nation’s facing and the need to adapt, just some fiscal discipline.  
As a result, you know, we’re seeing the - I think some building of the pressure on that horizon.  Bruce gave you some illustrations about delays and cancellations.  As we watch the Bills work their way through the congress, I think there was a level of interest that drew our attention in the Senate Appropriations Committee mark because they talked about the number of programs.  I even think that if I get the math right, I think the number’s 41 programs they may have described as being delayed in some fashion.  The result of which was they’re withholding some funding to see if those delays were going to be recovered or whether they were going to be persistent.  So I think there’s a broader observation of the process slowing down a little and that’s why among the affordability initiatives that Dr. Carter [released], we are keenly interested in adding our full prodded voice and any experience we have in our energy and focusing on shortening the cycle time.  Not only because it will help remedy the discussion that Bruce just had with you now about the onset of revenue recognition, but we pulled out all the way through to floor structure and military capability, that can be fielded.  And we don’t want to see that process delayed either because the real value of the systems we work on, if you think of returns on their value commences when they get fielded and put into operational services.  
So we - I think we have joined objectives and initiatives with the administration in getting this right.  But our job here is to make sure that we’re as clear and transparent and can give you the best of our professional judgement as we look out over pretty complicated landscape and give you a feel that we have a future. 
I’ll also say we’ve not hesitated in taking actions here that would be consistent with our appraisal of this future.  Even as far back as 2009, we began consolidations where our program baselines would be changed.  We’ve gone through some pretty painful reductions in force and that’s something we work hard to avoid, but we can’t avoid the reality of sizing the workforce to the volume of work that we have to accomplish with the government.  We - we’ve elected some of the vestures here that we’ve described to you fully to help us focus and really meet new sets of expectations in the markets that we serve.  But also to help us get a greater operational focus.  
We talked about the voluntary separation program.  We’ve been scrubbing our expense budgets and our capital budgets and really focusing on generating operational cash, which we think is a very important focus area as we adapt to the new reality which we are committed to adapting to, and  running this business well.  We think it’s very sound judgement on our part to focus on cash so that we can certainly weather any financial challenges we have, but also very much prepare for what we believe will be a re-establishment of the growth trajectory for the business in the future as we go through these early rounds of budget examination to see what new baselines will look like.  
I like the priorities our programs enjoy.  I like the support that we’ve had in the President’s budget with the administration.  I like the support that we’ve had in Congress overall.  As a statement about the portfolio, I think we align well with the military and intelligence community needs and some markets will probably accelerate and some will have a little pressure and we’ll do our best to have sound judgement here as we allocate resources and do not over invest in emerging or adjacent market areas so that we have difficulties in returning value on those investments and we’ll stay very focused and we’ll do our best to keep you advised in advance of our experience in these challenges.

You asked about pension, dividend, share repos and the actions we took in the quarter and what that means for the future.  I’ll start off with pension just to begin with because that’s a big moving piece of the whole discussion.  As I said in my prepared remarks, we are now assuming that cash harmonization is effective in 2012 versus 2011.  That actually has the effect of lowing the CAS number in 2011 from what we expected.  That’s one of the contributors to the additional FASB CAS GAAP relative to ETS that I talked about earlier.  
The discount rates have - are significantly lower and I don’t think that’s a great surprise to anyone.  They’re lower now than they were at the end of the last year.  And we still need to see how much change we’re going to see between now and the year end.  
Relative to the $2.2 billion, you know, we might give a little bit of tutorial relative to the risk of funding requirements for pension plans.  The ERISA, which obviously is the law that governs our pension plans in general, basically treats the discount rate and difference and either our FAS evaluation or our CAS in that discount rate for ERISA is for all intents and purposes, kind of set now going into next year.  So think of it as a 24-month moving average.  So we kind of know what that is now and with the contributions to get us to the 2.2 and where we expect our asset returns to be by the end of the year, we think that this additional contribution amount will get us to the 80 percent funded level at the start of 2011 relative to an ERISA measurement perspective, which gets us in line with the expectation of the PPA, the Pension Protection Act that becomes effective for us in 2011.  
And in that scenario, unless there are future changes beyond in 2011 in the form of lower discount rates or obviously lower asset returns, we would not expect to have to make additional discretionary contributions into the fund as we’ve done for the last few years.  In essence, the baseline - I’ll call them the baseline ERISA requirements for contributions will be what it takes to keep the fund funded.  Not just the 80 percent to actually grow that number over time. So a lot of what we’ve talked about recently in terms of discretionary contributions, we would not expect to have to make anywhere near that level going forward.  
On the dividend, we took a look at where we sat from the dividend perspective and our growth prospects and we just felt that - and I should say we talked to an awful lot of investors as well who felt that in today’s environment, a strong cash generating company with a strong dividend yield was looked upon favorably.  And so we did that consciously under that assumption.  
And then on the share repurchases, we probably were a little bit lighter in the quarter here this year.  We still expect to continue, although we’ve, you know, as compared to the first three quarters of last year actually were up compared to where we were last year.  I think some of that was just the phasing what we did in the first half of the year.  I don’t see that changing, Joe, as we go forward because we still, you know, the 50 percent of free cash flow going forward that we’ve done for quite some times is still our plan.  
And I think your last question concerned the EIG net receipt that we expect to get from that.  And we would expect to net out about a ½ billion dollars, thinking that relatively EIG sale.  And we would continue to use them in our - I’ll just characterize it as our general purpose use of cash for all the sorts of three things that we talked about earlier.

So we had more inflection-to-date pickups.  As we start into kind of the new contracts post-multiyear, with the volume coming there, as you point out, there are higher numbers of aircraft.

You know that, the answer to that is it all depends, but right now we’re not concerned.  What we - if you look historically, we’ve had a good number of fixed-price type contracts where we execute very well.  So the discussion in my mind is not whether or not risk is transferred or the contract type is cost reimbursable, fixed prices. What are the underlying conditions in behaviors that align with the contract type?  There is no magic in a contract type.  The magic is in alignment and that’s not just from our point of view, that’s the government’s point of view.  
So as a matter of professional discipline on our part, we’re going to continue to advance discussions that say, if we want to undertake a different kind of contracting architecture here, let’s also undertake all the responsibilities that are necessary to align the conditions that make that contracting methodology successful for you, the government and us the industry.  And so far, I believe we’ve been able to do that and I tried to highlight a little of Lot-4 F35.  There will be some behavioral changes and there’ll be some discipline, and there will be some reduction in flexibility.  We won’t jigger around the configuration, we’ll be - we’ll have a tighter bandwidth on performance all around.  And I believe the government is up for that and we are certainly up for that and we know how to do this.  We have the breadth and depth of our portfolio has been such that we’ve got lots of experience across the company and what we’re working on now is to make sure that we’re populating that experience across the company so that perhaps if there are organizations who in the recent past have not had familiarity with fixed price incentive type contracts, they’re becoming a lot smarter about fixed-priced contracting environments today as we think out government customers would want us to be so that we don’t fail to meet the execution responsibilities and commitments that we make.  
So I mean, it is a concerted focus here.  We’re not overly concerned about it.  We can believe we have defined financial returns and generate value there as we have to deliver commitments under contracts to government customers.

That’s the only reason I don’t want to offer it at this time.  But I will tell you, as we look at the transition from the FDD program into production, if we look at the movement of cost, if we look at the likely returns, the cost reimbursable environment through the transition production and the transition fixed price contracting, I tell you, this is in line with historic standards, save for maybe two observations that we did share with you and others, a 50/50 share line in Lot-4 is a little more aggressive and 120% sealing is a little tighter, but then we believed we had a constructive and valuable discussion about the content of the program, the configuration of the aircraft, what’s expected to be delivered.  And those are the areas that tend to put pressure on cost.  When you don’t have as thorough an understanding about content or what is exactly deliverable - we’ve tried to take that on earlier with full cooperation from our customer because our customer wanted us to step up and embrace some of this fixed-price incentive contract modeling.
So it isn’t again, that we say no, we can’t do that - our viewpoint honestly is we can do a lot of things provided that conditions are consistent to warrant the contracting methodology and the architecture in the contract.

First off, if I go back to my early days when I started my career in Fort Worth working the F-16 program, every single F-16 contract in production was an FDI contract.  So we’ve had this experience now for, in my case, almost 30 years.  
And as I look at the F-35 in particular, you know, not to directly answer your question relative to target price and margins and so forth, but I found one of the interesting things as I looked at it is you take a look at the cost, the target cost on the L-rip 1 aircraft, so that was for two aircraft and compare that with the target cost of L rip-4, the cost of the L rip-4 aircraft are about half as much as the cost of the L-rip 1 aircrafts.  So think of that in 31 aircrafts down the product line, we’ve lowered the cost amount on those aircraft by half and the other aspect as I look at from the risk perspective Bob described as far as working this contract is, you know, I very much view the L-rip 4 contract is the risk we’re taking on is continued, I’ll say performance down the learning curve.  
I think we have a good understanding between ourselves and the government relative to concurrency risk with new findings in the SDD contract, the development contract such that that will not sort of bleed over onto the L-rip 4 contract.  And it’s because of that, that I ultimately felt comfortable signing the - or getting the agreements with the contract with the terms that we have.

Actually, I think we probably know about as much of the U.K. decision on F-35 as you do.  I mean, you have to sort of filter out the things that are being described and discussed as the process is unfolding from the actual results of the process.  It’s a very comprehensive review that’s been undertaking in the United Kingdom, it’s very broad.  It’s very deep.  It’s very forward looking.  
I don’t even think the exact numbers of airplanes to be procured, have been determined as I’m sure - which is typical of all national security planners that we deal with in our international and domestic community.  We try to work through concepts of operations likely future scenarios, how much equipment will need to be capable, on what date to accomplish what task.  So I believe we’re watching the results flow out of the U.K. sort of in process.  Where some determinations have been made, I think the judgment to move away from Stovall to the carrier variant.  And I’m going to make some guesses here Peter, but that that decision might be made to enhance interoperability, to enable potentially U.S. aircraft to land on U.K. aircraft carriers, where French aircraft, or vice versa.  So I think that the experience we’ve had has been judgments are made on capability, total expense, lifecycle cost, interoperability, flexibility.  And that’s what we’re seeing in the U.K.  And we’ll have to see what ultimate judgments are made about airplanes.  But just stick with the F-35 for awhile.  
We’ve long expected that there would be substantial movement over time.  In the total estimated volumes of airplanes to be procured, whether they’re U.S. airplanes for the Air Force, the Navy, or the Marine Corps or whether they’re for are international partners.  The model we’ve offered before, the one that we think is the most relevant to the situation we face today on the F-35 is the F-16, started at little more than 900 airplanes grew into 4400 airplanes.  In 26 countries we’re still seeing follow on orders from those countries to back build support, extend their fleet.  
I very much believe that will be the case of, for the F-35.  And I know, governments now are facing tough economic conditions.  But they’re also facing very tough security environments.  I do believe this airplane has already demonstrated the fundamental capabilities that cause individuals to recognize its enormous value.  So I rather suspect, we’ll see it in the case of the U.K., reduction in the quantity, but we’ll also see cases like Israel who was not an investing partner in the core program, who’s come forward in the queue.  They’ve talked about 75 airplanes in total, they’d like to get the first [inaudible], I think 18 to 20, or whatever that number will be sooner.  
I believe other governments and countries in the Middle East, in the Asia Pacific theater are also recognizing very significant security challenges.  I think some of those countries are feeling less pressured in their fiscal environments.  They might have more resources, and may look at the current circumstances with regard to the U.K. or maybe other countries who are lessening the buyer, delaying the buys as a opportunity to get in the queue, and to buy airplanes.  Our focus here has to be on execution.  And we’re not going to allow ourselves to be distracted.  We’re certainly not overly concerned or hyperventilating.  I suspect they’ll be some EBB and Flow in quantities and timing, and even aircraft types.
But we’ve got a very capable program foundation here.  We talk a lot about the Stovall because it deserves to have the conversation since its 40 flights behind its schedule and we’re having some component failures.  The time we spend there causes us to talk less about the CTOL and the CV version that are really flying very well.  And I assure you that the United States Navy and the United States Air Force are very excited about the prospects of performance of this program, and recognize the contributions we can make by delivering this capability as do our international partner.  
So I’ll tell you again, get a seat with a seat belt on it, because this is not the first discussion we’re going to have with international partners about quantities or aircraft types or timing.  There will be more.  Our goal is to stay close to those customers, support them in every possible way we can, and give them very realistic appraisals about our performance and what they should expect.  Not just on cost and pricing, and availability, but aircraft capability.  
  Extending the discussion beyond the F-35, when we look at the international market place, we still see growth opportunities for our business.  Our portfolio is well populated with the kinds of capabilities that governments place a high priority on.  Like missile defense.  I know we can’t get talk definitively about the littoral combat ship, but I really believe deeply in that mission, and deeply in the concept of a ship of this class in the littorals.  And I’m confident other international governments do as well.  So there would be international opportunities there, for the C-130.  We believe they’re strong interest.  We’re not done delivering F-16s yet, and have significant campaigns under way that you know, support the evolution of F-35 quantities.  
So our sense is, we’re living in a world that has a lot of security challenges, notwithstanding the economic pressures.  What’s really going to matter is, do you have a mature portfolio, have you demonstrated that the systems that your working on, actually work when they’re placed into service they do.  And can you deliver according to the commitments that are under the contract.  Those are the fundamental details we focus on without allowing ourselves to be distracted.  So I don’t see a dramatic [inaudible] or change in the expectations for international growth.  We’re committed to staying on that pattern.  We’ll redouble some efforts in our international support community.  We’ll flow resources, talent people, executive presence there, and then we’ll work with the U.S. government here as we develop the budget for 2012, figure out what will happen through the continuing resolution, and the potential laying duck session for the 2011 funding, and keep you advised.

But sticking to that number, if you assume the 5%, that’s about 400 million of the 550 or so that you’re talking about.

A editorial note, at least from my point of view, I’ve heard some discussion about what was expected versus what was happened.  What happened was what I expected, so.  And I won’t comment more about that, I just find it interesting.      So more than 70% of those who have accepted the voluntary executive separation program are retirement eligible, which means they could walk out the door today.  And I’ll be very candid in my selection of language with you.  It isn’t as though the actions that we’ve taken or that I’ve authorized here are taking us off a cliff.  These folks were going to leave in the next couple of years anyway.  And the question in our mind was, how do you want to orchestrate the environment in which seasoned senior folks are going to leave.  And we elected to take ourselves to a position, rather than allow circumstances to envelope us and take us in a place that we have not planned for - or couldn’t adequately predict what the outcome would be.  
  So years ago, we began planning through a series of executive rotations.  Perhaps you’re familiar with the phrase full spectrum leadership, the investment in a center for leadership excellence here to begin to populate a set of experience to rotation of assignments, and broadening experiences in this company.  A cadre of talent, it was not retirement eligible today, recognizing we’ve got a demographic ship not just in our company and our industry, but throughout our government where the baby boomers are going to go to retirement.  And they’re going to go no matter what you and I do.  
So the best program was part of a much broader articulated strategy of how to transition through generational change in our company without losing the bubble on execution or programs.  So we began to link executives through mentoring program and through experiential relationships so that we would grow the population underneath the senior leaders who were about to depart.  And you added an important component here, the phasing of executive responsibility.  So let’s do some math;  600 or so people will leave between now and February.  Our sense was that they would be leaving in the relatively near-term anyway.  
We begun early phasing in a variety of ways where it makes sense to do that.  We won’t back fill, so entire compliment of 600 executives because a principle goal for us is to get leaner, more streamline, to right size this business, but we will back fill while we consolidate and realign our organizational focus.  We think that makes us stronger, not weaker.  And we’ll have people who will be placed into these realigned executive responsibilities, who have had experience, who do have contact with those who will be departing.  In some cases, under the direct tutelage of those who will be leaving, and I will say this about the professional work force that we have, including our retires today and our soon to become retirees who are in the Vest program.  They care deeply about the mission.  They care deeply about this company, and there is not one who would fail to help a colleague even after they were to depart in February.  So I think we’re very well aligned to face the reality that we’re all facing.  And others I guess, will go about this at a approach that they think makes sense.  This approach in our judgment was exactly the way we ought to navigate in this new reality, knowing we’re going to face the challenge that we’re facing.  
So I think we’re very well positioned here.  I don’t expect a single blimp on a program, I don’t expect any difficulty.  We have plenty of phasing in time, which we are doing now.  And we’ll continue to stay very focused on this.  It’s not just going to be through February, but when new people go to new assignments at any time, under any set of conditions, we try to give them more rather than less help to make sure we’re all getting grounded and our expectations are clear and communications are crisp.  And we’re prepared to do that, and have means and mechanisms in place now to help facilitate that.  
So I’m pleased you asked the question because I think we haven’t talked a lot about beyond the numbers, what do you expect in an operating environment from the company as you move forward, and your question gave us an opportunity to highlight that a bit.

Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone. As our release this morning outlined, operational performance continued at a good pace during the third quarter and we achieved solid financial results, including sales expansion of 6% and continued exceptional cash flow generation. 
Our focus on operating cash has been the centerpiece of our strategy that enables sustained investments in the business and sustained returns to shareholders through share repurchases and increases in our dividend. And I think this strategy is working well, as evidenced by our ability to increase the quarterly dividend by 19% this quarter, extending our double-digit dividend increases eight consecutive years.
Let me start with an update on matters relating to the external environment, which we're operating in, and address some emerging trends. When we last spoke in July, I highlighted what we termed “the new reality that we're facing”. Greater security needs emerging, with fewer resources available to meet them. To address this environment, the Defense Department has continued to clarify its objective of implementing major changes in the way equipment and services are procured from contractors, with the goal to save more than $100 billion over the next five years from overhead and other accounts without negatively affecting Warfighters.
Once realized, these savings would be invested in new equipment and applied to preserve troop strength even as military budgets flatten in the future. On September 14, Under Secretary for Defense Acquisition, Dr. Ash Carter, provided additional detail into 23 areas of improvement to make the department's procurement offices and defense contractors more efficient. These actions were broadly characterized into five major areas: Targeting affordability and controlling cost growth, incentivizing productivity and innovation in industry, promoting real competition, improving tradecraft in services acquisition and reducing non-productive processes and bureaucracy.
Within each of these categories, there are more specific areas of focus like advancing the use of should-cost modeling, eliminating redundant government reporting and review requirements, shortening acquisition cycle times and increasing the use of fixed-price incentive type contracts. Since implementation of these initiatives by the department was planned to be phased in over time, we've not yet seen their total effect on our business and we've been advised that some areas will require additional study and be subject to more detailed future guidance.
We have, however, agreed to the use of a fixed-price incentive-type contracts on our F-35 program in the Lot 4 Low-Rate Initial Production lot, which I'll cover later in greater detail, and we certainly welcome the focus on shortening cycle times, as we're seeing the opposite effect. Components of the acquisition process have been consuming more time. Some negotiations have taken longer. Some awards have been delayed, all having the effect of putting pressure on future growth prospects. So we're looking forward to working with the department and seeing some tangible results from these streamlining initiatives, and we'll keep you posted as they unfold.
Relative to our strategic focus, cost reduction and efficiency initiatives, we're making good progress. We've entered into an agreement to divest our Enterprise Integration Group to Veritas Capital for $815 million in cash. While this transaction is subject to government antitrust review, we expect to close before year end. 
Our Pacific Architects & Engineers unit continues to see solid interest from potential buyers, and we're on a timeline that supports closure either late in the fourth quarter of this year or early in the first quarter next year. These actions, plus the rebalancing of our Global Logistics & Training business, will provide a more crisp focus for our operations.
We also previously announced implementation of a voluntary executive separation program, designed to right-size the company, reduce layers of management, enhance affordability, tighten reporting relationships and allow for more direct lines of communication, both inside the company and with our customers. This program has been a solid success, with approximately 600 employees participating. We will backfill some of these positions, but not all of them, and we've already begun the process of organizational transition and knowledge transfer as we move to a more efficient model.
I want to thank those executives who are participating for their valuable contributions and many years of service to our company and to our customers. Their work has been professional and it's been highly valued. Our focus on reducing overhead costs, travel expenses and capital expenditures continues, with a renewed emphasis on working with our supply chain. With approximately 2/3 of the cost of our products procured from vendors, we must continue to drive down costs and improve quality, delivery and reliability. These actions are essential to enable us to deliver the best value to customers and financial performance for shareholders.
Turning to operational performance, we had a solid quarter, with key accomplishments across all business areas. In Aeronautics, I'll highlight three programs where special attention’s warranted. On F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, we continue to see progress across many areas of the program, but challenges remaining in others. 
In the flight test program, the overall tempo of flights continues to ramp up, as evidenced by completion of 133 flights this quarter or almost as many flights in the quarter as the 136 that were completed during the first six months of this year. This acceleration in the flight test program was planned and expected. Flight test performance continued ahead of plan on both the conventional takeoff and landing in the carrier variants, while the short takeoff and vertical landing of flight completions remain behind schedule. Overall, we're 26 flights ahead of plan through September and are tracking towards achievement of the planned 394 flights for the year.
Looking at some detail. The STOL variant is 61 flights ahead of plan and the carrier variant is 5 flights ahead of plan, while the STOVL variant is 40 flights behind plan. STOVL aircraft component reliability continues to be the principal focus area. We're pursuing a multi-faceted approach to improve tempo that is working to obtain higher levels of spare components and parts from vendors to keep the aircraft in a flight-ready condition, while completing the analysis and corrective action planning to address the root cause conditions. 
On the software front, we are about 85% complete with the development of over 15 million lines of code, but much work remains. The software flying now has shown good stability and good functionality, but more resources will be needed to complete software, build and test. We're adding an additional software integration line and additional staff to increase capacity and improve productivity.
I thought it might be interesting to give you an example of a day in the life of complex systems development. During routine ground testing of the F-35 fuel management subsystem, a software anomaly was detected. While we never experienced this problem in flight, testing indicated the potential that a fuel boost pump could shut down. Upon detection, flight operations were immediately suspended as a prudent precaution, a corrective modification to the software was immediately undertaken by the fuel system supplier and flight testing was resumed, limiting the impact to the flight test schedule to about a week. 
To the uninitiated, this may not seem like all that much. But from my point of view, it's a model of professionalism in the government industry partnership where testing was undertaken with rigor, roles and responsibilities were clear, high standards were maintained and safety was paramount. The process was transparent and effective and resulted in a better airplane, without taking on any unnecessary risk. 
Production activities continue to ramp up at Fort Worth, with Low-Rate Initial Production work yielding good progress on factory cost performance, but with some schedule pressure. Solid cost performance and learning curve data enabled us to reach agreement on price with the government this quarter on the Low-Rate Initial Production Lot 4 contract for 32 aircraft under a fixed-price incentive-type contract structure. With a 50-50 share line and a 120% ceiling, this contract will be challenging and will require focused attention on execution.
We're working through the normal process to definitize the contract. And once finalized, the Lot 4 contract will bring the total backlog of production aircraft to 63. International support for the program continues to evolve. We were pleased with Canada's announcement to acquire the F-35 as their next-generation fighter aircraft, as well as the Israeli government signing a Letter of Offer and Acceptance for procurement of the F-35 for their future fighter fleet. 
The United Kingdom is completing a far-reaching strategic review, the results of which will be known shortly. In fact, I believe Prime Minister David Cameron is presenting the details of the plan now. Our sense is that the plan will result in the reduction in the number of Joint Strike Fighters to be purchased from below the original planning number, which is 138 aircraft. 
We also believe they are likely to go to the carrier version of the airplane as compared to the original planning, which was the short takeoff and vertical landing variant, as they proceed with two aircraft carriers, one configured with a catapult that supports the carrier variant operations. As I've said, the Prime Minister is, I believe, releasing some additional details of the plan now, even as we speak.
We further sense that both partner and non-partner countries will continue their planning for the F-35. Some may reduce quantities or delay the onset of production and others may increase and accelerate their buy, and we'll do all that we can to be flexible and supportive as our customers evolve their concepts of operations and their recapitalization needs. 
In the system design and development program, the government's technical baseline review or TBR continues and is scheduled to be complete next month. While the results of this comprehensive assessment are not yet available, let me give you my overall sense of the progress.
I believe the many independent government assessments of the inherent capabilities of the F-35 system affirm its fundamental value, not just in low observability but in the power of its Mission Systems. Work done to date on the air vehicle supports expectations of low signature and sound structural integrity and durability. The propulsion system is performing well, and the onboard systems are phenomenal, and pilots immediately recognize their strength.
The combination of an advanced radar and sensor system, along with an integrated communication suite, not only distinguish the F-35, but enhance and enable many other military assets that the F-35 will work with, thereby improving their value as well. This capability is needed and valued, and continued investment in the program is warranted. The TBR then is specifically focusing on both areas of accomplishment and areas of need. With the negotiation of the Lot 4, it appears the cost of the production program are likely to be favorable to prior estimates, while the development program will need more resources in software development and flight test. 
The TBR process is dedicated to developing a solid set of realistic and executable planning assumptions, so that the program can be re-baselined as directed in the Nunn-McCurdy process and that additional resources can be applied. We recognize that long-term confidence in the program must be earned over time by executing and meeting commitments and the baseline resulting from the TBR process is an essential foundational requirement.
Moving to the C-130J., we continue to ramp up production levels, as customers expand their fleets. The Government of Oman recently executed new contract for two airlifters. And on the production line, we delivered seven aircraft and remain on track to a planned delivery of 26 aircraft this year. Robust domestic and international demand remains consistent with our planning assumptions.
The C-5 Galaxy achieved an important milestone in the modernization program, with delivery of the first production C-5M aircraft to the Air Force Mobility Command. With current plans calling for the modernization of 52 C-5 airlifters by 2016, delivery rates on these modernized aircraft will be ramping up to meet customer requirements. This ramp up was supported by the government's approval to proceed to full-rate production. 
I'm very proud of our team's contribution in fielding the modernized C-5M, as it provides significantly enhanced capabilities and improved mission readiness to the United States Air Force. With the C-5M providing twice the capability, and costing less than half of other U.S. strategic airlifters, the value to the user community and the taxpayer is compelling and the program aligns well with DoD initiatives on cost savings, efficiency and affordability improvements.
While accomplishments in Aeronautics are many, I was disappointed by the decertification of our EVMS system. We're committed to the highest standards in process and performance measurement systems. And at Fort Worth, we've not maintained these standards. We will correct the deficiencies that have been identified. We know what to do, we know how to do it, and we're working closely with government subject matter experts on corrective actions. 
Among other factors, implementation of accurate earned value management system measurement criteria requires stable, fully-defined baselines for each program, as well as some performance measurement history against which validation can occur. This takes time. For the F-35, we will need performance history against the baseline that will be produced by the TBR, a process that will likely take 18 months or so. But when we’re complete, we'll have a best-in-class system.
Turning to Electronic Systems. The team is doing a good job across the portfolio. Two areas merit special recognition this quarter: The Littoral Combat Ship and Missile Defense activities. On the Littoral Combat Ship program, our second vessel, the Fort Worth, remains on cost and on schedule, with more than 60% of the construction completed. Lessons learned from construction of our initial ship have resulted in improved efficiency and a 30% reduction in labor hours on our second ship. 
We look forward to the Navy's decision, expected later this quarter, to select a single design and the initial award of the 10-ship order.  Current Navy procurement plans continue to support a 55-ship fleet. 
In ballistic missile defense, key progress was achieved with successful completion of the critical design review on the Medium Extended Air Defense System. This next-generation mobile air and missile defense system will replace currently fielded defense capabilities. MEADS provides full 360-degree coverage and can defend up to 8x more area than current systems. Cost efficiencies are also achievable in the MEADS design due to fewer system elements and lower lifecycle costs.
Moving to Information Systems & Global Solutions. Our team working on the Airborne and Maritime/Fixed Station Joint Tactical Radio System, the program known as AMF JTRS, successfully transferred data and live streaming video over an internet protocol wideband network between multiple air and ground nodes. I know that's a mouthful. But what that means is that this exercise demonstrated the technical maturity of key AMF JTRS hardware elements in a rotary wing environment and brings secure, real-time, interoperable communications to the Warfighter one step closer to reality.
In the area of new contract awards, I was very pleased to see our IS&GS team extend their multi-decade relationship in providing information technology support and solutions to the Social Security Administration. Under the $2.8 billion seven-year ID/IQ contract, IS&GS will complete for task orders to provide a broad range of IT support. We watched the ongoing transformation at the Administration as they work to support the health and economic well-being of millions of Americans, and we're proud to play a role.
Finally, let me cover two important satellite programs and Space Systems. The team successfully launched the first Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellite. This is a technologically advanced military communication system that provides highly secure survivable global communications for Warfighters operating on ground, sea and air platforms. Advanced EHF remains a top priority in DoD, and there's a potential for future additional satellite awards above the three satellites currently under contract. After launch, our first satellite experienced a failure of one of its orbit right raising engines. We're now working on an alternative method of moving into final orbit, while still preserving the full planned orbital life of the satellite.
We also completed a critical design review on the Global Positioning System III contract. Completion of this milestone validates the design to ensure it meets Warfighter and civil requirements and allows the program to begin the production phase. GPS III improved navigation, position and timing services with signals 3x more accurate and powerful than current GPS systems. Space Systems is currently working under a $3 billion contract to build up to 12 satellites for the United States Air Force.
Finally, I've described for you many times my admiration for our workforce and the quality of our leadership team. I was very pleased to see Linda Gooden, Marilyn Hewson and Joanne Maguire recently named among the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business by Fortune Magazine; and our General Counsel, Maryanne Lavan, recognized by the Washington Post. They are exceptional leaders, whose talent and contributions are widely recognized inside and outside of our company; and we are very, very proud of them.
In the near term, we recognize we're working in a more challenging environment, as our customers face more volatility that will likely pressure our revenue growth, and as we face pension headwinds, that will likely increase pressure on earnings. I have unshakable confidence in our future, however, because of the quality of our portfolio and the quality of our people and our collective willingness to do all that is necessary to effectively navigate this new reality.
Let me turn the call over to Bruce now to provide some additional detail on the third quarter financial results and some initial color on emerging trends and their potential impact on 2011's financials. And then Bruce and I will come back and take your questions. Bruce?"
285827,114406912,80252,"Lockheed Martin Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2010",2010-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Lockheed Martin Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Bob. We've posted charts on our website to help with our discussion today. And at this time, I'd encourage you to open the charts and follow along with me as I make my comments.Let's begin with Chart 3 and a summary of significant portfolio shap",1168,"Thanks, Bob. We've posted charts on our website to help with our discussion today. And at this time, I'd encourage you to open the charts and follow along with me as I make my comments.
Let's begin with Chart 3 and a summary of significant portfolio shaping and affordability actions we took this quarter. First, we're pleased with the value we will receive with the announced sale of our EIG business for $815 million. And as a reminder, with the announced sale, the operating results for EIG have been classified as discontinued operations. As a result, we've lowered our 2010 sales and segment profit outlook by the amounts we expect EIG to contribute. Other than this movement to discontinued operations, our guidance remains unchanged for the year. And finally, we do anticipate that this sale will close by year end. 
As for PAE, as Bob said, we will expect to close that transaction later this year or early in 2011. And moving down the same chart to our voluntary executive separation program, we have about 600 employees participating in the program, and I'm sure you saw our 8-K announcing the $178 million pretax charge for the program. Over the next few weeks or months, we'll be working with our customer to agree on the timing of recovery of the program cost and the amount of recurring savings that it will generate going forward. We would expect to recover majority of the program cost in the future as we price new business.
If you'll now turn to Chart 4 in our third quarter sales summary. Overall, the corporation grew 6% in the quarter. Electronic Systems had the strongest growth at 10%, due primarily to the third quarter deliveries of our Persistent Threat Detection System or PTDS in the quarter. This contract began earlier this year and all deliveries occurred in this quarter. 
Both Aeronautics and IS&GS grew at 7% in the quarter, with the growth in Aeronautics driven by the F-35 program and C-130 deliveries. Growth at IS&GS was driven by the 2010 census program and our efforts at the DOE Hanford site. Space Systems sales were 5% lower than last year due to the absence of a commercial satellite sale. We had none this quarter versus one in the third quarter of last year.
Chart 5 shows our revised sales guidance, with EIG in discontinued operations. Again, the only change was removing the sales for EIG from the IS&GS projections. Looking at the end of the year for each of the business areas, I would expect Electronic Systems and IS&GS to be at the high end of their ranges. Space Systems to be at the low end of its range and Aeronautics to likely be in the middle of its range.
Chart 6 shows the same guidance changes for segment profit. Again, looking at where we expect to end the year, I'd expect Electronic Systems, Space Systems and Aeronautics to be at the high end of their ranges, while IS&GS will be towards the lower end of its range.
Moving to Chart 7 and our cash flow performance. Again, this quarter, cash was very strong, as we generated over $500 million in cash, while contributing over $1 billion to our pension plans. On a year-to-date basis, we have generated $3.4 billion in cash from operations, while contributing $1.4 billion to our pension plans. Without this contribution, our operating cash through the first three quarters would've been $4.8 billion or more than $1 billion more than last year through the same period.
Looking forward to the rest of the year, we were able to keep our guidance at $3.4 billion of operating cash, while planning for an additional $800 million of pension contributions in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year contribution level to $2.2 billion.
Turning to Chart 8. We'll look at our dividend and yield increases over the last five years. With the 19% increase in dividends we announced in the quarter, our yield at the current share price is just under 4%. And if you annualize the dividend increase, the yield exceeds 4%. Combined with our share repurchases, we have returned 76% of our year-to-date free cash flow to shareholders. We'll speak to our share repurchase activity on the next chart, Chart 9.
Year-to-date, we've repurchased almost 20 million shares for just under $1.6 billion. That brings our current shares outstanding to less than 360 million, a 4.1% decrease since the beginning of the year. 
On our next chart, Chart 10, we'll show our continuing earnings per share outlook compared with last quarter's outlook. In June, we provided guidance of $7.15 to $7.35 per share. Of course, in this quarter, we had the $178 million charge for our VESP, which impacted the outlook for the year by $0.31 per share. And moving the results of EIG into discontinued operations lowered our continuing earnings per share by an additional $0.11 per share. A number of other items netted to an overall $0.02 increase resulting in our new EPS guidance of $6.75 to $6.95 per share. 
Finally, I'd like to give you a brief update on what we see as emerging trends as we head into 2011. We still plan to provide our detailed guidance in January, but wanted you to have an idea of the trends we're seeing as we sit here today. For the top line, we expect our sales from continuing operations next year to grow at low single-digit growth rate over this year. Aeronautics will have another year of strong growth, driven by the F-35 program and C-130 deliveries. Electronic Systems will be flattish compared with this year, losing the benefits of the PTDS sales we have this year in addition to delays in expected awards from the Littoral Combat Ship and additional FAD production.
IS&GS will likely have a slight decrease since we finished the 2010 census this year and lose that activity in 2011. In addition, we are expecting the federal IT market to shrink some 2% to 3% in 2011 compared with 2010. Between the PTDS and census programs, we have nearly $1 billion in 2010 sales that will not be replicated in 2011. Space Systems will also remain relatively flat compared with 2010, as we've been saying for some time now.
We expect segment profit to be similar to the 2010 level, will result in lower ROS compared with 2010. And as we look at our pension expense on a FAS/CAS basis, our asset returns thus far are favorable compared with our long-term assumption of 8.5% return, while the rates used to determine our discount rate have declined significantly throughout the year. In addition, we are now assuming that CAS harmonization will be effective in 2012 rather than in 2011. The combination of each of these items leads us to believe that the FAS/CAS drag on our EPS will grow considerably in 2011. 
With that, I think we're ready for your questions. Jevon, if you please open up the lines."

It may surprise some folks, but in all honesty, we don't buy a lot of the commodities, and the metals and so forth that we use to build our products. As it turns out, we tend to aggregate the demands for those products and commodities. And instead, we let a lot of suppliers use those aggregated demands to purchase those materials. And so what we've tended to do in the past is establish some fairly long-term purchase agreements that provide us stability in both the supply, as well as the pricing. But think of that ability to aggregate the overall supply amongst a lot of different suppliers in our base as bringing us the best prices. And I'll tell you, relative to the specifics you cited, I'm not aware of any issues with our ability to acquire or price fluctuation of that, that's out of the ordinary on what we're seeing today."

However, notionally, we've had discussions with the Department of Defense acquisition team as we've extended these conversations about affordability initiatives in thinking through the prospect of increasing material prices and the greater need for us to act like a strategic buyer. And that's why this notion of long-term contracts, long-term predictability, multi-year procurement have been advanced by I think the industry community broadly because that will allow us to get the best possible price that's really in any set of market conditions even if there were to be some upward price pressure. You also asked the question about capacity constraints here. We’ve planned our programs in a flexible way so that we're not experiencing any capacity shortfalls today at all. And on our major programs, take the C-130 as an example, we've been able to go from 16 to 26 to approximately 36 based on optimizing the investment that we've made. To date, we'd be able to do same thing on the Joint Strike Fighter. We think our Littoral Combat Ship offering has been thought through in a similar set of circumstances. So we've tried to balance our view about capacity in assuring that we have gated investments, we call them gated, or we want to get greater knowledge before we make entirely speculative investments about what the future horizon will look like. We try to build as much flexibility in the capacity that we have. We also have thought through the prospect of potentially building down. If there were more headwind, can we build down and still not lose the bubble on affordability or profitability and the F-16 line is probably a good historical example of the ability to scale up as global circumstances change and customers' recapitalization needs vary, and then to build down and then to build back up. So the lessons that we've learned there, we've tried to populate throughout the company."

I would characterize it as still enabling us to have the kind of margin expansion on the production program that I've been talking about in the past.

And I still think that's the case. I still think this contract enabled us to do that. We wouldn't have agreed to it if we didn't think we could execute to it. It's probably a little tighter in terms of the risk elements of it on the share line and the ceiling than I would have otherwise liked, but I think that puts a little bit of a premium on us to focus on our execution. But I think we're capable of doing that."

So there's additional discipline in the process, and that's not just on our side, it's on the government side. And notwithstanding Lot 4, but let me give you just a sense about this movement from cost-type to fixed-price-type contracts. There's less flexibility overall in a fixed-price-type contract, and that requires, let me say, some behavioral change. And I'll make up an overly simplified illustration. It doesn't really have much to do with Lot 4, but in a cost reimbursable environment, if we agreed that we were going to meet every quarter, and the government would say, ""We'd rather meet monthly."" Our first response is where and when and what subject matter expert should we bring. Under a fixed-price contract, we will say, ""We are going to need to submit a change order to you to change the contract budget baseline to now include a provision for the cost of meeting monthly."" That's a behavioral difference. So I think we're all trying to go into this environment with our eyes open. As Bruce said, the wristband gets a little tighter on our side. The discipline, I think, gets cranked up on both sides. We lose a little flexibility but we think the advantages of taking on modestly more risk or diminishing flexibility will be born out by improved performance on the program. And that's what we're all focused on."

Last year, about this time, we provided you guidance not just for the year 2010 expectation, but we've tried to give a little longer-term view of what we're expecting to see. I think during that call, I talked about sales in 2011 as kind of being at the mid-single-digit level. We're now talking about more like the low-single-digit level and in the three -- the item that you mentioned from the press release, for the reasons for that diminished outlook, I'll give you a couple of examples maybe to highlight each of what we're talking about there. One on the delays, think of hurdles [indiscernible] like the Littoral Combat Ship, which we are assuming in our numbers in 2011 as a win when we talk about the growth rate we're seeing over 2010. But we had expected when we were talking last year for that award to have been sometime in the early summer of this year. We're now talking about a November award potentially. So think of that being almost six months of delay there. It doesn't change obviously the overall expectation of sales for the Littoral Combat Ship, but I guess it does change the phasing. So we're going to ship some of those sales to the right and push some of the early ramp rate in 2011 over into 2012. Same exact thing is happening with the FAD production lots. We'd expect to get those earlier in the year. Looks like they will be later in the year. And it's the same time kind of delayed ramp up in the higher FAD production that we're seeing there. On the cancellation side, the best example I think I can give to you there is we do have contracts for IS&GS called the FBI Sentinel project, which is really a case management study or case management program where we were doing development to enable a lot of greater capability of that system. And I think in large part due to budget pressures within the Federal budget, the decision was made to stop doing further production on that activity and instead essentially do with what you got and go more into an operations and maintenance phase going forward as opposed to a development phase. So not so much a cancellation as a scope reduction, in fact, reflecting, I think, the new reality we're talking about. And then on the adjacent market scenario, really, what we're talking about there is the energy market, and specifically, there it says the concentrated solar power market. When we talked to you last year at this time, we had in play a potential deal we're looking at providing for an Arizona power municipality that it turns out didn't happen for a number of reasons. But we also thought there were a number of smaller arrangements around the country that we're going to materialize. And as we sit here today, again, I think, frankly because of some of the fiscal pressures we're seeing and the tax revenues going down, I think we're seeing a delay in those particular types of projects. And Bob, do you want to add anything to that?"

Doug, I would tell you that obviously, we only speak for ourselves, but I'm going to guess we're not the only one seeing the phenomena that Bruce has described to you. Even as early as April of 2009, when Secretary Gates had a number of program decisions and announcements, some of which impacting our company, some of which impacted others, we began to communicate with you and others. Our sense is and the phrase we’ve used is  “this new reality” and a big part of that new reality was the fiscal challenges that our nation is facing and the need to adapt to some fiscal discipline. As a result, we're seeing I think some building of the pressure on that horizon. Bruce gave you some illustrations about delays and cancellations. As we watched the bills work their way through the Congress, I think there was a level of interest that drew our attention in the Senate Appropriations Committee Mark because they talked about a number of programs. I even think that, if I get the math right, I think the number is 41 programs. They may have described as being delayed in some fashion. The result of which was they're withholding some funding to see if those delays were going to be recovered or whether they were going to be persistent. So I think there's a broader observation of the process slowing down a little. And that's why among the affordability initiatives that Dr. Carter released, we are keenly interested in adding our full-throated voice in any experience we have in our energy and focusing on shortening this cycle time, not only because it will help remedy the discussion that Bruce just had with you now about the onset of revenue recognition, but we pulled [indiscernible] that all the way through to floor structure and military capability that can be fielded. And we don't want to see that process delayed either because the real value of the systems we work on, if you think of returns on their value, commences when they get fielded and put into operational service. So I think we have joined objectives and initiatives with the administration in getting this right. But our job here is to make sure that we're as clear and transparent and can give you the best of our professional judgment as we look out over a pretty complicated landscape and give you a feel that we have for the future. I'll also say, we've not hesitated in taking actions here that would be consistent with our appraisal of this future. Even as far back as 2009, we began consolidations where our program baselines were being changed. We've gone through some pretty painful reductions in force, and that's something we work hard to avoid, but we can't avoid the reality of sizing the workforce to the volume of work that we have to accomplish with the government. We've elected some divestitures here that we've described to you fully to help us focus and really meet new sets of expectations into the markets that we serve, but also to help us get greater operational focus. We talked about the voluntary separation program. We've been scrubbing our expense budgets and our capital budgets, and really focusing on generating operational cash, which we think is a very important focus area. As we adapt to the new reality, which we are committed to adapting to in running this business well, we think it's very sound judgment in our part to focus on cash so that we can certainly weather any financial challenges we have, but also very much prepare for what we believe will be a re-establishment of a growth trajectory for the business in the future as we go through these early rounds of budget examination to see what new baselines will look like. I like the priorities our programs enjoy. I like the support that we've had in the President's budget with the administration. I like the support that we've had in Congress overall. As a statement about the portfolio, I think we align well with military and intelligence community needs, In some markets, we'll probably accelerate. In some, we'll have a little pressure, and we'll do our best to have sound judgment here as we allocate resources. Do not over-invest in emerging or adjacent market area so that we have then difficulties in returning value on those investments and we'll stay very focused and we'll do our best to keep you advised in advance of our experiencing these challenges."

You asked about pension, dividend, share repos and the actions we took in the quarter and what that means for the future. Maybe I'll start off with pensions just to begin with because that's such a big moving piece of the whole discussion. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are now assuming that the cash harmonization is effective in 2012 versus 2011, that actually has the effect of lowering the CAS number in 2011 from what we expected, that's one of the contributors to the additional FAS/CAS gap relative to EPS that I talked about earlier. Now discount rates are significantly lower. I don't think it's a great surprise to anyone. They're lower now, than they were at the end of the last year. And we still need to see how much change we're going to see between now and the year end. Relative to the $2.2 billion, we'd like to give a little bit of a tutorial relative to the ERISA funding requirements of our pension plans. The ERISA, which obviously is the law that governs our pension plans in general, basically treats the discount rate different than either our FAS valuation or our CAS in that the discount rate for ERISA is for all intents and purposes kind of set now going into next year. So think of it as a 24-month moving average. So we kind of know what that is now. And with the contributions to get us to the $2.2 billion and where we expect our asset returns to be by the end of the year, we think that this additional contribution amount will get us to the 80% funded level at the start of 2011 relative to an ERISA measurement perspective, which gets us in line with the expectations of the PPA, the Pension Protection Act, that becomes effective for us in 2011. And in that scenario, unless there are future changes beyond in 2011 in the form of lower discount rates or obviously lower asset returns, we would not expect to have to make additional discretionary contributions into the fund as we've done for the last few years. In essence, the baseline ERISA requirements for contributions will be what it takes to keep the fund funded, not just at the 80%, to actually grow that number over time. So a lot of what we've talked about recently in terms of discretionary contributions we would not expect to have to make anywhere near that level going forward. On the dividend, we took a look at where we sat from a dividend perspective and our growth prospects, and we just felt that, and I should say we talked to an awful lot of investors as well, who felt that in today's environment, a strong cash generating company with a strong dividend yield was looked upon favorably. And so we did that consciously under that assumption. And on the share repurchases, we probably were a little bit lighter in the quarter here this year. We still expect to continue, although if you compared the first three quarters of last year, actually we're up compared to where we were last year. I think some of that was just the phasing that we did in the first half of the year. I don't see that changing, Joe, as we go forward because we still -- the 50% of free cash flow going forward that we've done for quite some time is still our plan. And I think your last question concerned the EIG net receipt that we expect to get from that. And we would expect to net out about $0.5 billion. Think of it relative to EIG sale. And we would continue to use them, and I'll just characterize it as our general purpose use of cash for all the sorts of three things that we talked about earlier."

The magic is enlightenment, and that's not just from our point of view, that's the government's point of view. So as a matter of professional discipline on our part, we're going to continue to advance discussions and say, if we want to undertake a different kind of contracting architecture here, let's also undertake all the responsibilities that are necessary to align the conditions that make that contracting methodology successful for you, the government and us, the industry. And so far, I believe we've been able to do that. And I tried to highlight a little of the Lot 4 F-35. There will be some behavioral changes and there will be some discipline, and there will be some reduction in flexibility. We won't jigger around the configuration. We'll have a tighter bandwidth on performance all around. And I believe the government is up for that, and we are certainly up for that, and we know how to do this. The breadth and depth of our portfolio has been such that we've got lots of experience across the company. And what we're working on now is to make sure that we're populating that experience across the company, so that perhaps if there are organizations who in the recent past have not had familiarity with fixed-price incentive-type contracts, they're becoming a lot smarter about fixed-priced contracting environments today, as we think our government customers would want us to be so that we don't fail to meet the execution, responsibilities and commitments that we make. So I mean, it is a concerted focus here. We're not overly concerned about it. We believe we have to find financial returns and generate value there, as we have to deliver commitments under contracts to government customers."

That's the only reason I don't want to offer it at this time. But I will tell you, as we look at the transition from the SDD program into production, if we look at the movement of cost, if we look at the likely returns and the cost reimbursable environment through the transition to production and the transition to fixed-price contracting, I'd tell you this is in line with historic standards. Save for maybe two observations that we did share with you and others, a 50-50 share line in Lot 4 is a little more aggressive and 120% ceiling is a little tighter. But then, we believed we had a constructive and valuable discussion about the content of the program, the configuration of the aircraft, what's expected to be delivered, and those are the areas that tend to put pressure on cost. When you don't have as thorough an understanding about content or what is exactly deliverable, we’ve tried to take that on earlier with full cooperation from our customer because our customer wanted us to step up and embrace some of this fixed-price incentive contract modeling. So it isn't, again, that we say no, we can't do that. Our view quite honestly is we can do a lot of things provided that conditions are consistent to warrant the contracting methodology and the architecture in the contract."

First off, if I go back to my early days, when I was starting my career in Fort Worth working the F-16 program, every single F-16 contract in production was an FPI contract. So we've had this experience now for, in my case, almost 30 years. And as I look at the F-35 in particular, not to directly answer your question relative to target price and margin and so forth, but I found one of the interesting thing as I looked at it is if you take a look at the cost, the target cost, on the LRIP 1 aircraft, so was for two aircraft buy, and compare that with a target cost of LRIP 4, the cost of the LRIP 4 aircrafts are about half as much as the cost of the LRIP I aircraft. So think of that in 31 aircraft down the production line, we've lowered the cost on those aircraft by half. And the other aspect that I looked at from a risk perspective that Bob described as far as working this contract is, I very much view the LRIP 4 contract as the risk we're taking on has continued, I'll say performance down the learning curve, I think we have a good understanding between ourselves and the government relative to concurrency risks with new findings in the STD contracted, the development contract, such that, that will not sort of bleed over onto the LRIP 4 contract. And it's because of that, that I ultimately felt comfortable getting the agreement for the contract with the terms that we have."

Actually, I think we probably know about as much of the U.K. decision on F-35 as you do. You have to sort of filter out the things that are being described and discussed as the process is unfolding from the actual results of the process. It's a very comprehensive review that's been undertaken in the United Kingdom. It's very broad. It's very deep. It's very forward looking. I don't even think the exact numbers of airplanes to be procured have been determined, as I'm sure, which is typical of all national security planners that we deal with in our international and domestic community. We try to work through concepts of operations, likely future scenarios, how much equipment we'll need to be capable on what date to accomplish what tasks. So I believe we are watching the results flow out of the U.K. sort of in process. Where some determinations have been made, I think the judgment to move away from STOVL to the carrier variant, and I'm going to make some guesses here, Peter, but that decision might be made to enhance interoperability, to enable potentially U.S. aircraft to land on U.K. aircraft carriers or French aircraft or vice versa. So I think the experience we’ve had and the judgments are made on capability, total expense, lifecycle costs, interoperability, flexibility and that's what we're seeing in the U.K. And we'll have to see what ultimate judgments are made about airplanes. Let's just stick with the F-35 for a while. We've long-expected that there would be substantial movement over time in the total estimated volumes of airplanes to being procured, whether they're U.S. airplanes for the Air Force, the Navy or the Marine Corps or whether they're for our international partners. The model we've offered before, the one that we think is the most relevant to the situation we face today on the F-35 is the F-16 started it a little more than 900 airplanes grew into 4,400 airplanes in 26 countries. We're still seeing follow-on orders from those countries to backfill, support, extend their fleet. I very much believe that will be the case for the F-35. And I know governments now are facing tough economic conditions, but they're also facing very tough security environments. I do believe this airplane has already demonstrated the fundamental capabilities that caused individuals to recognize it's enormous value. So I'd rather suspect we'll see it in the case of the U.K., reduction in the quantity, but we'll also see cases like Israel who was not an investing partner in the core program who's come forward in the queue. They've talked about 75 airplanes in total. They'd like to get the first tranche [sp?] like 18 to 20 or whatever that number will be sooner. I believe other governments and countries in the Middle East, in the Asia Pacific theater, are also recognizing very significant security challenges. I think some of those countries are feeling less pressured in their fiscal environments. They might have more resources and may look at the current circumstances with regard to the U.K. or maybe other countries who are lessening the buy or delaying the buy, it's an opportunity to get in the queue and to buy airplanes. Our focus here has to be on execution, and we're not going to allow ourselves to be distracted. We are certainly not overly concerned or hyperventilating. I expect there will be some ebb and flow in quantities and timing and even aircraft types. But we've got a very capable program foundation here. We talk a lot about the STOVL because it deserves to have the conversations since it's 40 flights behind its schedule and we're having some component failures. The time we spend there caused us to talk less about the CTOL and the CV version that are really flying very well. And I assure you that the United States Navy and the United States Air Force are very excited about the prospects of performance of this program and recognize the contribution we can make by delivering this capability as do our international partners. So I'll tell you again, get a seat with a seat belt on it because this is not the first discussion we're going to have with international partners about quantities or aircraft types or timing. There will be more. Our goal is to stay close to those customers, support them in every possible way we can, give them very realistic appraisals about our performance and what they should expect, not just on cost and pricing and availability, but aircraft capability. Extending this discussion beyond the F-35, when we look at the international marketplace, we still see growth opportunities for our business. Our portfolio is well populated with the kinds of capabilities that governments place a high priority on like missile defense. And I know we can't get talk definitively about the Littoral Combat Ship, but I really believe deeply in that mission and deeply in the concept of a ship of this class in the Littorals. And I'm confident other international governments do as well. So there would be international opportunities there for the C-130. We believe there’s strong interest. We're not done delivering F-16s yet and have significant campaigns under way that support the evolution of F-35 quantities. So our sense is we are living in a world that has a lot of security challenges notwithstanding the economic pressures. What's really going to matter is do you have a mature portfolio? Have you demonstrated that the systems that you're working on actually work when they're placed in the service they do? And can you deliver according to the commitments that are under the contract? And those are the fundamental details we focus on without allowing ourselves to be distracted. So I don't see a dramatic diminution or change in the expectations for international growth. We're committed to staying on that pattern. We'll redouble some efforts in our international support community. We’ll flow resources, talented people, executive presence there and then we'll work with the U.S. government here as we develop the budget for 2012, figure out what will happen through the continuing resolution and the potential lame-duck session for the 2011 funding and keep you advised."

What happened was what I expected. So I won't comment more about that. I just find it interesting. So more than 70% of those who have accepted the voluntary executive separation program are retirement eligible, which means they could walk out the door today. And I'll be very candid in my selection of language with you. It isn't as though the actions that we've taken or that I've authorized here have taken us off a cliff. These folks were going to leave in the next couple of years anyway. And the question in our mind was how do you want to orchestrate the environment in which seasoned senior folks are going to leave. And we elected to take ourselves to a position rather than allow circumstances to envelop us and take us in a place that we had not planned for or couldn't adequately predict what the outcome would be. So years ago, we began planning through a series of executive rotations, perhaps you're familiar with the phrase Full Spectrum Leadership. The investment in the Center For Leadership Excellence here to begin to populate a set of experienced rotational assignments and broadening experiences in this company, a cadre of talent that was not retirement-eligible today, recognizing we've got a demographic shift not just in our company in our industry but throughout our government, where the baby boomers are going to go to retirement, and they're going to go no matter what you and I do. So the best program was part of a much broader articulated strategy of how to transition through generational change in our company without losing the bubble on execution or programs so we began to link executives through mentoring programs and through experiential relationships so that we would grow the population underneath the senior leaders who are about to depart. And you added an important component here. The phasing of executive responsibility. So let's do some math. 600 or so people will leave between now and February. Our sense was that they would be leaving in the relatively near term anyway. We've begun early phasing, in a variety of ways, where it makes sense to do that. We won't backfill the entire complement of 600 executives because a principal goal for us is to get leaner, more streamlined to right-size this business, but we will backfill while we consolidate and realign our organizational focus. We think that makes us stronger, not weaker. And we'll have people who will be placed into these realigned executive responsibilities who have had experience who do have contact with those who will be departing and in some cases, under the direct tutelage of those who will be leaving. And I will say this about the professional workforce that we have, including our retirees today and are soon-to-become retirees who are in the VEST program. They care deeply about the mission. They care deeply about this company and there is not one who would fail to help a colleague even after they were to depart in February. So I think we're very well aligned to face the reality that we're all facing. And others I guess will go about this in an approach that they think makes sense. This approach in our judgment was exactly the way we ought to navigate in this new reality knowing we're going to face the challenges that we're facing. So I think we're very well positioned here. I don't expect a single blip on a program. I don't expect any difficulty. We have plenty of phasing in time, which we are doing now, and we'll continue to stay very focused on this. It's not just going to be through February, but when new people go to new assignments at any time under any set of conditions, we try to give them more, rather than less, help to make sure we're all getting grounded and our expectations are clear and communications are crisp. We are prepared to do that and have means and mechanisms in place now to help facilitate that. So I'm pleased you asked the question because I think we haven't talked a lot about beyond the numbers, what do you expect in an operating environment from the company as you move forward, and your question gave us an opportunity to highlight that a bit."

First, and I hope we conveyed this clarity when we talked to you about EIG and PAE. We do routinely look at every aspect of this business strategically, operationally and financially, relative to its short-term, intermediate-term and long-term fit with regard to delivering value to customers and value to shareholders, while we create a vibrant environment here for our employees. If we trigger a threshold in any one of those domains, as with the case with EIG on the organizational conflict of interest or PAE where growth opportunities were progressively misaligned with our core strategy, we won't hesitate. I will also tell you we are not pleased with the trading multiple of our stock and damn well believe we can do better. So in the short horizon, I don't think we're going to be looking at wholesale divestitures here before we look at operating the businesses better, navigating through some near-term turbulence, recognizing the quality and strength of our portfolio and our ability to execute going forward because we have the leadership and the professional capability to do a better job, and that's got our focus. It won't cause us to fail to look at the quality of our portfolio on a recurring basis. But I don't think you should expect from us wholesale divestitures because in a moment in time, there is a little more pressure here than any of us would like. Our job is to go execute better and relieve some of that pressure. George, I thank you for the question. Let me thank you, Jevon, for your help on the call today, and thank everybody who joined us. We're going to focus as I said on execution and on streamlining and on becoming more efficient as we learn more about our budget priorities and program priorities here on the domestic business front and in the international community. And we'll be able to share a more complete set of observations with you in January when we're next on the line together. So thanks again for being with us today."
