Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that BMC Software delivered a very strong third fiscal quarter. Our financial performance was solid, with a third consecutive quarter of double-digit growt",2205,"Thanks, Derrick. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to report that BMC Software delivered a very strong third fiscal quarter. Our financial performance was solid, with a third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in non-GAAP EPS. Our business and operating performance was also very strong with robust growth in bookings and continued expense discipline. And we enhanced our technology leadership, launching new solutions that position us more stronger than ever to capture the growth potential from virtualization and cloud computing and the emergence of the hybrid data center. As a result of our performance, we are clearly on track to achieve or exceed our key business and financial goals for fiscal 2010 and to deliver results well-above those or virtually all other enterprise software companies. Let's look more closely at our year-over-year performance against some key metrics in the third quarter. Total bookings rose 18% to $539 million. This reflects our strong value proposition, competitive positioning and a favorable MSM [Mainframe Service Management] renewal cycle. ESM [Enterprise Service Management] license bookings increased 15% and 39%, sequentially. MSM total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis increased 8%. Total revenue was $508 million, up 4%. License revenue was $216 million, up 12%. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.76, up 19%.  And GAAP EPS was $0.59, up 34%. Cash flow from operations was $83 million, in line with our expectations. And our balance sheet remains strong with approximately $1.3 billion in cash and investments and $1.7 billion in deferred revenue.  Also during the quarter, BMC was added to the closely followed NASDAQ 100 Index. The NASDAQ 100 is the globally recognized proxy for growth technology stocks. So that's a snapshot of the quarter. Let's turn now to our two business units, Enterprise Service Management and Mainframe Service Management, beginning with ESM.  As I mentioned, total ESM license bookings were up 15% compared to the year-ago period. Over the past few years, we've consistently demonstrated the ability to win large platform-oriented BSM [Business Service Management] deals, and this quarter was no different. As we closed 27 transactions with over $1 million in license bookings, 17 of those transactions and eight of the top ten transactions included multiple product disciplines. It's also worth noting that the number of transactions in the quarter between 500,000 and 1 million grew by over 50% compared to a year ago. This highlights the fact that we are seeing increasingly better broad-based performance across our sales force and that we do not have to rely on large deals to grow the ESM business. These results give us further confidence about our ability to execute and grow our ESM business into the future.Regarding our sales force, on previous conference calls, we've discussed our effort to invest in and strengthen our ESM sales force. These efforts are clearly working and we're encouraged by the progress we've made to date. Since March of 2009, we saw an increase in the total number of sales reps, the total number of tenured sales reps and the productivity of our tenured sales reps. While we will continue to work diligently to develop and enhance the sales organization, what this implies is that the hard work of transforming our sales force is mostly behind us and that we now have a strong foundation to aggressively grow our sales organization and expand our reach.We believe that the combination of our industry-leading product portfolio with an industry-leading sales organization provides BMC with a competitive advantage for the long term. Because of this combination, we continue to see some of the most sophisticated and demanding customers choosing BMC over the competition. Let me give you a few examples. New York Life, Fortune 100 company and a leading provider of life insurance relies heavily on remedy to run IT areas for their business and they recently implemented BMC's ProactiveNet and BMCs Performance Manager. This customer chose to standardize on our entire BSM platform to maximize customer satisfaction, ensure compliance and optimize availability.GEICO, provider of automobile, life and home insurance, believe that their infrastructure at opportunities for improvement to automate manual processes, remove inefficiencies and reduce time-consuming task. After seeing the success that others have had with automation, they took a proactive approach to seeking automation opportunities from BMC. As a low-cost insurance provider, GEICO selected BMC's cohesive, integrated BSM platform to reduce their operating cost so that they can offer lower insurance premiums to their customers.Cargill, an international provider of agricultural, financial and industrial products and services, is in the early stages of a multi-billion dollar business transformation initiative. Cargill sought our integrated IT management platform to optimize availability, ensure performance and reduce the cost of managing this new environment.AEGON Money Services, part of AEGON, the international life insurance pension and investment company, chose BMC because of the relationship they've built with us over the years and the ability to leverage their current and future investments globally. AEGON Money Services also saw the ability to reduce their overall cost by acquiring BMC solutions such as Service Assurance and BladeLogic and displacing other such as IBM.During the third quarter, we also made several important investments in our ESM product portfolio. In October of 2009, we announced the acquisition of Tideway Systems, enhancing our BSM platform by adding the industry's leading application discovery and dependency mapping solution that automatically discovers, models and maintains the relationships between services, applications and infrastructure components even with ongoing infrastructure changes. This acquisition has made a quick impact.Most recently, we acquired privately held Phurnace Software, a leading developer of application automation software. The application layer is the next frontier in automation and Phurnace provides the ability to automate the application deployment and configuration process for mission-critical job applications. While we are already the leader in automation, the combination of BMC's existing Service Automation product portfolio anchored by BladeLogic and Phurnace significantly widens what is our competitive advantage in this large and highly strategic market.The investments we're making through both organic means as well as M&A underscores our commitment to lead the market with the industry's best management solutions as well as positioned BMC as the unquestioned leader in BSM.We also continue to build strategic alliances that broaden our coverage in the new market segments and increases our competitive environments. In the quarter, we announced our alliance with salesforce.com, the enterprise cloud computing company, to enable the delivery of BMC's Service Desk Express solution on f0rce.com platform. The initial joint offering, which will be available in the next fiscal quarter, addresses the overwhelming customer demand for critical service desk and helpdesk functionality delivered via the Cloud. I'll come back to this later when I discuss recent technology trends.Turning now to our MSM business, in the third quarter, MSM's non-GAAP operating income was up 11% over the year-ago period. We also continue to see solid MSM bookings performance. Total MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis increased 8%. As you already know, our Mainframe business is a lumpy business. As bookings for our MSM business are tied largely to the timing and size of renewals, MSM bookings can vary from quarter to quarter. However, a strong renewal cycle and our continued marketing efforts drove our solid performance.During the quarter, we continued to increase the MSM install base by adding 28 new customers, the majority of which were from our enterprise workload automation product line. One of these new customers was Embratel, a major Brazilian communications company. We also saw existing customers renew and increase their relationship with us and add new products. Some of these major MSM wins include Banco Bradesco, Cargill, Centers for Medicaid/Medicare, IBM Argentina and Infocrossing. In fact, we once again grew the annual run rate of our top 15 MSM transactions. This is the 11th consecutive quarter where we have seen an increase in the run rate of our largest transactions. Our customers depend on BMC for the latest in mainframe innovations. During the quarter, we enhance some of our most compelling product lines. In December, we released our new complete solution support for IBM, IMS version 11. And earlier this month, enterprise management associates named BMC's Control-M the strongest product in their Workload Automation Radar Report. Looking forward, we expect to see continued strength in MSM renewals as we move into the fourth quarter and the first half of fiscal 2011. We also expect to see continued strong performance in our new business sales initiatives across the entire MSM portfolio.That gives you a look at the third quarter, which was a very strong quarter on a number of fronts. We're determined to maintain and accelerate this momentum, that's why we're continuing to invest internally and externally to enhance our leadership. We're investing in those areas that offer the most value for our customers and the most potential for growth at BMC. This includes cloud computing, virtualization and software as a service.Clearly, the acceleration of virtualization, cloud computing and SAS makes the need for IT management even greater. This is especially true given the extraordinary opportunities we see ahead for a unified system to manage the hybrid data center. It's most likely that customers will combine traditional legacy systems with one more or all of these new technology trends in order to address their current and future business needs. We see a big opportunity here to effectively manage across the hybrid environments. So let me tell you how BMC is prepared for these new technology trends. As you may recall during our conference calls last October, we briefly discussed our next big step forward to meet the demand with the launch of Dynamic BSM, the future of enterprise IT management. Dynamic BSM is the next evolution of BMC's management architecture where the goal is to not only to address that the traditional requirements of IT management but also to support the on-demand provisioning and management of services that leverage these new computing platforms in today's hybrid data center. With Dynamic BSM, our customers will be able to dynamically align the IT supply-chain with business demand in real time and optimize resources through tiered classes of services and policy-based automation.During the past quarter, our new product enhancements, strategic partnerships and relationships with our customers have advanced BMC's BSM platform leadership to help customers prepare for the next wave of IT management needs. Last quarter, we shipped our first release of our next generation assurance solutions, designed to manage the hybrid data center where we provide customers the ability to more easily identify, detect and predict problems while dramatically simplifying the installation and ease of use of our products. We're also using these technologies to broaden how we deliver our enterprise-class solutions to customers.Enterprises today want options and how they deploy technology solutions, ranging from on-premise through managed services or using software as a service. We have the market-leading on-premise solutions today and are widely regarded as the de facto standard for managed services. Our market share among to global outsourcers and systems integrators make this clear.Now we've launched new offerings that will quickly establish BMC as the leader in management as a service. As I mentioned earlier, BMC and salesforce.com formed an alliance during the quarter to deliver BMC's Service Desk Express on force.com. This strategic partnership combines the expertise and experience of the number one service desk provider with the number one platform for cloud based services. This will deliver a breakthrough approach to help IT organizations of all sizes overcome budget and resource constraints to achieve the capabilities that enterprise customers have enjoyed for so many years.In addition, just last week, BMC announced BMC Remedy ITSM on demand, which provides customers with a market that meeting IT service management suite delivered on a SAS model. Our offerings will be enterprise-class publication available via SAS, allowing sophisticated customers to select a SAS-based ITSM solution without making any compromises on functionality and scalability.The popularity of the SAS delivery model is accelerating in enterprise IT organizations. IDC expects the systems management software as a service market will top $1 billion by 2013. BMC Remedy ITSM Suite On Demand and BMC Service Desk Express on force.com will enable BMC to quickly become the leader in this market and will offer and important option for enterprises, mid-tier customers and SMB customers. As you can see, the third quarter was a positive, eventful period for BMC. As we look out over the remainder of fiscal 2010 and into fiscal 2011, we know that we're well-positioned. We're beginning to see signs of improvement in the global economic environment. Key technology trends are driving increasing demand for IT management platforms that are vendor-neutral and can scale across heterogeneous IT systems. We have the experience in the technology solutions to meet that demand. We're continuing to invest across the company to strengthen our portfolio and increase our sales footprint and capabilities. And we have the management discipline to ensure an appropriate return on those investments.Based on our performance year-to-date, and our current forecast, we are on track to meet or exceed our guidance for fiscal 2010. I'll talk more about our current outlook for fiscal 2010 later in this call. But first, here's Steve Solcher, who will provide more insight into our financial results."

We achieved solid results across all of our key financial metrics including total bookings, ESM license bookings, revenue, operating margin and EPS. This strong performan",1466,"Thank you, Bob. BMCs financial performance was very strong during the third quarter. We achieved solid results across all of our key financial metrics including total bookings, ESM license bookings, revenue, operating margin and EPS. This strong performance was balanced in both our ESM and MSM businesses and across our two major geographies, North America and Europe.With that, let me start off by reviewing our financial results for the third quarter in more detail. In the third quarter, non-GAAP operating income increased by 4% from $183 million to $191 million. Non-GAAP operating margin was 38%, flat with the year-ago quarter and up 1% on a constant currency basis.Please refer to Slide 5 in our conference call presentation material for our non-GAAP income statement, which includes segment profitability of our ESM and MSM business units. ESM's non-GAAP operating income was $77 million, down from $81 million in the year-ago period. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin was 25% compared to 26% in the third quarter of fiscal 2009.ESM's non-GAAP operating margin was impacted by 9 point year-over-year increase in the ESM ratable rate. Our MSM business unit's non-GAAP operating income was $114 million for the quarter compared to $103 million in the year-ago period. MSM's non-GAAP operating margin was 57% compared to 56% a year ago. Non-GAAP net earnings for the third quarter were $142 million, an increase of 17% from $121 million in the third quarter a year ago.Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.76, up 19% from $0.64 in the year-ago period. This reflects the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 25%. These non-GAAP results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the third quarter of $187 million versus $188 million in the year-ago period.GAAP operating income in the third quarter was $148 million compared with $139 million in the year-ago quarter. GAAP net earnings and fully diluted EPS were $111 million $0.59, respectively, compared with $84 million and $0.44, respectively, in the third quarter of fiscal 2009.Turning now to bookings. Bookings in the quarter were very strong. Total bookings of $539 million were up 18% from the year-ago period. On a constant currency basis, total bookings increased 14%. In the third quarter, total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were $1.9 billion, flat with the year-ago period. On a constant currency basis, total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis increased 3%.The weighted average contract length for a total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.17 years, up 6% from 2.04 years in the year-ago period. The increase in the weighted average contract length is directly correlated to MSM's entry into its strong renewal period. After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the third quarter were $875 million, down 6% from the year ago period. On a constant currency basis, trailing 12-month annualized big bookings were down 4%. Please refer to Slide 7 in our presentation. Now let me turn to the performance of each of our business units. For our ESM business unit, license bookings remain the best measure of performance. Total ESM license bookings were $152 million in the third quarter, an increase of 15% compared to the year ago period and up 39% sequentially. This strong performance reflects a significant turnaround compared to the first half of fiscal 2000. In addition to the strong growth in the ESM license bookings, we saw many positive trends in our ESM business. These include an increase in the average transaction size, growth in the number of transactions over $1 million. An over 50% increase in the number of transactions between 500,000 and million dollars, strong platform wins with multiple product lines and an increase in sales productivity and headcount.From a geographic perspective, I'm pleased to highlight the strong ESM license bookings performance in the U.S. I'm also pleased with our performance in EMEA during the quarter. We have delivered strong growth in this region through the first three quarters of fiscal 2010.Turning now to our MSM unit, we believe the MSM business unit is best evaluated on the basis of total and annualized bookings over the trailing 12 months. In the third quarter, total MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis increased 8% to $804 million, with an average contract length of 3.06 years. On a constant currency basis, total MSM bookings for the trailing 12-months increased 10%.  After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months $263 million, down 2% from $268 million in fiscal 2009. On a constant currency basis, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were flat to the year-ago period. As we've often said, our Mainframe business is a lumpy business, in which total bookings can vary quarter-to-quarter. We remain pleased with a solid performance in trends we've seen in our MSM business during the third quarter as we've entered a period of strong renewal activity.Turning to revenue, total revenue for the quarter was $508 million, up 4% from the third quarter of fiscal 2009. On a constant currency basis, total revenue was up 2%. License revenue in the third quarter was $216 million, up 12% from $193 million in the year ago period. On a constant currency basis, license revenue was up 9%. ESM license revenue was $137 million, up 8% from the year-ago period. The MSM license revenue was $80 million, up 20%. During the quarter, the percentage of license bookings that was deferred was 55%, in line with our expectations and higher than the 49% in the year ago period. The higher ratable rate was driven by the continuing trend toward larger, more complex transactions. Maintenance revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 was $260 million, up 2% from the year-ago period and up $3 million sequentially. On a constant currency basis, maintenance revenue grew 1%.ESM maintenance revenue was $141 million, up 1%. And MSM maintenance revenue was $120 million, up 3% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2009. Professional services revenue, which is included in our ESM segment was $32 million in the third quarter, a decrease of 20% compared to the year-ago period. Moving next to operating expenses. We remain pleased with our ability to control costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $317 million, up 4% from $305 million in the year ago period. The increase was driven by the adverse impact of foreign currency and the additional expenses related to three small acquisitions we completed this fiscal year, on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP operating expenses were up 1%. We do expect fourth quarter expenses to be up sequentially, which is consistent with our normal seasonality. Looking at our business units. The MSM non-GAAP operating expenses were $85 million, up 6% from the year-ago quarter. ESM non-GAAP operating expenses were $232 million, up 3% from the year-ago quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the third quarter was $588 million, up $32 million or 6% sequentially. During the quarter, we deferred $137 million of license revenue and recognized $105 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. Total deferred revenue was $1.7 billion, up 2% sequentially.Software development costs on the balance sheet were $144 million, up 6% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2010 as we capitalized $24 million and amortized $16 million during the quarter. The level of capitalized software development costs is rated to the continued development activity for ESM product releases made during the third quarter. Cash and investments at December 31 was $1.3 billion, roughly flat with the previous quarter. Our net cash position was $929 million. For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $83 million, down from a tough comparer of $155 million in the year-ago period. Our cash flow from operations through the first three quarters is in line with what we expected, and we are on track to achieve our annual cash flow from operations guidance. Driven by strong third quarter bookings, DSOs increased to 60 days, up eight days from the September quarter.During the quarter, we remain committed to share repurchases. We repurchased approximately 2 million shares for a total of $75 million. As of December 31, the remaining amount authorized in our share repurchase program is $145 million.So let me briefly sum up. During the quarter, we significantly grew our bottom line while showing strength in bookings across both of our businesses with solid performance across our two major geographies. Our ESM business delivered strong growth in licensed bookings, benefiting from an improved sales productivity. Our MSM business capitalized on customer renewal opportunities, further penetrated our installed base and won new business. Our third-quarter results position us well to achieve our fiscal 2010 financial goals across all key measures. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his concluding remarks."

The assumptions underlying this full year fiscal 2010 estimate include total bookings and revenue growth in the low single digits. At today's rates, we expect currency impacts to have a slightly positive impact on bookings.A license bookings ratable rate in the low 50s versus 50% in fiscal 2009 and a non-GAAP tax rate of 27%. We expect full year 2010 cash flow from operations to be between $600 million and $650 million, unchanged from our prior expectation. As we look out over the remainder of 2010 and into fiscal 2011, we are beginning to see signs of improvement in the economy and IT spending.We also believe that the macro-environment for managing IT will be positively influenced by key technology trends such as virtualization, cloud computing and software as a service, where we are well positioned to capitalize.

So actually, I think that bodes well for potentially earlier renewal cycles next time. And also potentially higher renewal cycles next time as they are buying basically just enough at this point. I think that probably softened, actually a little bit of what we had originally see a year ago thought was going to happen at this point in the cycle. We delivered some really strong results on mainframe. But it will probably elongate this positive period of the cycle.

We've got quite a few customer wins now behind us where revenues coming in from the relationship. We're working jointly on large engagements with them. Our teams are working particularly on some large transactions very, very close. I was in the briefing myself just two days ago with a very large service provider and in the room, we're a representative of Cisco who's in here, in Houston doing presentations with us. We've got a lot going on in Europe with them. And all indications from Cisco is that they're very satisfied with this partnership and how it's progressing. To come out from a different angle, I think the Oracle announcement with Sun, that being completed, combined with what you see from Cisco, what you see from HP. Building it's own full stack, IBM is on full stack, EMC doing something -- it looks something like trying to build a stack. All bodes very well for BMC because we essentially become the abstraction layer for these silos that are being built, that allows the customer to not have to locked in and commit to a single vendor. I haven't met any customers who are excited about locking into a single vendor for their entire stack. And it's quite the contrary. In fact, just yesterday, I had lunch with one of the largest, I'll call it exchanges in the world that does a huge amounts of transaction volume. And in that meeting, they specifically said, their CIO told me that they intend to have multiple virtual machine from multiple VM providers, rather than standardize on VMWare, or Microsoft, or et cetera. That they want to do intentionally, maintain heterogeneity. So I think it's these larger companies attempt to build a proprietary still pipes. The demand for single company that can manage all of it and basically, commoditize a large portion of their stacks just raises the value proposition and necessity for somebody like BMC."

By the way, Accenture will be doing the implementation in that customers environment for us. It was really, almost a year-long evaluation, very competitive and our acquisition of Tideway played a role in that as Discovery was a really a key part of it. And so across that company, it was really -- they didn't look at it as individual products, they we're looking at it as standardizing on a vendor, but they did take the time to go in and evaluate each of those products on each individual merit to make their summary decision and we won that business. Similarly at top five largest private company, very similar sort of story where they came in with and evaluated, in their case, a massive SAP implementation. And they needed to ensure that they could manage this SAP environment and they standardized on BMC's. So in a sense, the all in sales model that we have had now for over a year is beginning to make the products move more together. And so, you'll see kind of the move up and down somewhat together.

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's call. The fourth quarter marked the end of another solid year business and financial performance for BMC Software. During fiscal 2010, we performed well against our key metrics,",1847,"Thank you, Derrick. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's call. The fourth quarter marked the end of another solid year business and financial performance for BMC Software. 
During fiscal 2010, we performed well against our key metrics, operating cash flow, total bookings, revenue, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted EPS. Cash flow from operations increased 10% to $635 million. Total bookings for the year grew 4%. Total revenue for the year was $1.91 billion, up 2%. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2010 increased two percentage points year-over-year to 35%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 17% to $2.66 per share, while GAAP diluted EPS increased 74% to $2.17 per share. And our balance sheet remains strong with $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $1.8 billion in deferred revenue. So again, another very good year for BMC with momentum building in the second half, and we expect fiscal 2011 to be even better.
Let's turn now to look specifically at the fourth quarter. We generated strong bookings and strong cash flow from operations. Total bookings for the quarter were $587 million, up 9% year-over-year. And cash flow from operations was $304 million, an increase of 53% year-over-year. While I'm pleased with these results, our revenue and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter were at the low end of our expectations. We had a significant ESM transaction close minutes after the end of the quarter cutoff. This materially impacted fourth quarter results by roughly $15 million to license bookings and upfront license revenue. We believe that this delayed transaction is an anomaly and not the result of our historical sales processes and practices. With the timing of this transaction, as well as several other large GSM transactions that we closed in early April, we're off to a very strong start in fiscal 2011. 
While I will discuss specific guidance later in the call, our overall outlook is quite positive. The size of the pipeline in both our ESM and MSM businesses looks robust, the demand environment is improving and our competitive position remains exceptionally strong. We're seeing acceleration in the trends that drive our business.
Let me turn next to discuss some key business and operational highlights during the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. During fiscal 2010, we further strengthen our market-leading position in IT Service Management. As you know, Remedy is a strategically important solution for us because of its broad market penetration, which we leveraged to generate strategic platform sales. Not surprisingly, it's an area that attracts a lot of attention and the sharpest competition. 
We believe that over the past 12 months, we added more customers and grew our installed base faster than any of our significant competitor. During this time period, we added a total of 263 new Remedy IT Service Management customers. And it's important to note that we achieved this even before launching our ITSM SaaS offerings. As you may recall, we recently announced two powerful Software-as-a-Service or SaaS offerings that enable us to leverage our leadership in IT service desk and to broaden our customer footprint through these new offerings. This SaaS initiatives include our new BMC Remedy OnDemand solution, which provides customers with our full industry-leading service management offering delivered as a service. 
We've also introduced ServiceDesk on Force.com offered through our partnership with salesforce.com, which is aimed at a market that is looking for a powerful service desk at a low price point. This solution addresses the growing customer demand for critical service desk and help desk functionality delivered via the cloud. These are both very important initiatives for BMC. And I'm pleased to report that during the quarter, the initial reaction in the marketplace has been positive. 
We are particularly encouraged that we had six wins for our SaaS offerings prior to their announced general availability. In addition to these SaaS transactions and the previously mentioned Remedy ITSM new on-premise customers, during the year, we also added nearly 100 new Remedy ITSM customers through managed service providers and global systems integrators. We think this initial demand bodes well for our ability to further penetrate the market with our SaaS offerings, on-premise offerings and managed service offerings and to further strengthen our ITSM market position. 
We are continuing to see strong performance in larger multi-product platform deals with our enterprise customers. During fiscal 2010, we had 80 ESM license transactions over $1 million, 52 of these were multiple product license transactions, which is up about 10% over the previous year, and it reflects the changes we're seeing in the composition of our transaction.
We are also encouraged to see strong growth in our mid-sized transactions. The number of ESM license transactions between $500,000 and $1 million increased year-over-year by 33%. In the fourth quarter, we had 22 ESM license transactions over $1 million. The majority of these were multiple product license deals. ESM major wins during the fourth quarter included Fujitsu, CGI, Coinstar, and TELUS. 
We also saw ASP's continue to grow. It's worth noting that the number of transaction in the quarter between $500,000 and $1 million grew by over 15% compared to a year ago period. 
Many of our ESM sales wins were driven by customers who are adopting our service automation offerings and our Atrium Configuration Management Database, or CMDB. The continued penetration of our Atrium CMDB into the enterprise customers bodes well for our ability to drive larger, more strategic platform wins. 
Our automation offerings including BladeLogic had a very strong quarter and are significant competitive advantage that we enjoy among IT management software vendors. For example, during the quarter, we had multiple competitive wins and replacements against HP Opsware for our service automation offerings. We're also seeing a positive impact from our efforts to strengthen our top-notch ESM sales organization.
At the conclusion of our fiscal year, the total number of sales reps and the total number of tenured sales reps were above where we were a year ago. At the same time, these tenured sales reps increased their productivity on a year-over-year basis. We pass the peak point in our hiring and are beginning to see the benefits of this expansion as the productivity of new reps we brought on board throughout fiscal 2010 increases. We expect the average number of tenured reps to increase over 20% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. 
Turning now to our MSM business. Strong demand across the MSM portfolio continued into the fourth quarter, demonstrated by the 10% increase in total MSM bookings for fiscal year 2010. This growth reflects the continued strength in the mainframe renewal cycle, growth from our new business sales efforts and our continuing commitment to operational excellence. It's important to remember that in addition to mainframe specific solutions, MSM offers enterprise-wide, platform-agnostic solutions which are not tied to the ebbs and flows of the mainframe hardware cycle. Representing nearly a third of MSM's revenue base, these solutions include our industry-leading enterprise workload automation and middleware management products. 
During the fiscal year 2010, we increased the MSM installed base by adding 101 new customers. In the quarter alone, we added 42 new customers and also saw 88 existing customers renew and increase their relationship with us by adding new products to their existing portfolio. Some of these major MSM wins include Banco Bradesco, Kookmin Bank, Sallie Mae and T-Systems. And we, once again, had a solid increase in the annual run rate of our top 15 MSM transactions, driven by significant competitive wins at key accounts. This is the 12th consecutive quarter where we have seen an increase in the run rate of our largest transactions. Looking forward, we now expect to see continued strength in MSM renewals throughout all of fiscal 2011 and into fiscal 2012.
Our confidence in the continued strength of MSM is a direct benefit of our improved visibility relating to the timing of renewals, our execution of new business, as well as the upcoming IBM mainframe release. So that's a snapshot of key business and operational developments during the quarter. Looking in our markets more broadly, we like what we see, and think fiscal 2011 will mark further progress and achievement as we work to solidify our position as the world's leading IT management software platform. 
According to recent industry reports, the need to improve IT management and make it more efficient has increased the demand for these technologies. A large industry leading analyst firms stated in one of its surveys that even though CIOs projected a slight budget increase in 2010 from 2009 historic budget cuts, the increase still leaves them with fewer resources in 2008. In addition, the survey stated that business priorities for IT call for greater productivity and continued cost efficiencies. The top CIO business priorities in 2010 include improving business processes, reducing enterprise costs and increasing the use of information and analytics.
This plays directly to our strength in IT management software. And it's one of the major reasons we expect to see continued growth in fiscal 2011. This growth will also be fueled by key technology trends, virtualization, cloud computing and Software as a Service, that only heightened the need for unified IT management. Amidst this change, we believe that an IT infrastructure agnostic software management company, such as BMC, will be very strongly positioned.  
We offer the most comprehensive approach and unified management platform for managing IT. BMC's portfolio of BSM solutions helps customers efficiently manage business services across its IT service life cycle of request, deliver, operate, plan and govern across mainframe, distributed, physical, virtual and cloud computing environments. The strong partnerships we built with industry leaders, Cisco, Dell, Accenture, and salesforce.com to name a few, underscores the strength of BMC's competitive advantages in the IT Management Software business. They also reflect the scope and scale of the market opportunities that lie ahead. 
During fiscal 2011, we will continue to make the investments necessary to maximize these opportunities. These investments include new technologies to address key trends in the marketplace, such as customer migration to hybrid cloud environments and for Software as a Service. It also includes ensuring that we are properly positioned on the ground with the right people and organization to build strategic relationships with customers. We'll be looking in particular to strengthen our professional services organization to improve its ability to deliver value for customers and for BMC. In addition, we expect that in the year ahead, we'll see the benefits of the investments made in fiscal 2010 to expand and improve our sales force.
So from a strategic perspective, the market environment we are in plays very well to our strengths. When you combine it with the improving economy, an expanded product portfolio, a strengthened sales force and an exceptional start to the year, we're very confident that we are strongly positioned for fiscal 2011. 
I'll talk more about our current outlook for fiscal 2011 later in the call. But first, I would like to turn the call over to Steve Solcher, who will provide more insight into our financial results. Steve?"

Looking back over the course of fiscal 2010, there are few important aspects of our business and financial performance that I'd like to highlight. First, even amidst to relatively challenging economic environment, we were able to grow our business. After experiencing a slow start during the first half of fiscal 2010, we saw bookings growth accelerate during the second half of the year. 
Second, we made the investments necessary to improve our strategic position. This includes strengthening our technology portfolio, enhancing our sales force and improving our efficiency. 
Third, we did all of this while substantially improving our earnings and cash flow from operations. The combination of these factors underscores the strength of our strategy, our ability to meet customer demand and our financial discipline we bring across our business. We expect this momentum and improvement to continue into fiscal 2011. As Bob mentioned earlier, the first quarter is off to a strong start.
With that, let me review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year in more detail. Non-GAAP operating income decreased by 5% from $169 million to $161 million in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 33%, down from 35% in a year ago quarter. For the full year, we achieved a record non-GAAP operating income of $675 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2010 was 35%, up two percentage points from fiscal year 2009.
Please refer to Slide 5 for selected non-GAAP income statement information, which includes segment profitability of our ESM and MSM business units. ESM's non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter decreased to $51 million from $53 million in the year ago period. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin decreased year-over-year by two percentage points to 17%. 
For the full year, ESM's non-GAAP operating income increased by 27% to $240 million. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin increased by four percentage points in fiscal 2010 to 21%. We are pleased with the progress we've made in improving the profitability of our ESM business throughout the year, and we'll continue to look for improvement as we move forward.
MSM's non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $110 million, down 5% from the year ago period, and it's non-GAAP operating margin decreased four percentage points to 56%. For the full year, MSM's non-GAAP operating income was $435 million, up 3%, and it's non-GAAP operating margin was 57% flat compared to a year ago. We remain focused on increasing MSM's non-GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011.
Our non-GAAP net earnings for the fourth quarter were $121 million, flat with fiscal 2009. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the period was $0.65, which reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 26%. For fiscal year 2010, non-GAAP net earnings were $496 million, an increase of 15% compared to $431 million in fiscal 2009. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the year was $2.66 per share, up 17% compared to the prior year. This reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 of 26%. These non-GAAP results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter and for the full year of $186 million and $187 million, respectively; versus $187 million and $190 million in the respective year ago periods. 
GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $116 million compared with $120 million in the year ago period. GAAP net income and diluted EPS were $119 million and $0.64, compared to $83 million and $0.44 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, respectively. GAAP operating income in fiscal 2010 was $506 million compared with $368 million in fiscal 2009. GAAP net income and diluted EPS for the fiscal year were $406 million and $2.17 per diluted share, versus $238 million and $1.25 per diluted share in 2009.
Fourth quarter and full fiscal year GAAP net earnings were positively impacted by a net $30 million income tax benefit we recorded in connection with the settlement of prior year's tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service. This tax benefit was excluded from our non-GAAP results. 
Turning now to bookings. Total bookings for the fourth quarter were $587 million, representing an increase of 9% compared to the year ago period. On a constant currency basis, fourth quarter bookings increased to 4%. 
Total bookings for fiscal 2010 were $1.95 billion, up $66 million or 4% compared to the fiscal 2009. On a constant currency basis, total bookings increased 1% for the full year. 
Total license bookings for the quarter increased by 8% year-over-year to $237 million. Total license bookings for the year increased by 1% to $772 million. The weighted average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.12 years, up 3% from 2.06 years in the year ago period. The increase in the weighted average contract length is directly correlated to MSM's strong bookings performance. Accordingly, the longer-term MSM bookings accounted for a slightly higher percentage of total company bookings. 
After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the fourth quarter were $920 million, up 1% compared to the year ago period, and up 5% sequentially from the prior quarter. Please refer to Slide 7 in our presentation.
Now let me turn to the performance of each of our business units. Total ESM license bookings were $137 million in the fourth quarter, down 2% from the year ago period. As Bob mentioned earlier, we had a significant ESM transaction close minutes after our quarter cutoff. 
For fiscal 2010, total ESM license bookings were $471 million, down 4% from fiscal 2009. This shortfall is primarily due to the 16% decrease in ESM license bookings in the first half of the year. However, during the second half of fiscal 2010, ESM license bookings growth accelerated and bookings were up 6%. From a geographic perspective, I'm pleased to highlight the strong ESM license bookings performance in EMEA during the quarter and in the fiscal year.
Turning to the MSM business unit. We believe MSM is best evaluated on the basis of total and annualized bookings over the trailing 12 months. Total MSM bookings for fiscal 2010 increased 10% to $813 million and had an average contract length of 2.9 years. On a constant currency basis, total MSM bookings for the year were up 7%. After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were up 7% to $278 million. On a constant currency basis, total annualized MSM bookings for fiscal 2010 were up 4%. As bookings for our MSM business are tied largely to the timing and size of renewals, MSM bookings can vary widely from quarter-to-quarter. 
During the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong demand from our mainframe customers, as we are in a period of strong renewal activity and had solid performance in our new business sales initiatives across our MSM portfolio.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $491 million, a 3% increase compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. On a constant currency basis, revenue remained relatively flat. Total revenue for the year increased 2% to $1.91 billion on a reported and constant currency basis. 
License revenue in the fourth quarter was $201 million, up 5% from the year ago. License revenue was negatively impacted by the decline in ESM license bookings, and an increase of three percentage points in the ratable rate compared to the prior year. ESM license revenue was $124 million, up 8%; while MSM license revenue was $78 million, flat from the last year. 
For fiscal 2010, license revenue rose 7% to $758 million. During the quarter, the percent of license bookings that was deferred was 56%, one percentage point high year than the third quarter and three percentage points higher than the year ago period.
For the fourth quarter, maintenance revenue was $255 million, an increase of 1% compared to the year ago. ESM maintenance revenue was $137 million, up 2%; and MSM maintenance revenue was $118 million, relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2010, maintenance revenue increased 1% to $1.02 billion. 
Professional services revenue, which is included in the ESM segment, remained flat at $35 million in the fourth quarter. We do see trends improving in our Professional Services business as revenues grew 10% sequentially. Professional Services revenue in fiscal 2010 decreased by 11% to $129 million. 
Moving next to operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $331 million, up 7% from the year ago period and up 4% on a constant currency basis. The majority of this increase in non-GAAP expenses on a constant currency basis is attributable to the increase in sales capacity and three technology acquisitions we made during the year. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the year were down 2% from the previous year on both a reported and constant currency basis. 
Looking at our business units, ESM non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $245 million compared to $232 million in the year ago quarter. MSM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $85 million compared to $78 million in the year ago quarter.
For fiscal 2010, ESM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $902 million compared to $938 million in fiscal 2009. MSM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $335 million compared to $322 million in the previous year. 
Turning now to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the fourth quarter was $624 million come, up 6% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. During the quarter, we deferred $134 million of license revenue or 56% of license bookings, and recorded $99 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. Total deferred revenue increased by $96 million sequentially to $1.82 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 54%. 
Our software development costs were $146 million, a 1% increase over the third quarter fiscal 2010 as we capitalized $19 million and amortized $17 million. Cash and marketable securities at March 31 totaled $1.5 billion, an increase of $227 million, sequentially. Our net cash position was $1.2 billion at March 31. 
For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $304 million, up 53%. For fiscal 2010, cash flow from operations was $635 million, up 10% from the prior year. We are especially pleased with our cash flow performance during the quarter and for fiscal 2010. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares of our stock for a total cost of $75 million. For fiscal 2010, we repurchased 8 million shares at a cost $275 million. We announced today that our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $1 billion to our stock repurchase program, so that we now have just over 1 billion in our current share repurchase program. 
Let me summarize by saying that our performance throughout fiscal 2010 underscores our strong financial and competitive position, and bodes well for us as we enter into fiscal 2011. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his concluding remarks and fiscal 2011 guidance."

Looking forward to fiscal 2011, we believe it will be a year of strong growth in bookings, revenue, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and cash flow from operations. The combination of an improving economy, better prospects for IT spending, strong market demand, our leading-market position and our strong start to fiscal 2011 underlie our confidence for our outlook. 
For full year fiscal 2011, we expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.84 to $2.94 per share. At the midpoint, this would represent a 9% increase over last year. This range excludes an estimated $0.77 to $0.82 per share for non-GAAP adjustments, including expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and restructuring activity.  
The assumptions underlying this full year fiscal 2011 estimate includes: total bookings and revenue growth in the mid-single digits; continued improvement in non-GAAP operating margin; a slight increase in the license bookings ratable rate; slight bookings, revenue and non-GAAP EPS hurt due to currency assumed at today's rates; weighted shares outstanding similar to prior year; and a non-GAAP tax rate of 27%. We expect full year fiscal 2011 cash flow from operations to be between $660 million and $710 million. With that, we will now turn the call over to questions."

Currency had an impact as well as the M&A that we had done throughout the year, and then we, of course, had -- I've said over the last couple of calls that we've been kind of hiring sales capacity.

Obviously, with the guidance we just gave, we're expecting some pretty solid growth in '11. We wanted to make sure sales capacity was ready to go. So we will have, as we've said in the prepared remarks, 20% more productive salespeople in the field, in ESM next year. And so that kind of kept that there, then you had currency and you had M&A. So the expenses, what it was, is kind of baked into that side. We were okay with that. And I think given where we are with the optimism we've got going into '11, I wouldn't have changed anything about that sales build-out.

On the close rate, I would say it was about -- it's kind of hard with that one transaction slipping to comment on with because it wasn't actually material. Again, I'll tell you that we did plan on that deal all quarter. The customers said it's coming. There was no debate internally or externally with the customer about it. At the last minute, the lawyers and what not just couldn't get the paperwork completed until literally single-digit minutes after the clock struck midnight. But I would say if you can take that aside, it was in line with what we normally would see. This wasn't like Q1. We didn't see any kind of systemic buying pattern changes. We didn't have a large number of transactions that suddenly became as hard to close. It was I would say in line with what we had seen previously. This was not a demand issue. We didn't see any slowing in demand out there. It was just kind of what we said in the prepared remarks. Now your second question was about ESM and the overall market. Let me see if I answer this properly -- if I don't answer it properly to your question, let me know. In general, we're seeing some pretty solid optimism from our sales organization, and that comes from just the deals that are in the works. I'll give you an example. Our Executive Briefing Center in the last year, fiscal year '10 was up almost 80% in the number of briefings that we had, almost 80%. The number of CIOs or CXOs that were in our briefing center was up 5x what it had been in fiscal '09. The ASPs were up. The number of deals, 500,000 to a million significantly up. So that's a good healthy transaction mix. It's not just dependent on a few transactions. And then you've got this more productive sales force with 20% more selling feet on the street that should be on a productive sweet spot. Then with cloud and what we're seeing on a macro level, we think that, that should payoff very well. Another thing I mentioned to you is that John McMahon is going to be focused really this year, as he continues to run all of the sales and services, he is going to be focused on sharpening up our professional services organization with Vincent Loisel [ph], who's running that group, and really connecting sales and services together and kind of doing what they did on the sales side last year with the services side this year and really making that organization more profitable, more strategic organization for us to help us get that in line.

I think these products -- we had two products that are not even generally available yet, and we're basically didn't unleash them to the sales force. It was essentially kind of an R&D, hand-managed sort of transaction. So we didn't go out there and begin to really push it with the sales force in any big material way. And we closed half a dozen or so of them while the products were still preannounced. And by the way, these are competitive, competitive against the kind of our big traditional competitors out there that have tried to kind of couple together a SaaS offering or quasi-SaaS offerings, but also against some of the startups out there or smaller companies that are theoretically pure SaaS. As it turns out, they're really not pure Saas. As it turns out, some of these companies are actually doing on-premise with their people-customized code. But nonetheless, we were able to win in against small competitors and large. And with both the Remedy OnDemand and the  ServiceDesk Express on force.com, and they both went out there and won in the market. And now we're going to turn on the sales engines. And Marc Benioff  and I were just communicating last week about it. He is very fired up about it as am I. I'm pretty excited about it. Like with Cisco and the UCS thing, we're going to wait to start adjusting our top line growth plans until we really see those numbers begin to really run up. But I think that there's clearly a part of the market that is not interested or is interested in staying on-premise, and we would be able to serve that. There's clearly a part of the market that wants to do managed services. We're going to be able to and are doing business that way. There's clearly part of the market that want to outsource, and we've been doing very well there. In fact, we just signed a deal today with one of the world's largest global outsourcers and systems integrators, standardizing on us there with our ITSM offerings and a contract for our entire product line and now we're in SaaS. So we really kind of got all four areas covered with products that are integrated into our entire product portfolio suite that go from very inexpensive to full-blown heavy-functionality customizable solution. So we can run the spectrum, and I think SaaS for BMC is not going to be a hobby. It's going to be a very strategic part of our business, but part of our integrated business, not a standalone entity."

Not really, I mean, we, just today, were notified of one of the -- of a major application provider in Europe that we had won that business. It was very competitive against some of the biggest companies in IT that you know the names of. And we've been fighting it out with them for months, and we were just notified today that we've won that business. And it's really a broad set of our -- they were already a good customer and used lots of our products. It's the same products in some cases, but we've got some new things coming out. You'll see announcements from us this month and then some others that will follow up later in the year, where we basically continue to ratchet up the cloud-specific functionality, in particular, the integration and some of the automation components that are specific to cloud. As I sit here, I can't think of it. There may be something I can't think of it right now, Tim, of something that goes away. I think what we'll end up having is customers will want the cloud-specific functionality and the integration design for cloud implemented on their clouds, but they'll want, and this is really key for us, they will want to be able to manage their physical environments, their virtual environments, their cloud environments, internal cloud and their external cloud environments and their SaaS environments with one operations platform, and that's what we're bringing to the table. If you think about it, this is almost like another operating system. Another platform is coming on the scene for management. It increases the complexity of managing it. If you're going to manage cloud, let's say, you buy VMware suite to manage and you try to, and what they is coming out, to manage their cloud environment. Okay, so you've got certain products for them to manage cloud, which by the way only work on the VM hypervisor. Then you could buy other products to manage hardware from Oracle that just manages Oracle, and then you buy some other -- so you get into this huge bucket of balls of managing components with other components and your building management stacks that are not integrated. BMC gives the customer the ability to manage all of those environments, physical, virtual cloud and external cloud like Google, et cetera and SaaS offerings from a single vendor, and that's really integrated together. So we see it's going to continue to raise the strategic importance of an integrated management environment in these large enterprises. Those customers are saying that very, very clearly to us in the Briefing Center."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's call. The fourth quarter marked the end of another solid year business and financial performance for BMC Software. During fiscal 2010, we performed well against our key metrics,",1847,"Thank you, Derrick. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's call. The fourth quarter marked the end of another solid year business and financial performance for BMC Software. 
During fiscal 2010, we performed well against our key metrics, operating cash flow, total bookings, revenue, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP diluted EPS. Cash flow from operations increased 10% to $635 million. Total bookings for the year grew 4%. Total revenue for the year was $1.91 billion, up 2%. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2010 increased two percentage points year-over-year to 35%. Non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 17% to $2.66 per share, while GAAP diluted EPS increased 74% to $2.17 per share. And our balance sheet remains strong with $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $1.8 billion in deferred revenue. So again, another very good year for BMC with momentum building in the second half, and we expect fiscal 2011 to be even better.
Let's turn now to look specifically at the fourth quarter. We generated strong bookings and strong cash flow from operations. Total bookings for the quarter were $587 million, up 9% year-over-year. And cash flow from operations was $304 million, an increase of 53% year-over-year. While I'm pleased with these results, our revenue and non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter were at the low end of our expectations. We had a significant ESM transaction close minutes after the end of the quarter cutoff. This materially impacted fourth quarter results by roughly $15 million to license bookings and upfront license revenue. We believe that this delayed transaction is an anomaly and not the result of our historical sales processes and practices. With the timing of this transaction, as well as several other large GSM transactions that we closed in early April, we're off to a very strong start in fiscal 2011. 
While I will discuss specific guidance later in the call, our overall outlook is quite positive. The size of the pipeline in both our ESM and MSM businesses looks robust, the demand environment is improving and our competitive position remains exceptionally strong. We're seeing acceleration in the trends that drive our business.
Let me turn next to discuss some key business and operational highlights during the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. During fiscal 2010, we further strengthen our market-leading position in IT Service Management. As you know, Remedy is a strategically important solution for us because of its broad market penetration, which we leveraged to generate strategic platform sales. Not surprisingly, it's an area that attracts a lot of attention and the sharpest competition. 
We believe that over the past 12 months, we added more customers and grew our installed base faster than any of our significant competitor. During this time period, we added a total of 263 new Remedy IT Service Management customers. And it's important to note that we achieved this even before launching our ITSM SaaS offerings. As you may recall, we recently announced two powerful Software-as-a-Service or SaaS offerings that enable us to leverage our leadership in IT service desk and to broaden our customer footprint through these new offerings. This SaaS initiatives include our new BMC Remedy OnDemand solution, which provides customers with our full industry-leading service management offering delivered as a service. 
We've also introduced ServiceDesk on Force.com offered through our partnership with salesforce.com, which is aimed at a market that is looking for a powerful service desk at a low price point. This solution addresses the growing customer demand for critical service desk and help desk functionality delivered via the cloud. These are both very important initiatives for BMC. And I'm pleased to report that during the quarter, the initial reaction in the marketplace has been positive. 
We are particularly encouraged that we had six wins for our SaaS offerings prior to their announced general availability. In addition to these SaaS transactions and the previously mentioned Remedy ITSM new on-premise customers, during the year, we also added nearly 100 new Remedy ITSM customers through managed service providers and global systems integrators. We think this initial demand bodes well for our ability to further penetrate the market with our SaaS offerings, on-premise offerings and managed service offerings and to further strengthen our ITSM market position. 
We are continuing to see strong performance in larger multi-product platform deals with our enterprise customers. During fiscal 2010, we had 80 ESM license transactions over $1 million, 52 of these were multiple product license transactions, which is up about 10% over the previous year, and it reflects the changes we're seeing in the composition of our transaction.
We are also encouraged to see strong growth in our mid-sized transactions. The number of ESM license transactions between $500,000 and $1 million increased year-over-year by 33%. In the fourth quarter, we had 22 ESM license transactions over $1 million. The majority of these were multiple product license deals. ESM major wins during the fourth quarter included Fujitsu, CGI, Coinstar, and TELUS. 
We also saw ASP's continue to grow. It's worth noting that the number of transaction in the quarter between $500,000 and $1 million grew by over 15% compared to a year ago period. 
Many of our ESM sales wins were driven by customers who are adopting our service automation offerings and our Atrium Configuration Management Database, or CMDB. The continued penetration of our Atrium CMDB into the enterprise customers bodes well for our ability to drive larger, more strategic platform wins. 
Our automation offerings including BladeLogic had a very strong quarter and are significant competitive advantage that we enjoy among IT management software vendors. For example, during the quarter, we had multiple competitive wins and replacements against HP Opsware for our service automation offerings. We're also seeing a positive impact from our efforts to strengthen our top-notch ESM sales organization.
At the conclusion of our fiscal year, the total number of sales reps and the total number of tenured sales reps were above where we were a year ago. At the same time, these tenured sales reps increased their productivity on a year-over-year basis. We pass the peak point in our hiring and are beginning to see the benefits of this expansion as the productivity of new reps we brought on board throughout fiscal 2010 increases. We expect the average number of tenured reps to increase over 20% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010. 
Turning now to our MSM business. Strong demand across the MSM portfolio continued into the fourth quarter, demonstrated by the 10% increase in total MSM bookings for fiscal year 2010. This growth reflects the continued strength in the mainframe renewal cycle, growth from our new business sales efforts and our continuing commitment to operational excellence. It's important to remember that in addition to mainframe specific solutions, MSM offers enterprise-wide, platform-agnostic solutions which are not tied to the ebbs and flows of the mainframe hardware cycle. Representing nearly a third of MSM's revenue base, these solutions include our industry-leading enterprise workload automation and middleware management products. 
During the fiscal year 2010, we increased the MSM installed base by adding 101 new customers. In the quarter alone, we added 42 new customers and also saw 88 existing customers renew and increase their relationship with us by adding new products to their existing portfolio. Some of these major MSM wins include Banco Bradesco, Kookmin Bank, Sallie Mae and T-Systems. And we, once again, had a solid increase in the annual run rate of our top 15 MSM transactions, driven by significant competitive wins at key accounts. This is the 12th consecutive quarter where we have seen an increase in the run rate of our largest transactions. Looking forward, we now expect to see continued strength in MSM renewals throughout all of fiscal 2011 and into fiscal 2012.
Our confidence in the continued strength of MSM is a direct benefit of our improved visibility relating to the timing of renewals, our execution of new business, as well as the upcoming IBM mainframe release. So that's a snapshot of key business and operational developments during the quarter. Looking in our markets more broadly, we like what we see, and think fiscal 2011 will mark further progress and achievement as we work to solidify our position as the world's leading IT management software platform. 
According to recent industry reports, the need to improve IT management and make it more efficient has increased the demand for these technologies. A large industry leading analyst firms stated in one of its surveys that even though CIOs projected a slight budget increase in 2010 from 2009 historic budget cuts, the increase still leaves them with fewer resources in 2008. In addition, the survey stated that business priorities for IT call for greater productivity and continued cost efficiencies. The top CIO business priorities in 2010 include improving business processes, reducing enterprise costs and increasing the use of information and analytics.
This plays directly to our strength in IT management software. And it's one of the major reasons we expect to see continued growth in fiscal 2011. This growth will also be fueled by key technology trends, virtualization, cloud computing and Software as a Service, that only heightened the need for unified IT management. Amidst this change, we believe that an IT infrastructure agnostic software management company, such as BMC, will be very strongly positioned.  
We offer the most comprehensive approach and unified management platform for managing IT. BMC's portfolio of BSM solutions helps customers efficiently manage business services across its IT service life cycle of request, deliver, operate, plan and govern across mainframe, distributed, physical, virtual and cloud computing environments. The strong partnerships we built with industry leaders, Cisco, Dell, Accenture, and salesforce.com to name a few, underscores the strength of BMC's competitive advantages in the IT Management Software business. They also reflect the scope and scale of the market opportunities that lie ahead. 
During fiscal 2011, we will continue to make the investments necessary to maximize these opportunities. These investments include new technologies to address key trends in the marketplace, such as customer migration to hybrid cloud environments and for Software as a Service. It also includes ensuring that we are properly positioned on the ground with the right people and organization to build strategic relationships with customers. We'll be looking in particular to strengthen our professional services organization to improve its ability to deliver value for customers and for BMC. In addition, we expect that in the year ahead, we'll see the benefits of the investments made in fiscal 2010 to expand and improve our sales force.
So from a strategic perspective, the market environment we are in plays very well to our strengths. When you combine it with the improving economy, an expanded product portfolio, a strengthened sales force and an exceptional start to the year, we're very confident that we are strongly positioned for fiscal 2011. 
I'll talk more about our current outlook for fiscal 2011 later in the call. But first, I would like to turn the call over to Steve Solcher, who will provide more insight into our financial results. Steve?

Looking back over the course of fiscal 2010, there are few important aspects of our business and financial performance that I'd like to highlight. First, even amidst to relatively challenging economic environment, we were able to grow our business. After experiencing a slow start during the first half of fiscal 2010, we saw bookings growth accelerate during the second half of the year. 
Second, we made the investments necessary to improve our strategic position. This includes strengthening our technology portfolio, enhancing our sales force and improving our efficiency. 
Third, we did all of this while substantially improving our earnings and cash flow from operations. The combination of these factors underscores the strength of our strategy, our ability to meet customer demand and our financial discipline we bring across our business. We expect this momentum and improvement to continue into fiscal 2011. As Bob mentioned earlier, the first quarter is off to a strong start.
With that, let me review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year in more detail. Non-GAAP operating income decreased by 5% from $169 million to $161 million in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 33%, down from 35% in a year ago quarter. For the full year, we achieved a record non-GAAP operating income of $675 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin for fiscal 2010 was 35%, up two percentage points from fiscal year 2009.
Please refer to Slide 5 for selected non-GAAP income statement information, which includes segment profitability of our ESM and MSM business units. ESM's non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter decreased to $51 million from $53 million in the year ago period. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin decreased year-over-year by two percentage points to 17%. 
For the full year, ESM's non-GAAP operating income increased by 27% to $240 million. ESM's non-GAAP operating margin increased by four percentage points in fiscal 2010 to 21%. We are pleased with the progress we've made in improving the profitability of our ESM business throughout the year, and we'll continue to look for improvement as we move forward.
MSM's non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $110 million, down 5% from the year ago period, and it's non-GAAP operating margin decreased four percentage points to 56%. For the full year, MSM's non-GAAP operating income was $435 million, up 3%, and it's non-GAAP operating margin was 57% flat compared to a year ago. We remain focused on increasing MSM's non-GAAP operating income in fiscal 2011.
Our non-GAAP net earnings for the fourth quarter were $121 million, flat with fiscal 2009. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the period was $0.65, which reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 26%. For fiscal year 2010, non-GAAP net earnings were $496 million, an increase of 15% compared to $431 million in fiscal 2009. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the year was $2.66 per share, up 17% compared to the prior year. This reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 of 26%. These non-GAAP results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the fourth quarter and for the full year of $186 million and $187 million, respectively; versus $187 million and $190 million in the respective year ago periods. 
GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter was $116 million compared with $120 million in the year ago period. GAAP net income and diluted EPS were $119 million and $0.64, compared to $83 million and $0.44 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, respectively. GAAP operating income in fiscal 2010 was $506 million compared with $368 million in fiscal 2009. GAAP net income and diluted EPS for the fiscal year were $406 million and $2.17 per diluted share, versus $238 million and $1.25 per diluted share in 2009.
Fourth quarter and full fiscal year GAAP net earnings were positively impacted by a net $30 million income tax benefit we recorded in connection with the settlement of prior year's tax matters with the Internal Revenue Service. This tax benefit was excluded from our non-GAAP results. 
Turning now to bookings. Total bookings for the fourth quarter were $587 million, representing an increase of 9% compared to the year ago period. On a constant currency basis, fourth quarter bookings increased to 4%. 
Total bookings for fiscal 2010 were $1.95 billion, up $66 million or 4% compared to the fiscal 2009. On a constant currency basis, total bookings increased 1% for the full year. 
Total license bookings for the quarter increased by 8% year-over-year to $237 million. Total license bookings for the year increased by 1% to $772 million. The weighted average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.12 years, up 3% from 2.06 years in the year ago period. The increase in the weighted average contract length is directly correlated to MSM's strong bookings performance. Accordingly, the longer-term MSM bookings accounted for a slightly higher percentage of total company bookings. 
After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the fourth quarter were $920 million, up 1% compared to the year ago period, and up 5% sequentially from the prior quarter. Please refer to Slide 7 in our presentation.
Now let me turn to the performance of each of our business units. Total ESM license bookings were $137 million in the fourth quarter, down 2% from the year ago period. As Bob mentioned earlier, we had a significant ESM transaction close minutes after our quarter cutoff. 
For fiscal 2010, total ESM license bookings were $471 million, down 4% from fiscal 2009. This shortfall is primarily due to the 16% decrease in ESM license bookings in the first half of the year. However, during the second half of fiscal 2010, ESM license bookings growth accelerated and bookings were up 6%. From a geographic perspective, I'm pleased to highlight the strong ESM license bookings performance in EMEA during the quarter and in the fiscal year.
Turning to the MSM business unit. We believe MSM is best evaluated on the basis of total and annualized bookings over the trailing 12 months. Total MSM bookings for fiscal 2010 increased 10% to $813 million and had an average contract length of 2.9 years. On a constant currency basis, total MSM bookings for the year were up 7%. After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were up 7% to $278 million. On a constant currency basis, total annualized MSM bookings for fiscal 2010 were up 4%. As bookings for our MSM business are tied largely to the timing and size of renewals, MSM bookings can vary widely from quarter-to-quarter. 
During the fourth quarter, we continue to see strong demand from our mainframe customers, as we are in a period of strong renewal activity and had solid performance in our new business sales initiatives across our MSM portfolio.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $491 million, a 3% increase compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. On a constant currency basis, revenue remained relatively flat. Total revenue for the year increased 2% to $1.91 billion on a reported and constant currency basis. 
License revenue in the fourth quarter was $201 million, up 5% from the year ago. License revenue was negatively impacted by the decline in ESM license bookings, and an increase of three percentage points in the ratable rate compared to the prior year. ESM license revenue was $124 million, up 8%; while MSM license revenue was $78 million, flat from the last year. 
For fiscal 2010, license revenue rose 7% to $758 million. During the quarter, the percent of license bookings that was deferred was 56%, one percentage point high year than the third quarter and three percentage points higher than the year ago period.
For the fourth quarter, maintenance revenue was $255 million, an increase of 1% compared to the year ago. ESM maintenance revenue was $137 million, up 2%; and MSM maintenance revenue was $118 million, relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. For fiscal 2010, maintenance revenue increased 1% to $1.02 billion. 
Professional services revenue, which is included in the ESM segment, remained flat at $35 million in the fourth quarter. We do see trends improving in our Professional Services business as revenues grew 10% sequentially. Professional Services revenue in fiscal 2010 decreased by 11% to $129 million. 
Moving next to operating expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the fourth quarter were $331 million, up 7% from the year ago period and up 4% on a constant currency basis. The majority of this increase in non-GAAP expenses on a constant currency basis is attributable to the increase in sales capacity and three technology acquisitions we made during the year. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the year were down 2% from the previous year on both a reported and constant currency basis. 
Looking at our business units, ESM non-GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $245 million compared to $232 million in the year ago quarter. MSM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $85 million compared to $78 million in the year ago quarter.
For fiscal 2010, ESM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $902 million compared to $938 million in fiscal 2009. MSM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $335 million compared to $322 million in the previous year. 
Turning now to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the fourth quarter was $624 million come, up 6% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. During the quarter, we deferred $134 million of license revenue or 56% of license bookings, and recorded $99 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. Total deferred revenue increased by $96 million sequentially to $1.82 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 54%. 
Our software development costs were $146 million, a 1% increase over the third quarter fiscal 2010 as we capitalized $19 million and amortized $17 million. Cash and marketable securities at March 31 totaled $1.5 billion, an increase of $227 million, sequentially. Our net cash position was $1.2 billion at March 31. 
For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $304 million, up 53%. For fiscal 2010, cash flow from operations was $635 million, up 10% from the prior year. We are especially pleased with our cash flow performance during the quarter and for fiscal 2010. 
During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares of our stock for a total cost of $75 million. For fiscal 2010, we repurchased 8 million shares at a cost $275 million. We announced today that our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $1 billion to our stock repurchase program, so that we now have just over 1 billion in our current share repurchase program. 
Let me summarize by saying that our performance throughout fiscal 2010 underscores our strong financial and competitive position, and bodes well for us as we enter into fiscal 2011. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his concluding remarks and fiscal 2011 guidance.

Looking forward to fiscal 2011, we believe it will be a year of strong growth in bookings, revenue, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share and cash flow from operations. The combination of an improving economy, better prospects for IT spending, strong market demand, our leading-market position and our strong start to fiscal 2011 underlie our confidence for our outlook. 
For full year fiscal 2011, we expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.84 to $2.94 per share. At the midpoint, this would represent a 9% increase over last year. This range excludes an estimated $0.77 to $0.82 per share for non-GAAP adjustments, including expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation and restructuring activity.  
The assumptions underlying this full year fiscal 2011 estimate includes: total bookings and revenue growth in the mid-single digits; continued improvement in non-GAAP operating margin; a slight increase in the license bookings ratable rate; slight bookings, revenue and non-GAAP EPS hurt due to currency assumed at today's rates; weighted shares outstanding similar to prior year; and a non-GAAP tax rate of 27%. We expect full year fiscal 2011 cash flow from operations to be between $660 million and $710 million. With that, we will now turn the call over to questions.

So we will have, as we've said in the prepared remarks, 20% more productive salespeople in the field, in ESM next year. And so that kind of kept that there, then you had currency and you had M&A.

We also find, and this is I think very important, we just think we're doing a really good job of winning against the competitors right now in the MSM area. We think having a dedicated sales force who can sell value -- I was just on the phone about three hours ago with the CIO of a very large insurance company that just did an eight-figure transaction with us on mainframe, as well as a large BSM transaction with us last quarter, to thank him for his business. And this is a case where we can replace competitors or really standardize on us across our platform, our entire monitoring environment and automation environment. So I think we're just doing a good job of executing both R&D-wise or product-wise. Customer sat is really at or near an all-time high on MSM. And we do our own internal surveys. We also pay somebody else to check that for us. And we've got really good execution going on there.

On the close rate, I would say it was about -- it's kind of hard with that one transaction slipping to comment on with because it wasn't actually material. Again, I'll tell you that we did plan on that deal all quarter. The customers said it's coming. There was no debate internally or externally with the customer about it. At the last minute, the lawyers and what not just couldn't get the paperwork completed until literally single-digit minutes after the clock struck midnight. But I would say if you can take that aside, it was in line with what we normally would see. This wasn't like Q1. We didn't see any kind of systemic buying pattern changes. We didn't have a large number of transactions that suddenly became as hard to close. It was I would say in line with what we had seen previously. This was not a demand issue. We didn't see any slowing in demand out there. It was just kind of what we said in the prepared remarks. Now your second question was about ESM and the overall market. Let me see if I answer this properly -- if I don't answer it properly to your question, let me know. In general, we're seeing some pretty solid optimism from our sales organization, and that comes from just the deals that are in the works. I'll give you an example. Our Executive Briefing Center in the last year, fiscal year '10 was up almost 80% in the number of briefings that we had, almost 80%. The number of CIOs or CXOs that were in our briefing center was up 5x what it had been in fiscal '09. The ASPs were up. The number of deals, 500,000 to a million significantly up. So that's a good healthy transaction mix. It's not just dependent on a few transactions. And then you've got this more productive sales force with 20% more selling feet on the street that should be on a productive sweet spot. Then with cloud and what we're seeing on a macro level, we think that, that should payoff very well. Another thing I mentioned to you is that John McMahon is going to be focused really this year, as he continues to run all of the sales and services, he is going to be focused on sharpening up our professional services organization with Vincent Loisel [ph], who's running that group, and really connecting sales and services together and kind of doing what they did on the sales side last year with the services side this year and really making that organization more profitable, more strategic organization for us to help us get that in line. And see if I left anything out of your question there

Interestingly, it's expanded beyond just the UCS-embedded software discussion into broader product alliances. We're doing deals together in customer accounts. This week, I'll be at a customer event. We'll have almost 100 customers. And lots of CIOs from very, very well-known companies will be there, and Cisco is part of that event that's helping us on broader than just the UCS event. So I think the alliance is in good shape. But really trying to extrapolate math to get to the UCS attach rate at this point is unfortunately it's just still too early.

I think these products -- we had two products that are not even generally available yet, and we're basically didn't unleash them to the sales force. It was essentially kind of an R&D, hand-managed sort of transaction. So we didn't go out there and begin to really push it with the sales force in any big material way. And we closed half a dozen or so of them while the products were still preannounced. And by the way, these are competitive, competitive against the kind of our big traditional competitors out there that have tried to kind of couple together a SaaS offering or quasi-SaaS offerings, but also against some of the startups out there or smaller companies that are theoretically pure SaaS. As it turns out, they're really not pure Saas. As it turns out, some of these companies are actually doing on-premise with their people-customized code. But nonetheless, we were able to win in against small competitors and large. And with both the Remedy OnDemand and the  ServiceDesk Express on force.com, and they both went out there and won in the market. And now we're going to turn on the sales engines. And Marc Benioff  and I were just communicating last week about it. He is very fired up about it as am I. I'm pretty excited about it. Like with Cisco and the UCS thing, we're going to wait to start adjusting our top line growth plans until we really see those numbers begin to really run up. But I think that there's clearly a part of the market that is not interested or is interested in staying on-premise, and we would be able to serve that. There's clearly a part of the market that wants to do managed services. We're going to be able to and are doing business that way. There's clearly part of the market that want to outsource, and we've been doing very well there. In fact, we just signed a deal today with one of the world's largest global outsourcers and systems integrators, standardizing on us there with our ITSM offerings and a contract for our entire product line and now we're in SaaS. So we really kind of got all four areas covered with products that are integrated into our entire product portfolio suite that go from very inexpensive to full-blown heavy-functionality customizable solution. So we can run the spectrum, and I think SaaS for BMC is not going to be a hobby. It's going to be a very strategic part of our business, but part of our integrated business, not a standalone entity.

Not really, I mean, we, just today, were notified of one of the -- of a major application provider in Europe that we had won that business. It was very competitive against some of the biggest companies in IT that you know the names of. And we've been fighting it out with them for months, and we were just notified today that we've won that business. And it's really a broad set of our -- they were already a good customer and used lots of our products. It's the same products in some cases, but we've got some new things coming out. You'll see announcements from us this month and then some others that will follow up later in the year, where we basically continue to ratchet up the cloud-specific functionality, in particular, the integration and some of the automation components that are specific to cloud. As I sit here, I can't think of it. There may be something I can't think of it right now, Tim, of something that goes away. I think what we'll end up having is customers will want the cloud-specific functionality and the integration design for cloud implemented on their clouds, but they'll want, and this is really key for us, they will want to be able to manage their physical environments, their virtual environments, their cloud environments, internal cloud and their external cloud environments and their SaaS environments with one operations platform, and that's what we're bringing to the table. If you think about it, this is almost like another operating system. Another platform is coming on the scene for management. It increases the complexity of managing it. If you're going to manage cloud, let's say, you buy VMware suite to manage and you try to, and what they is coming out, to manage their cloud environment. Okay, so you've got certain products for them to manage cloud, which by the way only work on the VM hypervisor. Then you could buy other products to manage hardware from Oracle that just manages Oracle, and then you buy some other -- so you get into this huge bucket of balls of managing components with other components and your building management stacks that are not integrated. BMC gives the customer the ability to manage all of those environments, physical, virtual cloud and external cloud like Google, et cetera and SaaS offerings from a single vendor, and that's really integrated together. So we see it's going to continue to raise the strategic importance of an integrated management environment in these large enterprises. Those customers are saying that very, very clearly to us in the Briefing Center.

I'm very pleased to say that BMC Software is starting out fiscal 2011 with robust year-over-year growth and a solid overall performance. We grew total bookings by 14%. We had the highest percentage increase in total license bookings in the past six quarters. We grew ESM license bookings by 40%, the highest percentage increase in the past six quarters, a strong leading indicator of customer adoption and market growth.
MSM total annualized bookings for the trailing 12 months increased 8%. Cash flow from operations was $167 million, an increase of 8%. Total revenue for the quarter was $461 million, up 2%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 34%, up one percentage point.  And non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 5% to $0.62 per share. 
Our financial position remains strong as evidenced by our solid balance sheet. We had $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $1.8 billion in deferred revenue at the end of the quarter. That's a snapshot of our overall performance. Given our solid first quarter results and our current outlook, we are on track to achieve our fiscal 2011 expectations.
Let me turn next to discuss key developments in our ESM and MSM business units during the quarter. First and foremost, ESM license bookings increased 40% from the year-ago quarter. We continue to see momentum in ESM license bookings, which over the past nine months have grown 13% over the respective period of a year ago.
We had a number of significant wins during the quarter that demonstrated our continued strength in selling the BSM platform. In fact, we had 14 ESM license transactions with over $1 million in bookings, up from 11 license transactions a year ago. We had a number of large ESM platform wins, including Computer Sciences Corporation, Sanofi-Aventis Group, Servicio de Administracion Tributaria of Mexico and Tata Consulting Services. 
We saw multiple wins in the U.S. federal sector. These include the Marine Corps Systems Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the United States Central Command. 
It's not only the growth in large deals, but the mix of our ESM wins that underscores our momentum. The number of ESM license transactions between $500,000 and $1 million increased by over 50% compared to a year ago. That's the fourth straight quarter in which we have seen deals in this range increase by double-digit percentage. And we also saw our average selling price continue to grow.
Looking at our global performance, we generated solid double-digit ESM license bookings growth in all major geographies. Not only did we have strong geographic performance, but we also had strong double-digit license bookings growth across all of our product disciplines within the ESM business. Six of the top 10 license deals were multi-disciplined license transactions, while five of those included all product disciplines.  This reflects the success of our ongoing realignment of our ESM sales team. 
Our Service Automation and Atrium Configuration Management Database solutions continue to lead the way for us. Our Automation offerings had a particularly strong quarter and continue to be a significant advantage that differentiates us from the competition.  This demonstrates our ability to successfully integrate and leverage key technologies that we acquire. I'm referring in particular to BladeLogic. But this also holds true for our three largest transactions over the past two years, which have performed extremely well by fueling strong growth within our ESM business unit. We're continuing to see robust demand for our Atrium CMDB, which we believe is a leading indicator of the opportunity ahead to drive larger more strategic platform wins.  We also had strong growth in our Service Assurance and Service Support product disciplines. 
BMC has been focused on leveraging the strength of its unified, integrated management platform, investing in extending and enhancing it to enable the management of next-generation IT environments and speed the adoption of cloud computing. Unlike other vendors, BMC's cloud strategy allows customers to achieve the benefits of Cloud, reduced cost and improved efficiency, without introducing new silos, disrupting IT operations or forcing a vendor lock-in for hardware, services or a virtualization platform.
Looking at the number of companies that visited our Executive Briefing Center over the past year, it is evident that our customers are choosing to standardize on our IT management platform as they look to IT to strategically enable their business growth. Our partner ecosystem around the BSM platform also continues to develop. We're increasingly teaming with industry leaders such as Accenture, Cisco, Dell and salesforce.com in comprehensive cloud and BSM platform sales opportunities and implementations. These strong partnerships underscore the strength of BMC's competitive advantage in the IT Management Software business for both enterprise and service providers.
In terms of cloud solutions, I'm very proud to say that over the past year, BMC has won 25 large proof of concept and technical design shootouts for virtualization and cloud management at some of the largest enterprises in the world. BMC also has been selected by five of the top 20 telecom companies as their standard platform for virtualization and cloud management. And in the last two quarters, two of the top systems integrators have selected BMC Software as their strategic management provider for their hosted services.
We believe that significant potential lies ahead of us in this area. We're continuing to invest in and launch new offerings to capture that opportunity. Our BMC Cloud Lifecycle Management solution is now available globally. This solution is part of our Cloud Service Management portfolio, which unlike other offerings from other IT vendors, manages a broad combination of hardware, software and virtualization offerings. This enables customers to rapidly achieve success with their cloud initiatives, gives them choices about which current and future technologies to use and allows them to continue to derive value from their existing IT environments. This strategic approach has been validated by numerous enterprises and service provider customers, affirming that our approach is sound. As the market for cloud solutions grows, we anticipate seeing increased demand for our solutions in the area of Cloud Planning, Cloud Lifecycle Management, Cloud Operations and Cloud Governance, especially IT Service Costing. 
One thing in particular that I'd like to highlight is that our customers frequently view cloud computing as a catalyst for improving their IT maturity; that the introduction of new technology brings with it the requirement to also transform their IT operations along the principles of Business Service Management.
This is why we were so excited about the cloud market, and about how BMC can really shine. To augment these cloud solutions, we also plan on enhancing our Software-as-a-Service offerings over the next several quarters, capitalizing on customer interest in this expanding market. Our platform is winning significant support from customers, partners and service providers. For example, we gained 51 new customers for our IT Service Management offerings this past quarter. This reflects in part our efforts to broaden our footprint and distribution capabilities. 
We're also very encouraged that we had 15 wins for our SaaS offerings during the first quarter of general availability. Our SaaS initiatives include both our BMC Remedy On Demand solution, which enables customers to access our industry-leading service management offering as a service, and our BMC ServiceDesk on Force.com solution.  Key BMC Remedy On Demand wins included Citrix Online, St. Jude's Medical, Children's National Medical Center, Moffitt Cancer Center and Health Care Partners. Our strategic partnership with salesforce.com is off to a great start as we see customers rapidly adopting BMC's ServiceDesk on Force.com. 
During the quarter, we added a number of new companies through this offering, including Advanced Infrastructure Management, Emmanuel College and Creative Information Technologies, Incorporated.  Further strengthening the strategic alliance between the two companies, salesforce.com will begin this quarter reselling BMC's ServiceDesk on Force.com to accelerate the momentum for cloud-based IT service management integrated with their Sales Cloud 2, Service Cloud 2 and Chatter Collaboration Cloud. Through our resell agreement with salesforce.com, we are making it easier than ever to customers to simplify and automate their IT operations.
In addition to having the best technology, another way in which we're determined to gain a competitive advantage is by helping enterprise customers get the most value out of our offerings. That's why we're working to strengthen and expand our Professional Services organization. We began this current initiative in fiscal 2010, and it will remain a priority during fiscal 2011. While it's still early in the process, we're pleased with the results in the first quarter. Professional Services bookings and revenue increased significantly. Utilization rates rose, and our Professional Services business returned to profitability.
We're also seeing a positive impact from our efforts to strengthen our ESM sales organization. Our goal here is to broaden our footprint and our ability to build C-level relationships. The evidence indicates that our strategy is working. During the quarter, the average number of tenured sales reps increased from the prior year. At the same time, these tenured reps increased their productivity on a year-over-year basis. We are ahead of plan on the number of productive heads, and we expect the average number of tenured reps to increase over 20% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010.
Let me turn now to our MSM business. As you know, this business can be lumpy from a booking standpoint because of the timing of renewals. Total MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis increased 15%, up from a 10% increase last quarter. It's also important to look at MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis after normalizing for differences in contract length. On that basis, MSM annualized bookings increased 8%. During the quarter, we increased the MSM install base by adding 15 new customers. We also saw 54 existing customers renew and increase their relationship with us by adding new products to their existing portfolio. Some of these major MSM wins include Federal Express, Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase, Aurora Healthcare and Telefonica de Espana.
Once again, we had a solid increase in the annual run rate for our top 15 MSM transactions, driven by significant competitive wins at key accounts. This is the 13th consecutive quarter where we have seen an increase in the run rate of our largest transactions. Our MSM business continues to lead the mainframe management market in terms of innovation and execution. 
During the first quarter, we announced new mainframe cost-optimization capabilities. We also recently released a new mainframe product for IMS, the leading transactional and hierarchical database management system for the IBM System z mainframe. 
BMC has been providing innovative IMS solutions since 1982 and has hundreds of IMS customers worldwide, including some of the world's largest financial and IT service providers. 
So to summarize our fiscal 2011 first quarter, we had robust bookings growth across key product offerings and geographies. We're continue to lead our market in terms of both vision and technology. The technology trends driving our markets, such as cloud computing, virtualization and Software-as-a-Service, represent a strengthening tailwind that is propelling BMC forward. I'll talk more about our current outlook for fiscal 2011 later in the call. 
Before I turn the call over to Steve Solcher, I would like to highlight two additions to our team. Steve James and Mark Hawkins joined BMC's Board of Directors in May. Both Steve and Mark bring years of senior executive experience in the technology  industry to our board. 
Now Steve Solcher will provide more insight into our financial results. Steve?"

Before I take you through our financial results, there are a few points I'd like to underscore about our performance.

Before I take you through our financial results, there are a few points I'd like to underscore about our performance. I'm pleased with our solid first quarter performance and start to our fiscal year. We had strong total bookings growth in ESM license bookings growth. Our ESM business demonstrated significant broad-based growth across key product lines and geographies, while increasing its operating margin year-over-year by seven percentage points.
We grew revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share despite the negative impact of a significant year-over-year increase in the deferral rate of our license bookings, which I will discuss later, and we grew our cash flow from operations by 8%.  Our financial position remains strong as demonstrated by our solid balance sheet and recent ratings upgrades by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's. 
It's important to point out that license revenues were negatively impacted by an unusual year-over-year difference in the ratable rate of our license bookings. You can see this difference on Slide 9 of our conference call presentation where we provide additional visibility on ratability by license bookings overall and for each of our business units.  License bookings ratability increased from an unusually low 26% in the year-ago quarter to 44% in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. On a business unit basis, license bookings deferral rate increased 10 percentage points for our ESM business and 45 percentage points for our MSM business.
We are pleased that our key business initiatives which we have discussed with you in recent quarters are proving successful. Our efforts to strengthen and expand our sales force are showing progress and momentum. Although still early, we are now seeing signs of traction in our Professional Services organization, and we remain committed to maintaining our customary financial discipline. All of these initiatives reflect our strategy to invest in our business in a disciplined way to build value for customers and shareholders.
With that, let me turn to our financial results for the quarter. 
In the first quarter, non-GAAP operating income increased by 6% from $148 million to $157 million. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 34% this quarter, up one percentage point over the last year.  
Please refer to Slide 5 for our highlights of our ESM and MSM business unit operating results. In the first quarter, operating income of our ESM business unit increased 55% to $66 million from $42 million in the year-ago period. ESM's operating margin increased year-over-year by seven percentage points to 23%. We remain pleased with the continued improvement and profitability of our ESM business. 
MSM's operating income decreased by 14% to $91 million from $106 million, and its operating margin decreased by four percentage points to 52%.  MSM's financial performance on a year-over-year basis reflects the significant increase in MSM's license bookings deferral rate. 
Our non-GAAP net earnings for the first quarter were $114 million, an increase of 3% from $111 million in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the period was $0.62, up 5% from $0.59 in the year-ago period. This reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 25%. These non-GAAP results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter of $184 million versus $188 million in the year-ago period.
GAAP operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $108 million, flat compared to the year-ago period. GAAP net income and diluted EPS were $93 million and $0.50 compared to $82 million and $0.44 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.  First quarter GAAP net earnings were positively impacted by a $14 million income tax benefit recorded in connection with the settlement with a taxing authority related to prior years' tax matters. This benefit was excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Turning now to bookings. In the first quarter, total bookings of $443 million were up 14% from $390 million in the year-ago period. On a constant currency basis, first quarter bookings increased 16%. Total license bookings for the quarter increased 27% year-over-year to $135 million. On a constant currency basis, first quarter license bookings increased 31%.
Total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were $2 billion, up 12% compared to the year-ago period. The weighted-average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.19 years, up 7% from 2.05 years in the year-ago period.
After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the first quarter were $911 million, up 4% from the year-ago period. Please refer to Slide 7 in our presentation.
Now let me turn to the performance of each of our business units. For our ESM business unit, growth in license bookings is the best measure of performance. ESM license bookings were $101 million in the first quarter, up 40% from $73 million in the year-ago period. I'm pleased to highlight the strong broad-based ESM license bookings performance across all major geographies and product disciplines.
Turning to the MSM business unit, we believe MSM is best evaluated on the basis of total and annualized bookings over the trailing 12 months. As Bob mentioned before, MSM remains a lumpy business. Since bookings for our MSM business are tied largely to the timing and size of renewals, MSM bookings can vary widely from quarter to quarter. Total MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis increased 15% to $794 million. The average contract length of 3.03 years increased 6%.  After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were $262 million, up 8% from the year-ago period. For fiscal 2011, we expect low to mid-single digit growth in MSM total bookings on a constant currency basis.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $461 million, up 2% from $450 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 on both a reported and constant currency basis.  
License revenue in the first quarter was $171 million, an increase of 3% from $167 million a year ago.  During the quarter, the large increase in the license bookings deferral rate negatively impacted license revenue by approximately $24 million compared to the deferral rate a year ago. ESM license revenue was $113 million, up 18% from $96 million in the year-ago period. The ESM license bookings deferral rate was 32%, a 10 percentage point increase over the last year.
MSM license revenue decreased by 18% from $71 million to $58 million. This is mainly due to a 45 percentage point increase in MSM's license bookings deferral rate, which was driven by an increase in the percentage of time-based or term transactions.  The first quarter of fiscal 2011 is more reflective of our typical seasonality for license bookings deferral rate as we had an abnormally low deferral rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
For the first quarter, maintenance revenue was $254 million, an increase of 1% from the year-ago period. ESM maintenance revenue was $137 million, up 2%, and MSM maintenance revenue was $117 million, relatively flat compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
We expect maintenance revenue to grow sequentially in the second quarter. As Bob mentioned, we continue to make improvements in our Professional Services organization. Professional services revenue, which is included in our ESM business unit, increased 13% to $36 million and our professional services operating margin generated a profit of $1 million versus a loss a year ago.
Moving next to operating expenses. We remain committed to our disciplined approach to managing our expense structure, focusing on ways to maximize our efficiency and leverage our infrastructure. During the first quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $304 million, up 1% from $302 million in the year-ago period. It is important to note that we capitalized more software development costs than in the year-ago period.
Looking at our business units, ESM's operating expenses were $221 million, flat compared to the year-ago period. MSM operating expenses were $84 million, up 3% from $81 million in the year-ago period. 
As for other income, we had a $5.5 million loss in other income compared to a $0.7 million loss a year ago. On a year-over-year basis, this negatively impacted non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.02.
Turning now to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the first quarter was $588 million, down 6% sequentially from $624 million as of March 31, 2010. The sequential change follows our typical seasonality. During the quarter, we deferred $59 million of license revenue, or 44% of license bookings, and recognized $94 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet.  Total deferred revenue decreased by $18 million sequentially to $1.8 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 55% of total deferred revenue.
Our software development costs were $160 million, up 10% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, as we capitalized $32 million and amortized $18 million. This increase was driven by the scope and timing of several key product releases expected in the September quarter.
At the end of the quarter, cash and investments totaled $1.5 billion, and our net cash position was $1.1 billion. For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $167 million, up 8% from $155 million in the year-ago period. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by $6 million due to the year-over-year change and finance payables on the balance sheet.  DSOs in the quarter dropped sequentially to 47 days, down from 60 days in March. 
During the quarter, we remained committed to our existing share repurchase program. We repurchased 4 million shares of our stock for a total cost of $149 million. We now have $921 million remaining in our current share repurchase program.
Finally, as further validation of our strong financial position, both Standard & Poor's and Moody's upgraded their ratings on BMC last week. Standard & Poor's raised BMC's corporate credit and senior unsecured rating to BBB+ from BBB. As rationale, they cited BMC's good operating performance during the recent IT downturn, our conservative leverage and strong free cash flow generation. Moody's upgraded BMC to Baa2 from Baa3 and cited BMC's strong operating and financial performance throughout the recent downturn, our success in growing and improving the profitability of our non-mainframe business and Moody's view that the outlook for our IT management software products is favorable.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his concluding remarks."

Given our first quarter results, we are on track to meet our fiscal 2011 expectations. The combination of an improving economy, better prospects for IT spending, strong market demand, our leading market position and our solid start to fiscal 2011 underlie our view. To reiterate what we provided in May, for the full year, we expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.84 to $2.94. At the midpoint, this would represent a 9% increase over last fiscal year.
Our non-GAAP diluted EPS estimate excludes an estimated range of $0.71 to $0.76 per share for non-GAAP adjustments, including share-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets, severance, exit costs and related charges, as well as the related tax impacts of these items and certain discrete tax items.
The assumptions underlying this full year fiscal 2011 estimate include: total bookings and revenue growth in the mid-single digits; continued improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin; a slight increase in the license bookings deferral rate; slight bookings hurt due to currency that negatively impacts growth rate by one point more than what we assumed in May; other income estimated to be $10 million lower than a year ago, reflecting current market conditions; weighted shares outstanding similar to the prior year; and a non-GAAP tax rate of 26% to 27%.

And we look at ourselves and we do think that it probably had a little bit of a stalling effect on some mainframe transactions. Not so much for any negative reason, just that customers wanted to see -- they're assuming they're going to get a new box. They want to know what the capacity of the new box will be before they negotiate a new agreement, so that they make sure that they have in the negotiation the proper number of NIPS and the proper capacity. So I think that the -- kind of the overhang of the announcement caused a little more slowing of transactions than we typically would have seen. But it was not a big number, but we did see that.

So that quarter did not spike. We actually saw a very solid long-term number we can live with there that was better than our internal plan. And we saw our productivity continue to really -- if you look at those booking numbers, the license bookings of ESM soaring 40% year-over-year, obviously the bookings, and the license bookings productivity per head is up significantly. And the headcount, we do expect to achieve our 20% growth in productive tenured sales people, which means they're already on board and the incremental are coming into the productive part of their tenure with the company."

We're now over 100 customers through that OEM relationship, which if you kind of take their numbers and ours, it shows a reasonable attach rate, particularly considering the fact that it's such a large number of the boxes that are shipping, are shipping are proof of concepts. There's also a lot of mid-market being shipped too, et cetera. And what we really offer are industrial-strength automation for a production environment. So we're going to be a lagging indicator of success for that platform, not a leading indicator. We're going to be brought in once the proof of concepts go into production, once the production goes to scale. So I think you can say that where we are is a reasonable success. Now what I'll add is that what that's really though created is a significant change in the relationship of how we work together on large transactions, how we work together on cloud transactions, on much more than just the OEM agreement of the particular product, but really almost the entire Cloud Lifecycle Management product from BMC are now being brought into many, many deals, some of which we would have not been in at all had it not been for our relationship and others we've helped them into. So I think that the relationship is continuing to improve and the opportunity expands well beyond the OEM agreement.  One thing I just mention is that, and I certainly understand the many questions we had today on the mainframe, today mainframe represents about 1/3 of BMC. Our growth engines are the BSM initiative, the virtualization and the cloud initiatives, the Software-as-a-Service initiatives that we have been and that the employees of this company have been working on so diligently now since 2003 when we announced it, which is now the other 2/3 of our business, really just put in some phenomenal growth. This 40% year-over-year license growth in ESM is really something exceptional. And I just want to just pause a second and congratulate the ESM organization for that. Double-digit growth across all product lines, across all geographies, a doubling in the number of transactions, $500,000 to  $1 million in increase in the ASPs, being ahead in sales capacity, seeing strong growth in productivity and seeing 15 brand new Software-as-a-Service customers with products that we didn't even have 90 days ago are all really good indicators of our core growth engine that is our BSM strategy. And our ESM sales team and R&D teams and support teams deserve a lot of credit. So I'd just like to end with that as I believe, if I'm not mistaken, Kelly, we have no further questions."

I'm very pleased to say that BMC Software is starting out fiscal 2011 with robust year-over-year growth and a solid overall performance. We grew total bookings by 14%. We had the highest percentage increase in total license bookings in the past six quarters. We grew ESM license bookings by 40%, the highest percentage increase in the past six quarters, a strong leading indicator of customer adoption and market growth.
MSM total annualized bookings for the trailing 12 months increased 8%. Cash flow from operations was $167 million, an increase of 8%. Total revenue for the quarter was $461 million, up 2%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 34%, up one percentage point.  And non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 5% to $0.62 per share. 
Our financial position remains strong as evidenced by our solid balance sheet. We had $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $1.8 billion in deferred revenue at the end of the quarter. That's a snapshot of our overall performance. Given our solid first quarter results and our current outlook, we are on track to achieve our fiscal 2011 expectations.
Let me turn next to discuss key developments in our ESM and MSM business units during the quarter. First and foremost, ESM license bookings increased 40% from the year-ago quarter. We continue to see momentum in ESM license bookings, which over the past nine months have grown 13% over the respective period of a year ago.
We had a number of significant wins during the quarter that demonstrated our continued strength in selling the BSM platform. In fact, we had 14 ESM license transactions with over $1 million in bookings, up from 11 license transactions a year ago. We had a number of large ESM platform wins, including Computer Sciences Corporation, Sanofi-Aventis Group, Servicio de Administracion Tributaria of Mexico and Tata Consulting Services. 
We saw multiple wins in the U.S. federal sector. These include the Marine Corps Systems Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the United States Central Command. 
It's not only the growth in large deals, but the mix of our ESM wins that underscores our momentum. The number of ESM license transactions between $500,000 and $1 million increased by over 50% compared to a year ago. That's the fourth straight quarter in which we have seen deals in this range increase by double-digit percentage. And we also saw our average selling price continue to grow.
Looking at our global performance, we generated solid double-digit ESM license bookings growth in all major geographies. Not only did we have strong geographic performance, but we also had strong double-digit license bookings growth across all of our product disciplines within the ESM business. Six of the top 10 license deals were multi-disciplined license transactions, while five of those included all product disciplines.  This reflects the success of our ongoing realignment of our ESM sales team. 
Our Service Automation and Atrium Configuration Management Database solutions continue to lead the way for us. Our Automation offerings had a particularly strong quarter and continue to be a significant advantage that differentiates us from the competition.  This demonstrates our ability to successfully integrate and leverage key technologies that we acquire. I'm referring in particular to BladeLogic. But this also holds true for our three largest transactions over the past two years, which have performed extremely well by fueling strong growth within our ESM business unit. We're continuing to see robust demand for our Atrium CMDB, which we believe is a leading indicator of the opportunity ahead to drive larger more strategic platform wins.  We also had strong growth in our Service Assurance and Service Support product disciplines. 
BMC has been focused on leveraging the strength of its unified, integrated management platform, investing in extending and enhancing it to enable the management of next-generation IT environments and speed the adoption of cloud computing. Unlike other vendors, BMC's cloud strategy allows customers to achieve the benefits of Cloud, reduced cost and improved efficiency, without introducing new silos, disrupting IT operations or forcing a vendor lock-in for hardware, services or a virtualization platform.
Looking at the number of companies that visited our Executive Briefing Center over the past year, it is evident that our customers are choosing to standardize on our IT management platform as they look to IT to strategically enable their business growth. Our partner ecosystem around the BSM platform also continues to develop. We're increasingly teaming with industry leaders such as Accenture, Cisco, Dell and salesforce.com in comprehensive cloud and BSM platform sales opportunities and implementations. These strong partnerships underscore the strength of BMC's competitive advantage in the IT Management Software business for both enterprise and service providers.
In terms of cloud solutions, I'm very proud to say that over the past year, BMC has won 25 large proof of concept and technical design shootouts for virtualization and cloud management at some of the largest enterprises in the world. BMC also has been selected by five of the top 20 telecom companies as their standard platform for virtualization and cloud management. And in the last two quarters, two of the top systems integrators have selected BMC Software as their strategic management provider for their hosted services.
We believe that significant potential lies ahead of us in this area. We're continuing to invest in and launch new offerings to capture that opportunity. Our BMC Cloud Lifecycle Management solution is now available globally. This solution is part of our Cloud Service Management portfolio, which unlike other offerings from other IT vendors, manages a broad combination of hardware, software and virtualization offerings. This enables customers to rapidly achieve success with their cloud initiatives, gives them choices about which current and future technologies to use and allows them to continue to derive value from their existing IT environments. This strategic approach has been validated by numerous enterprises and service provider customers, affirming that our approach is sound. As the market for cloud solutions grows, we anticipate seeing increased demand for our solutions in the area of Cloud Planning, Cloud Lifecycle Management, Cloud Operations and Cloud Governance, especially IT Service Costing. 
One thing in particular that I'd like to highlight is that our customers frequently view cloud computing as a catalyst for improving their IT maturity; that the introduction of new technology brings with it the requirement to also transform their IT operations along the principles of Business Service Management.
This is why we were so excited about the cloud market, and about how BMC can really shine. To augment these cloud solutions, we also plan on enhancing our Software-as-a-Service offerings over the next several quarters, capitalizing on customer interest in this expanding market. Our platform is winning significant support from customers, partners and service providers. For example, we gained 51 new customers for our IT Service Management offerings this past quarter. This reflects in part our efforts to broaden our footprint and distribution capabilities. 
We're also very encouraged that we had 15 wins for our SaaS offerings during the first quarter of general availability. Our SaaS initiatives include both our BMC Remedy On Demand solution, which enables customers to access our industry-leading service management offering as a service, and our BMC ServiceDesk on Force.com solution.  Key BMC Remedy On Demand wins included Citrix Online, St. Jude's Medical, Children's National Medical Center, Moffitt Cancer Center and Health Care Partners. Our strategic partnership with salesforce.com is off to a great start as we see customers rapidly adopting BMC's ServiceDesk on Force.com. 
During the quarter, we added a number of new companies through this offering, including Advanced Infrastructure Management, Emmanuel College and Creative Information Technologies, Incorporated.  Further strengthening the strategic alliance between the two companies, salesforce.com will begin this quarter reselling BMC's ServiceDesk on Force.com to accelerate the momentum for cloud-based IT service management integrated with their Sales Cloud 2, Service Cloud 2 and Chatter Collaboration Cloud. Through our resell agreement with salesforce.com, we are making it easier than ever to customers to simplify and automate their IT operations.
In addition to having the best technology, another way in which we're determined to gain a competitive advantage is by helping enterprise customers get the most value out of our offerings. That's why we're working to strengthen and expand our Professional Services organization. We began this current initiative in fiscal 2010, and it will remain a priority during fiscal 2011. While it's still early in the process, we're pleased with the results in the first quarter. Professional Services bookings and revenue increased significantly. Utilization rates rose, and our Professional Services business returned to profitability.
We're also seeing a positive impact from our efforts to strengthen our ESM sales organization. Our goal here is to broaden our footprint and our ability to build C-level relationships. The evidence indicates that our strategy is working. During the quarter, the average number of tenured sales reps increased from the prior year. At the same time, these tenured reps increased their productivity on a year-over-year basis. We are ahead of plan on the number of productive heads, and we expect the average number of tenured reps to increase over 20% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010.
Let me turn now to our MSM business. As you know, this business can be lumpy from a booking standpoint because of the timing of renewals. Total MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis increased 15%, up from a 10% increase last quarter. It's also important to look at MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis after normalizing for differences in contract length. On that basis, MSM annualized bookings increased 8%. During the quarter, we increased the MSM install base by adding 15 new customers. We also saw 54 existing customers renew and increase their relationship with us by adding new products to their existing portfolio. Some of these major MSM wins include Federal Express, Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase, Aurora Healthcare and Telefonica de Espana.
Once again, we had a solid increase in the annual run rate for our top 15 MSM transactions, driven by significant competitive wins at key accounts. This is the 13th consecutive quarter where we have seen an increase in the run rate of our largest transactions. Our MSM business continues to lead the mainframe management market in terms of innovation and execution. 
During the first quarter, we announced new mainframe cost-optimization capabilities. We also recently released a new mainframe product for IMS, the leading transactional and hierarchical database management system for the IBM System z mainframe. 
BMC has been providing innovative IMS solutions since 1982 and has hundreds of IMS customers worldwide, including some of the world's largest financial and IT service providers. 
So to summarize our fiscal 2011 first quarter, we had robust bookings growth across key product offerings and geographies. We're continue to lead our market in terms of both vision and technology. The technology trends driving our markets, such as cloud computing, virtualization and Software-as-a-Service, represent a strengthening tailwind that is propelling BMC forward. I'll talk more about our current outlook for fiscal 2011 later in the call. 
Before I turn the call over to Steve Solcher, I would like to highlight two additions to our team. Steve James and Mark Hawkins joined BMC's Board of Directors in May. Both Steve and Mark bring years of senior executive experience in the technology  industry to our board. 
Now Steve Solcher will provide more insight into our financial results. Steve?

Before I take you through our financial results, there are a few points I'd like to underscore about our performance. I'm pleased with our solid first quarter performance and start to our fiscal year. We had",1723,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon to all of you. Before I take you through our financial results, there are a few points I'd like to underscore about our performance. I'm pleased with our solid first quarter performance and start to our fiscal year. We had strong total bookings growth in ESM license bookings growth. Our ESM business demonstrated significant broad-based growth across key product lines and geographies, while increasing its operating margin year-over-year by seven percentage points.
We grew revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share despite the negative impact of a significant year-over-year increase in the deferral rate of our license bookings, which I will discuss later, and we grew our cash flow from operations by 8%.  Our financial position remains strong as demonstrated by our solid balance sheet and recent ratings upgrades by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's. 
It's important to point out that license revenues were negatively impacted by an unusual year-over-year difference in the ratable rate of our license bookings. You can see this difference on Slide 9 of our conference call presentation where we provide additional visibility on ratability by license bookings overall and for each of our business units.  License bookings ratability increased from an unusually low 26% in the year-ago quarter to 44% in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. On a business unit basis, license bookings deferral rate increased 10 percentage points for our ESM business and 45 percentage points for our MSM business.
We are pleased that our key business initiatives which we have discussed with you in recent quarters are proving successful. Our efforts to strengthen and expand our sales force are showing progress and momentum. Although still early, we are now seeing signs of traction in our Professional Services organization, and we remain committed to maintaining our customary financial discipline. All of these initiatives reflect our strategy to invest in our business in a disciplined way to build value for customers and shareholders.
With that, let me turn to our financial results for the quarter. 
In the first quarter, non-GAAP operating income increased by 6% from $148 million to $157 million. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 34% this quarter, up one percentage point over the last year.  
Please refer to Slide 5 for our highlights of our ESM and MSM business unit operating results. In the first quarter, operating income of our ESM business unit increased 55% to $66 million from $42 million in the year-ago period. ESM's operating margin increased year-over-year by seven percentage points to 23%. We remain pleased with the continued improvement and profitability of our ESM business. 
MSM's operating income decreased by 14% to $91 million from $106 million, and its operating margin decreased by four percentage points to 52%.  MSM's financial performance on a year-over-year basis reflects the significant increase in MSM's license bookings deferral rate. 
Our non-GAAP net earnings for the first quarter were $114 million, an increase of 3% from $111 million in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the period was $0.62, up 5% from $0.59 in the year-ago period. This reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 25%. These non-GAAP results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter of $184 million versus $188 million in the year-ago period.
GAAP operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $108 million, flat compared to the year-ago period. GAAP net income and diluted EPS were $93 million and $0.50 compared to $82 million and $0.44 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.  First quarter GAAP net earnings were positively impacted by a $14 million income tax benefit recorded in connection with the settlement with a taxing authority related to prior years' tax matters. This benefit was excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Turning now to bookings. In the first quarter, total bookings of $443 million were up 14% from $390 million in the year-ago period. On a constant currency basis, first quarter bookings increased 16%. Total license bookings for the quarter increased 27% year-over-year to $135 million. On a constant currency basis, first quarter license bookings increased 31%.
Total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were $2 billion, up 12% compared to the year-ago period. The weighted-average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.19 years, up 7% from 2.05 years in the year-ago period.
After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the first quarter were $911 million, up 4% from the year-ago period. Please refer to Slide 7 in our presentation.
Now let me turn to the performance of each of our business units. For our ESM business unit, growth in license bookings is the best measure of performance. ESM license bookings were $101 million in the first quarter, up 40% from $73 million in the year-ago period. I'm pleased to highlight the strong broad-based ESM license bookings performance across all major geographies and product disciplines.
Turning to the MSM business unit, we believe MSM is best evaluated on the basis of total and annualized bookings over the trailing 12 months. As Bob mentioned before, MSM remains a lumpy business. Since bookings for our MSM business are tied largely to the timing and size of renewals, MSM bookings can vary widely from quarter to quarter. Total MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis increased 15% to $794 million. The average contract length of 3.03 years increased 6%.  After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were $262 million, up 8% from the year-ago period. For fiscal 2011, we expect low to mid-single digit growth in MSM total bookings on a constant currency basis.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $461 million, up 2% from $450 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 on both a reported and constant currency basis.  
License revenue in the first quarter was $171 million, an increase of 3% from $167 million a year ago.  During the quarter, the large increase in the license bookings deferral rate negatively impacted license revenue by approximately $24 million compared to the deferral rate a year ago. ESM license revenue was $113 million, up 18% from $96 million in the year-ago period. The ESM license bookings deferral rate was 32%, a 10 percentage point increase over the last year.
MSM license revenue decreased by 18% from $71 million to $58 million. This is mainly due to a 45 percentage point increase in MSM's license bookings deferral rate, which was driven by an increase in the percentage of time-based or term transactions.  The first quarter of fiscal 2011 is more reflective of our typical seasonality for license bookings deferral rate as we had an abnormally low deferral rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
For the first quarter, maintenance revenue was $254 million, an increase of 1% from the year-ago period. ESM maintenance revenue was $137 million, up 2%, and MSM maintenance revenue was $117 million, relatively flat compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
We expect maintenance revenue to grow sequentially in the second quarter. As Bob mentioned, we continue to make improvements in our Professional Services organization. Professional services revenue, which is included in our ESM business unit, increased 13% to $36 million and our professional services operating margin generated a profit of $1 million versus a loss a year ago.
Moving next to operating expenses. We remain committed to our disciplined approach to managing our expense structure, focusing on ways to maximize our efficiency and leverage our infrastructure. During the first quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $304 million, up 1% from $302 million in the year-ago period. It is important to note that we capitalized more software development costs than in the year-ago period.
Looking at our business units, ESM's operating expenses were $221 million, flat compared to the year-ago period. MSM operating expenses were $84 million, up 3% from $81 million in the year-ago period. 
As for other income, we had a $5.5 million loss in other income compared to a $0.7 million loss a year ago. On a year-over-year basis, this negatively impacted non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.02.
Turning now to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the first quarter was $588 million, down 6% sequentially from $624 million as of March 31, 2010. The sequential change follows our typical seasonality. During the quarter, we deferred $59 million of license revenue, or 44% of license bookings, and recognized $94 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet.  Total deferred revenue decreased by $18 million sequentially to $1.8 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 55% of total deferred revenue.
Our software development costs were $160 million, up 10% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, as we capitalized $32 million and amortized $18 million. This increase was driven by the scope and timing of several key product releases expected in the September quarter.
At the end of the quarter, cash and investments totaled $1.5 billion, and our net cash position was $1.1 billion. For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $167 million, up 8% from $155 million in the year-ago period. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by $6 million due to the year-over-year change and finance payables on the balance sheet.  DSOs in the quarter dropped sequentially to 47 days, down from 60 days in March. 
During the quarter, we remained committed to our existing share repurchase program. We repurchased 4 million shares of our stock for a total cost of $149 million. We now have $921 million remaining in our current share repurchase program.
Finally, as further validation of our strong financial position, both Standard & Poor's and Moody's upgraded their ratings on BMC last week. Standard & Poor's raised BMC's corporate credit and senior unsecured rating to BBB+ from BBB. As rationale, they cited BMC's good operating performance during the recent IT downturn, our conservative leverage and strong free cash flow generation. Moody's upgraded BMC to Baa2 from Baa3 and cited BMC's strong operating and financial performance throughout the recent downturn, our success in growing and improving the profitability of our non-mainframe business and Moody's view that the outlook for our IT management software products is favorable.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his concluding remarks.

Given our first quarter results, we are on track to meet our fiscal 2011 expectations. The combination of an improving economy, better prospects for IT spending, strong market demand, our leading market position and our solid start to fiscal 2011 underlie our view. To reiterate what we provided in May, for the full year, we expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.84 to $2.94. At the midpoint, this would represent a 9% increase over last fiscal year.
Our non-GAAP diluted EPS estimate excludes an estimated range of $0.71 to $0.76 per share for non-GAAP adjustments, including share-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets, severance, exit costs and related charges, as well as the related tax impacts of these items and certain discrete tax items.
The assumptions underlying this full year fiscal 2011 estimate include: total bookings and revenue growth in the mid-single digits; continued improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin; a slight increase in the license bookings deferral rate; slight bookings hurt due to currency that negatively impacts growth rate by one point more than what we assumed in May; other income estimated to be $10 million lower than a year ago, reflecting current market conditions; weighted shares outstanding similar to the prior year; and a non-GAAP tax rate of 26% to 27%. 
We expect full year fiscal 2011 cash flow from operations to be between $660 million and $710 million.  With that, we'll now turn the call over to questions. Operator?

Our President of our MSM business unit was actually on stage with the IBM executives the day of the launch in London. And we were one of the few vendors that were there actually as part of that rollout. So we're excited about the machine and about the impact it will have on the market. And we look at ourselves and we do think that it probably had a little bit of a stalling effect on some mainframe transactions. Not so much for any negative reason, just that customers wanted to see -- they're assuming they're going to get a new box. They want to know what the capacity of the new box will be before they negotiate a new agreement, so that they make sure that they have in the negotiation the proper number of NIPS and the proper capacity. So I think that the -- kind of the overhang of the announcement caused a little more slowing of transactions than we typically would have seen. But it was not a big number, but we did see that. But on the whole, we think it will be a positive now that the machine is starting to ship.

I think in bookings, the only fairness that I would caution you on is just think about it on a per annum basis, so adjusted for contract length. So on a per annum basis, when you start looking at it, especially if you kind of stretch the period out a little bit, you're going to get to growth rates on a TTM basis per annum that are going to approximate revenue growth.

We're now over 100 customers through that OEM relationship, which if you kind of take their numbers and ours, it shows a reasonable attach rate, particularly considering the fact that it's such a large number of the boxes that are shipping, are shipping are proof of concepts. There's also a lot of mid-market being shipped too, et cetera. And what we really offer are industrial-strength automation for a production environment. So we're going to be a lagging indicator of success for that platform, not a leading indicator. We're going to be brought in once the proof of concepts go into production, once the production goes to scale. So I think you can say that where we are is a reasonable success. Now what I'll add is that what that's really though created is a significant change in the relationship of how we work together on large transactions, how we work together on cloud transactions, on much more than just the OEM agreement of the particular product, but really almost the entire Cloud Lifecycle Management product from BMC are now being brought into many, many deals, some of which we would have not been in at all had it not been for our relationship and others we've helped them into. So I think that the relationship is continuing to improve and the opportunity expands well beyond the OEM agreement.  One thing I just mention is that, and I certainly understand the many questions we had today on the mainframe, today mainframe represents about 1/3 of BMC. Our growth engines are the BSM initiative, the virtualization and the cloud initiatives, the Software-as-a-Service initiatives that we have been and that the employees of this company have been working on so diligently now since 2003 when we announced it, which is now the other 2/3 of our business, really just put in some phenomenal growth. This 40% year-over-year license growth in ESM is really something exceptional. And I just want to just pause a second and congratulate the ESM organization for that. Double-digit growth across all product lines, across all geographies, a doubling in the number of transactions, $500,000 to  $1 million in increase in the ASPs, being ahead in sales capacity, seeing strong growth in productivity and seeing 15 brand new Software-as-a-Service customers with products that we didn't even have 90 days ago are all really good indicators of our core growth engine that is our BSM strategy. And our ESM sales team and R&D teams and support teams deserve a lot of credit. So I'd just like to end with that as I believe, if I'm not mistaken, Kelly, we have no further questions.

I'm very pleased to say that BMC Software is starting out fiscal 2011 with robust year-over-year growth and a solid overall performance. We grew total bookings by 14%. We had the highest percentage increase in total license bookings in the past six quarters. We grew ESM license bookings by 40%, the highest percentage increase in the past six quarters, a strong leading indicator of customer adoption and market growth.
MSM total annualized bookings for the trailing 12 months increased 8%. Cash flow from operations was $167 million, an increase of 8%. Total revenue for the quarter was $461 million, up 2%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 34%, up one percentage point.  And non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 5% to $0.62 per share. 
Our financial position remains strong as evidenced by our solid balance sheet. We had $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $1.8 billion in deferred revenue at the end of the quarter. That's a snapshot of our overall performance. Given our solid first quarter results and our current outlook, we are on track to achieve our fiscal 2011 expectations.
Let me turn next to discuss key developments in our ESM and MSM business units during the quarter. First and foremost, ESM license bookings increased 40% from the year-ago quarter. We continue to see momentum in ESM license bookings, which over the past nine months have grown 13% over the respective period of a year ago.
We had a number of significant wins during the quarter that demonstrated our continued strength in selling the BSM platform. In fact, we had 14 ESM license transactions with over $1 million in bookings, up from 11 license transactions a year ago. We had a number of large ESM platform wins, including Computer Sciences Corporation, Sanofi-Aventis Group, Servicio de Administracion Tributaria of Mexico and Tata Consulting Services [Tata Consultancy Services]. 
We saw multiple wins in the U.S. federal sector. These include the Marine Corps Systems Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the United States Central Command. 
It's not only the growth in large deals, but the mix of our ESM wins that underscores our momentum. The number of ESM license transactions between $500,000 and $1 million increased by over 50% compared to a year ago. That's the fourth straight quarter in which we have seen deals in this range increase by double-digit percentage. And we also saw our average selling price continue to grow.
Looking at our global performance, we generated solid double-digit ESM license bookings growth in all major geographies. Not only did we have strong geographic performance, but we also had strong double-digit license bookings growth across all of our product disciplines within the ESM business. Six of the top 10 license deals were multi-disciplined license transactions, while five of those included all product disciplines.  This reflects the success of our ongoing realignment of our ESM sales team. 
Our Service Automation and Atrium Configuration Management Database solutions continue to lead the way for us. Our Automation offerings had a particularly strong quarter and continue to be a significant advantage that differentiates us from the competition.  This demonstrates our ability to successfully integrate and leverage key technologies that we acquire. I'm referring in particular to BladeLogic. But this also holds true for our three largest transactions over the past two years, which have performed extremely well by fueling strong growth within our ESM business unit. We're continuing to see robust demand for our Atrium CMDB, which we believe is a leading indicator of the opportunity ahead to drive larger more strategic platform wins.  We also had strong growth in our Service Assurance and Service Support product disciplines. 
BMC has been focused on leveraging the strength of its unified, integrated management platform, investing in extending and enhancing it to enable the management of next-generation IT environments and speed the adoption of cloud computing. Unlike other vendors, BMC's cloud strategy allows customers to achieve the benefits of cloud, reduced cost and improved efficiency, without introducing new silos, disrupting IT operations or forcing a vendor lock-in for hardware, services or a virtualization platform.
Looking at the number of companies that visited our Executive Briefing Center over the past year, it is evident that our customers are choosing to standardize on our IT management platform as they look to IT to strategically enable their business growth. Our partner ecosystem around the BSM platform also continues to develop. We're increasingly teaming with industry leaders such as Accenture, Cisco, Dell and salesforce.com in comprehensive cloud and BSM platform sales opportunities and implementations. These strong partnerships underscore the strength of BMC's competitive advantage in the IT Management Software business for both enterprise and service providers.
In terms of cloud solutions, I'm very proud to say that over the past year, BMC has won 25 large proof of concept and technical design shootouts for virtualization and cloud management at some of the largest enterprises in the world. BMC also has been selected by five of the top 20 telecom companies as their standard platform for virtualization and cloud management. And in the last two quarters, two of the top systems integrators have selected BMC Software as their strategic management provider for their hosted services.
We believe that significant potential lies ahead of us in this area. We're continuing to invest in and launch new offerings to capture that opportunity. Our BMC Cloud Lifecycle Management solution is now available globally. This solution is part of our Cloud Service Management portfolio, which unlike other offerings from other IT vendors made broad combination of hardware, software and virtualization offerings. This enables customers to rapidly achieve success with their cloud initiatives, gives them choices about which current and future technologies to use and allows them to continue to derive value from their existing IT environments. This strategic approach has been validated by numerous enterprises and service provider customers, affirming that our approach is sound. As the market for cloud solutions grows, we anticipate seeing increased demand for our solutions in the area of Cloud Planning, Cloud Lifecycle Management, Cloud Operations and Cloud Governance, especially IT Service Costing. 
One thing in particular that I'd like to highlight is that our customers frequently view cloud computing as a catalyst for improving their IT maturity; that the introduction of new technology brings with it the requirement to also transform their IT operations along the principles of Business Service Management.
This is why we were so excited about the cloud market, and about how BMC can really shine. To augment these cloud solutions, we also plan on enhancing our Software-as-a-Service offerings over the next several quarters, capitalizing on customer interest in this expanding market. Our platform is winning significant support from customers, partners and service providers. For example, we gained 51 new customers for our IT Service Management offerings this past quarter. This reflects in part our efforts to broaden our footprint and distribution capabilities. 
We're also very encouraged that we had 15 wins for our SaaS offerings during the first quarter of general availability. Our SaaS initiatives include both our BMC Remedy On Demand solution, which enables customers to access our industry leading service management offering as a service, and our BMC ServiceDesk on Force.com solution.  Key BMC Remedy On Demand wins included Citrix Online, St. Jude's Medical, Children's National Medical Center, Moffitt Cancer Center and Health Care Partners. Our strategic partnership with salesforce.com is off to a great start as we see customers rapidly adopting BMC's ServiceDesk on Force.com. 
During the quarter, we added a number of new companies through this offering, including Advanced Infrastructure Management, Emmanuel College and Creative Information Technologies, Inc. [Creative Information Technology, Inc.] Further strengthening the strategic alliance between the two companies, salesforce.com will begin this quarter reselling BMC's ServiceDesk on Force.com to accelerate the momentum for cloud-based IT service management integrated with their Sales Cloud 2, Service Cloud 2 and Chatter Collaboration Cloud. Through our resell agreement with salesforce.com, we are making it easier than ever for customers to simplify and automate their IT operations.
In addition to having the best technology, another way in which we're determined to gain a competitive advantage is by helping enterprise customers get the most value out of our offerings. That's why we're working to strengthen and expand our Professional Services organization. We began this current initiative in fiscal 2010, and it will remain a priority during fiscal 2011. While it's still early in the process, we're pleased with the results in the first quarter. Professional Services bookings and revenue increased significantly. Utilization rates rose, and our Professional Services business returned to profitability.
We're also seeing a positive impact from our efforts to strengthen our ESM sales organization. Our goal here is to broaden our footprint and our ability to build C-level relationships. The evidence indicates that our strategy is working. During the quarter, the average number of tenured sales reps increased from the prior year. At the same time, these tenured reps increased their productivity on a year-over-year basis. We are ahead of plan on the number of productive heads, and we expect the average number of tenured reps to increase over 20% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010.
Let me turn now to our MSM business. As you know, this business can be lumpy from a booking standpoint because of the timing of renewals. Total MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis increased 15%, up from a 10% increase last quarter. It's also important to look at MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis after normalizing for differences in contract length. On that basis, MSM annualized bookings increased 8%. During the quarter, we increased the MSM install base by adding 15 new customers. We also saw 54 existing customers renew and increase their relationship with us by adding new products to their existing portfolio. Some of these major MSM wins include Federal Express, Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase, Aurora Healthcare and Telefonica de Espana.
Once again, we had a solid increase in the annual run rate for our top 15 MSM transactions, driven by significant competitive wins at key accounts. This is the 13th consecutive quarter where we have seen an increase in the run rate of our largest transactions. Our MSM business continues to lead the mainframe management market in terms of innovation and execution. 
During the first quarter, we announced new mainframe cost-optimization capabilities. We also recently released a new mainframe product for IMS, the leading transactional and hierarchical database management system for the IBM System z mainframe. 
BMC has been providing innovative IMS solutions since 1982 and has hundreds of IMS customers worldwide, including some of the world's largest financial and IT service providers. 
So to summarize our fiscal 2011 first quarter, we had robust bookings growth across key product offerings and geographies. We're continue to lead our market in terms of both vision and technology. The technology trends driving our markets, such as cloud computing, virtualization and Software-as-a-Service, represent a strengthening tailwind that is propelling BMC forward. I'll talk more about our current outlook for fiscal 2011 later in the call. 
Before I turn the call over to Steve Solcher, I would like to highlight two additions to our team. Steve James and Mark Hawkins joined BMC's Board of Directors in May. Both Steve and Mark bring years of senior executive experience in the technology  industry to our board. 
Now Steve Solcher will provide more insight into our financial results. Steve?"

Before I take you through our financial results, there are a few points I'd like to underscore about our performance. I'm pleased with our solid first quarter performance and start to our fiscal year. We had",1723,"Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon to all of you. Before I take you through our financial results, there are a few points I'd like to underscore about our performance. I'm pleased with our solid first quarter performance and start to our fiscal year. We had strong total bookings growth in ESM license bookings growth. Our ESM business demonstrated significant broad-based growth across key product lines and geographies, while increasing its operating margin year-over-year by seven percentage points.
We grew revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share despite the negative impact of a significant year-over-year increase in the deferral rate of our license bookings, which I will discuss later, and we grew our cash flow from operations by 8%.  Our financial position remains strong as demonstrated by our solid balance sheet and recent ratings upgrades by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's. 
It's important to point out that license revenues were negatively impacted by an unusual year-over-year difference in the ratable rate of our license bookings. You can see this difference on Slide 9 of our conference call presentation where we provide additional visibility on ratability by license bookings overall and for each of our business units.  License bookings ratability increased from an unusually low 26% in the year-ago quarter to 44% in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. On a business unit basis, license bookings deferral rate increased 10 percentage points for our ESM business and 45 percentage points for our MSM business.
We are pleased that our key business initiatives which we have discussed with you in recent quarters are proving successful. Our efforts to strengthen and expand our sales force are showing progress and momentum. Although still early, we are now seeing signs of traction in our Professional Services organization, and we remain committed to maintaining our customary financial discipline. All of these initiatives reflect our strategy to invest in our business in a disciplined way to build value for customers and shareholders.
With that, let me turn to our financial results for the quarter. 
In the first quarter, non-GAAP operating income increased by 6% from $148 million to $157 million. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 34% this quarter, up one percentage point over the last year.  
Please refer to Slide 5 for our highlights of our ESM and MSM business unit operating results. In the first quarter, operating income of our ESM business unit increased 55% to $66 million from $42 million in the year-ago period. ESM's operating margin increased year-over-year by seven percentage points to 23%. We remain pleased with the continued improvement and profitability of our ESM business. 
MSM's operating income decreased by 14% to $91 million from $106 million, and its operating margin decreased by four percentage points to 52%.  MSM's financial performance on a year-over-year basis reflects the significant increase in MSM's license bookings deferral rate. 
Our non-GAAP net earnings for the first quarter were $114 million, an increase of 3% from $111 million in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the period was $0.62, up 5% from $0.59 in the year-ago period. This reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 25%. These non-GAAP results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter of $184 million versus $188 million in the year-ago period.
GAAP operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $108 million, flat compared to the year-ago period. GAAP net income and diluted EPS were $93 million and $0.50 compared to $82 million and $0.44 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.  First quarter GAAP net earnings were positively impacted by a $14 million income tax benefit recorded in connection with the settlement with a taxing authority related to prior years' tax matters. This benefit was excluded from our non-GAAP results.
Turning now to bookings. In the first quarter, total bookings of $443 million were up 14% from $390 million in the year-ago period. On a constant currency basis, first quarter bookings increased 16%. Total license bookings for the quarter increased 27% year-over-year to $135 million. On a constant currency basis, first quarter license bookings increased 31%.
Total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were $2 billion, up 12% compared to the year-ago period. The weighted-average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.19 years, up 7% from 2.05 years in the year-ago period.
After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the first quarter were $911 million, up 4% from the year-ago period. Please refer to Slide 7 in our presentation.
Now let me turn to the performance of each of our business units. For our ESM business unit, growth in license bookings is the best measure of performance. ESM license bookings were $101 million in the first quarter, up 40% from $73 million in the year-ago period. I'm pleased to highlight the strong broad-based ESM license bookings performance across all major geographies and product disciplines.
Turning to the MSM business unit, we believe MSM is best evaluated on the basis of total and annualized bookings over the trailing 12 months. As Bob mentioned before, MSM remains a lumpy business. Since bookings for our MSM business are tied largely to the timing and size of renewals, MSM bookings can vary widely from quarter to quarter. Total MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis increased 15% to $794 million. The average contract length of 3.03 years increased 6%.  After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were $262 million, up 8% from the year-ago period. For fiscal 2011, we expect low to mid-single digit growth in MSM total bookings on a constant currency basis.
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $461 million, up 2% from $450 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 on both a reported and constant currency basis.  
License revenue in the first quarter was $171 million, an increase of 3% from $167 million a year ago.  During the quarter, the large increase in the license bookings deferral rate negatively impacted license revenue by approximately $24 million compared to the deferral rate a year ago. ESM license revenue was $113 million, up 18% from $96 million in the year-ago period. The ESM license bookings deferral rate was 32%, a 10 percentage point increase over the last year.
MSM license revenue decreased by 18% from $71 million to $58 million. This is mainly due to a 45 percentage point increase in MSM's license bookings deferral rate, which was driven by an increase in the percentage of time-based or term transactions.  The first quarter of fiscal 2011 is more reflective of our typical seasonality for license bookings deferral rate as we had an abnormally low deferral rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
For the first quarter, maintenance revenue was $254 million, an increase of 1% from the year-ago period. ESM maintenance revenue was $137 million, up 2%, and MSM maintenance revenue was $117 million, relatively flat compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
We expect maintenance revenue to grow sequentially in the second quarter. As Bob mentioned, we continue to make improvements in our Professional Services organization. Professional services revenue, which is included in our ESM business unit, increased 13% to $36 million and our professional services operating margin generated a profit of $1 million versus a loss a year ago.
Moving next to operating expenses. We remain committed to our disciplined approach to managing our expense structure, focusing on ways to maximize our efficiency and leverage our infrastructure. During the first quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $304 million, up 1% from $302 million in the year-ago period. It is important to note that we capitalized more software development costs than in the year-ago period.
Looking at our business units, ESM's operating expenses were $221 million, flat compared to the year-ago period. MSM operating expenses were $84 million, up 3% from $81 million in the year-ago period. 
As for other income, we had a $5.5 million loss in other income compared to a $0.7 million loss a year ago. On a year-over-year basis, this negatively impacted non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.02.
Turning now to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the first quarter was $588 million, down 6% sequentially from $624 million as of March 31, 2010. The sequential change follows our typical seasonality. During the quarter, we deferred $59 million of license revenue, or 44% of license bookings, and recognized $94 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet.  Total deferred revenue decreased by $18 million sequentially to $1.8 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 55% of total deferred revenue.
Our software development costs were $160 million, up 10% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, as we capitalized $32 million and amortized $18 million. This increase was driven by the scope and timing of several key product releases expected in the September quarter.
At the end of the quarter, cash and investments totaled $1.5 billion, and our net cash position was $1.1 billion. For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $167 million, up 8% from $155 million in the year-ago period. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by $6 million due to the year-over-year change and finance payables on the balance sheet.  DSOs in the quarter dropped sequentially to 47 days, down from 60 days in March. 
During the quarter, we remained committed to our existing share repurchase program. We repurchased 4 million shares of our stock for a total cost of $149 million. We now have $921 million remaining in our current share repurchase program.
Finally, as further validation of our strong financial position, both Standard & Poor's and Moody's upgraded their ratings on BMC last week. Standard & Poor's raised BMC's corporate credit and senior unsecured rating to BBB+ from BBB. As rationale, they cited BMC's good operating performance during the recent IT downturn, our conservative leverage and strong free cash flow generation. Moody's upgraded BMC to Baa2 from Baa3 and cited BMC's strong operating and financial performance throughout the recent downturn, our success in growing and improving the profitability of our non-mainframe business and Moody's view that the outlook for our IT management software products is favorable.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his concluding remarks."

Given our first quarter results, we are on track to meet our fiscal 2011 expectations. The combination of an improving economy, better prospects for IT spending, strong market demand, our leading market position and our solid start to fiscal 2011 underlie our view. To reiterate what we provided in May, for the full year, we expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.84 to $2.94. At the midpoint, this would represent a 9% increase over last fiscal year.
Our non-GAAP diluted EPS estimate excludes an estimated range of $0.71 to $0.76 per share for non-GAAP adjustments, including share-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets, severance, exit costs and related charges, as well as the related tax impacts of these items and certain discrete tax items.
The assumptions underlying this full year fiscal 2011 estimate include: total bookings and revenue growth in the mid- single digits; continued improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin; a slight increase in the license bookings deferral rate; slight bookings hurt due to currency that negatively impacts growth rate by one point more than what we assumed in May; other income estimated to be $10 million lower than a year ago, reflecting current market conditions; weighted shares outstanding similar to the prior year; and a non-GAAP tax rate of 26% to 27%. 
We expect full year fiscal 2011 cash flow from operations to be between $660 million and $710 million.  With that, we'll now turn the call over to questions. Operator?"

And we were one of the few vendors that were there actually as part of that rollout. So we're excited about the machine and about the impact it will have on the market. And we look at ourselves and we do think that it probably had a little bit of a stalling effect on some mainframe transactions. Not so much for any negative reason, just that customers wanted to see -- they're assuming they're going to get a new box. They want to know what the capacity of the new box will be before they negotiate a new agreement, so that they make sure that they have in the negotiation the proper number of NIPS and the proper capacity. So I think that the -- kind of the overhang of the announcement caused a little more slowing of transactions than we typically would have seen. But it was not a big number, but we did see that. But on the whole, we think it will be a positive now that the machine is starting to ship."

We're now over 100 customers through that OEM relationship, which if you kind of take their numbers and ours, it shows a reasonable attach rate, particularly considering the fact that it's such a large number of the boxes that are shipping, are shipping are proof of concepts. There's also a lot of mid-market being shipped too, et cetera. And what we really offer are industrial-strength automation for a production environment. So we're going to be a lagging indicator of success for that platform, not a leading indicator. We're going to be brought in once the proof of concepts go into production, once the production goes to scale. So I think you can say that where we are is a reasonable success. Now what I'll add is that what that's really though created is a significant change in the relationship of how we work together on large transactions, how we work together on cloud transactions, on much more than just the OEM agreement of the particular product, but really almost the entire Cloud Lifecycle Management product from BMC are now being brought into many, many deals, some of which we would have not been in at all had it not been for our relationship and others we've helped them into. So I think that the relationship is continuing to improve and the opportunity expands well beyond the OEM agreement.  One thing I just mention is that, and I certainly understand the many questions we had today on the mainframe, today mainframe represents about 1/3 of BMC. Our growth engines are the BSM initiative, the virtualization and the cloud initiatives, the Software-as-a-Service initiatives that we have been and that the employees of this company have been working on so diligently now since 2003 when we announced it, which is now the other 2/3 of our business, really just put in some phenomenal growth. This 40% year-over-year license growth in ESM is really something exceptional. And I just want to just pause a second and congratulate the ESM organization for that. Double-digit growth across all product lines, across all geographies, a doubling in the number of transactions, $500,000 to  $1 million in increase in the ASPs, being ahead in sales capacity, seeing strong growth in productivity and seeing 15 brand new Software-as-a-Service customers with products that we didn't even have 90 days ago are all really good indicators of our core growth engine that is our BSM strategy. And our ESM sales team and R&D teams and support teams deserve a lot of credit. So I'd just like to end with that as I believe, if I'm not mistaken, Kelly, we have no further questions."

I'm very pleased to say that BMC Software is starting out fiscal 2011 with robust year-over-year growth and a solid overall performance. We grew total bookings by 14%. We had the highest percentage increase in total license bookings in the past six quarters. We grew ESM license bookings by 40%, the highest percentage increase in the past six quarters, a strong leading indicator of customer adoption and market growth.
 MSM total annualized bookings for the trailing 12 months increased 8%. Cash flow from operations was $167 million, an increase of 8%. Total revenue for the quarter was $461 million, up 2%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 34%, up one percentage point.  And non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 5% to $0.62 per share.
 Our financial position remains strong as evidenced by our solid balance sheet. We had $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $1.8 billion in deferred revenue at the end of the quarter. That's a snapshot of our overall performance. Given our solid first quarter results and our current outlook, we are on track to achieve our fiscal 2011 expectations.
 Let me turn next to discuss key developments in our ESM and MSM business units during the quarter. First and foremost, ESM license bookings increased 40% from the year-ago quarter. We continue to see momentum in ESM license bookings, which over the past nine months have grown 13% over the respective period of a year ago.
 We had a number of significant wins during the quarter that demonstrated our continued strength in selling the BSM platform. In fact, we had 14 ESM license transactions with over $1 million in bookings, up from 11 license transactions a year ago. We had a number of large ESM platform wins, including Computer Sciences Corporation, Sanofi-Aventis Group, Servicio de Administracion Tributaria of Mexico and Tata Consulting Services.
 We saw multiple wins in the U.S. federal sector. These include the Marine Corps Systems Command, the Defense Threat Reduction Agency and the United States Central Command.
 It's not only the growth in large deals, but the mix of our ESM wins that underscores our momentum. The number of ESM license transactions between $500,000 and $1 million increased by over 50% compared to a year ago. That's the fourth straight quarter in which we have seen deals in this range increase by double-digit percentage. And we also saw our average selling price continue to grow.
 Looking at our global performance, we generated solid double-digit ESM license bookings growth in all major geographies. Not only did we have strong geographic performance, but we also had strong double-digit license bookings growth across all of our product disciplines within the ESM business. Six of the top 10 license deals were multi-disciplined license transactions, while five of those included all product disciplines.  This reflects the success of our ongoing realignment of our ESM sales team.
 Our Service Automation and Atrium Configuration Management Database solutions continue to lead the way for us. Our Automation offerings had a particularly strong quarter and continue to be a significant advantage that differentiates us from the competition.  This demonstrates our ability to successfully integrate and leverage key technologies that we acquire. I'm referring in particular to BladeLogic. But this also holds true for our three largest transactions over the past two years, which have performed extremely well by fueling strong growth within our ESM business unit. We're continuing to see robust demand for our Atrium CMDB, which we believe is a leading indicator of the opportunity ahead to drive larger more strategic platform wins.  We also had strong growth in our Service Assurance and Service Support product disciplines.
 BMC has been focused on leveraging the strength of its unified, integrated management platform, investing in extending and enhancing it to enable the management of next-generation IT environments and speed the adoption of cloud computing. Unlike other vendors, BMC's cloud strategy allows customers to achieve the benefits of Cloud, reduced cost and improved efficiency, without introducing new silos, disrupting IT operations or forcing a vendor lock-in for hardware, services or a virtualization platform.
 Looking at the number of companies that visited our Executive Briefing Center over the past year, it is evident that our customers are choosing to standardize on our IT management platform as they look to IT to strategically enable their business growth. Our partner ecosystem around the BSM platform also continues to develop. We're increasingly teaming with industry leaders such as Accenture, Cisco, Dell and salesforce.com in comprehensive cloud and BSM platform sales opportunities and implementations. These strong partnerships underscore the strength of BMC's competitive advantage in the IT Management Software business for both enterprise and service providers.
 In terms of cloud solutions, I'm very proud to say that over the past year, BMC has won 25 large proof of concept and technical design shootouts for virtualization and cloud management at some of the largest enterprises in the world. BMC also has been selected by five of the top 20 telecom companies as their standard platform for virtualization and cloud management. And in the last two quarters, two of the top systems integrators have selected BMC Software as their strategic management provider for their hosted services.
 We believe that significant potential lies ahead of us in this area. We're continuing to invest in and launch new offerings to capture that opportunity. Our BMC Cloud Lifecycle Management solution is now available globally. This solution is part of our Cloud Service Management portfolio, which unlike other offerings from other IT vendors, manages a broad combination of hardware, software and virtualization offerings. This enables customers to rapidly achieve success with their cloud initiatives, gives them choices about which current and future technologies to use and allows them to continue to derive value from their existing IT environments. This strategic approach has been validated by numerous enterprises and service provider customers, affirming that our approach is sound. As the market for cloud solutions grows, we anticipate seeing increased demand for our solutions in the area of Cloud Planning, Cloud Lifecycle Management, Cloud Operations and Cloud Governance, especially IT Service Costing.
 One thing in particular that I'd like to highlight is that our customers frequently view cloud computing as a catalyst for improving their IT maturity; that the introduction of new technology brings with it the requirement to also transform their IT operations along the principles of Business Service Management.
 This is why we were so excited about the cloud market, and about how BMC can really shine. To augment these cloud solutions, we also plan on enhancing our Software-as-a-Service offerings over the next several quarters, capitalizing on customer interest in this expanding market. Our platform is winning significant support from customers, partners and service providers. For example, we gained 51 new customers for our IT Service Management offerings this past quarter. This reflects in part our efforts to broaden our footprint and distribution capabilities.
 We're also very encouraged that we had 15 wins for our SaaS offerings during the first quarter of general availability. Our SaaS initiatives include both our BMC Remedy On Demand solution, which enables customers to access our industry-leading service management offering as a service, and our BMC ServiceDesk on Force.com solution.  Key BMC Remedy On Demand wins included Citrix Online, St. Jude's Medical, Children's National Medical Center, Moffitt Cancer Center and Health Care Partners. Our strategic partnership with salesforce.com is off to a great start as we see customers rapidly adopting BMC's ServiceDesk on Force.com.
 During the quarter, we added a number of new companies through this offering, including Advanced Infrastructure Management, Emmanuel College and Creative Information Technologies, Incorporated.  Further strengthening the strategic alliance between the two companies, salesforce.com will begin this quarter reselling BMC's ServiceDesk on Force.com to accelerate the momentum for cloud-based IT service management integrated with their Sales Cloud 2, Service Cloud 2 and Chatter Collaboration Cloud. Through our resell agreement with salesforce.com, we are making it easier than ever to customers to simplify and automate their IT operations.
 In addition to having the best technology, another way in which we're determined to gain a competitive advantage is by helping enterprise customers get the most value out of our offerings. That's why we're working to strengthen and expand our Professional Services organization. We began this current initiative in fiscal 2010, and it will remain a priority during fiscal 2011. While it's still early in the process, we're pleased with the results in the first quarter. Professional Services bookings and revenue increased significantly. Utilization rates rose, and our Professional Services business returned to profitability.
 We're also seeing a positive impact from our efforts to strengthen our ESM sales organization. Our goal here is to broaden our footprint and our ability to build C-level relationships. The evidence indicates that our strategy is working. During the quarter, the average number of tenured sales reps increased from the prior year. At the same time, these tenured reps increased their productivity on a year-over-year basis. We are ahead of plan on the number of productive heads, and we expect the average number of tenured reps to increase over 20% in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010.
 Let me turn now to our MSM business. As you know, this business can be lumpy from a booking standpoint because of the timing of renewals. Total MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis increased 15%, up from a 10% increase last quarter. It's also important to look at MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis after normalizing for differences in contract length. On that basis, MSM annualized bookings increased 8%. During the quarter, we increased the MSM install base by adding 15 new customers. We also saw 54 existing customers renew and increase their relationship with us by adding new products to their existing portfolio. Some of these major MSM wins include Federal Express, Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase, Aurora Healthcare and Telefonica de Espana.
 Once again, we had a solid increase in the annual run rate for our top 15 MSM transactions, driven by significant competitive wins at key accounts. This is the 13th consecutive quarter where we have seen an increase in the run rate of our largest transactions. Our MSM business continues to lead the mainframe management market in terms of innovation and execution.
 During the first quarter, we announced new mainframe cost-optimization capabilities. We also recently released a new mainframe product for IMS, the leading transactional and hierarchical database management system for the IBM System z mainframe.
 BMC has been providing innovative IMS solutions since 1982 and has hundreds of IMS customers worldwide, including some of the world's largest financial and IT service providers.
 So to summarize our fiscal 2011 first quarter, we had robust bookings growth across key product offerings and geographies. We're continue to lead our market in terms of both vision and technology. The technology trends driving our markets, such as cloud computing, virtualization and Software-as-a-Service, represent a strengthening tailwind that is propelling BMC forward. I'll talk more about our current outlook for fiscal 2011 later in the call.
 Before I turn the call over to Steve Solcher, I would like to highlight two additions to our team. Steve James and Mark Hawkins joined BMC's Board of Directors in May. Both Steve and Mark bring years of senior executive experience in the technology  industry to our board.
 Now Steve Solcher will provide more insight into our financial results. Steve?

 We grew revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share despite the negative impact of a significant year-over-year increase in the deferral rate of our license bookings, which I will discuss later, and we grew our cash flow from operations by 8%.  Our financial position remains strong as demonstrated by our solid balance sheet and recent ratings upgrades by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's.
 It's important to point out that license revenues were negatively impacted by an unusual year-over-year difference in the ratable rate of our license bookings. You can see this difference on Slide 9 of our conference call presentation where we provide additional visibility on ratability by license bookings overall and for each of our business units.  License bookings ratability increased from an unusually low 26% in the year-ago quarter to 44% in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. On a business unit basis, license bookings deferral rate increased 10 percentage points for our ESM business and 45 percentage points for our MSM business.
 We are pleased that our key business initiatives which we have discussed with you in recent quarters are proving successful. Our efforts to strengthen and expand our sales force are showing progress and momentum. Although still early, we are now seeing signs of traction in our Professional Services organization, and we remain committed to maintaining our customary financial discipline. All of these initiatives reflect our strategy to invest in our business in a disciplined way to build value for customers and shareholders.
 With that, let me turn to our financial results for the quarter.
 In the first quarter, non-GAAP operating income increased by 6% from $148 million to $157 million. Non-GAAP operating margin increased to 34% this quarter, up one percentage point over the last year.
 Please refer to Slide 5 for our highlights of our ESM and MSM business unit operating results. In the first quarter, operating income of our ESM business unit increased 55% to $66 million from $42 million in the year-ago period. ESM's operating margin increased year-over-year by seven percentage points to 23%. We remain pleased with the continued improvement and profitability of our ESM business.
 MSM's operating income decreased by 14% to $91 million from $106 million, and its operating margin decreased by four percentage points to 52%.  MSM's financial performance on a year-over-year basis reflects the significant increase in MSM's license bookings deferral rate.
 Our non-GAAP net earnings for the first quarter were $114 million, an increase of 3% from $111 million in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the period was $0.62, up 5% from $0.59 in the year-ago period. This reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter of 25%. These non-GAAP results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the first quarter of $184 million versus $188 million in the year-ago period.
 GAAP operating income in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 was $108 million, flat compared to the year-ago period. GAAP net income and diluted EPS were $93 million and $0.50 compared to $82 million and $0.44 in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.  First quarter GAAP net earnings were positively impacted by a $14 million income tax benefit recorded in connection with the settlement with a taxing authority related to prior years' tax matters. This benefit was excluded from our non-GAAP results.
 Turning now to bookings. In the first quarter, total bookings of $443 million were up 14% from $390 million in the year-ago period. On a constant currency basis, first quarter bookings increased 16%. Total license bookings for the quarter increased 27% year-over-year to $135 million. On a constant currency basis, first quarter license bookings increased 31%.
 Total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were $2 billion, up 12% compared to the year-ago period. The weighted-average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.19 years, up 7% from 2.05 years in the year-ago period.
 After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the first quarter were $911 million, up 4% from the year-ago period. Please refer to Slide 7 in our presentation.
 Now let me turn to the performance of each of our business units. For our ESM business unit, growth in license bookings is the best measure of performance. ESM license bookings were $101 million in the first quarter, up 40% from $73 million in the year-ago period. I'm pleased to highlight the strong broad-based ESM license bookings performance across all major geographies and product disciplines.
 Turning to the MSM business unit, we believe MSM is best evaluated on the basis of total and annualized bookings over the trailing 12 months. As Bob mentioned before, MSM remains a lumpy business. Since bookings for our MSM business are tied largely to the timing and size of renewals, MSM bookings can vary widely from quarter to quarter. Total MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis increased 15% to $794 million. The average contract length of 3.03 years increased 6%.  After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were $262 million, up 8% from the year-ago period. For fiscal 2011, we expect low to mid-single digit growth in MSM total bookings on a constant currency basis.
 Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $461 million, up 2% from $450 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 on both a reported and constant currency basis.
 License revenue in the first quarter was $171 million, an increase of 3% from $167 million a year ago.  During the quarter, the large increase in the license bookings deferral rate negatively impacted license revenue by approximately $24 million compared to the deferral rate a year ago. ESM license revenue was $113 million, up 18% from $96 million in the year-ago period. The ESM license bookings deferral rate was 32%, a 10 percentage point increase over the last year.
 MSM license revenue decreased by 18% from $71 million to $58 million. This is mainly due to a 45 percentage point increase in MSM's license bookings deferral rate, which was driven by an increase in the percentage of time-based or term transactions.  The first quarter of fiscal 2011 is more reflective of our typical seasonality for license bookings deferral rate as we had an abnormally low deferral rate in the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
 For the first quarter, maintenance revenue was $254 million, an increase of 1% from the year-ago period. ESM maintenance revenue was $137 million, up 2%, and MSM maintenance revenue was $117 million, relatively flat compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2010.
 We expect maintenance revenue to grow sequentially in the second quarter. As Bob mentioned, we continue to make improvements in our Professional Services organization. Professional services revenue, which is included in our ESM business unit, increased 13% to $36 million and our professional services operating margin generated a profit of $1 million versus a loss a year ago.
 Moving next to operating expenses. We remain committed to our disciplined approach to managing our expense structure, focusing on ways to maximize our efficiency and leverage our infrastructure. During the first quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $304 million, up 1% from $302 million in the year-ago period. It is important to note that we capitalized more software development costs than in the year-ago period.
 Looking at our business units, ESM's operating expenses were $221 million, flat compared to the year-ago period. MSM operating expenses were $84 million, up 3% from $81 million in the year-ago period.
 As for other income, we had a $5.5 million loss in other income compared to a $0.7 million loss a year ago. On a year-over-year basis, this negatively impacted non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.02.
 Turning now to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the first quarter was $588 million, down 6% sequentially from $624 million as of March 31, 2010. The sequential change follows our typical seasonality. During the quarter, we deferred $59 million of license revenue, or 44% of license bookings, and recognized $94 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet.  Total deferred revenue decreased by $18 million sequentially to $1.8 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 55% of total deferred revenue.
 Our software development costs were $160 million, up 10% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, as we capitalized $32 million and amortized $18 million. This increase was driven by the scope and timing of several key product releases expected in the September quarter.
 At the end of the quarter, cash and investments totaled $1.5 billion, and our net cash position was $1.1 billion. For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $167 million, up 8% from $155 million in the year-ago period. Cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by $6 million due to the year-over-year change and finance payables on the balance sheet.  DSOs in the quarter dropped sequentially to 47 days, down from 60 days in March.
 During the quarter, we remained committed to our existing share repurchase program. We repurchased 4 million shares of our stock for a total cost of $149 million. We now have $921 million remaining in our current share repurchase program.
 Finally, as further validation of our strong financial position, both Standard & Poor's and Moody's upgraded their ratings on BMC last week. Standard & Poor's raised BMC's corporate credit and senior unsecured rating to BBB+ from BBB. As rationale, they cited BMC's good operating performance during the recent IT downturn, our conservative leverage and strong free cash flow generation. Moody's upgraded BMC to Baa2 from Baa3 and cited BMC's strong operating and financial performance throughout the recent downturn, our success in growing and improving the profitability of our non-mainframe business and Moody's view that the outlook for our IT management software products is favorable.
 With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob for his concluding remarks.

Given our first quarter results, we are on track to meet our fiscal 2011 expectations. The combination of an improving economy, better prospects for IT spending, strong market demand, our leading market position and our solid start to fiscal 2011 underlie our view. To reiterate what we provided in May, for the full year, we expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.84 to $2.94. At the midpoint, this would represent a 9% increase over last fiscal year.
 Our non-GAAP diluted EPS estimate excludes an estimated range of $0.71 to $0.76 per share for non-GAAP adjustments, including share-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets, severance, exit costs and related charges, as well as the related tax impacts of these items and certain discrete tax items.
 The assumptions underlying this full year fiscal 2011 estimate include: total bookings and revenue growth in the mid-single digits; continued improvement in our non-GAAP operating margin; a slight increase in the license bookings deferral rate; slight bookings hurt due to currency that negatively impacts growth rate by one point more than what we assumed in May; other income estimated to be $10 million lower than a year ago, reflecting current market conditions; weighted shares outstanding similar to the prior year; and a non-GAAP tax rate of 26% to 27%.
 We expect full year fiscal 2011 cash flow from operations to be between $660 million and $710 million.  With that, we'll now turn the call over to questions. Operator?

Our President of our MSM business unit was actually on stage with the IBM executives the day of the launch in London. And we were one of the few vendors that were there actually as part of that rollout. So we're excited about the machine and about the impact it will have on the market. And we look at ourselves and we do think that it probably had a little bit of a stalling effect on some mainframe transactions. Not so much for any negative reason, just that customers wanted to see -- they're assuming they're going to get a new box. They want to know what the capacity of the new box will be before they negotiate a new agreement, so that they make sure that they have in the negotiation the proper number of NIPS and the proper capacity. So I think that the -- kind of the overhang of the announcement caused a little more slowing of transactions than we typically would have seen. But it was not a big number, but we did see that. But on the whole, we think it will be a positive now that the machine is starting to ship.

We're now over 100 customers through that OEM relationship, which if you kind of take their numbers and ours, it shows a reasonable attach rate, particularly considering the fact that it's such a large number of the boxes that are shipping, are shipping are proof of concepts. There's also a lot of mid-market being shipped too, et cetera. And what we really offer are industrial-strength automation for a production environment. So we're going to be a lagging indicator of success for that platform, not a leading indicator. We're going to be brought in once the proof of concepts go into production, once the production goes to scale. So I think you can say that where we are is a reasonable success. Now what I'll add is that what that's really though created is a significant change in the relationship of how we work together on large transactions, how we work together on cloud transactions, on much more than just the OEM agreement of the particular product, but really almost the entire Cloud Lifecycle Management product from BMC are now being brought into many, many deals, some of which we would have not been in at all had it not been for our relationship and others we've helped them into. So I think that the relationship is continuing to improve and the opportunity expands well beyond the OEM agreement.  One thing I just mention is that, and I certainly understand the many questions we had today on the mainframe, today mainframe represents about 1/3 of BMC. Our growth engines are the BSM initiative, the virtualization and the cloud initiatives, the Software-as-a-Service initiatives that we have been and that the employees of this company have been working on so diligently now since 2003 when we announced it, which is now the other 2/3 of our business, really just put in some phenomenal growth. This 40% year-over-year license growth in ESM is really something exceptional. And I just want to just pause a second and congratulate the ESM organization for that. Double-digit growth across all product lines, across all geographies, a doubling in the number of transactions, $500,000 to  $1 million in increase in the ASPs, being ahead in sales capacity, seeing strong growth in productivity and seeing 15 brand new Software-as-a-Service customers with products that we didn't even have 90 days ago are all really good indicators of our core growth engine that is our BSM strategy. And our ESM sales team and R&D teams and support teams deserve a lot of credit. So I'd just like to end with that as I believe, if I'm not mistaken, Kelly, we have no further questions.

BMC performed very well during the second quarter, and we're seeing strength across many areas of our business. A few highlights for the quarter. Total bookings grew 5% to $453 million. License bookings grew 23% to $221 million. Revenue was up 9% to $502 million. Cash flow from operations increased 36% to $127 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 24% to $0.82 per share, and our balance sheet remains strong with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $1.8 billion in deferred revenue. That's a snapshot of our overall financial performance. Let me turn next to provide a brief overview of our ESM and MSM business units performance during the second quarter.
Our ESM business had another strong quarter with robust year-over-year growth in ESM bookings across most geographic areas and all product disciplines. ESM license bookings increased 32% from the year ago quarter. We had 31 ESM transactions over $1 million in license bookings, up over 50% from a year ago. Over half of these largest transactions were multi-disciplined license transactions. Major ESM wins during the second quarter included Adobe, Hospital Corporation of America, Harris Corporation and SYS-CON IT services. We are also encouraged to see continued strong growth in our midsize transactions. The number of ESM license transactions between $500,000 and $1 million increased by 22% compared to last year. This is the fifth straight quarter in which we've seen deals in this range grow by double digits.
Looking at our Mainframe business, MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were up 2%. MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis after normalizing for contract length were up 3%. During the first half of the year, capacity upgrade volume was slightly below its usual pace. We may have been affected in the first half by customer anticipation of IBM's new zEnterprise mainframes, which began shipping in September. We expect availability of this powerful platform certainly to help our performance as we enter the second half of the year. We hope to capture this momentum and any pent-up demand. As you may know, we announced our support for the new IBM system last quarter.
During the quarter, we added 18 new customers to the MSM install base and expanded our relationship with 58 existing customers by adding new products to their portfolios. Some wins include the Internal Revenue Service, Korea Exchange Bank, Sanofi-aventis, Thomson Reuters and United States Postal Service. That provides an overview of our financial and business units performance during the quarter. 
I also want to highlight a few of the key trends that are driving our results. One of the major factors is customer adoption of cloud computing. There is no question that the interest around cloud computing is very high. The fact is cloud computing is real. It's here, and it's a very attractive proposition for enterprises today. That's because it can help them be more agile and flexible in managing and growing their businesses with reduced cost and improved efficiency. It does so by enabling IT departments to provide and deliver services and to quickly scale those services with more automation and without worrying about adding more to their IT infrastructures. While customers are excited about the benefits of cloud computing, they are not about to get rid of the investments they've already made. They need a practical solution that extends and builds upon their existing infrastructures, IT processes and service offerings. That's where we come in. We help enterprises and service providers more effectively plan, build and manage cloud computing as an integral part of their IT infrastructure. Unlike other key technology trends, where IT management lags market development, our cloud solutions are one of the drivers of this trend. That's important because both cloud computing and virtualization are complex and can drive up operating costs even as they drive down capital expenditures. 
A case in point is BMC's Cloud Lifecycle Management. Our single integrated solution that allows service providers and enterprise IT customers to deliver superior services through public, private and hybrid clouds. BMC Cloud Lifecycle Management helps customer establish their cloud environment by providing a catalog that presents service offering, a self service portal for procuring resources, a comprehensive provisioning engine to dynamically build the cloud and management capabilities to control the cloud. Unlike products from other IT vendors, our solutions manage the broadest range of computing, storage, network, virtualization and software solutions, automatically provisioning the full stack of cloud services, it's not just for one technology. 
We operate truly vendor neutral platform. This commitment to heterogeneity combined with our BSM [Business Service Management] best practices is a very attractive value proposition for customers migrating to the cloud. BMC's cloud strategy allows customers to achieve the benefits of cloud computing without introducing new silos, disrupting IT operations or forcing a vendor lock-in for hardware, services or the virtualization platform itself.
During the second quarter, we won a total of 14 cloud deals including CGI and Adobe, which was our first joint cloud win with Dell. What's more, we had a long list of cloud-related opportunities that positions us well for the second half. In addition to winning new business from customers, we're also winning MindShare among industry thought leaders regarding cloud management. A recent Forrester report entitled, You're Not Ready for Internal Cloud, makes this clear. The report states BMC solutions are cloud-ready today. We standardize management on the most commonly repeated operating procedures. We fully automated deployment and we're providing self-service access for cloud users. We think there is a significant potential for us in cloud management and we're continuing to invest in our capabilities both through internal development and acquisitions. 
During the quarter, we announced BMC's Control-M 7, a new version of the industry-leading solution that automates the management of dynamic and static workloads across applications, as well as physical, virtual and cloud platforms. It includes dynamic workload management, a capability that automatically maps workloads to IT priorities, using policies to react to realtime business needs. In addition, BMC's Control-M 7 helps harness cloud environments, providing the elasticity needed to cost effectively support fluctuating workloads. 
In October, BMC acquired the software business of Neptuny, a leading provider of capacity management and IT performance optimization solutions. The addition of Neptuny's technology extends BMC's exiting leadership in capacity management and enhances BMC's dynamic BSM portfolio and cloud management offerings. With Neptuny, our capacity management solutions allow our customers to correlate changes in business requirements with changes in our IT infrastructure. As customers anticipate business changes, they can test scenarios for optimizing their infrastructure and make those changes, allocating capacity across physical to physical, physical to virtual, virtual to virtual, virtual to cloud and cloud to cloud environments. Essentially every combination of physical, virtual and cloud resources to simultaneously improve their service levels and reduce capital expenditures. 
Our cloud strategy and solutions underscore the leadership and vision we're bringing across-the-board in helping enterprises improve how they manage IT. This is also demonstrated by the recognition we continue to win among industry analysts. Gartner's recent report entitled BMC Software IT Operations Management: Vision, Strategy, Strengths and Challenges evaluate BMC's enterprise IT management product offerings and BMC's strategic position in the global marketplace. In its report, Gartner concluded that BMC had a consistent, strong BSM vision that simultaneously addresses the need for IT alignment and efficiency. In addition to our cloud offerings, I would like to provide some perspective on three other initiatives that are driving our leadership in BSM, our ITSM offerings, our software as a service solution and Cisco's UCS. 
First, ITSM. The new era of IT service management is about having a full menu of flexible options to meet the needs of the enterprise, whether large or small, expanding or contracting, on premise or on-demand, physical or virtual. To address these needs, we launched product enhancements during the quarter that enable greater flexibility and choice for our customers when it comes to tailoring an ITSM option for their particular situation. These enhancements offer standardized processes such as embedded ITIL based best practices, full platform integration and enhanced web reporting.
One of the ways we're working to broaden and leverage our ITSM leadership is through our SaaS offerings. These solutions, which include a full suite remedy on demand and a streamlined powerful service desk on Force.com, are beginning to gain serious traction. Though they are still in a relatively early stage, we like what we see. We're very encouraged that we had 18 wins for our SaaS offerings in the quarter and expect demand for these solutions to further ramp up in the second half. We took steps to further enhance our SaaS offerings by integrating salesforce.com's, Chatter 2 environment into the ServiceDesk on Force.com solutions. It enables collaboration and mobility across the IT department, resulting in higher productivity.
Let me move next to discuss Cisco and their UCS solution. As you know, BMC's management tools help to provision, configure and manage Cisco's Unified Computing System. We're now beginning to see some enterprise deployments and are happy to report to you on a couple of a larger deals that closed this quarter. The Department of Defense's Defense Media Activity selected a comprehensive solution incorporating BMC, Cisco and Vmware technologies to support a consolidated data center. The win comes to us from Force 3, a  trusted provider in Federal security, unified communications and data center solutions. In addition we recently announced the win with Monsanto Company, a leading global provider of agricultural products who selected BMC for a large scale BSM deployment to reduce system downtime by improving the way IT manages changes to the network. The company is working with BMC and the Cisco UCS system to achieve its goal of 70% server virtualization. 
So to summarize the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we had another strong quarter of business and financial performance. This solid performance was driven by our leadership in providing solutions that customers need, whether it's managing the data center, improving IT operations, utilizing a SaaS solution for IT service management or implementing virtualization in cloud computing. Based on our performance so far and our expectations for the next two quarters, we will raise our full year expectation for fiscal 2011. 
I'll talk more about our current outlook for Fiscal '11 later in the call. But first, Steve Solcher will provide more insight into our financial results. Steve?"

I'm very pleased with our company's business and financial results in the second quarter and in the first half of fiscal 2011. We generated solid broad-based top line growth in a seasonally tough quarter. We",1767,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon to everyone. I'm very pleased with our company's business and financial results in the second quarter and in the first half of fiscal 2011. We generated solid broad-based top line growth in a seasonally tough quarter. We're investing in those areas of our business with strong growth potential, while remaining disciplined with regards to our expense structure, resulting in strong growth in earnings and cash flow from operations.
Given our strong first half performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, our full year expectations have improved. A key driver of this strong first half performance is bookings growth. In particular, ESM license bookings growth, which has been strong both geographically, as well as across all product disciplines. This quarter, for example, was the second quarter in a row in which license bookings in each ESM product discipline grew by double-digit percentages. We remain focused on accelerating topline growth in converting those incremental bookings and revenues into increased earnings and cash flow. 
Non-GAAP net earnings and cash flow from operations grew by 12%, and 18% respectively in the first half. Our performance is indicative of the operating leverage we have in our business, which should enable us to drive further improvement in operating income and margin in the second half of this fiscal year. While at the same time, enabling us to increase our investment in future growth initiatives. This broad-based growth, coupled with our operating leverage, is providing us the opportunity to plan for sound and consistent growth both short and long term. With that, let me turn to our results for operating income and EPS.
In the second quarter, non-GAAP operating income increased by 9%  to $191 million from $175 million in the second quarter of last year. Non-GAAP operating margin remained flat at 38%. For the first half of fiscal 2011, non-GAAP operating income  increased 8% from $323 million to $348  million. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first half was 36%, up one percentage point.
Please refer to Slide 5 for highlights of our ESM and MSM business unit operating results. ESM's non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter increased 9% to $76 million. ESM's operating margin was 25%, a slight decrease compared to the year ago quarter largely due to a year-over-year decline in net capitalized software development costs. For the first half, ESM's non-GAAP operating income increased 26% and ESM's operating margin was up three percentage points to 24%. We expect continued year-over-year improvements in ESM's profitability in the second half of the fiscal year.
MSM's non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter increased by 10% to $115 million. MSM's non-GAAP operating margin was 60%, up four percentage points compared to the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP net earnings for the second quarter were $148 million, an increase of 20% from the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.82, up 24% from the year ago quarter. This reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 23% for the quarter. For the first half, non-GAAP net earnings increased  12% to $262 million, and non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 15% to $1.44. GAAP operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $144 million compared to $135 million in the year ago quarter. GAAP net earnings and diluted EPS were $132 million and $0.73 compared to $94 million and $0.50 in the second quarter of fiscal 2010.
These results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the second quarter of $181 million compared to $187 million in the year ago quarter. Turning now to bookings. In the second quarter, total bookings of $453 million were up 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis, compared to the year ago quarter. Total bookings for the first half were up 9% to $896 million. Total license bookings for the quarter increased 23% year-over-year on both a reported and  constant currency basis to $221 million. For the first half, license bookings rose 24% to $356 million. Total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were $2 billion, up 11% compared to the year ago quarter. The weighted average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.18 years, up from 2.09 years in the year ago quarter. After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the second quarter were $928 million, up 7% from the year ago quarter and up two percentage points from the first quarter. Please see Slide 7 in our presentation.
Now let me turn to the bookings performance of each of our business units. For our ESM business unit, license bookings are the best measure of performance. We generated strong growth in our ESM business with ESM license bookings at $144 million in the second quarter, up 32% from the year ago quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2011, ESM license bookings were up 35% to $246 million. I'm pleased to highlight the strong performance we're seeing in the U.S. in our ESM business and the broad-based double-digit growth across all ESM product disciplines.
Turning to the MSM business unit. We believe MSM is best evaluated on the basis of total and annualized bookings over their trailing 12 months. In the second quarter, total MSM bookings  on a trailing 12-month basis increased 2% to $754 million and had an average contract length of 2.93 years. After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were $257 million, up 3% from $249 million in the year ago quarter. We expect total MSM bookings to be up in the low single digits for the full fiscal year. 
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $502 million, up 9% on both a reported and constant currency basis from $462 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. ESM's total revenue was up 13% to $309 million and MSM's total revenue was up 3% to $193 million. License revenue in the second quarter was $208 million, an increase of 20% from the year ago quarter. ESM license revenue was $131 million, up 24% from the year ago quarter. MSM's license revenue increased by 13% to $77 million.
During the second quarter, the percentage of license bookings that was deferred was 49%, down from 56% in the year ago quarter. For the second quarter, maintenance revenue was $253 million, a decrease of 2% from the year ago quarter and relatively flat compared to the first quarter. The slight decline in maintenance revenue during the second quarter is largely due to the lagging impact of license bookings only growing 1% in fiscal 2010. The additional maintenance revenue related to these new license bookings was not enough to offset the decline from our normal level of renewals. Our maintenance renewal rates and the attached rates in both our MSM and ESM businesses have been relatively stable over the past several years. Given our strong license bookings performance in the first half of fiscal 2011, we expect gradual sequential improvements in maintenance revenue in the second half of fiscal 2011.
ESM maintenance revenue was $136 million, down 1% compared to the year ago quarter. MSM maintenance revenue was $116 million, down 3% from the second quarter of fiscal 2010. For the first half of fiscal 2011, maintenance revenue for both units was roughly flat compared to the year ago period. During the second quarter, we continue to see improvements in our professional services organization. Professional services revenue, which is included in the ESM business unit increased by 37% to $42 million from the year ago quarter. Our Professional Services business was profitable in the second quarter with a non-GAAP operating margin of $3 million compared to a slight loss a year ago.
Moving next to operating expenses. During the second quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $311 million, up 8% from $287 million in the year ago quarter. This increase reflects the focus investments we've made in ESM sales, R&D and professional services organizations.
Looking at our business units, ESM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $233 million, an increase of 14% compared to the year ago quarter. MSM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $78 million, down 6% from the year ago quarter. Other income in the second quarter was slightly positive compared to a $2 million loss a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the second quarter was $601 million, up $13 million sequentially from $588 million. During the second quarter, we deferred $107 million of license revenue, a 49% of license bookings and recognized $96 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. Given normal seasonality, total deferred revenue decreased $50 million sequentially to $1.8 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 54% of total deferred revenue.
Software development costs on the balance sheet were $171 million as we capitalized $29 million and amortized $18 million during the quarter. Capitalized software development costs declined $3 million sequentially compared to the first quarter, and we expect continued decline for the remainder of the fiscal year. Cash and investments at the end of the quarter totaled $1.5 billion, up $50 million from the previous quarter. Our net cash position is $1.2 billion. 
For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $127 million, up 36% from $93 million in the year ago quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2011, cash flow from operations increased by 18% to $295 million. During the quarter, we remain committed to share repurchases. We repurchased 2 million shares for a total of $75 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $846 million remaining in our current share repurchase program. 
So let me briefly's some up the quarter. BMC's strong top and bottom line performance across our key financial metrics in the second quarter and the first half, positions us well as we enter the second half. We are generating broad-based growth across our business. And our cost discipline and operating leverage positions us well for continued improvement in our operating margins and operating income, while at the same time enabling us to increase our investment in our future growth initiatives. Our solid results in the first half and our outlook for the remainder of the year, puts us on track to exceed our previously stated financial goals for the year. It is also providing us the opportunity to plan for sound and consistent growth both short and long term. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob to discuss our revised expectations for the year and for his concluding remarks."

As I mentioned, given our financial results in the first half of the year and our expectations for the next two quarters, we are raising our expectations for fiscal 2011. We now expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.92 to $3.02. At the midpoint, this would represent a 12% increase over last year compared to the 9% increase in our original guidance. 
Our non-GAAP diluted EPS estimate excludes an estimated range of $0.58 to $0.63 per diluted share for non-GAAP adjustments, including share-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets, severance, exit costs and related charges, as well as the related tax impacts of these items and certain discrete tax items. The assumptions underlying this full year fiscal 2011 estimate include: bookings growth in the mid- to high-single digits, compared to our original expectation of mid-single digits bookings growth. ESM license bookings growth in the high teens; total revenue growth in the mid-single digits. At current rates, we do not expect currency to materially impact full year bookings or revenue growth rates; continued improvement in non-GAAP operating margin; a license bookings ratable rate in the low 50% range; other income estimated to be $10 million lower than a year ago, reflecting current market conditions. Weighted shares outstanding, slightly down compared to the prior year and a non-GAAP tax rate of 25%.
We now expect full year fiscal 2011 cash flows from operations to be between $675 million and $725 million compared to our original expectation of $660 million to $710 million. At the midpoint, this would represent a 10% increase over last year. We also now expect by the third quarter to achieve close to 60% of our fiscal year cash flow from operations goal, which is higher than the 52% achieved to the third quarter of fiscal 2010. We will provide more detailed overview of the company strategy, financial performance and business initiatives at our Investor Day conference on December 14 in New York City. We hope to see you all there.

One is that most of the largest customers particularly the service providers and the global outsourcers and systems integrators are developing new cloud environments because they want to deploy new offerings. They have new revenue engines they're trying to develop around a self-service cloud for application stacks that they want to offer. And that's almost virgin territory for us. We're able to go into those and there's a massive build that you've probably read stories about some of the huge investments that some of the service providers are making in data centers. And we're talking to different people even there. In one case, we're talking to chief marketing officer of a Fortune 10, who is a telco that's moving in that direction. So I think there's lots of room around cloud. I think that our success across our product lines this quarter, I really think we're still just scratching the surface in terms of most of the product sets. I mean, even Remedy, which is our arguably one of our most widely adopted products, we saw a 27% growth in the Service Support business, which includes Atrium and Remedy in the first half in license bookings. And the pipeline is building very nicely, there's still plenty of opportunity to grow that business. Automation is really still nascent even though we're growing that business much faster than support. We're growing that business almost 50% in the first half of the year. We're still just scratching the surface there. And use cases are still, they're very early use cases. So by the way, I just go and complete the puzzle, assurance, those of you followed us for years, you know the PATROL business and we told you how that business was going to be reinvigorated with things like ProactiveNet, et cetera. That business is up 45% license bookings in the first half. And so there's plenty of room to grow this. I'm not worried about hitting our head on the market saturation."

I think larger transactions, again, long-term does, of course, add a little more excitement potentially to the business. But right now, I think, it's still a game of a lot of medium-sized fish and not whale hunting. We don't need whales to make the business work like MSM certainly does. And the sales force is, I think, brilliant. I think we have a brilliant sales force. I mean, I'll you give you a case in point. If you remember, over the past several earnings calls, we talked about how Europe came on. It was doing such a great job but in North America was lagging. This quarter we didn't see that all. We saw North America had a really solid quarter, so we've seen now worldwide solid performance across the geographies for several quarters. We've seen the entire product portfolio, all the major product lines delivering strong double-digit growth. You're seeing the deal count from $500,000 to $1 million growing nicely from $1 million and above growing nicely and you're not seeing the whales making all the difference to the deals. It's all of those things happening together. So, geographic balance, product line balance and you got SaaS in there. By the way, as an example, the deal at Adobe was a Remedy OnDemand, a SaaS offering for Remedy but it was an entire BSM story with the CMDB, with entire product line basically integrated into our Remedy product line. So there's an example of the flexibility that we have in our sales force. This was a company that really, almost no business with BMC. It was very small, if at all, we're trying to find a bit of any business with us up to this point and now they've basically are standardizing on almost our entire portfolio across the board and our sales team just did a fantastic job of that.

As new customers that we weren't doing much business with coming online. Certainly, the SaaS offerings, that's majority of these SaaS deals and we have some great SaaS wins with customers we've never done any business with before, very competitive by the way but we won often times with our competitors both large and small dropping price to try to win the deal and we beat them on functionality. We beat them on capability, we beat them on our ability to integrate with a more complete product line attached to it in the future. And we did about 50% of the deals, we did with Remedy and 50% we did with on the ServiceDesk on Force.com. And so, we're out there selling to new customers, as well as existing customers.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today’s call.

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us on today’s call. BMC performed very well during the second quarter we're seeing strength across many areas of our business.
A few highlights for the quarter, total bookings grew 5% to 453 million. Licensed bookings grew 23% to 221 million. Revenue was up 9% to 502 million. Cash-flow from operations increased 36% to 127 million.
Non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 24% to $0.82 per share and our balance sheet remains strong with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and investments and 1.8 billion in deferred revenue.
That's a snapshot of our overall financial performance.
Let me turn next to provide a brief overview of ESM and MSM business units performance during the second quarter. Our ESM business had another strong quarter with robust year-over-year growth in ESM bookings across most geographic areas and all product disciplines.
ESM licensed bookings increased 32% from the year-ago quarter. We had 31 ESM transactions over $1 million in licensed bookings up over 50% from a year-ago. Over half of these largest transactions were multi-disciplined licensed transactions, major ESM wins during the second quarter included adobe by, Hospital Corporation of America, (inaudible) Corporation and Swisscom IT Services.
We're also encouraged to see continued strong growth in our mid-sized transactions. The number of ESM licensed transactions between 500,000 and $1 million increased by 22% compared to last year. This is the fifth straight quarter in which we've seen deals in this range grow by double digits.
Looking at our mainframe business, MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were up 2%. MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis after normalizing for contract length were up 3%. During the first half of the year capacity upgrade volume was slightly below its usual pace, we may have been affected in the first half by customer anticipation by IBM’s new zEnterprise mainframes, which began shipping in September.
We expect availability of this powerful platform certainly to help our performance as we enter the second half of the year. We hope to capture this momentum and any pent up demand as you may now, we announced our support for the new IBM system last quarter.
During the quarter, we added 18 new customers to the MSM install base and expanded our relationship with 58 existing customers by adding new products to their portfolios. Some wins include the Internal Revenue Service, Korea Exchange Bank, Tom Sanofi-Aventis, Thomson Reuters and the United States Postal Service.
That provides an overview of our financial and business unit performance during the quarter.
I also want to highlight a few of the key trends that are driving our results, one of the major factors is customer adoption of cloud computing. There's no question that the interest around cloud computing is very high, the fact is cloud computing is real. It's here and it's very attractive proposition for enterprises today that's because it can help them be more agile and flexible in managing and growing their businesses with reduced cost and improved efficiency.
It does so by enabling IT departments to provide and deliver services and to quickly scale those services with more automation and without worrying about adding more to their IT infrastructures.
While customers are excited about the benefits of cloud computing they are not about to get rid of the investments they’ve already made. They need a practical solution that extends and builds upon their existing infrastructures, IT processes and service offerings. That’s where we come in. We help enterprises and service providers more effectively plan, build, and manage cloud computing as an integral part of their IT infrastructure.
Unlike other key technology trends, where IT management lacks market development, our cloud solutions are one of the drivers of this trend. That's important because both cloud computing and virtualization are complex and can drive up operating costs even if they drive down capital expenditures.
A case in Point is BMC's cloud life cycle management. Our single integrated solution that allow service providers and enterprise IT customers to deliver superior services through public, private, and hybrid clouds.
BMC cloud life cycle management helps customers establish their cloud environment by providing a catalog that presents service offerings, a self-service portal for procuring, resources, a comprehensive provisioning engine to dynamically build the cloud and management capabilities to control the cloud.
Unlike products from other IT vendors, our solutions manage the broadest range of computing, storage, network, virtualization and software solutions automatically provisioning the full stack of cloud services is not just for one technology.
We offer a truly vendor neutral platform. This commitment to heterogeneity combined with our BSM best practices is a very attractive value proposition for customers migrating to the cloud.
BMC's cloud strategy allows customers to achieve the benefits of cloud computing without introducing new silos, disrupting IT operations, or forcing a vendor lock-in for hardware, services or the virtualization platform itself.
During the second quarter we've won a total of 14 cloud deals, including CGI and Adobe, which was our first joint cloud win with Dell. Once more we have a long list of cloud related opportunities that positions us well for the second half.
In addition to winning new business from customers, we're also winning mind share among industry thought leaders regarding cloud management. A recent Forrester report entitled “You're Not Ready For Internal Cloud” makes this clear. The report states, BMC's solutions are cloud-ready today. We’ve standardized management on the most commonly repeated operating procedures, we fully automated deployment and we’re providing self-service access for cloud users. We think there is a significant potential for us in cloud management we're continuing to invest in our capability both through internal development and acquisitions.
During the quarter we announced BMC's control M7, a new version of the industry-leading solution that automates the management of dynamic and static workloads, across applications as well as physical, virtual and cloud platforms it includes dynamic workload management, a capability that automatically maps workloads to IT priorities using policies, to react to real time business needs.
In addition, BMC's Control M7 helps harness could environments providing the elasticity needing to cost effectively support fluctuating workloads.
In October BMC acquired the software business of Neptuny, a leading provider of capacity management and IT performance optimization solutions. The addition of Neptuny’s technology extends BMC’s existing leadership in capacity management and enhances BMC's dynamic BSM portfolio in cloud management offerings.
With Neptuny, our capacity management solutions allow our customers to correlate changes in business requirements with changes in their IT infrastructure. As customers anticipate business changes they can test scenarios for optimizing their infrastructure and make those changes allocating capacity across physical to physical, physical to virtual, virtual to virtual, virtual to cloud and cloud to cloud environments essentially every combination of physical, virtual and cloud resources to simultaneously improve their service levels and reduce capital expenditures.
Our cloud strategy and solutions underscore the leadership and vision we're bringing across the board in helping enterprises improve how they manage IT. This is also demonstrated by the recognition we continue win among industry analysts, Gartner’s recent report entitled “BMC software IT operations management, vision, strategy, strength and challenges” evaluates BMC’s enterprise IT management product offerings and BMC's strategic position in the global marketplace. In its report, Gartner concluded that BMC has a consistent, strong, BSM vision to simultaneously addresses the need for IT alignment and efficiency.
In addition to our cloud offerings I would like to provide some perspective on three other initiatives that are driving our leadership in BSM, our ITSM offerings, our software as service solutions and Cisco's UCS.
First ITSM, the new era of IT service management is about having a full menu of flexible options to meet the needs of enterprise whether large or small. Expanding or contracting, on premise or on demand, physical or virtual.
To address these needs, we launched product enhancements during the quarter that enable greater flexibility and choice for our customers when it comes to tailoring an ITSM option for their particular situation. These enhancements offer standardized processes such as embedded IT based best practices, full platform integration an enhanced web reporting.
One of the ways we're working to broaden and leverage our ITSM leadership is our SaaS offerings. These solutions which include a full suite remedy on demand and a streamlined powerful service desk on Force.com are beginning to gain serious traction, though they are still in a relatively early stage, we like what we see.
We're very encouraged that we've had 18 wins for our SaaS offerings in the quarter and expect demand for these solutions to further ramp up in the second half. We took steps to further enhance our staff offerings by integrating salesforce.com’s Chatter 2 environment into the service desk on Force.com solutions. It enables collaboration and mobility across the IT department resulting in higher productivity.
Let me move next to discuss Cisco and their UCS solution. As you know BMC's management tools helps to provision, configure and manage Cisco's unified computing system. We're now beginning to see some enterprise deployments and are happy to report to you on a couple of the larger deals that closed this quarter.
The department of defenses, defense media activity, selected a comprehensive solution incorporating BMC, Cisco, and VMware Technologies for their consolidated data center. The win comes through us through Force 3, a trusted provider in federal security, unified communications and data center solutions.
In addition, we recently announced a win with Monsanto Company, a leading global provider of agricultural products who selected BMC for a large scale BSM deployment to reduce system down time by improving the way IT manages changes to the network. The company is working with BMC and Cisco UCS system to achieve its goal of 70% server virtualization.
So to summarize the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we had another strong quarter of business and financial performance.
This solid performance was driven by our leadership in providing solutions that customers need, whether it's managing the data center, improving IT operations, utilizing a SaaS solution for IT service management or implementing virtualization in cloud computing.
Based on our performance so far and our expectations for the next two quarters, we will raise our full expectation for fiscal 2011.
I'll talk more about our current outlook for fiscal '11 later in the call.
But first Steve Solcher will provide more insight into our financial results. Steve?

I'm very pleased with our company's business and financial results in the second quarter and in the first half of fiscal 2011.We generated solid, broad based top line growth in a seasonally tough quarter w",1746,"Thank you, Bob. And good afternoon to everyone. I'm very pleased with our company's business and financial results in the second quarter and in the first half of fiscal 2011.
We generated solid, broad based top line growth in a seasonally tough quarter where investing in those areas of our business was strong growth potential while remaining disciplined with regards to our expense structure resulting in strong growth in earnings and cash-flow from operations.
Given our strong first half performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, our full year expectations have improved.
The key driver of this strong first half performance is bookings growth, in particular ESM license bookings growth which has been strong both geographically as well as across all product disciplines.
This quarter, for example, was the second quarter in a row in which licensed bookings in each ESM product discipline grew by double digit percentages, we remain focused on accelerating top line growth and converting those incremental bookings and revenues into increased earnings and cash-flow.
Non-GAAP net earnings and cash-flow operations grew by 12% and 18% respectively in the first half.
Our performance is indicative of the operating leverage we have in our business, which should enable us to drive further improvement in operating income and margin in the second half of this fiscal year.
While at the same time enabling us to increase our investment in future growth initiatives this broad based growth coupled with our operating leverage is providing us the opportunity to plan for sound and consistent growth both short and long term.
With that, let me turn to our results for operating income and EPS.
In the second quarter, non-GAAP operating income increased by 9% to 191 million from 175 million in the second quarter of last year. Non-GAAP operating margin remained flat at 38%.
For the first half of fiscal 2011, non-GAAP operating income increased 8% from 323 million to 348 million. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first half was 36% of 1 percentage point.
Please refer to slide 5 for highlights of our ESM and MSM business unit operating results.
ESMs non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter increased 9% to 76 million.
ESMs operating margin was 25%, a slight decrease compared to the year-ago quarter largely due to a year over year decline in net capitalized software development cost. For the first half ESMs non-GAAP operating income increased 26% and ESMs operating margin was up 3 percentage points to 24%. We expect continued year-over-year improvements in ESMs profitability in the second half of the fiscal year.
MSMs non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter increased by 10% to 115 million.
MSMs non-GAAP operating margin was 60% up 4 percentage points compared to the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net earnings for the second quarter were 148 million, an increase of 20% from the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.82, up 24% from the year-ago quarter.
This reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 23% for the quarter.
For the first half, non-GAAP net earnings increased 12% to 262 million and non-GAAP diluted EPS increased to 15% to $1.44. GAAP operating income in the second quarter fiscal 2011 was 144 million compared to 135 million in the year-ago quarter.
GAAP net earnings and diluted EPS were 132 million and $0.73 compared to 94 million and $0.50 in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. These results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the second quarter of 181 million compared to 187 million in the year-ago quarter.
Turning now to bookings, in the second quarter, total bookings of 453 million were up 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis compared to the year-ago quarter. Total bookings for the first half were up 9% to 896 million.
Total license bookings for the quarter increased 23% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis to 221 million. For the first half, licensed bookings rose 24% to 356 million.
Total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were 2 billion, up 11% compared to the year-ago quarter. The weighted average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.18 years up from 2.09 years in the year-ago quarter.
After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12 month annualized bookings for the second quarter were 928 million up 7% from the year-ago quarter and up 2 percentage points from the first quarter.
Please see slide 7 in our presentation.
Now, let me turn to the bookings performance of each of our business units.
For ESM business unit, licensed bookings are the best measure of performance. We generated strong growth in our ESM business. With ESM licensed bookings at 144 million in the second quarter up 32% from the year-ago quarter.
For the first half of fiscal 2011, ESM licensed bookings were up 35% to 246 million. I'm pleased to highlight the strong performance we're seeing in the U.S. in our ESM business and the broad-based double digit growth across all ESM product disciplines.
Turning to the MSM business unit, we believe MSM is best evaluated on the basis of total and annualized bookings over the trailing 12 months.
In the second quarter, total MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis increased 2% to 754 million and had an average contract length of 2.93 years. After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing months were 257 million up 3% from 249 million in the year-ago quarter.
We expect total MSM bookings to be up in the low single digits for the full fiscal year.
Turning to revenue, total revenue for the quarter was 502 million up 9% on both a reported and constant currency basis from 462 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. ESM’s total revenue was up 13% to 309 million and MSMs total revenue was up 3% to 192 million. Licensed revenue in the second quarter was 208 million, an increase of 20% from the year-ago quarter.
ESM license revenue was 131 million, up 24% from the year-ago quarter. MSM license revenue increased by 13% to 77 million. During the second quarter, the percentage of licensed bookings that was deferred was 49% down from 56% in the year-ago quarter.
For the second quarter, maintenance revenue was 253 million, a decrease of 2% from the year-ago quarter and relatively flat compared to the first quarter. The slight decline in maintenance revenue during the second quarter is largely due to the lagging impact of licensed bookings only growing 1% in fiscal 2010.
The additional maintenance revenue related to these new licensed bookings was not enough to offset the decline from our normal level of renewals. Our maintenance renewal rates and attach rates in both our MSM and ESM businesses have been relatively stable over the past several years.
Given our strong license bookings performance in the first half of fiscal 2011, we expect gradual sequential improvements in maintenance revenue in the second half of fiscal 2011. ESM maintenance revenue was 136 million down 1% when compared to the year ago quarter, MSM maintenance revenue was 116 million down 3% from the second quarter of fiscal 2010. For the first half of fiscal 2011 maintenance revenue for both units was roughly flat compared to the year-ago period.
During the second quarter, we continued to see improvements in our professional services organization. Professional services revenue which is included in the ESM business unit increased by 37% to 42 million from the year-ago quarter. Our professional services business was profitable in the second quarter with a non-GAAP operating margin of 3 million compared to slight loss a year ago.
Moving next to operating expenses, during the second quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were 311 million up 8% from 287 million in the year-ago quarter. This increase reflects the focused investments we’ve made in ESMs sales, R&D and professional services organizations.
Looking at our business units, ESMs non-GAAP operating expenses were 233 million, an increase of 14% compared to the year-ago quarter. MSMs non-GAAP operating expenses were 78 million down 6% from the year-ago quarter.
Other income in the second quarter was slightly positive compared to a 2 million loss a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet, total deferred license revenue at the end of the second quarter was 601 million, up 13 million sequentially from 588 million.
During the second quarter we deferred 107 million of licensed revenue or 49% of licensed bookings and recognized 96 million of deferred licensed revenue from the balance sheet.
Given normal seasonality, total deferred revenue decreased by 50 million sequentially to 1.8 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 54% of total deferred revenue.
Software development costs on the balance sheet were 171 million as we capitalized 29 million and amortized 18 million during the quarter. Capitalized software development costs declined 3 million sequentially compared to the first quarter and we expect continued declines for the remainder of the fiscal year.
Cash and investments at the end of the quarter totaled 1.5 billion, up 50 million from the previous quarter. Our net cash position is 1.2 billion.
For the quarter, cash-flow from operations was 127 million, up 36% from 93 million in a year-ago quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2011 cash-flow from operations increased by 18% to 295 million.
During the quarter we remained committed to share repurchases. We repurchased 2 million shares for a total of 75 million. At the end of the second quarter we had 846 million remaining in our current share repurchase program.
So let me briefly sum up the quarter, BMCs strong top and bottom line performance across our key financial metrics in the second quarter and the first half positions us well as we entered the second half.
We are generating broad-based growth across our business and our cost discipline and operating leverage positions us well for continued improvement in our operating margins and operating income while at the same time enabling us to increase our investment in our future growth initiatives.
Our solid results in the first half and our outlook for the remainder of the year puts us on track to exceed our previously stated financial goals for the year.
It is also providing us the opportunity to plan for sound and consistent growth, both short and long term.
With that I'll turn the call back over to Bob to discuss our revised expectations for the year and for his concluding remarks.

As I mentioned given, our financial results in first half of the year and our expectations for the next two quarters, we are raising our expectations for fiscal 2011. We now expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.92 to $3.02, at the midpoint this would represent a 12% over last year compared to 9% increase in our original guidance.
Our non-GAAP diluted EPS estimates exclude an estimated range of $0. 58 to $0.63 per diluted share for non-GAAP adjustments including share-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets, severance, exit costs, and related charges as well as the related tax impacts of these items and certain discrete tax items.
The assumptions underlying this full year fiscal 2011 estimate include bookings growth in the mid-to-high single digits compared to our original expectation of mid-single digits bookings growth. ESM license bookings growth in the high teens.
Total revenue growth in the mid-single digits. At current rates, we do not expect currency to materially impact full-year bookings or revenue growth rates, continued improvement in non-GAAP operating margin, c licensed bookings ratable rate in the low 50% range.
Other income estimated to be $10 million lower than a year-ago reflecting current market conditions.
Weighted shares outstanding slightly down compared to the prior year and a non-GAAP Tax rate of 25%.
We now expect full-year fiscal 2011 cash flows from operations to between 675 million and 725 million compared to our original expectation of 660 to 710 million. At the midpoint, this would represent a 10% increase over last year.
We also now expect by the third quarter to achieve close to 60% of our fiscal year cash-flow from operations goal, which is higher than the 52% achieved to the third quarter of fiscal 2010. We will provide more detailed overview of the company’s strategy, financial performance and business initiatives at our Investor Day conference on December the 14th in New York City.
We hope to see you all there.

One is that most of the largest customers particularly the service providers and the global outsourcers and systems integrators are developing new cloud environments because they want to deploy new offerings, they have new revenue engines, they're trying to develop around a self-service cloud for applications stacks that they want to offer. And that that's almost virgin territory for us. We’re able to go into those and there are some - probably you read the stories about some of the huge investments that some of the service providers are making in data centers and we’re talking to different people even there.
In one case, we're talking to chief marketing officer of a Fortune 10 company who is a Telco that's moving in that direction. So, I think that's lots of room around cloud. I think that that our success across our product lines this quarter - I really think we're still a discretionary service in terms of most of the product sets.
I mean, even Remedy which has been our, you know, which is arguably one of our most widely adopted products, we saw 27% growth in the service support business which includes a premium remedy in the first half in licensed bookings. And the pipeline is building very nicely. There's still plenty of opportunity to grow that business. Automation is really still nascent even though we're growing that business much faster than support; we are growing that business almost 50% the first half of the year. That's - we're still discretionary in the surface there and the use cases are still very early use cases.
So lots of - by the way I was going to complete the puzzle, assurance, those of you followed us for years you know the control business and we told you how that business was going to be reinvigorated with things like ProactiveNet and etcetera. That business is up 45% licensed bookings in the first half, and so there's plenty of room to grow this.
We're not - I'm not worried about hitting our head on the market saturation.

I would guess having done this for while that with the economy the way it is, we'll probably look at a little less of kind of that year-end budget flush because my guess is the CFOs are still going to be fairly cautious about if you have got extra money, don't just go spend it, give it back to me.

But at the same point, we definitely will have some. We'll definitely have some transactions that aren't even in the forecast that will come in at the end of the year that always happens and I'm sure it will happen again. It will probably be more muted than in the best of times.

So any weakness we saw was really around capacity upgrades, not about losing business, not about price atrophy it was about that and also a little bit on - we've got a very aggressive effort to do competitive replacements in new product sales and that grew very nicely but it's still a little behind where we wanted it to be. But other than that it was basically in line with what we thought.
And we expect the lumpiness to return to the positive in the second half.

We mentioned in the Defense Department example where UCS code where the software that manages UCS was part of that proposal, the software that's in the OEM agreement the same software that's in the agreement. But yet, in this you really saw the full BSM suite as part of it with atrium technologies, with automation technologies, run book automation, with remedy technologies and service support in there.

I will tell you that the - it is large deal but there is more large deals but it's also the 500,000 to 1 million has been improving now for a long time.

Our sales force is very well trained in how to sell these broad ranging solutions, I think it's eight out of the top ten multiple product lines, the - I think larger transactions again long term does, of course, add a little more excitement, potentially, to the business.
But right now, I think, it's still - it's still a game of a lot of medium size fish and not whale hunting. We are not - we don’t need whales to make the business work like MSM certainly does.
And in the sales force is I think brilliant. I think we have a brilliant sales force. I mean to give you a case in point, if you remember some over the past several earnings calls we talked about how Europe came on and was doing such a great job, but then North America was lagging. Well now this quarter we didn't see that at all.
We saw a North America had a really solid quarter. So we've seen now worldwide solid performance across the geographies for several quarters we've seen the entire product portfolio, all the major product lines delivering strong double digit growth.
You're seeing the deal count from 50 - 500,000 to 1 million growing nicely from 1 million and above growing nicely. And you're not seeing whales making the - all the difference to the deals. It's all of those things happening together. So geographic balance, product line balance, and you've have SaaS in there.
By the as an example the deal at Adobe was a remedy on demand, our SaaS offering for remedy but it was an entire BSM story with CMDB with the entire product line basically integrated into our remedy product line.
So there's an example of the flexibility that we have in our sales force. This was a company that really did almost no business with BMC was very small if at all, and we’re trying to find if it did any business with us up to this point and now they’ve basically are standardizing on our - on almost our entire portfolio across the board and our sales team just did a fantastic job of that and there's plenty of stories like that.
So I am very, very - I feel very good about our sales force ability to sell our products.

The way that we're scaling up the sales force and the way we've been adding productive heads essentially requires and the way we're giving the salespeople territories where there's lots of new customers out there that they need to go call on and that's one of the most exciting areas that we see, is new customers that we weren't doing much business with coming online.
With certainly the SaaS offerings, vast majority of these deals, and we had some great SaaS wins with customers we’ve never done business with before, very competitive by the way but we won often times with our competitors both large and small dropping price to try to win the deal and we beat them on functionality, we beat them on capability, we beat them on our ability to integrate with a more complex, with a more complete product line attached to it in the future and we did about 50% of the deals we did with remedy and 50% we did was with - on the service desk on Force.com.
And so we're out there selling to new customers as well as existing customers. We'll always do more business with new - I mean with existing because we're an enterprise company and we know who they are. But we are doing very nicely in new.

BMC performed very well during the second quarter, and we're seeing strength across many areas of our business. A few highlights for the quarter. Total bookings grew 5% to $453 million. License bookings grew 23% to $221 million. Revenue was up 9% to $502 million. Cash flow from operations increased 36% to $127 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 24% to $0.82 per share, and our balance sheet remains strong with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $1.8 billion in deferred revenue. That's a snapshot of our overall financial performance. Let me turn next to provide a brief overview of our ESM and MSM business units performance during the second quarter.
Our ESM business had another strong quarter with robust year-over-year growth in ESM bookings across most geographic areas and all product disciplines. ESM license bookings increased 32% from the year ago quarter. We had 31 ESM transactions over $1 million in license bookings, up over 50% from a year ago. Over half of these largest transactions were multi-discipline license transactions. Major ESM wins during the second quarter included Adobe, Hospital Corporation of America, Harris Corporation and Swisscom IT Services. We are also encouraged to see continued strong growth in our midsize transactions. The number of ESM license transactions between $500,000 and $1 million increased by 22% compared to last year. This is the fifth straight quarter in which we've seen deals in this range grow by double digits.
Looking at our Mainframe business, MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were up 2%. MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis after normalizing for contract length were up 3%. During the first half of the year, capacity upgrade volume was slightly below its usual pace. We may have been affected in the first half by customer anticipation of IBM's new zEnterprise mainframes, which began shipping in September. We expect availability of this powerful platform certainly to help our performance as we enter the second half of the year. We hope to capture this momentum and any pent-up demand. As you may know, we announced our support for the new IBM system last quarter.
During the quarter, we added 18 new customers to the MSM install base and expanded our relationship with 58 existing customers by adding new products to their portfolios. Some wins include the Internal Revenue Service, Korea Exchange Bank, Sanofi-aventis, Thomson Reuters and the United States Postal Service. That provides an overview of our financial and business unit performance during the quarter. 
I also want to highlight a few of the key trends that are driving our results. One of the major factors is customer adoption of cloud computing. There’s no question that the interest around cloud computing is very high. The fact is cloud computing is real. It's here, and it's a very attractive proposition for enterprises today. That's because it can help them be more agile and flexible in managing and growing their businesses with reduced cost and improved efficiency. It does so by enabling IT departments to provide and deliver services and to quickly scale those services with more automation and without worrying about adding more to their IT infrastructures. While customers are excited about the benefits of cloud computing, they are not about to get rid of the investments they've already made. They need a practical solution that extends and builds upon their existing infrastructures, IT processes and service offerings. That's where we come in. We help enterprises and service providers more effectively plan, build and manage cloud computing as an integral part of their IT infrastructure. Unlike other key technology trends, where IT management lags market development, our cloud solutions are one of the drivers of this trend. That's important because both cloud computing and virtualization are complex and can drive up operating costs even as they drive down capital expenditures. 
A case in point is BMC's Cloud Lifecycle Management. Our single integrated solution that allows service providers and enterprise IT customers to deliver superior services through public, private and hybrid clouds. BMC Cloud Lifecycle Management helps customer establish their cloud environment by providing a catalog that presents service offerings, a self-service portal for procuring resources, a comprehensive provisioning engine to dynamically build the cloud and management capabilities to control the cloud. Unlike products from other IT vendors, our solutions manage the broadest range of computing, storage, network, virtualization and software solutions. Automatically provisioning the full stack of cloud services is not just for one technology. 
We operate truly vendor-neutral platform. This commitment to heterogeneity combined with our BSM [Business Service Management] best practices is a very attractive value proposition for customers migrating to the cloud. BMC's cloud strategy allows customers to achieve the benefits of cloud computing without introducing new silos, disrupting IT operations or forcing a vendor lock-in for hardware, services or the virtualization platform itself.
During the second quarter, we won a total of 14 cloud deals including CGI and Adobe, which was our first joint cloud win with Dell. What's more, we had a long list of cloud-related opportunities that positions us well for the second half. In addition to winning new business from customers, we're also winning MindShare among industry thought leaders regarding cloud management. A recent Forrester report entitled “You Are Not Ready for Internal Cloud” makes this clear. The report states, “BMC solutions are cloud-ready today.” We standardize management on the most commonly repeated operating procedures. We fully automated deployment, and we're providing self-service access for cloud users. We think there is a significant potential for us in cloud management, and we're continuing to invest in our capabilities both through internal development and acquisitions. 
During the quarter, we announced BMC's Control-M 7, a new version of the industry-leading solution that automates the management of dynamic and static workloads across applications, as well as physical, virtual and cloud platforms. It includes dynamic workload management, a capability that automatically maps workloads to IT priorities, using policies to react to real-time business needs. In addition, BMC's Control-M 7 helps harness cloud environments, providing the elasticity needed to cost-effectively support fluctuating workloads. 
In October, BMC acquired the software business of Neptuny, a leading provider of capacity management and IT performance optimization solutions. The addition of Neptuny's technology extends BMC's exiting leadership in capacity management and enhances BMC's dynamic BSM portfolio and cloud management offerings. With Neptuny, our capacity management solutions allow our customers to correlate changes in business requirements with changes in our IT infrastructure. As customers anticipate business changes, they can test scenarios for optimizing their infrastructure and make those changes, allocating capacity across physical to physical, physical to virtual, virtual to virtual, virtual to cloud and cloud to cloud environments, essentially every combination of physical, virtual and cloud resources to simultaneously improve their service levels and reduce capital expenditures. 
Our cloud strategy and solutions underscore the leadership and vision we're bringing across the board in helping enterprises improve how they manage IT. This is also demonstrated by the recognition we continue to win among industry analysts. Gartner's recent report entitled “BMC Software IT Operations Management: Vision, Strategy, Strengths and Challenges” evaluates BMC's enterprise IT management product offerings and BMC's strategic position in the global marketplace. In its report, Gartner concluded that BMC has a consistent, strong BSM vision that simultaneously addresses the need for IT alignment and efficiency. In addition to our cloud offerings, I would like to provide some perspective on three other initiatives that are driving our leadership in BSM, our ITSM offerings, our software-as-a-service solutions and Cisco's UCS. 
First, ITSM. The new era of IT service management is about having a full menu of flexible options to meet the needs of the enterprise, whether large or small, expanding or contracting, on premise or on-demand, physical or virtual. To address these needs, we launched product enhancements during the quarter that enable greater flexibility and choice for our customers when it comes to tailoring an ITSM option for their particular situation. These enhancements offer standardized processes such as embedded ITIL based best practices, full platform integration and enhanced web reporting.
One of the ways we're working to broaden and leverage our ITSM leadership is through our SaaS offerings. These solutions, which include a full suite Remedy OnDemand and a streamlined powerful ServiceDesk on Force.com, are beginning to gain serious traction. Though they are still in a relatively early stage, we like what we see. We're very encouraged that we had 18 wins for our SaaS offerings in the quarter and expect demand for these solutions to further ramp up in the second half. We took steps to further enhance our SaaS offerings by integrating salesforce.com's Chatter 2 environment into the ServiceDesk on Force.com solutions. It enables collaboration and mobility across the IT department, resulting in higher productivity.
Let me move next to discuss Cisco and their UCS solution. As you know, BMC's management tools help to provision, configure and manage Cisco's Unified Computing System. We're now beginning to see some enterprise deployments and are happy to report to you on a couple of the larger deals that closed this quarter. The Department of Defense's Defense Media Activity selected a comprehensive solution incorporating BMC, Cisco and Vmware technologies for their consolidated data center. The win comes to us from Force 3, a trusted provider in Federal security, unified communications and data center solutions. In addition, we recently announced the win with Monsanto Company, a leading global provider of agricultural products, who selected BMC for a large-scale BSM deployment to reduce system downtime by improving the way IT manages changes to the network. The company is working with BMC and the Cisco UCS system to achieve its goal of 70% server virtualization. 
So to summarize the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we had another strong quarter of business and financial performance. This solid performance was driven by our leadership in providing solutions that customers need, whether it's managing the data center, improving IT operations, utilizing a SaaS solution for IT service management or implementing virtualization in cloud computing. Based on our performance so far and our expectations for the next two quarters, we will raise our full year expectation for fiscal 2011. 
I'll talk more about our current outlook for Fiscal '11 later in the call. But first, Steve Solcher will provide more insight into our financial results. Steve?"

I'm very pleased with our company's business and financial results in the second quarter and in the first half of fiscal 2011. We generated solid broad-based top line growth in a seasonally tough quarter. We",1769,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon to everyone. I'm very pleased with our company's business and financial results in the second quarter and in the first half of fiscal 2011. We generated solid broad-based top line growth in a seasonally tough quarter. We're investing in those areas of our business with strong growth potential, while remaining disciplined with regards to our expense structure, resulting in strong growth in earnings and cash flow from operations.
Given our strong first half performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, our full year expectations have improved. A key driver of this strong first half performance is bookings growth, in particular, ESM license bookings growth, which has been strong both geographically, as well as across all product disciplines. This quarter, for example, was the second quarter in a row in which license bookings in each ESM product discipline grew by double-digit percentages. We remain focused on accelerating top line growth in converting those incremental bookings and revenues into increased earnings and cash flow. 
Non-GAAP net earnings and cash flow from operations grew by 12% and 18% respectively in the first half. Our performance is indicative of the operating leverage we have in our business, which should enable us to drive further improvement in operating income and margin in the second half of this fiscal year, while at the same time, enabling us to increase our investment in future growth initiatives. This broad-based growth, coupled with our operating leverage, is providing us the opportunity to plan for sound and consistent growth both short and long term. With that, let me turn to our results for operating income and EPS.
In the second quarter, non-GAAP operating income increased by 9% to $191 million from $175 million in the second quarter of last year. Non-GAAP operating margin remained flat at 38%. For the first half of fiscal 2011, non-GAAP operating income increased 8% from $323 million to $348  million. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first half was 36%, up one percentage point.
Please refer to Slide 5 for highlights of our ESM and MSM business unit operating results. ESM's non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter increased 9% to $76 million. ESM's operating margin was 25%, a slight decrease compared to the year ago quarter, largely due to a year-over-year decline in net capitalized software development costs. For the first half, ESM's non-GAAP operating income increased 26% and ESM's operating margin was up three percentage points to 24%. We expect continued year-over-year improvements in ESM's profitability in the second half of the fiscal year.
MSM's non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter increased by 10% to $115 million. MSM's non-GAAP operating margin was 60%, up four percentage points compared to the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP net earnings for the second quarter were $148 million, an increase of 20% from the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.82, up 24% from the year ago quarter. This reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 23% for the quarter. For the first half, non-GAAP net earnings increased 12% to $262 million, and non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 15% to $1.44. GAAP operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $144 million compared to $135 million in the year ago quarter. GAAP net earnings and diluted EPS were $132 million and $0.73 compared to $94 million and $0.50 in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. These results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the second quarter of $181 million compared to $187 million in the year ago quarter. 
Turning now to bookings. In the second quarter, total bookings of $453 million were up 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis, compared to the year ago quarter. Total bookings for the first half were up 9% to $896 million. Total license bookings for the quarter increased 23% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis to $221 million. For the first half, license bookings rose 24% to $356 million. Total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were $2 billion, up 11% compared to the year ago quarter. The weighted average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.18 years, up from 2.09 years in the year ago quarter. After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the second quarter were $928 million, up 7% from the year ago quarter and up two percentage points from the first quarter. Please see Slide 7 in our presentation.
Now let me turn to the bookings performance of each of our business units. For our ESM business unit, license bookings are the best measure of performance. We generated strong growth in our ESM business with ESM license bookings at $144 million in the second quarter, up 32% from the year ago quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2011, ESM license bookings were up 35% to $246 million. I'm pleased to highlight the strong performance we're seeing in the U.S. in our ESM business and the broad-based double-digit growth across all ESM product disciplines.
Turning to the MSM business unit. We believe MSM is best evaluated on the basis of total and annualized bookings over their trailing 12 months. In the second quarter, total MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis increased 2% to $754 million and had an average contract length of 2.93 years. After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were $257 million, up 3% from $249 million in the year ago quarter. We expect total MSM bookings to be up in the low single digits for the full fiscal year. 
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $502 million, up 9% on both a reported and constant currency basis from $462 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. ESM's total revenue was up 13% to $309 million, and MSM's total revenue was up 3% to $193 million. License revenue in the second quarter was $208 million, an increase of 20% from the year ago quarter. ESM license revenue was $131 million, up 24% from the year ago quarter. MSM license revenue increased by 13% to $77 million.
During the second quarter, the percentage of license bookings that was deferred was 49%, down from 56% in the year ago quarter. For the second quarter, maintenance revenue was $253 million, a decrease of 2% from the year ago quarter and relatively flat compared to the first quarter. The slight decline in maintenance revenue during the second quarter is largely due to the lagging impact of license bookings only growing 1% in fiscal 2010. The additional maintenance revenue related to these new license bookings was not enough to offset the decline from our normal level of renewals. Our maintenance renewal rates and attach rates in both our MSM and ESM businesses have been relatively stable over the past several years. Given our strong license bookings performance in the first half of fiscal 2011, we expect gradual sequential improvements in maintenance revenue in the second half of fiscal 2011.
ESM maintenance revenue was $136 million, down 1% compared to the year ago quarter. MSM maintenance revenue was $116 million, down 3% from the second quarter of fiscal 2010. For the first half of fiscal 2011, maintenance revenue for both units was roughly flat compared to the year ago period. During the second quarter, we continued to see improvements in our professional services organization. Professional services revenue, which is included in the ESM business unit, increased by 37% to $42 million from the year ago quarter. And our Professional Services business was profitable in the second quarter, with a non-GAAP operating margin of $3 million compared to a slight loss a year ago.
Moving next to operating expenses. During the second quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $311 million, up 8% from $287 million in the year ago quarter. This increase reflects the focused investments we've made in ESM sales, R&D and professional services organizations.
Looking at our business units, ESM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $233 million, an increase of 14% compared to the year ago quarter. MSM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $78 million, down 6% from the year ago quarter. Other income in the second quarter was slightly positive compared to a $2 million loss a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the second quarter was $601 million, up $13 million sequentially from $588 million. During the second quarter, we deferred $107 million of license revenue, a 49% of license bookings and recognized $96 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. Given normal seasonality, total deferred revenue decreased by $50 million sequentially to $1.8 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 54% of total deferred revenue.
Software development costs on the balance sheet were $171 million as we capitalized $29 million and amortized $18 million during the quarter. Capitalized software development costs declined $3 million sequentially compared to the first quarter, and we expect continued declines for the remainder of the fiscal year. Cash and investments at the end of the quarter totaled $1.5 billion, up $50 million from the previous quarter. Our net cash position is $1.2 billion. 
For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $127 million, up 36% from $93 million in the year ago quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2011, cash flow from operations increased by 18% to $295 million. During the quarter, we remained committed to share repurchases. We repurchased 2 million shares for a total of $75 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $846 million remaining in our current share repurchase program. 
So let me briefly sum up the quarter. BMC's strong top and bottom line performance across our key financial metrics in the second quarter and the first half positions us well as we enter the second half. We are generating broad-based growth across our business. And our cost discipline and operating leverage positions us well for continued improvement in our operating margins and operating income, while at the same time enabling us to increase our investment in our future growth initiatives. Our solid results in the first half and our outlook for the remainder of the year puts us on track to exceed our previously stated financial goals for the year. It is also providing us the opportunity to plan for sound and consistent growth both short and long term. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob to discuss our revised expectations for the year and for his concluding remarks."

As I mentioned, given our financial results in the first half of the year and our expectations for the next two quarters, we are raising our expectations for fiscal 2011. We now expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.92 to $3.02. At the midpoint, this would represent a 12% increase over last year compared to the 9% increase in our original guidance. 
Our non-GAAP diluted EPS estimate excludes an estimated range of $0.58 to $0.63 per diluted share for non-GAAP adjustments, including share-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets, severance, exit costs and related charges, as well as the related tax impacts of these items and certain discrete tax items. The assumptions underlying this full year fiscal 2011 estimate include: bookings growth in the mid- to high-single digits, compared to our original expectation of mid-single digits bookings growth; ESM license bookings growth in the high teens; total revenue growth in the mid-single digits; at current rates, we do not expect currency to materially impact full year bookings or revenue growth rates; continued improvement in non-GAAP operating margin; a license bookings ratable rate in the low 50% range; other income estimated to be $10 million lower than a year ago, reflecting current market conditions; weighted shares outstanding, slightly down compared to the prior year; and a non-GAAP tax rate of 25%.
We now expect full year fiscal 2011 cash flows from operations to be between $675 million and $725 million compared to our original expectation of $660 million to $710 million. At the midpoint, this would represent a 10% increase over last year. We also now expect by the third quarter to achieve close to 60% of our fiscal year cash flow from operations goal, which is higher than the 52% achieved to the third quarter of fiscal 2010. We will provide more detailed overview of the company strategy, financial performance and business initiatives at our Investor Day conference on December 14 in New York City. We hope to see you all there.

One is that most of the largest customers, particularly the service providers and the global outsourcers and systems integrators, are developing new cloud environments because they want to deploy new offerings. They have new revenue engines they're trying to develop around a self-service cloud for application stacks that they want to offer. And that's almost virgin territory for us. We're able to go into those, and there's some massive buildout. You've probably read stories about some of the huge investments that some of the service providers are making in data centers. And we're talking to different people even there. In one case, we're talking to the chief marketing officer of a Fortune 10 company, who is a telco that's moving in that direction. So I think there's lots of room around cloud. I think that our success across our product lines this quarter, I really think we're still just scratching the surface in terms of most of the product sets. I mean, even Remedy, which is our arguably one of our most widely adopted products, we saw a 27% growth in the Service Support business, which includes Atrium and Remedy in the first half, in license bookings. And the pipeline is building very nicely. There's still plenty of opportunity to grow that business. Automation is really still nascent, even though we're growing that business much faster than support. We're growing that business almost 50% in the first half of the year. We're still just scratching the surface there. And the use cases are still, they're very early use cases. So by the way, I’ll just go ahead and complete the puzzle, assurance, those of you followed us for years, you know the PATROL business, and we told you how that business was going to be reinvigorated with things like ProactiveNet, et cetera. That business is up 45% license bookings in the first half. And so there's plenty of room to grow this. I'm not worried about hitting our head on the market saturation."

We mentioned the Defense Department example, where UCS code, where the -- the software that manages UCS was part of that proposal, the software that's in the OEM agreement, the same software that's in that agreement. But yet in this you really saw the full BSM suite as part of it with Atrium technologies, with automation technologies, Run Book Automation, with Remedy technologies and our Service Support in there. So you're starting to see a lot of traction on the seeding aspect of it. We've always viewed the UCS relationship as more, and I think we've always been consistent with this, as more than the direct revenue associated with that but rather as a seeding mechanism that bring us into other transactions, and we're clearly seeing that. We're clearly seeing with some of their largest customers in the world where we're jointly in talking to those customers about the full breadth of the product, and they are actively recommending us to many of their largest customers in the world very directly for the full broad portfolio."

I think larger transactions, again, long-term does, of course, add a little more excitement potentially to the business. But right now, I think, it's still a game of a lot of medium-sized fish and not whale hunting. We don't need whales to make the business work like MSM certainly does. And the sales force is, I think, brilliant. I think we have a brilliant sales force. I mean, give you a case in point. If you remember, over the past several earnings calls, we talked about how Europe came along and was doing such a great job, but that North America was lagging. Well, this quarter we didn't see that at all. We saw North America had a really solid quarter, so we've seen now worldwide solid performance across the geographies for several quarters. We've seen the entire product portfolio, all the major product lines, delivering strong double-digit growth. You're seeing the deal count from $500,000 to $1 million growing nicely, from $1 million and above growing nicely, and you're not seeing whales making all the difference to the deals. It's all of those things happening together. So, geographic balance, product line balance, and you got SaaS in there. By the way, as an example, the deal at Adobe was our Remedy OnDemand, our SaaS offering for Remedy but it was an entire BSM story with the CMDB, with entire product line, basically, integrated into our Remedy product line. So there's an example of the flexibility that we have in our sales force. This was a company that really did almost no business with BMC. It was a very small, if at all, we're trying to find if they did any business with us up to this point, and now they basically are standardizing on almost our entire portfolio across the board, and our sales team just did a fantastic job of that.

Certainly, these SaaS offerings, vast majority of these SaaS deals, and we had some great SaaS wins, was customers we've never done any business with before, very competitive, by the way, but we won oftentimes with our competitors both large and small dropping price to try to win the deal. And we beat them on functionality, we beat them on capability, we beat them on our ability to integrate with a more complete product line attached to it in the future. And we did about 50% of the deals, we did with Remedy and 50% we did with on the ServiceDesk on Force.com. And so we're out there selling to new customers as well as existing customers.

BMC performed very well during the second quarter, and we're seeing strength across many areas of our business. A few highlights for the quarter. Total bookings grew 5% to $453 million. License bookings grew 23% to $221 million. Revenue was up 9% to $502 million. Cash flow from operations increased 36% to $127 million. Non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 24% to $0.82 per share, and our balance sheet remains strong with approximately $1.5 billion in cash and investments and $1.8 billion in deferred revenue. That's a snapshot of our overall financial performance. Let me turn next to provide a brief overview of our ESM and MSM business units performance during the second quarter.
Our ESM business had another strong quarter with robust year-over-year growth in ESM bookings across most geographic areas and all product disciplines. ESM license bookings increased 32% from the year ago quarter. We had 31 ESM transactions over $1 million in license bookings, up over 50% from a year ago. Over half of these largest transactions were multi-discipline license transactions. Major ESM wins during the second quarter included Adobe, Hospital Corporation of America, Harris Corporation and Swisscom IT Services. We are also encouraged to see continued strong growth in our midsize transactions. The number of ESM license transactions between $500,000 and $1 million increased by 22% compared to last year. This is the fifth straight quarter in which we've seen deals in this range grow by double digits.
Looking at our Mainframe business, MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were up 2%. MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis after normalizing for contract length were up 3%. During the first half of the year, capacity upgrade volume was slightly below its usual pace. We may have been affected in the first half by customer anticipation of IBM's new zEnterprise mainframes, which began shipping in September. We expect availability of this powerful platform certainly to help our performance as we enter the second half of the year. We hope to capture this momentum and any pent-up demand. As you may know, we announced our support for the new IBM system last quarter.
During the quarter, we added 18 new customers to the MSM install base and expanded our relationship with 58 existing customers by adding new products to their portfolios. Some wins include the Internal Revenue Service, Korea Exchange Bank, Sanofi-aventis, Thomson Reuters and the United States Postal Service. That provides an overview of our financial and business unit performance during the quarter. 
I also want to highlight a few of the key trends that are driving our results. One of the major factors is customer adoption of cloud computing. There’s no question that the interest around cloud computing is very high. The fact is cloud computing is real. It's here, and it's a very attractive proposition for enterprises today. That's because it can help them be more agile and flexible in managing and growing their businesses with reduced cost and improved efficiency. It does so by enabling IT departments to provide and deliver services and to quickly scale those services with more automation and without worrying about adding more to their IT infrastructures. While customers are excited about the benefits of cloud computing, they are not about to get rid of the investments they've already made. They need a practical solution that extends and builds upon their existing infrastructures, IT processes and service offerings. That's where we come in. We help enterprises and service providers more effectively plan, build and manage cloud computing as an integral part of their IT infrastructure. Unlike other key technology trends, where IT management lags market development, our cloud solutions are one of the drivers of this trend. That's important because both cloud computing and virtualization are complex and can drive up operating costs even as they drive down capital expenditures. 
A case in point is BMC's Cloud Lifecycle Management. Our single integrated solution that allows service providers and enterprise IT customers to deliver superior services through public, private and hybrid clouds. BMC Cloud Lifecycle Management helps customer establish their cloud environment by providing a catalog that presents service offerings, a self-service portal for procuring resources, a comprehensive provisioning engine to dynamically build the cloud and management capabilities to control the cloud. Unlike products from other IT vendors, our solutions manage the broadest range of computing, storage, network, virtualization and software solutions. Automatically provisioning the full stack of cloud services is not just for one technology. 
We operate truly vendor-neutral platform. This commitment to heterogeneity combined with our BSM [Business Service Management] best practices is a very attractive value proposition for customers migrating to the cloud. BMC's cloud strategy allows customers to achieve the benefits of cloud computing without introducing new silos, disrupting IT operations or forcing a vendor lock-in for hardware, services or the virtualization platform itself.
During the second quarter, we won a total of 14 cloud deals including CGI and Adobe, which was our first joint cloud win with Dell. What's more, we had a long list of cloud-related opportunities that positions us well for the second half. In addition to winning new business from customers, we're also winning MindShare among industry thought leaders regarding cloud management. A recent Forrester report entitled “You Are Not Ready for Internal Cloud” makes this clear. The report states, “BMC solutions are cloud-ready today.” We standardize management on the most commonly repeated operating procedures. We fully automated deployment, and we're providing self-service access for cloud users. We think there is a significant potential for us in cloud management, and we're continuing to invest in our capabilities both through internal development and acquisitions. 
During the quarter, we announced BMC's Control-M 7, a new version of the industry-leading solution that automates the management of dynamic and static workloads across applications, as well as physical, virtual and cloud platforms. It includes dynamic workload management, a capability that automatically maps workloads to IT priorities, using policies to react to real-time business needs. In addition, BMC's Control-M 7 helps harness cloud environments, providing the elasticity needed to cost-effectively support fluctuating workloads. 
In October, BMC acquired the software business of Neptuny, a leading provider of capacity management and IT performance optimization solutions. The addition of Neptuny's technology extends BMC's exiting leadership in capacity management and enhances BMC's dynamic BSM portfolio and cloud management offerings. With Neptuny, our capacity management solutions allow our customers to correlate changes in business requirements with changes in our IT infrastructure. As customers anticipate business changes, they can test scenarios for optimizing their infrastructure and make those changes, allocating capacity across physical to physical, physical to virtual, virtual to virtual, virtual to cloud and cloud to cloud environments, essentially every combination of physical, virtual and cloud resources to simultaneously improve their service levels and reduce capital expenditures. 
Our cloud strategy and solutions underscore the leadership and vision we're bringing across the board in helping enterprises improve how they manage IT. This is also demonstrated by the recognition we continue to win among industry analysts. Gartner's recent report entitled “BMC Software IT Operations Management: Vision, Strategy, Strengths and Challenges” evaluates BMC's enterprise IT management product offerings and BMC's strategic position in the global marketplace. In its report, Gartner concluded that BMC has a consistent, strong BSM vision that simultaneously addresses the need for IT alignment and efficiency. In addition to our cloud offerings, I would like to provide some perspective on three other initiatives that are driving our leadership in BSM, our ITSM offerings, our software-as-a-service solutions and Cisco's UCS. 
First, ITSM. The new era of IT service management is about having a full menu of flexible options to meet the needs of the enterprise, whether large or small, expanding or contracting, on premise or on-demand, physical or virtual. To address these needs, we launched product enhancements during the quarter that enable greater flexibility and choice for our customers when it comes to tailoring an ITSM option for their particular situation. These enhancements offer standardized processes such as embedded ITIL based best practices, full platform integration and enhanced web reporting.
One of the ways we're working to broaden and leverage our ITSM leadership is through our SaaS offerings. These solutions, which include a full suite Remedy OnDemand and a streamlined powerful ServiceDesk on Force.com, are beginning to gain serious traction. Though they are still in a relatively early stage, we like what we see. We're very encouraged that we had 18 wins for our SaaS offerings in the quarter and expect demand for these solutions to further ramp up in the second half. We took steps to further enhance our SaaS offerings by integrating salesforce.com's Chatter 2 environment into the ServiceDesk on Force.com solutions. It enables collaboration and mobility across the IT department, resulting in higher productivity.
Let me move next to discuss Cisco and their UCS solution. As you know, BMC's management tools help to provision, configure and manage Cisco's Unified Computing System. We're now beginning to see some enterprise deployments and are happy to report to you on a couple of the larger deals that closed this quarter. The Department of Defense's Defense Media Activity selected a comprehensive solution incorporating BMC, Cisco and Vmware technologies for their consolidated data center. The win comes to us from Force 3, a trusted provider in Federal security, unified communications and data center solutions. In addition, we recently announced the win with Monsanto Company, a leading global provider of agricultural products, who selected BMC for a large-scale BSM deployment to reduce system downtime by improving the way IT manages changes to the network. The company is working with BMC and the Cisco UCS system to achieve its goal of 70% server virtualization. 
So to summarize the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we had another strong quarter of business and financial performance. This solid performance was driven by our leadership in providing solutions that customers need, whether it's managing the data center, improving IT operations, utilizing a SaaS solution for IT service management or implementing virtualization in cloud computing. Based on our performance so far and our expectations for the next two quarters, we will raise our full year expectation for fiscal 2011. 
I'll talk more about our current outlook for Fiscal '11 later in the call. But first, Steve Solcher will provide more insight into our financial results. Steve?"

I'm very pleased with our company's business and financial results in the second quarter and in the first half of fiscal 2011. We generated solid broad-based top line growth in a seasonally tough quarter. We",1769,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon to everyone. I'm very pleased with our company's business and financial results in the second quarter and in the first half of fiscal 2011. We generated solid broad-based top line growth in a seasonally tough quarter. We're investing in those areas of our business with strong growth potential, while remaining disciplined with regards to our expense structure, resulting in strong growth in earnings and cash flow from operations.
Given our strong first half performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, our full year expectations have improved. A key driver of this strong first half performance is bookings growth, in particular, ESM license bookings growth, which has been strong both geographically, as well as across all product disciplines. This quarter, for example, was the second quarter in a row in which license bookings in each ESM product discipline grew by double-digit percentages. We remain focused on accelerating top line growth in converting those incremental bookings and revenues into increased earnings and cash flow. 
Non-GAAP net earnings and cash flow from operations grew by 12% and 18% respectively in the first half. Our performance is indicative of the operating leverage we have in our business, which should enable us to drive further improvement in operating income and margin in the second half of this fiscal year, while at the same time, enabling us to increase our investment in future growth initiatives. This broad-based growth, coupled with our operating leverage, is providing us the opportunity to plan for sound and consistent growth both short and long term. With that, let me turn to our results for operating income and EPS.
In the second quarter, non-GAAP operating income increased by 9% to $191 million from $175 million in the second quarter of last year. Non-GAAP operating margin remained flat at 38%. For the first half of fiscal 2011, non-GAAP operating income increased 8% from $323 million to $348  million. Non-GAAP operating margin for the first half was 36%, up one percentage point.
Please refer to Slide 5 for highlights of our ESM and MSM business unit operating results. ESM's non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter increased 9% to $76 million. ESM's operating margin was 25%, a slight decrease compared to the year ago quarter, largely due to a year-over-year decline in net capitalized software development costs. For the first half, ESM's non-GAAP operating income increased 26% and ESM's operating margin was up three percentage points to 24%. We expect continued year-over-year improvements in ESM's profitability in the second half of the fiscal year.
MSM's non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter increased by 10% to $115 million. MSM's non-GAAP operating margin was 60%, up four percentage points compared to the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP net earnings for the second quarter were $148 million, an increase of 20% from the second quarter of fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.82, up 24% from the year ago quarter. This reflects a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 23% for the quarter. For the first half, non-GAAP net earnings increased 12% to $262 million, and non-GAAP diluted EPS increased 15% to $1.44. GAAP operating income in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 was $144 million compared to $135 million in the year ago quarter. GAAP net earnings and diluted EPS were $132 million and $0.73 compared to $94 million and $0.50 in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. These results reflect diluted shares outstanding in the second quarter of $181 million compared to $187 million in the year ago quarter. 
Turning now to bookings. In the second quarter, total bookings of $453 million were up 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis, compared to the year ago quarter. Total bookings for the first half were up 9% to $896 million. Total license bookings for the quarter increased 23% year-over-year on both a reported and constant currency basis to $221 million. For the first half, license bookings rose 24% to $356 million. Total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis were $2 billion, up 11% compared to the year ago quarter. The weighted average contract length for total bookings on a trailing 12-month basis was 2.18 years, up from 2.09 years in the year ago quarter. After normalizing for contract length, trailing 12-month annualized bookings for the second quarter were $928 million, up 7% from the year ago quarter and up two percentage points from the first quarter. Please see Slide 7 in our presentation.
Now let me turn to the bookings performance of each of our business units. For our ESM business unit, license bookings are the best measure of performance. We generated strong growth in our ESM business with ESM license bookings at $144 million in the second quarter, up 32% from the year ago quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2011, ESM license bookings were up 35% to $246 million. I'm pleased to highlight the strong performance we're seeing in the U.S. in our ESM business and the broad-based double-digit growth across all ESM product disciplines.
Turning to the MSM business unit. We believe MSM is best evaluated on the basis of total and annualized bookings over their trailing 12 months. In the second quarter, total MSM bookings on a trailing 12-month basis increased 2% to $754 million and had an average contract length of 2.93 years. After normalizing for contract length, total annualized MSM bookings for the trailing 12 months were $257 million, up 3% from $249 million in the year ago quarter. We expect total MSM bookings to be up in the low single digits for the full fiscal year. 
Turning to revenue. Total revenue for the quarter was $502 million, up 9% on both a reported and constant currency basis from $462 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. ESM's total revenue was up 13% to $309 million, and MSM's total revenue was up 3% to $193 million. License revenue in the second quarter was $208 million, an increase of 20% from the year ago quarter. ESM license revenue was $131 million, up 24% from the year ago quarter. MSM license revenue increased by 13% to $77 million.
During the second quarter, the percentage of license bookings that was deferred was 49%, down from 56% in the year ago quarter. For the second quarter, maintenance revenue was $253 million, a decrease of 2% from the year ago quarter and relatively flat compared to the first quarter. The slight decline in maintenance revenue during the second quarter is largely due to the lagging impact of license bookings only growing 1% in fiscal 2010. The additional maintenance revenue related to these new license bookings was not enough to offset the decline from our normal level of renewals. Our maintenance renewal rates and attach rates in both our MSM and ESM businesses have been relatively stable over the past several years. Given our strong license bookings performance in the first half of fiscal 2011, we expect gradual sequential improvements in maintenance revenue in the second half of fiscal 2011.
ESM maintenance revenue was $136 million, down 1% compared to the year ago quarter. MSM maintenance revenue was $116 million, down 3% from the second quarter of fiscal 2010. For the first half of fiscal 2011, maintenance revenue for both units was roughly flat compared to the year ago period. During the second quarter, we continued to see improvements in our professional services organization. Professional services revenue, which is included in the ESM business unit, increased by 37% to $42 million from the year ago quarter. And our Professional Services business was profitable in the second quarter, with a non-GAAP operating margin of $3 million compared to a slight loss a year ago.
Moving next to operating expenses. During the second quarter, non-GAAP operating expenses were $311 million, up 8% from $287 million in the year ago quarter. This increase reflects the focused investments we've made in ESM sales, R&D and professional services organizations.
Looking at our business units, ESM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $233 million, an increase of 14% compared to the year ago quarter. MSM's non-GAAP operating expenses were $78 million, down 6% from the year ago quarter. Other income in the second quarter was slightly positive compared to a $2 million loss a year ago.
Turning to the balance sheet. Total deferred license revenue at the end of the second quarter was $601 million, up $13 million sequentially from $588 million. During the second quarter, we deferred $107 million of license revenue, a 49% of license bookings and recognized $96 million of deferred license revenue from the balance sheet. Given normal seasonality, total deferred revenue decreased by $50 million sequentially to $1.8 billion. The current portion of deferred revenue now stands at 54% of total deferred revenue.
Software development costs on the balance sheet were $171 million as we capitalized $29 million and amortized $18 million during the quarter. Capitalized software development costs declined $3 million sequentially compared to the first quarter, and we expect continued declines for the remainder of the fiscal year. Cash and investments at the end of the quarter totaled $1.5 billion, up $50 million from the previous quarter. Our net cash position is $1.2 billion. 
For the quarter, cash flow from operations was $127 million, up 36% from $93 million in the year ago quarter. For the first half of fiscal 2011, cash flow from operations increased by 18% to $295 million. During the quarter, we remained committed to share repurchases. We repurchased 2 million shares for a total of $75 million. At the end of the second quarter, we had $846 million remaining in our current share repurchase program. 
So let me briefly sum up the quarter. BMC's strong top and bottom line performance across our key financial metrics in the second quarter and the first half positions us well as we enter the second half. We are generating broad-based growth across our business. And our cost discipline and operating leverage positions us well for continued improvement in our operating margins and operating income, while at the same time enabling us to increase our investment in our future growth initiatives. Our solid results in the first half and our outlook for the remainder of the year puts us on track to exceed our previously stated financial goals for the year. It is also providing us the opportunity to plan for sound and consistent growth both short and long term. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Bob to discuss our revised expectations for the year and for his concluding remarks."

As I mentioned, given our financial results in the first half of the year and our expectations for the next two quarters, we are raising our expectations for fiscal 2011. We now expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.92 to $3.02. At the midpoint, this would represent a 12% increase over last year compared to the 9% increase in our original guidance. 
Our non-GAAP diluted EPS estimate excludes an estimated range of $0.58 to $0.63 per diluted share for non-GAAP adjustments, including share-based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets, severance, exit costs and related charges, as well as the related tax impacts of these items and certain discrete tax items. The assumptions underlying this full year fiscal 2011 estimate include: bookings growth in the mid- to high-single digits, compared to our original expectation of mid-single digits bookings growth; ESM license bookings growth in the high teens; total revenue growth in the mid-single digits; at current rates, we do not expect currency to materially impact full year bookings or revenue growth rates; continued improvement in non-GAAP operating margin; a license bookings ratable rate in the low 50% range; other income estimated to be $10 million lower than a year ago, reflecting current market conditions; weighted shares outstanding, slightly down compared to the prior year; and a non-GAAP tax rate of 25%.
We now expect full year fiscal 2011 cash flows from operations to be between $675 million and $725 million compared to our original expectation of $660 million to $710 million. At the midpoint, this would represent a 10% increase over last year. We also now expect by the third quarter to achieve close to 60% of our fiscal year cash flow from operations goal, which is higher than the 52% achieved to the third quarter of fiscal 2010. We will provide more detailed overview of the company strategy, financial performance and business initiatives at our Investor Day conference on December 14 in New York City. We hope to see you all there.

One is that most of the largest customers, particularly the service providers and the global outsourcers and systems integrators, are developing new cloud environments because they want to deploy new offerings. They have new revenue engines they're trying to develop around a self-service cloud for application stacks that they want to offer. And that's almost virgin territory for us. We're able to go into those, and there's some massive buildout. You've probably read stories about some of the huge investments that some of the service providers are making in data centers. And we're talking to different people even there. In one case, we're talking to the chief marketing officer of a Fortune 10 company, who is a telco that's moving in that direction. So I think there's lots of room around cloud. I think that our success across our product lines this quarter, I really think we're still just scratching the surface in terms of most of the product sets. I mean, even Remedy, which is our arguably one of our most widely adopted products, we saw a 27% growth in the Service Support business, which includes Atrium and Remedy in the first half, in license bookings. And the pipeline is building very nicely. There's still plenty of opportunity to grow that business. Automation is really still nascent, even though we're growing that business much faster than support. We're growing that business almost 50% in the first half of the year. We're still just scratching the surface there. And the use cases are still, they're very early use cases. So by the way, I’ll just go ahead and complete the puzzle, assurance, those of you followed us for years, you know the PATROL business, and we told you how that business was going to be reinvigorated with things like ProactiveNet, et cetera. That business is up 45% license bookings in the first half. And so there's plenty of room to grow this. I'm not worried about hitting our head on the market saturation."

And that's not feet on the street, that's productive feet on the street, which means we're not counting the brand-new people that are in the classrooms. It’s people that have been out in the patch for several quarters who are trained up. And so we're in line with that. We will always push for sales productivity enhancements. I think there's really some good room for sales productivity growth for some time as we're still experiencing a little bit, although it's not unusual, but a little bit of a bimodal productivity model within the company, where you've got a solid group of people that are doing very well and then some of the new ones who are doing less well. And as that moves up to a little more of a bell curve, then that should really help deliver some better productivity across the board."

It's still not material to the whole company, but it is certainly something that's becoming larger in quantity.

We mentioned the Defense Department example, where UCS code, where the -- the software that manages UCS was part of that proposal, the software that's in the OEM agreement, the same software that's in that agreement.

So you're starting to see a lot of traction on the seeding aspect of it.

We're clearly seeing with some of their largest customers in the world where we're jointly in talking to those customers about the full breadth of the product, and they are actively recommending us to many of their largest customers in the world very directly for the full broad portfolio."

Our sales force is very well trained in how to sell these broad-ranging solutions. I think it's eight out of the top 10 were multiple product lines. I think larger transactions, again, long-term does, of course, add a little more excitement potentially to the business. But right now, I think, it's still a game of a lot of medium-sized fish and not whale hunting. We don't need whales to make the business work like MSM certainly does. And the sales force is, I think, brilliant. I think we have a brilliant sales force. I mean, give you a case in point. If you remember, over the past several earnings calls, we talked about how Europe came along and was doing such a great job, but that North America was lagging. Well, this quarter we didn't see that at all. We saw North America had a really solid quarter, so we've seen now worldwide solid performance across the geographies for several quarters. We've seen the entire product portfolio, all the major product lines, delivering strong double-digit growth. You're seeing the deal count from $500,000 to $1 million growing nicely, from $1 million and above growing nicely, and you're not seeing whales making all the difference to the deals. It's all of those things happening together. So, geographic balance, product line balance, and you got SaaS in there. By the way, as an example, the deal at Adobe was our Remedy OnDemand, our SaaS offering for Remedy but it was an entire BSM story with the CMDB, with entire product line, basically, integrated into our Remedy product line. So there's an example of the flexibility that we have in our sales force. This was a company that really did almost no business with BMC. It was a very small, if at all, we're trying to find if they did any business with us up to this point, and now they basically are standardizing on almost our entire portfolio across the board, and our sales team just did a fantastic job of that. And there's plenty of stories like that. So I'm very, very -- I feel very good about our sales force ability to sell our products."

Certainly, these SaaS offerings, vast majority of these SaaS deals, and we had some great SaaS wins, was customers we've never done any business with before, very competitive, by the way, but we won oftentimes with our competitors both large and small dropping price to try to win the deal. And we beat them on functionality, we beat them on capability, we beat them on our ability to integrate with a more complete product line attached to it in the future.
