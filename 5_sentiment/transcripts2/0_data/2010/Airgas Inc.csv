Slide 2 will highlight some of the key points I'll cover today and the reason why we believe that we are stronger than ever as a company, on the right track and poised to capitalize as the economy",1497,"Thanks, Jay, and good morning, and thanks for joining us. Slide 2 will highlight some of the key points I'll cover today and the reason why we believe that we are stronger than ever as a company, on the right track and poised to capitalize as the economy recovers.Earnings were slightly below guidance for our third quarter fiscal 2010, and that's clearly not how we like to do things. Nonetheless, our performance was strong. The key factors in the earnings midst were weaker than expected sales during the holiday season, and the cancellation or postponement of plant turnarounds negatively impacting our very profitable Rental Welder business.On the bright side, this quarter marked the first sequential increase in our daily sales rate since our second quarter of fiscal 2009. And we generated record year-to-date free cash flow of $289 million.  In spite of the challenges in our Red-D-Arc Rental Welder business that I just mentioned, our Distribution segment posted healthy results, including a 2% sequential increase in daily sales, and a sequential expansion in operating margin.Our guidance this year has been predicated on a moderate case of sequential economic recovery, and we continue to hold that expectation. It may take more time to unfold than we hoped, but a recovery does seem to be underway across most of our geographies and customer segments.As we conveyed to you at our analyst meeting in December, we are very confident in our ability to drive above market results on the strength of the growth accelerators we outlined: Service to multi-location customers, cross-sell opportunities, our customer service culture, technology implementations, increasing regulation, favorable demographics and demand for supply chain management and other services, including our eCommerce offerings.Our strategic accounts customer base continues to grow, adding mass to our book of business, and our strategic products continue to outperform and effectively diversify our offering and provide stability. As the premier U.S. Packaged Gas distributor, we're in a strong position to capitalize on an improving economy.To recap the third quarter, net earnings for the third quarter were $46.9 million or $0.56 per diluted share. Excluding a $0.05 debt extinguishment charge and a $0.04 multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charge, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.65. This compares to a very strong $0.76 per diluted share last year. Earnings were $0.02 below the bottom of our guided range, primarily due to the unseasonably low sales in our Rental Welder business, which accounted for $0.02, and slower than expected daily sales activity in December, which accounted for another $0.02.Total sales in from the quarter declined 13% to $942 million, driven by a total same-store sales decline of 14%, with price down 3% and volume down 11%. The price declines were most pronounced in our ammonia and welding filler metals products, as declining costs accounted for the price movement. Overall, our gross margins expanded. Gas and Rent same-store sales declined 11%, and Hardgoods, 19%. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 1%.On a sequential basis, total sales declined by 2% from the second quarter, reflecting the impact of fewer selling days and the seasonality of certain businesses in the all other operations segment. Total daily sales increased 1% from the second quarter. In the Distribution segment, we were encouraged by the 2% sequential increase in daily sales.Looking across our geographies, our Pacific Northwest region posted the smallest year-over-year declines, followed by Airgas National Welders, which covers the Carolinas in Southern Virginia. The deepest declines took place in our mid-South and Southwest region, where oil field service activity continues to be slow and in our North Central region where construction activity has tapered off. We continue to benefit from a product mix shift towards Gas and Rent sales, which represent 65% of total sales in the quarter.Year-over-year, comps remain tough for most of our customer segments and will ease next quarter. We were pleased to see a sequential increase in sales to our industrial manufacturing customers. Utilities and Petrochemical, along with our always steady Medical business, posted the strongest sequential growth on a daily sales basis. Activity with our contractor customers that served new construction and repair and maintenance projects decreased sequentially, challenging our Packaged Gas, Hardgoods and Rental Welder business. A lack of funding seems to have brought major projects to a halt and plant turnarounds are being postponed.  Overall, Hardgoods sales continue to be under the most volume pressure, led by steep declines in equipment, which is the only product line we sell that is a capital purchase for our customers.We expect equipment to drop deepest in the downturn, followed by filler metals used in manufacturing. Fortunately, these tend to be the lower margin sales compared to the rest of Hardgoods. Additionally, sales mix from Hardgoods to Gas and Rent drives gross margin expansion as Gas and Rent carry higher gross margins than in Hardgoods. Our Gas gross margin also benefited from lower costs, partially offset by lower prices. Total company margin expanded 220 basis points from last year. This gross margin expansion work in conjunction with our cost-reduction efforts to minimize operating margin erosion. Adjusted for multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charges, our operating margin only dropped 110 basis points to 11.1% from 12.2% last year, and 50 basis points from 11.6% in the second quarter.Cash flow continues to be one of the strengths of our business model. Year-to-date, free cash flow increased to a record $289 million, a 69% increase over the prior year and representing about 10% of our sales. Adjusted cash flow from operations grew 8% from $436 million last year to $470 million this year. And capital spending dropped by 32% to $192 million. Roughly 2/3 of our free cash flow has been used for debt reduction, about $190 million so far.We were pleased to increase our dividend again, as our strong cash flow allows us to reward shareholders while still pursuing our growth strategies. This was our fifth dividend increase in the past three years, and it will result in a 36% increase in dividends per share paid in fiscal 2010 over 2009.Acquisition activity has been slow as potential sellers assess their business in the wake of the downturn. However, our pipeline has been recovering recently as the anticipation of improving business conditions has stirred some interest. Year-to-date, we've acquired five businesses with an aggregate of $47 million in annual revenues.In our largest transaction this year, we acquired Tri-Tech, a very well-run, highly profitable independent distributor, with 16 locations throughout Georgia, Florida and South Carolina, generating $31 million in annual revenue. We also improved our presence and density in Oklahoma and West Texas with our purchase of Fitch Industrial & Welding Supply, a Lawton, Oklahoma-based distributor with around $10 million in annual revenues. Most recently, we added a small distributor in Houston called Champ Sales [ph], representing about $3 million to revenue.Our acquisition activity has historically accelerated during the recovery phase of a business cycle, and we hope that recent developments in the pipeline are signs of sustainable improvement. Our strategy is unchanged, we have the capacity to purchase and integrate quality businesses, and we remained diligent in sourcing transactions. We will continue to evaluate international opportunities as they arise, but our primary focus remains on domestic core products and service offering acquisitions.Looking forward, in the fourth quarter, our Packaged Gas business should pose another sequential improvement, which will be slightly offset by seasonality in the all other operations segment and continued pressure in our Rental Welder business. January sales have us off to a good start, showing slight sequential improvement from last quarter. Actually, Gas sales are up 5% to 6%, and we expect the month of January to end with Hardgoods sales down around 1%.We intend to stay focused on our fundamental strategies, enhance our sales organization and performance and continue to train our associates as we position ourselves to emerge even stronger when recovery does take shape. We have converted many new customers to Airgas over the last 18 months, and we expect that to have a positive impact as the economy continues its recovery.Although we hate to miss our guided earnings range, and believe me, it's especially hard on me, I'm a large shareholder in the company. And I take this very, very seriously, but we're a daily sales company, and its very, very hard to know what our sales are from quarter to quarter, and especially in this quarter which ends with the holiday season. However, I really don't think $0.02 below the end of our range is meaningful in the larger scheme of things, particularly after delivering results near the high-end of our range in the past two quarters. What is meaningful is that we're on track to deliver strong performance as the U.S. economy recovers. We think our stock is undervalued, and I would say that history confirms that. And we hope that our loyal shareholders will take this opportunity to increase their holdings.  Mike will now give us a review of market strategy and operations."

But we turned a corner by posting our first sequential increase in daily sales in the year. Encouragingly, volumes in our core business drove the improvement, and Distribution segment daily sales were up in spite of a tough quarter for Red-D-Arc. Before I start the broader discussion, I'd like to touch on Red-D-Arc in a bit more detail. Our Rental Welder business primarily serves two Contractor segments. First, New Construction, and second, the Repair and Maintenance Operations of Multiple Customer segments. The New Construction segment has been slowing all year as jobs are completed and new startups are limited. However, the fall is prime outage season, and we anticipated that the fall outage season would see a normal seasonal uptick in turnaround Maintenance activity, and this is where we fell far short of expectations. The end result accounted for at least $0.02 of our earnings miss. While plant shutdowns did take place, the volume of turnaround work during the shutdowns was very low. It seems that plant utilization rates in the past few quarters have allowed customers to minimize the repair and maintenance work during this outage cycle, or indefinitely postponed major plant turnarounds. Often, customers made these decisions last minute. And in several large cases, after our Rental Welder equipment have already been delivered to the job site. It is difficult to determine at this time whether customers will continue to delay scheduled turnarounds or simply skip the cycle altogether.Now let's discuss our core Packaged Gas business. We have seen some increased price competition recently. We do need and deserve a broad price increase in as much as our last increase was 17 months ago. We will initiate a pricing action at the appropriate time to achieve the optimal result. And in the meantime, we continue to address pricing tactically in local markets where it makes the most sense.We are focused on achieving real gains through new business signings while cross selling to our existing customer base and building market position. As Peter mentioned, we have many ways to accelerate our sales growth beyond market rates, and we believe we are doing so even in this economy. Our sales and marketing strategy focused on segment alignment is taking shape. Success thus far has been most pronounced in the strategic accounts program where it originated, and was already underway in the Medical and Construction segments. For the third quarter, Strategic Accounts business was down 8% from the prior year, as the benefit of new accounts signings across all customer segments continue to be outpaced by the year-over-year declines in our existing Metal Fabrication, Construction and Petrochemical customer base. For customers with multiple location, our strategic account focus offers superior service and supply chain savings to our national infrastructure, breadth and depth of products and services and technical expertise. Customers facing tougher times tend to renew their interest in supply chain savings, and we have been busy responding to customer inquiries. Momentum is beginning to build in our more recently aligned sales and marketing segments, including Retail, Energy, Metal Fabrication, Food and Beverage, Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals and Laboratories. When the economy recovers, this part of our business is positioned for a strong growth.Turning to Slide 3, our strategic products which combine to make up about 40% of our revenue, declined 4% for the quarter comparing favorably to the overall same-store sales decline of 14%. Sequentially, daily sales for total strategic products improved by 2% from the second quarter. Our strategic products, as a group continue to have good long-term growth profiles as many of our growth accelerators impact their performance. Safety products sales declined 5% year-over-year in the quarter comparing favorably to the overall Hardgoods same-store sales decline of 19%, and partially reflecting the impact of last years' Boeing strike on our third quarter last year. On a sequential basis, daily sales of safety products were up 3%, although low operating rates and rising unemployment are headwinds, safety products still present a strong cross-sell opportunity for us at the value and vendor consolidation is greater for our customers in today's economy.Both Gas sales were down 5% for the quarter compared to prior year. On a daily sales basis however, bulk sales increased by almost 5% sequentially, and sales of bulk nitrogen for food freezing applications continued to show strength and bulk sales to Industrial Manufacturing customers began to recover in segments such as Steel, Auto and Alternative Energy. Bulk sales continue to represent significant opportunity for us to a combination of our extensive sales presence, full range of supply modes and ability to engineer solutions for customer needs. Medical sales grew 2% year-over-year and 3% sequentially in daily sales. While slowing in elective and non-critical procedures has reduced overall medical demand, we continue to expand our Medical business through new customer signings.Our proprietary Walk-O2-Bout cylinders, Bulk Capabilities and new Medical Gas Piping and Certification business, combined with our core Medical Package Gases offering have allowed us to cross-sell and expand business with existing customers, and have proven to be successful in helping us win new key customers, including some of the top hospitals in the country.Specialty Gas sales declined 7% year-over-year, driven largely by slowing in chemical processing industries. Sequentially however, Specialty Gas sales improved by almost 4% on a daily sales basis driven by a broad-based increase in demand for core Specialty Gases, including further strengthening of our market position and EPA protocol gases.As we highlighted during our December 15 analyst meeting, we remain extremely optimistic about our growth prospects, given our expanding account base in the biotech, life sciences, research and environmental monitoring fields. Our ability to drive the industry forward through the pursuit of new technologies and automation and increasing regulation globally. In addition, our investment in proprietary automated production and automated analytical technology, now fully deployed at all of our major Specialty Gas cylinder production plants, provides the quality and the capacity we will need to service future growth.Finishing out our strategic products, CO2 and Dry Ice were down 5% from last year, as increases in sales for food and industrial freezing applications was more than offset by lower surcharges compared to prior year. Sequentially, CO2 and Dry Ice were down on a daily sales basis due to seasonality in those businesses. RADNOR private label products were down 18% for the quarter, slightly less than the overall drop in Hardgoods volumes. Long-term growth opportunity for our RADNOR private label products remain strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, RADNOR products enhanced our profitability because they carry gross margin higher than comparable OEM products by 1.5x or more.In contrast with the rest of our Gas business, ammonia, which is the main product of Airgas Specialty Products, posted a sales decline in excess of 30% for the quarter. Volumes actually increased 4% in the quarter, but were more than offset by pricing, driven by the impact of falling costs compared to very high levels in the ammonia industry last year. In spite of lower volumes, our gross margin percent on ammonia improved over last year, as costs decline greater than selling prices. Similarly, refrigerants are down year-over-year as economic conditions and mild weather have fostered indefinite delays in the maintenance of HVAC Systems and elective refrigerants conversion projects that typically take place around this time of the year. The buying patterns of our refrigerant customers have changed significantly during the downturn. Looking forward, it is difficult to determine at this time whether the pre-season buy that typically takes place in March will materialize. Our operating efficiency programs, which focus on cylinder maintenance and testing distribution of fill plant logistics and freight and fuel management are progressing according to schedule. We've achieved $10 million in annual run rate savings this fiscal year, composed largely of UT cylinder test benefits distribution logistics initiatives and common carrier freight reductions.At our December analyst meeting, we set a goal to attain $40 million of new operating efficiency savings over the next four years, driven largely by a logistics plant cylinder studies and cylinder testing, cost containment and operating efficiencies have become a significant element of the Airgas operating culture, and we are confident in our ability to deliver on our goals.To date, we have fully implemented $57 million of annual expense reductions since the downturn began last year, representing more than 7% of our annual run rate EBITDA at the time. In light of the result and outlook for our Rental Welder business, we are evaluating the cost structure of that business. Excluding the Rental Welder business, we feel that our cost structure is appropriate for the current demand levels. We are able to make additional reductions if conditions deteriorate further, but we intend to balance short-term profit protection with long-term strategy for creating shareholder value.  Now Bob will give our financial review of the quarter."

I'd like to start today by reviewing our segment results. Please turn to Slide 4.

I'd like to start today by reviewing our segment results. Please turn to Slide 4. As I go through these results, please note that we have GAAP reconciliations for various metrics on Slides 9 through 13.Peter and Mike have talked about the drivers of the earnings shortfall and contrasted them with a relatively positive fundamentals of our core business. The segment results paint that picture pretty clearly, so we'll start there. Distribution sales in the quarter were down 12% versus prior year to $852 million, with same-store sales down 14%. On a sequential basis, Distribution sales decreased 1% from the second quarter. However, since there were fewer selling days in the third quarter, our Distribution sales actually improved by 2% sequentially on a daily sales basis.Distribution Gas and Rent same-store sales were down 10% year-over-year, with volumes down 8% and pricing down 2%. This is also the category that suffered the most direct impact of the Red-D-Arc shortfall in Rental revenues, which were down more than 20% from last year. Distribution Hardgoods same-store sales were down 19%, with volumes down 17% and pricing down 2%. Declines in costs and prices for filler metals were the most pronounced impact on Hardgoods pricing, with most other product lines slightly down or stable. Both Hardgoods and Gas and Rent sales improved sequentially on a daily sales basis.Distribution gross margin was 56.2%, an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year, reflecting a favorable sales mix shift to Gas and Rent. Sequentially, Distribution gross margin improved 10 basis points, with the mix of Gas and Rent sales consistent at approximately 61%. Excluding multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charges, adjusted operating income in the Distribution segment was $94 million, down 20% from the prior year and flat sequentially. The related operating margin was 11.1%, a decline of 110 basis points year-over-year, and an increase of 10 basis points sequentially. Our Distribution operating margins held up relatively well in light of the significant year-over-year sales decline due to aggressive reduction of operating expenses. We implemented $57 million of company-wide annual expense reductions since December 2008, of which a significant portion benefited the Distribution segment. The favorable mix shift to Gas and Rent also helped our operating margins.All other operations reflect our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia and Nitrous Oxide business units. Sales for all other operations were down 18% from the prior year, in both in total and on a same-store basis. The decline was driven largely by lower pricing in ammonia products related to a corresponding drop in raw materials and lower wholesale Refrigerant volumes, reflecting sluggish contractor demand. Sequentially, the sales decline was driven by normal seasonality in the Dry Ice and Carbonic businesses, as well as the challenging business conditions in Refrigerants that Mike mentioned earlier.Operating income for all other operations was down 21% from the prior year. Operating margin decreased 50 basis points, driven primarily by margin compression in the Refrigerants business as a result of the volume declines. Sequentially, the 450 basis point decline in operating margin is primarily attributable to the normal seasonal decline of CO2, Dry Ice and Refrigerants sales. The all other operations segments was the driver of the entire sequential decline in our consolidated operating margin.Now turn Slide 5 and we'll look at our consolidated results. Sales declined 13% year-over-year to $942 million, reflecting acquisition growth of 1% and a total same-store sales decline of 14%, comprised of an 11% decline in Gas and Rent, and a 19% decline in Hardgoods. Volume was down 11% and price was down 3%. As mentioned in the segment discussion, declines in costs and prices for ammonia are the most pronounced impact in the Gas and Rent sales. In the same dynamic, impacted Filler Metals and Hardgoods sales.Sequentially, sales declined 2%, driven primarily by fewer selling days and the seasonality discussed in the all other operation segment. However, on a daily sales basis, sales rose sequentially by 1%. Gas and Rent represented almost 65% of our sales mix, comparing favorably with the prior year mix of just over 62%. The sales mix shift is driven by the relative strength of Gas and Rent same-store sales compared to Hardgoods. The favorable Gas-Rent mix is also reflected in our 55.8% gross margin for the quarter, an increase of 220 basis points over the prior year. As mentioned in the Distribution segment discussion, gross margin was up 10 basis points sequentially, reflecting stable relationships between costs and pricing across most products.Excluding pretax multi-employer pension plan charges, operating income for the quarter was $105 million, down 20% from last year. While operating margins were negatively impacted by the significant year-over-year decline in sales, the $57 million in annual expense reductions that we implemented between December 2008 and September 2009, in addition to our ongoing operating efficiency initiatives, significantly mitigated the impact on our operating margins. Our adjusted operating margin, which excludes pretax multi-employer pension plan charges, held up relatively well for the quarter at 11.1%, a decline of 110 basis points year-over-year, and 50 basis points sequentially. The sequential decline is entirely attributable to the normal seasonal decline in our all other operations segment.We continue our efforts to withdraw from multi- employer pension plans, and we're successful to a significant degree this quarter. We entered the year with 12 collective bargaining agreements that contain multi-employer pension plans, and thus far, have exited six. The remaining six agreements, which cover approximately 80 employees, come up for renewal between now and the end of fiscal 2012.Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.65 in the second quarter represents a decline of 14% year-over-year and a decline of 4% sequentially. We were short of our guidance due to a $0.02 impact of the challenging conditions in our Rental Welder business and a $0.02 impact from a weaker than expected sales finish in the quarter. Including a $0.05 loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the previously-announced redemption of our $150 million 6 1/4 notes and a $0.04 charge for multi-employer pension plan withdrawals, GAAP earnings were $0.56 per diluted share. There were approximately 84 million weighted diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, up about 1% year-over-year and fundamentally flat on a sequential basis.Return on capital was 10.1%, a 340 basis point decline from the prior year, primarily driven by the slowing economy and related decline in operating income. With respect to accounts receivable, our collection rates for the quarter have remained relatively consistent both year-over-year and sequentially, and our quarterly DSO of 48 days was consistent with the second quarter results. Inventory turns held consistently with recent trends and inventory reductions have contributed more than $45 million to our cash flow this year. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $289 million compared to $171 million last year, driven by strong adjusted from cash from operations of $470 million, up from $436 million last year. And by a 32% reduction in capital expenditures to $192 million this year. We increased our dividend for the fourth quarter by 22% to $0.22 per share, representing a 36% increase in dividends per share paid in fiscal 2010 over 2009.Adjusted debt at December 31 was $1.9 billion, and $523 million was available under our revolving credit facility. Adjusted debt has been reduced by approximately $300 million since December 2008 and a little more than $190 million year-to-date in fiscal 2010. Our fixed flow of ratio at the end of December was 53% fixed and our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.7% in the middle of our recently revised target range of 2% to 3%.Slide 6 is one that we introduced at our analyst meeting in December and it serves to demonstrate some of the defensive and resilient financial aspects of our performance, as well as where we seem to be in the economic cycle. A review of the EBITDA line reveals a remarkably gentle slope when compared to the magnitude of the same store sales decline that we experienced in the past four quarters. The work we have done to diversify our customer base and product mix, the relatively stable nature of our rental revenue stream and the quick effective expense reductions we implemented in the downturn, served to hold EBITDA relatively flat in this challenging sales environment.  The result is an expanded EBITDA margin compared to the peak quarters of just over a year ago. Secondly, the sequential change in daily sales show that after period of sharp decreases, we just posted our first sequential increase in the year. The timing of the sequential declines suggest that the Packaged Gas business lagged the downturn slightly and is exhibiting these characteristics coming out of it as well.Please turn to Slide 7, capital expenditures. Capital spending was $192 million fiscal year-to-date versus $282 million last year. Spending on cylinders, bulk tanks and rental welders declined as sales have slowed, and overall capital spending was down 32% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of major capital projects, year-to-date capital spending is about 4% of sales. We are still on pace to realize our target of reducing capital expenditures by more than $100 million in this fiscal year.Slide 8, presents a walk through the primary elements of our fourth quarter guidance using the third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.65 as the starting point. The $0.04 headwind we have is related to two dynamics. One is the normal seasonal slowing of our Dry Ice and Carbonic businesses, as colder weather alleviate the demand for some of these products. The second is our expectation of further pressure on our Rental Welder business, associated with sluggish construction activity, which we do not expect to turn up in the near-term. At our backs, the absence of the holiday season should help us with a couple extra pennies, and the big additions come from modest sequential increase in the core business, supported by an improving economy, an additional selling day, and incremental operating efficiencies. We expect negative same-store sales in the low single digits, representing a slow steady pace of recovery. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.71 in the fourth quarter, roughly flat to slightly up from last year. The high end of the range assumes an improving economic environment, particularly related to industrial manufacturing.Please note that the fourth quarter guidance does not incorporate the impact of any future multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charges. As we continue our efforts to withdraw from such plants, although we do not anticipate material charges in our fourth quarter. We also reiterate that prevailing economic conditions offer limited visibility into future sales and earnings, which should be taken into consideration when evaluating our guidance. I'll now turn it back over to Jay to begin the Q&A portion of the call."

There were quarters where we dipped a little bit below it, but for the most part, we've outperformed and because of our strategic products and our strategic accounts program. So I think that we'll run ahead of it as it improves. And I think in terms of what might be different in this recovery, I do feel that our cost reduction and our efficiency programs have a lot of momentum. They really became a part of our culture. We're launching new programs, we've got good technology that we're deploying. So that's going to be different and should help our fall through as sales increase. And I would also say that we've added a lot of customers to our roles in the last 18 months, and I really think that, that's going to give us somewhat of an extra kick as the economy recovers. So I think there's a few things different this time, which will benefit us more than in the past, but I also expect that we are going to run ahead of non-tech industrial production."

Slide 2 will highlight some of the key points I'll cover today and the reason why we believe that we are stronger than ever as a company, on the right track and poised to capitalize as the economy",1497,"Thanks, Jay, and good morning, and thanks for joining us. Slide 2 will highlight some of the key points I'll cover today and the reason why we believe that we are stronger than ever as a company, on the right track and poised to capitalize as the economy recovers.Earnings were slightly below guidance for our third quarter fiscal 2010, and that's clearly not how we like to do things. Nonetheless, our performance was strong. The key factors in the earnings midst were weaker than expected sales during the holiday season, and the cancellation or postponement of plant turnarounds negatively impacting our very profitable Rental Welder business.On the bright side, this quarter marked the first sequential increase in our daily sales rate since our second quarter of fiscal 2009. And we generated record year-to-date free cash flow of $289 million.  In spite of the challenges in our Red-D-Arc Rental Welder business that I just mentioned, our Distribution segment posted healthy results, including a 2% sequential increase in daily sales, and a sequential expansion in operating margin.Our guidance this year has been predicated on a moderate case of sequential economic recovery, and we continue to hold that expectation. It may take more time to unfold than we hoped, but a recovery does seem to be underway across most of our geographies and customer segments.As we conveyed to you at our analyst meeting in December, we are very confident in our ability to drive above market results on the strength of the growth accelerators we outlined: Service to multi-location customers, cross-sell opportunities, our customer service culture, technology implementations, increasing regulation, favorable demographics and demand for supply chain management and other services, including our eCommerce offerings.Our strategic accounts customer base continues to grow, adding mass to our book of business, and our strategic products continue to outperform and effectively diversify our offering and provide stability. As the premier U.S. Packaged Gas distributor, we're in a strong position to capitalize on an improving economy.To recap the third quarter, net earnings for the third quarter were $46.9 million or $0.56 per diluted share. Excluding a $0.05 debt extinguishment charge and a $0.04 multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charge, adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.65. This compares to a very strong $0.76 per diluted share last year. Earnings were $0.02 below the bottom of our guided range, primarily due to the unseasonably low sales in our Rental Welder business, which accounted for $0.02, and slower than expected daily sales activity in December, which accounted for another $0.02.Total sales in from the quarter declined 13% to $942 million, driven by a total same-store sales decline of 14%, with price down 3% and volume down 11%. The price declines were most pronounced in our ammonia and welding filler metals products, as declining costs accounted for the price movement. Overall, our gross margins expanded. Gas and Rent same-store sales declined 11%, and Hardgoods, 19%. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 1%.On a sequential basis, total sales declined by 2% from the second quarter, reflecting the impact of fewer selling days and the seasonality of certain businesses in the all other operations segment. Total daily sales increased 1% from the second quarter. In the Distribution segment, we were encouraged by the 2% sequential increase in daily sales.Looking across our geographies, our Pacific Northwest region posted the smallest year-over-year declines, followed by Airgas National Welders, which covers the Carolinas in Southern Virginia. The deepest declines took place in our mid-South and Southwest region, where oil field service activity continues to be slow and in our North Central region where construction activity has tapered off. We continue to benefit from a product mix shift towards Gas and Rent sales, which represent 65% of total sales in the quarter.Year-over-year, comps remain tough for most of our customer segments and will ease next quarter. We were pleased to see a sequential increase in sales to our industrial manufacturing customers. Utilities and Petrochemical, along with our always steady Medical business, posted the strongest sequential growth on a daily sales basis. Activity with our contractor customers that served new construction and repair and maintenance projects decreased sequentially, challenging our Packaged Gas, Hardgoods and Rental Welder business. A lack of funding seems to have brought major projects to a halt and plant turnarounds are being postponed.  Overall, Hardgoods sales continue to be under the most volume pressure, led by steep declines in equipment, which is the only product line we sell that is a capital purchase for our customers.We expect equipment to drop deepest in the downturn, followed by filler metals used in manufacturing. Fortunately, these tend to be the lower margin sales compared to the rest of Hardgoods. Additionally, sales mix from Hardgoods to Gas and Rent drives gross margin expansion as Gas and Rent carry higher gross margins than in Hardgoods. Our Gas gross margin also benefited from lower costs, partially offset by lower prices. Total company margin expanded 220 basis points from last year. This gross margin expansion work in conjunction with our cost-reduction efforts to minimize operating margin erosion. Adjusted for multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charges, our operating margin only dropped 110 basis points to 11.1% from 12.2% last year, and 50 basis points from 11.6% in the second quarter.Cash flow continues to be one of the strengths of our business model. Year-to-date, free cash flow increased to a record $289 million, a 69% increase over the prior year and representing about 10% of our sales. Adjusted cash flow from operations grew 8% from $436 million last year to $470 million this year. And capital spending dropped by 32% to $192 million. Roughly 2/3 of our free cash flow has been used for debt reduction, about $190 million so far.We were pleased to increase our dividend again, as our strong cash flow allows us to reward shareholders while still pursuing our growth strategies. This was our fifth dividend increase in the past three years, and it will result in a 36% increase in dividends per share paid in fiscal 2010 over 2009.Acquisition activity has been slow as potential sellers assess their business in the wake of the downturn. However, our pipeline has been recovering recently as the anticipation of improving business conditions has stirred some interest. Year-to-date, we've acquired five businesses with an aggregate of $47 million in annual revenues.In our largest transaction this year, we acquired Tri-Tech, a very well-run, highly profitable independent distributor, with 16 locations throughout Georgia, Florida and South Carolina, generating $31 million in annual revenue. We also improved our presence and density in Oklahoma and West Texas with our purchase of Fitch Industrial & Welding Supply, a Lawton, Oklahoma-based distributor with around $10 million in annual revenues. Most recently, we added a small distributor in Houston called Champ Sales [ph], representing about $3 million to revenue.Our acquisition activity has historically accelerated during the recovery phase of a business cycle, and we hope that recent developments in the pipeline are signs of sustainable improvement. Our strategy is unchanged, we have the capacity to purchase and integrate quality businesses, and we remained diligent in sourcing transactions. We will continue to evaluate international opportunities as they arise, but our primary focus remains on domestic core products and service offering acquisitions.Looking forward, in the fourth quarter, our Packaged Gas business should pose another sequential improvement, which will be slightly offset by seasonality in the all other operations segment and continued pressure in our Rental Welder business. January sales have us off to a good start, showing slight sequential improvement from last quarter. Actually, Gas sales are up 5% to 6%, and we expect the month of January to end with Hardgoods sales down around 1%.We intend to stay focused on our fundamental strategies, enhance our sales organization and performance and continue to train our associates as we position ourselves to emerge even stronger when recovery does take shape. We have converted many new customers to Airgas over the last 18 months, and we expect that to have a positive impact as the economy continues its recovery.Although we hate to miss our guided earnings range, and believe me, it's especially hard on me, I'm a large shareholder in the company. And I take this very, very seriously, but we're a daily sales company, and its very, very hard to know what our sales are from quarter to quarter, and especially in this quarter which ends with the holiday season. However, I really don't think $0.02 below the ends of our range is meaningful in the larger scheme of things, particularly after delivering results near the high-end of our range in the past two quarters. What is meaningful is that we're on track to deliver strong performance as the U.S. economy recovers. We think our stock is undervalued, and I would say that history confirms that. And we hope that our loyal shareholders will take this opportunity to increase their holdings.  Mike will now give us a review of market strategy and operations."

But we turned a corner by posting our first sequential increase in daily sales in the year. Encouragingly, volumes in our core business drove the improvement, and Distribution segment daily sales were up in spite of a tough quarter for Red-D-Arc. Before I start the broader discussion, I'd like to touch on Red-D-Arc in a bit more detail. Our Rental Welder business primarily serves two Contractor segments. First, New Construction, and second, the Repair and Maintenance Operations of Multiple Customer segments. The New Construction segment has been slowing all year as jobs are completed and new startups are limited. However, the fall is prime outage season, and we anticipated that the fall outage season would see a normal seasonal uptick in turnaround Maintenance activity, and this is where we fell far short of expectations. The end result accounted for at least $0.02 of our earnings miss. While plant shutdowns did take place, the volume of turnaround work during the shutdowns was very low. It seems that plant utilization rates in the past few quarters have allowed customers to minimize the repair and maintenance work during this outage cycle, or indefinitely postponed major plant turnarounds. Often, customers made these decisions last minute. And in several large cases, after our Rental Welder equipment have already been delivered to the job site. It is difficult to determine at this time whether customers will continue to delay scheduled turnarounds or simply skip the cycle altogether.Now let's discuss our core Packaged Gas business. We have seen some increased price competition recently. We do need and deserve a broad price increase in as much as our last increase was 17 months ago. We will initiate a pricing action at the appropriate time to achieve the optimal result. And in the meantime, we'll continue to address pricing tactically in local markets where it makes the most sense.We are focused on achieving real gains through new business signings while cross selling to our existing customer base and building market position. As Peter mentioned, we have many ways to accelerate our sales growth beyond market rates, and we believe we are doing so even in this economy. Our sales and marketing strategy focused on segment alignment is taking shape. Success thus far has been most pronounced in the strategic accounts program where it originated, and was already underway in the Medical and Construction segments. For the third quarter, Strategic Accounts business was down 8% from the prior year, as the benefit of new accounts signings across all customer segments continue to be outpaced by the year-over-year declines in our existing Metal Fabrication, Construction and Petrochemical customer base. For customers with multiple location, our strategic account focus offers superior service and supply chain savings through our national infrastructure, breadth and depth of products and services and technical expertise. Customers facing tougher times tend to renew their interest in supply chain savings, and we have been busy responding to customer inquiries. Momentum is beginning to build in our more recently aligned sales and marketing segments, including Retail, Energy, Metal Fabrication, Food and Beverage, Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals and Laboratories. When the economy recovers, this part of our business is positioned for a strong growth.Turning to Slide 3, our strategic products which combine to make up about 40% of our revenue, declined 4% for the quarter comparing favorably to the overall same-store sales decline of 14%. Sequentially, daily sales for total strategic products improved by 2% from the second quarter. Our strategic products, as a group continue to have good long-term growth profiles as many of our growth accelerators impact their performance. Safety products sales declined 5% year-over-year in the quarter comparing favorably to the overall Hardgoods same-store sales decline of 19%, and partially reflecting the impact of last years' Boeing strike on our third quarter last year. On a sequential basis, daily sales of safety products were up 3%, although low operating rates and rising unemployment are headwinds, safety products still present a strong cross-sell opportunity for us as the value and vendor consolidation is greater for our customers in today's economy.Both Gas sales were down 5% for the quarter compared to prior year. On a daily sales basis however, bulk sales increased by almost 5% sequentially, and sales of bulk nitrogen for food freezing applications continued to show strength and bulk sales to Industrial Manufacturing customers began to recover in segments such as Steel, Auto and Alternative Energy. Bulk sales continue to represent significant opportunity for us due to a combination of our extensive sales presence, full range of supply modes and ability to engineer solutions for customer needs. Medical sales grew 2% year-over-year and 3% sequentially in daily sales. While slowing in elective and non-critical procedures has reduced overall medical demand, we continue to expand our Medical business through new customer signings.Our proprietary Walk-O2-Bout cylinders, Bulk Capabilities and new Medical Gas Piping and Certification business, combined with our core Medical Package Gases offering have allowed us to cross-sell and expand business with existing customers, and have proven to be successful in helping us win new key customers, including some of the top hospitals in the country.Specialty Gas sales declined 7% year-over-year, driven largely by slowing in chemical processing industries. Sequentially however, Specialty Gas sales improved by almost 4% on a daily sales basis driven by a broad-based increase in demand for core Specialty Gases, including further strengthening of our market position and EPA protocol gases.As we highlighted during our December 15 analyst meeting, we remain extremely optimistic about our growth prospects, given our expanding account base in the biotech, life sciences, research and environmental monitoring fields. Our ability to drive the industry forward through the pursuit of new technologies and automation and increasing regulation globally. In addition, our investment in proprietary automated production and automated analytical technology, now fully deployed at all of our major Specialty Gas cylinder production plants, provides the quality and the capacity we will need to service future growth.Finishing out our strategic products, CO2 and Dry Ice were down 5% from last year, as increases in sales for food and industrial freezing applications was more than offset by lower surcharges compared to prior year. Sequentially, CO2 and Dry Ice were down on a daily sales basis due to the seasonality in those businesses. RADNOR private label products were down 18% for the quarter, slightly less than the overall drop in Hardgoods volumes. Long-term growth opportunity for our RADNOR private label products remain strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, RADNOR products enhanced our profitability because they carry gross margins higher than comparable OEM products by 1.5x or more.In contrast with the rest of our Gas business, ammonia, which is the main product of Airgas Specialty Products, posted a sales decline in excess of 30% for the quarter. Volumes actually increased 4% in the quarter, but were more than offset by pricing, driven by the impact of falling costs compared to very high levels in the ammonia industry last year. In spite of lower volumes, our gross margin percent on ammonia improved over last year, as costs decline greater than selling prices. Similarly, refrigerants are down year-over-year as economic conditions and mild weather have fostered indefinite delays in the maintenance of HVAC Systems and elective refrigerants conversion projects that typically take place around this time of the year. The buying patterns of our refrigerant customers have changed significantly during the downturn. Looking forward, it is difficult to determine at this time whether the pre-season buy that typically takes place in March will materialize. Our operating efficiency programs, which focus on cylinder maintenance and testing distribution of fill plant logistics and freight and fuel management are progressing according to schedule. We've achieved $10 million in annual run rate savings this fiscal year, composed largely of UT cylinder test benefits distribution logistics initiatives and common carrier freight reductions.At our December analyst meeting, we set a goal to attain $40 million of new operating efficiency savings over the next four years, driven largely by a logistics plant cylinder studies and cylinder testing, cost containment and operating efficiencies have become a significant element of the Airgas operating culture, and we are confident in our ability to deliver on our goals.To date, we have fully implemented $57 million of annual expense reductions since the downturn began last year, representing more than 7% of our annual run rate EBITDA at the time. In light of the result and outlook for our Rental Welder business, we are evaluating the cost structure of that business. Excluding the Rental Welder business, we feel that our cost structure is appropriate for the current demand levels. We are able to make additional reductions if conditions deteriorate further, but we intend to balance short-term profit protection with long-term strategy for creating shareholder value.  Now Bob will give our financial review of the quarter."

I'd like to start today by reviewing our segment results. Please turn to Slide 4. As I go through these results, please note that we have GAAP reconciliations for various metrics on Slides 9 through 13.Peter and Mike have talked about the drivers of the earnings shortfall and contrasted them with a relatively positive fundamentals of our core business. The segment results paint that picture pretty clearly, so we'll start there. Distribution sales in the quarter were down 12% versus prior year to $852 million, with same-store sales down 14%. On a sequential basis, Distribution sales decreased 1% from the second quarter. However, since there were fewer selling days in the third quarter, our Distribution sales actually improved by 2% sequentially on a daily sales basis.Distribution Gas and Rent same-store sales were down 10% year-over-year, with volumes down 8% and pricing down 2%. This is also the category that suffered the most direct impact of the Red-D-Arc shortfall in Rental revenues, which were down more than 20% from last year. Distribution Hardgoods same-store sales were down 19%, with volumes down 17% and pricing down 2%. Declines in costs and prices for filler metals were the most pronounced impact on Hardgoods pricing, with most other product lines slightly down or stable. Both Hardgoods and Gas and Rent sales improved sequentially on a daily sales basis.Distribution gross margin was 56.2%, an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year, reflecting a favorable sales mix shift to Gas and Rent. Sequentially, Distribution gross margin improved 10 basis points, with the mix of Gas and Rent sales consistent at approximately 61%. Excluding multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charges, adjusted operating income in the Distribution segment was $94 million, down 20% from the prior year and flat sequentially. The related operating margin was 11.1%, a decline of 110 basis points year-over-year, and an increase of 10 basis points sequentially. Our Distribution operating margins held up relatively well in light of the significant year-over-year sales decline due to aggressive reduction of operating expenses. We implemented $57 million of company-wide annual expense reductions since December 2008, of which a significant portion benefited the Distribution segment. The favorable mix shift to Gas and Rent also helped our operating margins.All other operations reflect our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia and Nitrous Oxide business units. Sales for all other operations were down 18% from the prior year, in both in total and on a same-store basis. The decline was driven largely by lower pricing in ammonia products related to a corresponding drop in raw materials and lower wholesale Refrigerant volumes, reflecting sluggish contractor demand. Sequentially, the sales decline was driven by normal seasonality in the Dry Ice and Carbonic businesses, as well as the challenging business conditions in Refrigerants that Mike mentioned earlier.Operating income for all other operations was down 21% from the prior year. Operating margin decreased 50 basis points, driven primarily by margin compression in the Refrigerants business as a result of the volume declines. Sequentially, the 450 basis point decline in operating margin is primarily attributable to the normal seasonal decline of CO2, Dry Ice and Refrigerants sales. The all other operations segments was the driver of the entire sequential decline in our consolidated operating margin.Now turn Slide 5 and we'll look at our consolidated results. Sales declined 13% year-over-year to $942 million, reflecting acquisition growth of 1% and a total same-store sales decline of 14%, comprised of an 11% decline in Gas and Rent, and a 19% decline in Hardgoods. Volume was down 11% and price was down 3%. As mentioned in the segment discussion, declines in costs and prices for ammonia are the most pronounced impact in the Gas and Rent sales. In the same dynamic, impacted Filler Metals and Hardgoods sales.Sequentially, sales declined 2%, driven primarily by fewer selling days and the seasonality discussed in the all other operation segment. However, on a daily sales basis, sales rose sequentially by 1%. Gas and Rent represented almost 65% of our sales mix, comparing favorably with the prior year mix of just over 62%. The sales mix shift is driven by the relative strength of Gas and Rent same-store sales compared to Hardgoods. The favorable Gas-Rent mix is also reflected in our 55.8% gross margin for the quarter, an increase of 220 basis points over the prior year. As mentioned in the Distribution segment discussion, gross margin was up 10 basis points sequentially, reflecting stable relationships between costs and pricing across most products.Excluding pretax multi-employer pension plan charges, operating income for the quarter was $105 million, down 20% from last year. While operating margins were negatively impacted by the significant year-over-year decline in sales, the $57 million in annual expense reductions that we implemented between December 2008 and September 2009, in addition to our ongoing operating efficiency initiatives, significantly mitigated the impact on our operating margins. Our adjusted operating margin, which excludes pretax multi-employer pension plan charges, held up relatively well for the quarter at 11.1%, a decline of 110 basis points year-over-year, and 50 basis points sequentially. The sequential decline is entirely attributable to the normal seasonal decline in our all other operations segment.We continue our efforts to withdraw from multi- employer pension plans, and we're successful to a significant degree this quarter. We entered the year with 12 collective bargaining agreements that contain multi-employer pension plans, and thus far, have exited six. The remaining six agreements, which cover approximately 80 employees, come up for renewal between now and the end of fiscal 2012.Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.65 in the second quarter represents a decline of 14% year-over-year and a decline of 4% sequentially. We were short of our guidance due to a $0.02 impact of the challenging conditions in our Rental Welder business and a $0.02 impact from a weaker than expected sales finish in the quarter. Including a $0.05 loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the previously-announced redemption of our $150 million 6 1/4 notes and a $0.04 charge for multi-employer pension plan withdrawals, GAAP earnings were $0.56 per diluted share. There were approximately 84 million weighted diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, up about 1% year-over-year and fundamentally flat on a sequential basis.Return on capital was 10.1%, a 340 basis point decline from the prior year, primarily driven by the slowing economy and related decline in operating income. With respect to accounts receivable, our collection rates for the quarter have remained relatively consistent both year-over-year and sequentially, and our quarterly DSO of 48 days was consistent with the second quarter results. Inventory turns held consistently with recent trends and inventory reductions have contributed more than $45 million to our cash flow this year. Year-to-date, free cash flow was $289 million compared to $171 million last year, driven by strong adjusted from cash from operations of $470 million, up from $436 million last year. And by a 32% reduction in capital expenditures to $192 million this year. We increased our dividend for the fourth quarter by 22% to $0.22 per share, representing a 36% increase in dividends per share paid in fiscal 2010 over 2009.Adjusted debt at December 31 was $1.9 billion, and $523 million was available under our revolving credit facility. Adjusted debt has been reduced by approximately $300 million since December 2008 and a little more than $190 million year-to-date in fiscal 2010. Our fixed flow of ratio at the end of December was 53% fixed and our adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.7% in the middle of our recently revised target range of 2% to 3%.Slide 6 is one that we introduced at our analyst meeting in December and it serves to demonstrate some of the defensive and resilient financial aspects of our performance, as well as where we seem to be in the economic cycle. A review of the EBITDA line reveals a remarkably gentle slope when compared to the magnitude of the same store sales decline that we experienced in the past four quarters. The work we have done to diversify our customer base and product mix, the relatively stable nature of our rental revenue stream and the quick effective expense reductions we implemented in the downturn, served to hold EBITDA relatively flat in this challenging sales environment.  The result is an expanded EBITDA margin compared to the peak quarters of just over a year ago. Secondly, the sequential change in daily sales show that after period of sharp decreases, we just posted our first sequential increase in the year. The timing of the sequential declines suggest that the Packaged Gas business lagged the downturn slightly and is exhibiting these characteristics coming out of it as well.Please turn to Slide 7, capital expenditures. Capital spending was $192 million fiscal year-to-date versus $282 million last year. Spending on cylinders, bulk tanks and rental welders declined as sales have slowed, and overall capital spending was down 32% compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of major capital projects, year-to-date capital spending is about 4% of sales. We are still on pace to realize our target of reducing capital expenditures by more than $100 million in this fiscal year.Slide 8, presents a walk through the primary elements of our fourth quarter guidance using the third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.65 as the starting point. The $0.04 headwind we have is related to two dynamics. One is the normal seasonal slowing of our Dry Ice and Carbonic businesses, as colder weather alleviate the demand for some of these products. The second is our expectation of further pressure on our Rental Welder business, associated with sluggish construction activity, which we do not expect to turn up in the near-term. At our backs, the absence of the holiday season should help us with a couple extra pennies, and the big additions come from modest sequential increase in the core business, supported by an improving economy, an additional selling day, and incremental operating efficiencies. We expect negative same-store sales in the low single digits, representing a slow steady pace of recovery. We expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.71 in the fourth quarter, roughly flat to slightly up from last year. The high end of the range assumes an improving economic environment, particularly related to industrial manufacturing.Please note that the fourth quarter guidance does not incorporate the impact of any future multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charges. As we continue our efforts to withdraw from such plants, although we do not anticipate material charges in our fourth quarter. We also reiterate that prevailing economic conditions offer limited visibility into future sales and earnings, which should be taken into consideration when evaluating our guidance. I'll now turn it back over to Jay to begin the Q&A portion of the call."

And petrochemicals and chemicals also showed improvement. So they are important to us and so continued improvement is going to be important to our same-store sales progress. As I mentioned, our gas sales are up over December levels and January, 5% to 6%, which is pretty nice and that's without any price increase. And we expect hardgoods to come in at about 1% below December at this rate. But combined, it's going to be a solid same-store sales performance for January, and we just hope it carries on into February and through March. This tends to be our strongest quarter. We are cautiously optimistic that it will develop positively."

But no, some of them are newer like Oilind and integrating that with our sales efforts, especially in the worst recession since the Great Depression, has been a challenge. But we like the business. It really fits well with our product and service offering on the maintenance products that we sell, maintenance welding and maintenance gases, as well as Red-D-Arc. And Red-D-Arc is a fabulous company and a very, very profitable company. And they've been not backed by this recession and the big decline in construction and most recently the postponement of plant turnarounds. I would say no. And looking across at some of the other new ones like ammonia, it's been a big winner. Profits are up this quarter even though prices are down because we're selling a very price-sensitive commodity. Refrigerants, another good acquisition, hasn't developed as quickly as we thought. But it fits very well with our regional companies. We have a great program where regional companies are selling refrigerants, and Airgas Refrigerants, Inc. is doing all the fulfillment. Our customers like to buy these products from us.

But long-term with our deficits and whatnot, I don't see a huge increase in the dollar, but I'm not an economist. I don't think U.S. manufacturing can go any lower as a percent of GDP, and we're encouraged because we're seeing the construction of a lot of new plants in the United States. They are four our five automobile manufacturing plants, Intel is building two new fabs, several other semiconductor firms are taking over fabs that were shut down, they're renovating them, there are stainless steel plants, uranium processing plants going in and solar plants.

And as I've been telling our employees, the most exciting time in Airgas is right now. Our business, which historically lags the economic cycle, is just starting to gather momentum in the growing economic recovery. In addition, Air Products' takeover attempt has cast a bright light on our business, revealing how undervalued the company was, and energizing the 14,000 Airgas associates out there who make up the best team in the business: From drivers and retail store personnel, to our plant operators, sales force and back-office team. We have proven time and time again our ability to create real shareholder value, and we are confident that the coming year will be no exception.
Before turning to the business at hand today, I want to briefly address Air Products' unsolicited takeover attempt of Airgas. Our Board of Directors unanimously believes that Air Products' unsolicited proposals grossly undervalue Airgas. Our reasoning, simply stated, is that Air Products' proposals do not reflect the value inherent in our future prospects, our extraordinary track record in creating shareholder value and our position as the largest and most valuable Packaged Gas business in the world. They also fail to reflect our substantial recent investments and the significant opportunities for our business as the economy recovers. 
Since our IPO in 1986, Airgas has employed a disciplined approach to steadily growing revenue, EBITDA and shareholder equity. Airgas' stock has achieved total shareholder return over that period of time of more than seven times the return of the S&P 500 Index. Air Products' unsolicited takeover attempt is extremely opportunistic, as it attempts to obtain the future value of Airgas at a bargain basement price based on our only significant EBITDA decline in the last 22 years, which occurred during the worst recession since the Great Depression.
Air Products has essentially said as much as themselves declaring the timing of their proposals to be excellent. Indeed, our performance coming out of the last recession was robust, and we are a much stronger company today than we were then.
I invite you to review our materials on this topic posted in the Investor information section of our website, by clicking on the Air Products' Unsolicited Proposal link. In particular, please review the presentation dated February 22, 2010, entitled Our Rejection of Air Products' Proposal. 
Now please turn to Slide 2.  I'm very proud of our performance in fiscal 2010. We generated record free cash flow of $411 million, and increased our dividend payout by 36% over 2009. Our credit rating was upgraded to investment grade, the only company I know of that got that upgrade in the middle of the worst credit crisis ever. 
We were also added to the S&P 500. We made our first appearance in the Fortune 500, and we were recently awarded the Compressed Gas Association's Fleet Safety awards for both bulk and cylinder miles in the large fleet category. 
We also reorganized our sales and marketing efforts to align more closely with our customer segments, enabling us to better communicate our value proposition to customers and to more quickly develop our highest potential opportunities.
We seamlessly brought two new ASUs online, and significantly raised our visibility as an on-site supplier. We again changed the game in specialty gases with our new hydrocarbon plant in the Houston area. 
We added some important new products and marketing agreements, continue to invest in customer service training and prepared for our upcoming SAP implementation, all while reducing our cost structure to protect margins and earnings in a very challenging economy. We also shared with Investors our expectations of continued success by issuing new midterm financial goals at our analyst meeting in December.
We're excited that the world is watching our performance, and we're all very bullish on the future of Airgas. The economic recovery is gaining momentum as daily sales rates improve sequentially for the second consecutive quarter, and March was our first positive same-store sales month since November 2008. We again expanded our book of business with another very strong quarter of signings in our strategic accounts program, which was established specifically for multi-location customers who benefit from sole-source supply and supply chain management services. 
In view of the challenging economy, companies across a variety of industries continue to embrace the value proposition inherent in our integrated product and service offerings.
Two weeks ago, we announced a broad-based price increase on gas, rent and hardgoods effective June 1 or as contracts permit. Nearly two years have passed since our last across-the-board price increase, and the pace of cost increases is now accelerating as the economy recovers. Rising costs for raw materials, power, fuel and labor and benefits have led to increases in operating costs at Airgas plants and distribution facilities, as well as increases in product cost from suppliers. We have also seen higher prices for welding hardgoods and safety products, cylinders, bulk tanks, gas handling plants and equipment. Additionally, the cost of regulatory compliance continues to rise. Given the landscape of rising costs and improving demand, we believe our timing is appropriate.
The modest but steady improvement in daily sales is another sign that business is strengthening and the future is bright for Airgas. As the premier U.S. packaged gas distributor, we're in an excellent position to capitalize on the improving economy. 
After posting strong earnings deep into the recession and solid results through the downturn, we are excited to again have our sights on double-digit earnings growth. Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.69 for the fourth quarter, within guidance and up slightly from the prior year. Our full year adjusted EPS of $2.68 was within both the original guided range announced in May of 2009 and our updated guidance provided in January, bolstering our track record of meeting or exceeding our guidance and showing that shareholders can count on us to deliver the long-term results we forecast.
Total sales in the quarter declined 1% to $980 million compared to the prior year, driven by a total same-store sales decline of 3%. Revenues tracked at the low-end of our guided range, hampered by severe winter weather and reflecting an initially tepid recovery. Gas and rent same-store sales declined 3%, and hardgoods declined 2%. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 2% on a sequential basis. Daily sales rates improved by 2% from the third quarter. As expected, hardgoods declined more than Gas and rent during this downturn, and also as expected, Hardgoods are leading the way out.
Looking across our geographies, our Great Lakes region posted the strongest results with positive year-over-year same-store sales in both Gas and rents and in hardgoods, followed by Airgas National Welders, which covers the Carolinas in southern Virginia. Our north central region is also gaining momentum, and these manufacturing base regions tend to lead in an economic recovery, while the coastlines tend to lag, a good sign for our core business. Our west region, consisting of southern California, southern Nevada and Arizona, continue to be hindered by the fall off in construction activity.
In our customer segments, we were pleased to see a sequential increase in sales to our manufacturing customers. Retail and Petrochemical posted the strongest sequential growth on a daily sales basis, while Healthcare, Analytical and Food and Beverage were stable.
Turning to Slide 3, cash flow continues to be one of the strengths of our business model. Fiscal 2010 free cash flow increased 25% over the prior year to a record $411 million, representing about 11% of sales in comparable and absolute dollars to the free cash flow of companies with more than twice our revenue base. And you can guess who I'm talking about. We generated nearly $650 million of adjusted cash flow from operations, representing a 20% compounded annual growth rate since fiscal 2001. And as we committed on our fourth quarter earnings call last year, we reduced our capital spending for the year by nearly $100 million to $253 million, while continuing to invest in growth assets. Roughly 2/3 of our free cash flow was used for debt reduction, totaling nearly $270 million during the year.
Acquisition activity was slow this year as potential sellers opted to wait out the downturn. However, our pipeline has been recovering recently, and improving business conditions has stirred some interest. In fiscal '10, we acquired six businesses with an aggregate of more than $47 million in annual revenues. The largest transaction of the year being Tri-Tech, a very well run, highly profitable independent distributor, with 16 locations throughout Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, generating approximately $31 million in annual revenues. 
We also improved our presence and density in Oklahoma and West Texas with our Fitch Industrial acquisition, a Lawton, Oklahoma-based distributor with about $10 million in annual revenues. Our acquisition activity has historically accelerated during the recovery phase with the business cycle, and we hope that recent developments in the pipeline are signs of sustainable improvement. 
Our strategy is unchanged. We have the capacity to purchase and integrate quality businesses, and we remain diligent in sourcing transactions. We will continue to evaluate international opportunities as they arise, but our primary focus remains on domestic core products and service offering acquisitions.
Looking forward, in the first quarter, we expect another sequential improvement in daily sales. April finished well above our fourth quarter daily averages and slightly above March. Our full year guidance assumes the continuation of that trend, resulting in mid- to upper single-digit same-store sales increases. 
We intend to stay focused on our fundamental business strategies, enhancing our sales organization and performance and continuing to train our associates as we position Airgas to emerge even stronger as the recovery gains momentum. 
Mike will now give you a review of market strategy and operation."

This morning, I'm going to give you a few examples of metrics we watch in our business to illustrate the momentum that is building. Then we'll review operating results, and I'll finish with the discussion of our SAP implementation plans.
Welding hardgoods are a critical element of the offering in the U.S. Packaged Gas business. They also provide some useful leading indicators for us, both in total and also within product categories. In general, hardgoods same-store sales lead Gas and rent same-store sales in a recovery. 
In the fourth quarter, our daily sales of equipment were up 6% sequentially from the third quarter. Equipment, which consist primarily of welding and cutting machines, represents a capital purchase for our customers, and equipment sales tend to rise as customers recapitalize for future production. 
Daily volumes for filler metals improved sequentially in each month of the fourth quarter, and March levels were the highest since November of 2008. Customer production rates drive a significant portion of filler metal demand and account for most of the improvement.
Another measure of hardgoods activity is the number of invoiced line items picked and shipped from our distribution centers to our branches and customers. The hardgoods in this category are primarily welding and gas handling accessories and safety supplies.  Fourth quarter lines shipped from our DCs increased 8% from the third quarter, and are running at their highest levels since October 2008. 
In the Gas business, production, distribution and asset management are key drivers of profitability and returns. Our production numbers have been on the rise, and the average number of industrial gas cylinders filled per day improved sequentially by 6% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Sales per day for cylinder gas has also improved by 6% from the third quarter.
We refer to cylinders in our customers' possession as utilized cylinders. The rate of decline in utilized cylinder trends has been decelerating for well over a year, and believe we have now seen the bottom. We ended the year with about a 2% reduction from last year. The good news is that the increases in utilized cylinders typically lag gas volume growth, which we began to see in the fourth quarter, and request from branches and customers to increase working stocks are now growing. 
So regardless of the metric you pick, all indications are that we're on the cusp of the sustained recovery. And when evaluated together with rising daily sales rates and improving economic data points, we have reason to expect the business climate of steady expansion.
Our sales and marketing strategy focused on segment alignment also continues to gain momentum. Success thus far has been most pronounced in our strategic accounts program where it originated and was already underway in the Medical and Construction segments. 
In the fourth quarter, we announced some of our new customer signings that resulted from the concentrated sales and marketing focus that we've implemented in key customer segments. Customer names like Goodrich Corporation, ITW, Case Western Reserve University, XCOR Aerospace, healthcare system Procurement Group Premier Purchasing and Utility Service Alliance, a cooperative of 15 electric utilities operating 17 nuclear power stations across the U.S. It's rewarding to see our new sales and marketing alignment yielding results while still in its infancy, and the outlook is very bright for even greater gains in the future. 
With the fourth quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 2% from the prior year, driven by new account signings across all customer segments and easing year-over-year comps in our existing Metal Fabrication, Construction and Petrochemical business.
Turning to Slide 4. Sales of our strategic products, which combined to make up about 40% of our revenue, increased 1% for the quarter comparing favorably to the overall same-store sales decline of 3%. Our strategic products as a group continue to have particularly good long-term growth profiles as many of our growth accelerators impact their performance. Safety products grew 5% year-over-year in the quarter, comparing favorably to the overall hardgoods same-store sales decline of 2%. On a sequential basis, daily sales of safety products were up 2%, although low operating rates and continued high unemployment are headwinds, safety products still represent a strong cross sell opportunity for us as our customers realize good value in vendor consolidation.
Bulk gas sales were up 3% compared to prior year, and up 1% sequentially compared to the third quarter, as sales of bulk nitrogen for food freezing applications continued to show strength. And bulk sales of industrial manufacturing customers continue to recover in segments such as steel, auto and alternative energy. 
Medical sales grew 1% year-over-year and were up 2% sequentially. While the slowing in elective and noncritical procedures has temporarily reduced overall medical demand, we continue to expand our Medical business through new customer signings, and expect good long-term growth due to population demographics and cross-sell opportunities from our full-range offering.
Specialty Gas sales declined 7% year-over-year, driven largely by lower volumes this year, and a significant one-time sale to an aerospace customer last year. Sequentially, however, Specialty Gas daily sales improved by 1%, driven by a broad-based increase in demand for core specialty gases, including further strengthening of our market position and EPA protocols and other calibration gas mixtures. March was a record production month for protocols, primary and certified standards, not just for the year, but in our history.
Encouragingly, our all spec rate, by which we monitor the quality of all specialty gas products, was also the lowest in our history. Finishing out strategic products, CO2/Dry Ice were down 1% from last year, as increases in sales for food and industrial freezing applications were more than offset by lower surcharges compared to prior year, and daily sales were down 13% sequentially due to the normal seasonality in those businesses.
Our Radnor private label products were down only 1% for the quarter, slightly better than the same-store sales decline in total hardgoods. The long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, Radnor products carry gross margins higher than comparable OEM products by 1.5x or more. 
Our operating efficiency programs, which focuses on cylinder maintenance and testing, distribution of field plant logistics and freight and fuel management are progressing according to schedule. We achieved $10 million in annual run rate savings this fiscal year, composed largely of UT cylinder test benefits, Distribution logistics initiatives and cylinder plant efficiencies. 
At our December analyst meeting, we set a goal to attain $40 million of new operating efficiency savings over the next four years, driven largely by logistics, plant studies and cylinder testing. We are on track to deliver the $10 million of those savings that are included in our fiscal 2011 guidance.
All told, we have just wrapped up an impressive year operationally. Peter mentioned some of the full year highlights such as our new ASUs, specialty gas and cylinder-filled plants, new products and marketing agreements, Fleet Safety awards, cost reductions, customer service, training and our SAP build, which I'd like to discuss now further.
We will begin the phase rollout of our highly customized SAP platform this July. Our hardgoods distribution infrastructure, including our six national distribution centers, purchasing organization and safety telesales organizations will be the first to go live, followed soon after in fiscal 2011 by two of our regional distribution companies. The commencement of our plan phase rollout, whereby business units implement the new system in succession, marks a major milestone in the structural development of our company. 
Our implementation of SAP is about much more than just consolidating IT systems. SAP will enable high standard work processes across all facets of our complex, high-volume distribution business, and it will enhance our customer service culture, as well as drive operating efficiencies above and beyond those are just discussed. 
We began designing our SAP solution in January of 2009 by assigning 75 full-time business and IT experts from across the organization and engaging a global consulting firm that had successfully led the implementation of SAP at other multibillion-dollar industrial distributors. The SAP cylinder module and system experts that were all retained in our purchase of Linde's U.S. Packaged Gas business in July 2007, provided us with a strong foundation and hands on experience a performance. Since then, we have conducted more than 100 workshop, leveraging 300 internal subject matter experts to design our customized platform. Testing has involved more than 160 end-to-end business processes scenarios, including nearly 5, 000 process steed and utilization of a fullconverted data load of more than 125,000 customers and 800,000 products.
After 400 acquisitions and nearly as many systems conversions, including some from SAP to our current platforms, we are certain about our ability to design and implement the right operating system for our business. Our positive test results to date give us the confidence to establish our conversion timelines through March of 2011. Our SAP platform has been designed to effectively address some of the unique elements of the highly competitive U.S. packaged gas market, which is principally a Distribution, not a Manufacturing business. Multiple fill rental and leasing methods are required to effectively meet and exceed the expectations of a broad customer base. We also manage a highly complex, hardgoods supply chain for manufactures to distribution centers to branches and customers and a variety of sales channels from telesales to e-business to the Retail Store counter.
As in everything we do, we have taken a customer-centric approach to SAP, planning and executing to minimize conversion, planning a and Enxecuting to minimize conversion risk and usnrue transition for customers that were more than returns that will more than justify our investment, significantly above our internal rates of 15% to 20% IRR and return on capital and well above our cost of capital. 
Given our expertise with system conversion and the amount of time and energy we have invested, we are uniquely positioned to maximize the value of this investment, and we are confident that the implementation of SAP will create meaningful value for all Airgas stockholders.
Through March 2010, we have invested $50 million in the project, more than half of the total plant. For fiscal 2011, we expect incremental operating expenses of approximately $14 million, as we begin the implementation phase of the project driven by training, conversion and depreciation. All SAP operating in implementation costs for the current implementation schedule are included in our mid-term financial goals introduced in December 2009. But, and I want to underscore this point, the benefit of our SAP implementation and the positive impact we expected to have on our financial results are not included in our forecast.
Benefits will include customer phasing applications that will improve the customers' that will improve thdbuying experience, assist with cross selling, simplify accounted administration and enhance visibility for multi- location customers. We also expect significant gains in efficiencies and cost reductions through the entire supply chain and administrative functions. As we complete the initial systems conversions, we will further quantify and refine the benefits we anticipate and update our midterm financial goals accordingly.
Now Bob will give our financial review of the quarter."

I'd like to start today by reviewing our segment results. Please turn to Slide 5. As I go through these results, please note that we have GAAP reconciliations for various metrics on Slides 13 through 18.
Distribution sales in the quarter were down 1% versus prior year to $886 million with same-store sales down 3%. Gas and rent same-store sales were down 3%, and hardgoods were down 2%, with pricing down slightly by 1% in both categories. We were encouraged by the finish to the quarter, with the month of March posting the first same-store positive sales since November 2008. This is a trend we expect to continue throughout fiscal 2011. 
On a sequential basis, Distribution sales increased by 4%, driven by a 2% increase in daily sales rates and an incremental selling day. Both hardgoods and Gas and rent sales improved sequentially on a daily sales basis, with hardgoods leading the way, up 5%. This is the second consecutive quarter we have seen our daily sales rates increase, and as both Mike and Peter highlighted, we are clearly seeing signs that the economy is building momentum. 
Distribution gross margins was 55%, a decrease of 70 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting a sales mix shift within Gas and rent and lower growth incentive rebates in hardgoods. Sequentially, Distribution gross margin declined 120 basis points, reflecting a sales mix shift to hardgoods, as well as the seasonal increase in propane and other fuel gases that carry lower margins. Gas and rent represented 60% of Distribution sales in the fourth quarter compared to 61% in the third quarter.
Operating margin in the Distribution segment expanded sequentially for a third consecutive quarter to 11.3%. Our Distribution operating margins held up relatively well during the year due to our aggressive reduction of operating expenses in response to declining sales. 
All other operations reflects our CO2/Dry Ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia and Nitrous Oxide business units. Sales for all other operations were down 3% in total, and 4% on a same-store basis from the prior year. Positive same-store sales in our Carbon Dioxide business were more than offset by year-over-year weaknesses in Refrigerants and Ammonia. All other operations same-store sales as a whole turned positive in March along with the Distribution segment.
Sequentially, the sales improvement was driven by seasonal improvement in the Refrigerants business, offset somewhat by the normal seasonal declines in Dry Ice/CO2. Operating income for all other operations was $5 million. Operating margin declined 350 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by margin compression in the Ammonia business as a result of rising costs. 
In the prior year, the market moved in the opposite direction. Ammonia product costs were falling and pricing was stable, creating incremental margins.
Sequentially, the 570 basis point decline in operating margin is primarily attributable to margin compression in the Ammonia business combined with normal seasonal sales declines at CO2 and dry ice. In addition, sales increases in lower margin Refrigerants business also contributed to the sequential decline in margins.
Turning now to Slide 6. We look at our consolidated results. Sales declined by 1% year-over-year to $980 million, reflecting acquisitions growth of 2% and a total same-store sales decline of 3%, comprised of a 3% decline in Gas and rent, and a 2% decline in hardgoods. Volume was down 2%, and price was down 1%. Industrial gas volumes, while improving, were still below the prior year. Sequentially, sales increased by 4%, driven by an incremental selling day and a 2% sequential increase in daily sales. Gas and rent represented approximately 64% of our sales mix compared to 65% in the third quarter, as hardgoods sales are demonstrating their tendency to recover at a faster pace than gas and rent.
As in the Distribution segment, a mixed shift within gas and rent, as well as reduced growth incentive rebates and hardgoods, is reflected in our consolidated gross margin of 54.1% for the quarter, 80 basis points below the prior year. Sequentially, gross margin was down 170 basis points, driven by the impact of the Ammonia business, mix shift to hardgoods and a normal seasonal mix shift within Gas and rent and lower margin gases such as propane and Refrigerants.
Excluding a pretax charge of $23 million related to Air Products' unsolicited takeover attempt, adjusted operating income for the quarter was $105 million, down 8% from last year. Cost reductions and operating efficiencies help support our adjusted operating margin, with decline modestly year-over-year to 10.7% from 11.5%, and sequentially from 11.1%. The sequential decline is attributable to the seasonality in the All Other Operations segment, as well as the margin impact I discussed related to the Ammonia business.
Adjusted earnings per share were $0.69 in the fourth quarter, a 6% increase sequentially, and a 1% increase from the prior year. There were approximately $85 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, up about 1% year-over-year and up 1% sequentially. 
Return on capital was 10%, a 270 basis point decline from the prior year, primarily driven by the recession and the related decline in operating income. 
With respect to accounts receivable, our collection rates for the quarter have remained relatively constant both year-over-year and sequentially. And our quarterly DSO of 48 days was consistent with the third quarter results. 
Inventory turns held consistent with recent trends, and inventory reductions contributed almost $60 million to our cash flow this fiscal year. 
We increased our dividend for the fourth quarter by 22% to $0.22 per share, representing a 36% increase in dividends per share paid in fiscal 2010 over 2009.
Adjusted debt has been reduced by nearly $270 million in fiscal 2010 to approximately $1.8 billion at March 31. During March, we issued $300 million of 2.85% senior notes due in 2013, which was significantly oversubscribed. We used the proceeds to reduce the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility, under which we had approximately $823 million available as of March 31. 
In March, we also signed a two-year $295 million account receivable securitization agreement, replacing the previous agreement that was set to expire. The new agreement expires in March of 2012. Our fixed float ratio at the end of March was 50-50, and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.7 within our revised target range of two to three.
Please turn to Slide 7, capital expenditures. We reduced our capital spending by nearly $100 million this year to $253 million. Spending on cylinders, bulk tanks and rental welders declined as sales slowed, and overall capital spending was down 28% year-over-year. However, we still invested in these revenue-generating assets where we had the opportunity to expand our book of business. We also finished up plant upgrades and new production facilities, and are ready to support growth as the economy rebounds. Excluding the impact of major capital projects, capital spending for the year was about 4% of sales.
Slide 8 presents our fiscal 2011 first quarter and full year guidance. For the first quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.72, an increase of 6% to 9% over the prior year and including $0.02 of incremental SAP implementation costs. Excluding incremental SAP costs, our guidance represents a 9% to 12% improvement year-over-year. 
For the full year, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $2.95 to $3.05, up 10% to 14% over adjusted EPS for fiscal 2010, and including $0.10 of incremental SAP implementation costs. Excluding incremental SAP costs, our guidance for the full year reflects a 14% to 18% improvement over fiscal 2010.
We expect same-store sales to turn positive in the current quarter, led by hardgoods, which tend to outperform gases in the early stages of a recovery. For the full year, we expect same-store sales to be in the mid- to upper-single digits. 
 
Operating margins will be in the 11.5% to 12% range, and we estimate capital expenditures to be a approximately 5.5% of sales. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 38% to 39%, and our guidance does not incorporate the impact of debt extinguishment or multi-employer pension withdrawal charges, if any, or costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt.
Slide 9 presents a walk through the primary elements of our guidance, using adjusted fourth quarter EPS of $0.69 and fiscal 2010 adjusted EPS of $2.68 as the starting points. Both have several headwinds, including incremental SAP implementation costs, higher share count and tax rate and the reset of variable compensation components as we exit a difficult economic period. We expect these headwinds to be more than offset by improvements in the underlying business, driven by an improving economy, related strength in same-store sales and incremental operating efficiencies.
The underlying business improvement represents year-over-year earnings growth of approximately 16% and 22% for the first quarter and full year, respectively, and is consistent with the plan we developed in conjunction with the midterm financial goals we announced at the December analyst meeting. And now I'll turn it back to Peter."
24504,100728867,60024,"Airgas Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, May 06, 2010",2010-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Airgas, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bob. Before we turn to Q&A, I'd like to quickly highlight some of the reasons that underscore our confidence in Airgas' prospects for a continued growth and shareholder value creation. Please turn to Slide 11. This slide illustrates the EPS grow",652,"Thanks, Bob. Before we turn to Q&A, I'd like to quickly highlight some of the reasons that underscore our confidence in Airgas' prospects for a continued growth and shareholder value creation. 
Please turn to Slide 11. This slide illustrates the EPS growth generated in the economic recovery from calendar 2002 to 2005, and contrast that with the growth represented by our current midterm financial goals. The top of the slide is the 2002 to 2005 period, and the bottom slide (sic) [chart] is 2009 through 2012 based on our goals. 
In the three-year period following the last recession, we delivered compounded annual EPS growth of 18%. Our earnings growth tends to accelerate as an expansion continues, particularly after overcoming the initial headwinds of variable costs at the outset the recovery. 
We announced a new set of midterm financial goals at our December analyst meeting, consistent with our practice over the past decade. We issue midterm financial goals for the benefit of investors, and we have a proven track record of meeting or exceeding our targets. The bottom chart shows the earnings growth trajectory from calendar 2009 to our calendar 2012 target of $4.20 or greater.
This 16% compounded annual growth rate is more conservative than our performance in the last recovery in spite of the fact that we are a much stronger operating company today than we were back then. Attractive upside could come from a cooperative economy or from the benefits of our SAP implementation. You can see that our fiscal 2011 EPS guidance is right in line with our path to calendar 2012.
Another point I like to bring out is that in the 2002 to 2005 period, we had a 16% CAGR on same-store sales, 6% was internal growth and 10% was acquisition. In the goals set forth in the 2009 to 2012 period at the bottom of the page, we have an 8% to 10% CAGR on sales, 7% internal and 3% acquisitions. So at the top of the page, we had higher interest and higher depreciation because the sales mix favored acquisitions that we don't have now at the bottom of the page.
We also have a history of meeting or exceeding the annual guidance we provide in May of each year. In fact, we delivered EPS above the top end of our guidance by an average of nearly 8% in three of the last five years. In fiscal 2009, the year the economic tsunami hit, we missed our guidance by less than 4% and proved resilient by delivering EPS within our guidance range for fiscal 2010 under very difficult economic conditions. Consider our calendar year 2012 target of $4.20 plus per share and the implications of that target for the stand-alone trading potential of our shares, even without including any control premium. Consider our track record of delivering value to our shareholders. While there is no assurance, we point these factors out to underscore our board's view that we can deliver superior value to our stockholders by executing our strategic plans. 
Finally, I want to be clear that this is a tremendous opportunity for Airgas stockholders to benefit in the future value of the execution of our business strategies, as highlighted on Slide 12. Our industry is still very fragmented and acquisitions are a core competency at Airgas. The benefits of our customer-centric culture and new sales alignment are just starting to develop. 
And on the subject of alignment, between the Airgas board and the management team, we own 12% of the company, so the interests of the Airgas board and management are aligned with those of all Airgas shareholders. We appreciate the tremendous amount of support we've received from our shareholders and our customers, and look forward to continuing to deliver outstanding value to you in the years to come. 
Thank you. And now I'll turn it back to Jay to begin our Q&A session."

And as I've always said, the most exciting time in Airgas is right now. 
We delivered the second best earnings quarter in our history, which is particularly encouraging, given that at this early stage of the economic recovery, revenues have not yet recovered to pre-recession levels. 
Our business, which historically lags the economic cycle, is just starting to gather momentum in the economic recovery. In addition, Air Products' takeover attempt has cast a bright light on our business, revealing how undervalued the company was and energizing the 14,000 Airgas associates out there who make up the best team in the business from drivers and retail store personnel to our plant operators, sales force and back-office teams. We have proven year after year our ability to create real shareholder value, and as our quarterly results show, we're off to a great start in continuing that trend this year. 
Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.83 for the first quarter, up 26% from the prior year and up 20% sequentially. After posting strong earnings deep into the recession and solid results through the downturn, we are excited again to post double-digit earnings growth, the kind our shareholders have come to expect from Airgas. 
Before continuing with the business at hand today, I want to briefly address the Air Products' unsolicited takeover attempt, including their revised offer of $63.50 per share. The Airgas Board of Directors unanimously believes that Air Products' revised offer, like their previous offers of $60 and $62 per share, grossly undervalued Airgas. And today, we filed our 14D-9 response to that effect. 
Our reasoning, simply stated, is that Air Products' proposals do not reflect the inherent value of our future prospects. Our extraordinary track record in creating shareholder value and our position as the largest and most valuable packaged gas business in the world. They also fail to reflect our substantial recent investment and the significant opportunities for our business as the economy recovers as further evidenced by our strong first quarter earnings. 
Since Airgas' IPO in 1986, we have employed a disciplined approach to steadily growing revenue, EBITDA and shareholder equity. Airgas stock has achieved total shareholder return over that period of time, more than 7x the return of the S&P 500 index. We believe Air Products' unsolicited takeover attempt is an opportunistic effort to cut off the Airgas stockholder's ability to benefit as the domestic economy continues its recovery. It is also an effort to obtain the future value of Airgas at a bargain basement price. 
Air Products has essentially acknowledged the importance of their timing, declaring the timing of their proposals to be ""excellent or ideal"" as ""the economy is just beginning to emerge from the recession."" Indeed, our performance coming out of the last recession was robust, and we are a much stronger company today than we were then. 
Since Air Products commenced its tender offer, we delivered excellent results, and economic conditions have continued to improve. We have reduced our adjusted debt by more than $160 million since Air Products first approached us with a $60 offer in October last year, and we have now just delivered the second best earnings quarter in company history at a very early stage in the economic recovery. We believe that the improving sales climate bolsters the expectations of greater value. Our strategy through the downturn was to position Airgas to emerge from the recession as an even stronger company, and our results demonstrate our success. 
I invite you to review our materials on this topic posted in the Investor Information section of our website by clicking on the Air Products Unsolicited Proposal link. In particular, we will be posting a new presentation today entitled It's All About Value, which provides additional support for our midterm goals and we believe further strengthens our position that Air Products' offer grossly undervalues Airgas. 
Please turn to Slide 2 for a recap of the outstanding quarter we just delivered. We're excited that the world is watching our performance, and we're all very bullish on the future of Airgas. Daily sales improved by 5% sequentially, the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement and another sign that business is strengthening. 
Total sales in the quarter were nearly $1.05 billion, an increase of 7% over the prior year, driven by a total same-store sales increase of 6%. Gas and Rent same-store sales increased 5% and Hardgoods increased 8%. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 1%. Also, as expected, Hardgoods continue to lead the recovery. 
Conditions continue to improve in most of our customer segments and geographies this quarter, led by Manufacturing and with the greatest strength in our Great Lakes region. We again expanded our book of business with another very strong quarter of signings in our Strategic Accounts program, which was established specifically for multi-location customers who benefit from sole-source supply and supply chain management services. Companies across a variety of industries continue to embrace the value proposition inherent in our integrated product and service offerings. 
In light of the accelerating pace of cost increases as the economy recovers, we announced our first broad-based price increase on gas, rent and hardgoods in nearly two years effective June 1. The price increase has been successful thus far, but we do not expect to realize the full benefits until the September quarter. 
Cash flow continues to be one of the strengths of our business model, and the first quarter was no exception. Free cash flow of $113 million resulted from $171 million of adjusted cash flow from operations and continued CapEx discipline. We reduced our adjusted debt by $83 million during the quarter, and we're pleased to increase our dividends to $0.25 per share on the strength of our outstanding performance and future prospects. 
Our acquisition activity has historically accelerated during the recovery phase of the business cycle, and we hope that recent developments in the pipeline are signs of sustainable improvement. Year-to-date, we have acquired four small businesses with aggregate annual revenues of $5 million. 
Our acquisition strategy is unchanged. We have capacity to purchase and integrate quality businesses, and we remain diligent in sourcing transaction. We will continue to evaluate international opportunities as they arise, but our primary focus remains on domestic core product and service offering acquisition. 
Looking forward, in the second quarter, we expect another sequential improvement in daily sales. June finished well above our first quarter average daily sales, and given holiday and seasonal consideration, July is tracking well. The strengthening in our business and our robust result give us the confidence to raise our fiscal 2011 guidance by more than 7% from the previously announced range to a new range of $3.15 to $3.30 per share, which is an 18% to 23% increase over fiscal 2010. 
As I mentioned earlier, our strategy was to position Airgas to emerge an even stronger company in the economic recovery, and our results are testament to the success of that strategy as we are running very close to record earnings and margin. We intend to stay focused on our fundamental strategies, enhance our sales organization and performance and continue to train our associates as we position Airgas to drive significant shareholder value creation during the recovery. 
Mike will now give us a review of market strategy and operations."

Welding Hardgoods are a critical element of the offering in the U.S. Packaged Gas business. They also provide some useful leading indicators for us, both in total and also in end product categories. In general, Hardgoods same-store sales lead Gas and Rent same-store sales in the recovery.

Equipment, which consist primarily of welding and cutting machines, represents the capital purchase for our customers, and equipment sales tend to rise as customers invest in their business for future productions. Daily sales of filler metals increased 11% sequential. Customer production rates drive a significant portion of filler metal demand and account for most of the improvement. 
Another measure of hardgood activity is the number of invoice line items picked and shipped from our distribution centers to our branches and customers. The hardgoods in this category are primarily welding and gas-handling accessories and safety supplies. First quarter lines shipped from our DCs increased by more than 10% from the fourth quarter. 
In the Gas business, production, distribution and asset management are key drivers of profitability and returns. Our production numbers have been on the rise, and the average number of industrial gas cylinders filled per day improved sequentially by 8% in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Excluding fuel gases, which declined seasonally in our first quarter, sales per day for cylinder gases improved 4% from the fourth quarter. Regardless of the metric you'd pick, solid improvement in our underlying business is evident. 
Our sales and marketing strategy focused on segment alignment also continues to gain momentum. Success thus far has been most pronounced in our Strategic Accounts program, where this strategy originated and was already underway in Medical and Construction segments. 
For the first quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 12% from the prior year, driven by new account signings across all customer segments and by increased activity in our existing metal fabrication and materials and conglomerates customer base. Strategic Accounts present tremendous cross-sell opportunities, both in terms of product line and locations and now represent 20% of the total sales. 
Turning to Slide 3, sales of our Strategic Products, which combines that make up over 40% of our revenue, increased 9% for the quarter, stronger than the overall same-store sales increase of 6%. Our Strategic Products as a group continue to have particularly good long-term growth profiles as many of our growth accelerators impact their performance.  
Safety Products sales grew 15% year-over-year in the quarter, comparing favorably to the overall Hardgoods same-store sales increase of 8%. On a sequential basis, daily sales of Safety Products were up 8%. The increase in Safety Products sales was broad based, although most pronounced at our manufacturing customer base as operating rates have steadily improved. Safety Products sales still represented strong cross-sell opportunities for us as our customer realize good value in vendor consolidation. 
Bulk Gas sales were up 8% compared to prior year and up 4% sequentially compared to the fourth quarter, as sales of bulk nitrogen for food-freezing application to continue to show strength supported by the launch of our FreezeRight line of cryogenic freezers, and bulk sales to industrial manufacturing customers continue to recover in segments such as Steel and Auto. 
Specialty Gas sales increased 7% year-over-year, driven largely by higher volumes. Sequentially, the Specialty Gas daily sales improved by 3%, driven by a broad-based increase in demand for core specialty gases, including further strengthening of our market position in EPA protocol and other calibration gas mixtures.
Our Radnor private label products were up 15% for the quarter, better than the same-store sales increase in total Hardgoods. The long-term growth opportunities for the Radnor brand remains strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or more than comparable OEM products. 
Our operating efficiency programs that's focused on cylinder maintenance testing, distribution of fill plant logistics, brake and fuel management are progressing according to schedule. At our December Analyst Meeting, we set a goal to attain $40 million of new operating efficiency savings over the next four years, driven largely by logistics, plant studies and cylinder testing. We are on track to deliver the $10 million of those savings that are included in our fiscal 2011 guidance. 
As planned, we've began the phase rollout of our highly customized SAP platform on July 5. Our Hardgoods distribution infrastructure, including our six national distribution centers, our national purchasing organization and the Safety telesales organizations were the first to go live, and thus far, the feedback has been very positive. Our next SAP rollout will be to one of our regional distribution companies later in fiscal 2011. 
The commencement of our plant phase rollout, whereby business units implement the new system in succession, marks a major milestone in the structural development of our company. As in everything we do, we have taken a customer-centric approach to SAP, planning and executing to minimize conversion risk and ensure a seamless transition for our customers. We expect returns that will more than justify our investments, significantly above our internal hurdle rate of 15% to 20% IRR and return on capital and well above our cost of capital. Given our expertise with system conversions and the amount of time and energy we've invested, we are uniquely positioned to maximize the value of this investment, and we are confident that the implementation of SAP will create meaningful value for all Airgas stockholders. 
Through June 2010, we have invested more than half of the total plant for the project. For fiscal 2011, we expect incremental operating expenses of approximately $14 million as we begin the implementation phase of the project, driven by training, conversion and depreciation. All SAP-related operating and implementation costs for the current implementation schedule are included in our midterm financial goals introduced in December 2009, but the benefits of our SAP implementation and the positive impact we expected to have on our financial results are not included in our forecast. 
Benefits will include customer phasing applications that will improve the customer's buying experience, assisted with cross selling and simplified account administration and enhanced feasibility for multi-location customers. We also expect significant gains and efficiencies in both the gases and hardgoods supply chain, as well as in administrator processing [ph]. In addition, SAP tools and functionality will drive more structured and disciplined pricing. As we move forward with SAP conversions, we will further refine the quantity and timing of the benefits we anticipate and update our midterm financial goals accordingly. 
Now Bob will give our financial review of the quarter."

I'd like to start today by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide 4.

I'd like to start today by reviewing our consolidated results. Please turn to Slide 4. As I go through these results, please note that we have GAAP reconciliations for various metrics on Slides 11 through 15. 
Sales increased by 7% year-over-year to a little over $1 billion, reflecting acquisition growth of 1% and total same-store sales growth of 6%, comprised of the 5% increase in Gas and Rent and an 8% increase in Hardgoods. Volume was up 5% and price was up 1%, with only one month of contribution from the June price increase. 
Sequentially, sales increased by 7%, driven by an incremental selling day and a 5% sequential increase in daily sales. Both Hardgoods and Gas and Rent sales improved sequentially on a daily sales basis, with Gas and Rent leading the way, up 6%. Consistent with the fourth quarter, Gas and Rent represented approximately 64% of our sales mix. The Gas and Rent mix was slightly higher in the first quarter of last year at 65%. 
Gross margin was 54.9%, a decline of 40 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift towards lower-margin hardgoods that is characteristic of an industrial economic recovery. Sequentially, however, gross margin expanded by 50 basis points reflecting seasonal rebound of certain businesses in the All Other Operations segment, which I will discuss on the next slide. 
Excluding pretax charges of approximately $4 million related to Air Products' unsolicited takeover attempt and approximately $3 million related to the withdrawal from multi-employer pension plan, adjusted operating income for the quarter was $130 million, up 20% from last year and up 24% sequentially from the fourth quarter. Adjusted operating margin was 12.3%, a 130 basis-point improvement over the prior year and 160 basis-point improvement sequentially, driven by operating leverage on sales growth in the quarter, which more than overcame sequential and year-over-year expense headwinds from variable compensation resets and the SAP implementation. 
Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.83 in the first quarter, a 26% increase from the prior year and a 20% increase on a sequential basis. This quarter marked the second highest earnings performance in our history, the highest being $0.86 in September 2008 quarter, just prior to the economic downturn. 
There were approximately 85 million weighted-average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, up about 2% year-over-year and up 1% on a sequential basis. Return on capital, which is a trailing four-quarters calculation, was 10.5%, a 130 basis-point decline from the prior year, primarily driven by the recession and the related decline in operating income. Sequentially, however, return on capital improved by 50 basis points on the strength of our improved operating income this quarter. 
Turning now to Slide 5, we look at our segment results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 7% versus the prior year to $932 million, with same-store sales up 5%. Gas and Rent same-store sales were up 3%, and were up 8%, with pricing up 1% in both categories, impacted in part by one-month contribution from our June 1 price increase. 
On a sequential basis, distribution sales increased 5%, driven by a 3% increase in daily sales rate and an incremental selling day. Both Hardgoods and Gas and Rent sales improved sequentially on a daily basis, with Hardgoods up 4%, slightly outpacing Gas and Rent. This is the third consecutive quarter that we have seen our daily distribution rates increase, with a slight acceleration of that pace in this quarter. And as both Mike and Peter highlighted, we are clearly seeing signs that our business is gaining momentum. 
Distribution gross margin was 55.5%, a decrease of 60 basis points in the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift toward lower-margin hardgoods. Sequentially, distribution gross margin improved 20 basis points. Consistent with the fourth quarter, Gas and Rent represented close to 50% of distribution sales in the first quarter. 
Adjusted operating income in the Distribution segment increased 19% year-over-year to $107 million. Sequentially, adjusted operating income improved to $107 million from $100 million in the fourth quarter. It's worth highlighting that we achieved that strong sequential improvement in adjusted operating income after overcoming approximately $14 million in sequential expense hurdles, including post-recession reset of variable compensation and stock-based compensation expense, which is front-end loaded in our fiscal year due to retiree eligible vesting provisions. 
Adjusted operating margin in the Distribution segment expanded sequentially for a fourth consecutive quarter to 11.5%. All Other Operations reflects our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia and Nitrous Oxide business units. Sales for All Other Operations were up 14% in total and 13% on a same-store sales basis from the prior year, driven largely by a strong performance in our Refrigerants business this quarter. 
The Refrigerants business benefited from some pent-up demand, as well as certain products shortages, and we were able to leverage our broad platform to respond where other suppliers could not, generating both volume and margin expansion. Sequentially, the sales improvement was driven by seasonal improvement in the Refrigerants, CO2 and Dry Ice businesses, as well as by the strong performance in Refrigerants. 
Operating income for All Other Operations was $23 million. Operating margin increased by 150 basis points year-over-year, as margin compression in the Ammonia business resulting from rising cost was more than offset by margin expansion in the Refrigerants business. Sequentially, the more than 1,200-basis-point improvement in operating margin is primarily attributable to the normal seasonal improvement in the CO2 and Dry Ice businesses, which carry higher fixed cost than our Distribution businesses, as well as the strong performance in Refrigerants for the first quarter. 
With respect to accounts receivable, our collection rates for the quarter have remained relatively consistent, both year-over-year and sequentially, and our quarterly DSO of 47 days was slightly better than the fourth quarter's results. Inventory turns held consistent with recent trends, reflecting our disciplined management of inventory levels during the significant uptick in hardgoods sales. 
We generated strong free cash flow for the quarter of $130 million driven by adjusted cash from operations of $171 million. The strength of our robust earnings, continued strong cash flow and outlook for the future, we increased our second quarter dividend by 14% to $0.25 per share. We have reduced adjusted debt by approximately $83 million in the first quarter to $1.7 billion at June 30 and reduced it by over $260 million on a year-over-year basis. Our fixed-float ratio at the end of June was about 52% fixed, and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.6, within our revised target range of two to three. 
Please turn to Slide 6, capital expenditures. We have continued to be disciplined in our capital spending this year, which was down 9% in the quarter versus the prior year, as we lapped the completion of our new ASU in Kentucky that was completed last year. CapEx represented 5.8% of sales, consistent with our expectation.
Slide 7 presents our fiscal 2011 second quarter and updated full year guidance. For the second quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.82, an increase of 15% to 21% over the prior year and including $0.03 of incremental SAP implementation costs. Excluding incremental SAP costs, our guidance represents a 19% to 25% improvement over the prior year. For the full year, we are raising our earnings per share expectations to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.30, up 18% to 23% over adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2010 and including $0.10 of incremental SAP implementation costs. Excluding incremental SAP costs, our guidance for the full year reflects a 21% to 27% improvement over fiscal 2010. We expect same-store sales growth to be in the high single digits in the second quarter and in the mid- to upper-single digits for the full fiscal year. Our guidance range does include SAP expense. 
Operating margins are now expected to be in the 12% to 12.5% range, and we continue to estimate capital expenditures to be approximately 5.5% of sales. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 38% to 39%, and our guidance does not incorporate the impact of debt extinguishment, multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charges or costs related to the unsolicited takeover attempt. 
Slide 8 presents a walk through the primary elements of our guidance using first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.83 and fiscal 2010 adjusted EPS of $2.68 as the starting points for the second quarter and full year respectively. Sequentially, the second quarter has headwinds of approximately $0.06 driven by seasonality, in addition to strong first quarter performance in our Refrigerants business, seasonality in the Rental Welder business and incremental SAP implementation expense. 
We expect the four business to expand sequentially 1% to 6%, with price tailwinds that overcome the normal seasonal flowing in July and early August in our core Distribution business. For the full year, our updated $3.15 to $3.30 guidance reflects headwinds from variable compensation reset, SAP implementation, tax rate and share count, which is more than offset by a 27% to 33% improvement in the underlying business, driven by continued momentum in our sales growth, our price increase initiative and operating efficiencies. The guidance also reflects the normal third and fourth quarter seasonal slowing in our CO2, Dry Ice and Refrigerants businesses. 
The underlying business improvement is consistent with the plan we developed in conjunction with our midterm financial goals we announced at the December Analyst Meeting. And in fact, our trajectory is higher. And now I'll turn it back to Peter."

Before we go to Q&A, I want to quickly highlight some of the reasons that underscore our confidence in Airgas' prospects for continued growth and shareholder value creation. 
Slide 9 illustrates the EPS growth generated in the economic recovery from calendar 2002 to 2005 and contrast that with the growth represented by our current midterm goals. In the three-year period following the last recession, we delivered a compound annual EPS growth rate of 18%. Our earnings growth tend to accelerate as an expansion continues, particularly after overcoming the initial headwinds of variable costs at the outset of recovery. We announced a new set of midterm financial goals at our December Analyst Meeting, consistent with our practice over the last decade. We are proud of our proven track record of meeting or exceeding our targets. The bottom chart shows the earnings growth trajectory from calendar 2009 to our calendar 2012 target of $4.20 per share or greater. The 16% CAGR is more conservative than our performance in the last recovery in spite of the fact that we are a much stronger operating company today. 
Attractive upside could come from a cooperative economy and/or the benefits of our SAP implementation. You can clearly see that our revised fiscal 2011 guidance range is above the earnings trajectory on which these current midterm goals are built, a point which Bob just made. In other words, if we continue at our current pace, I expect us to beat our target of $4.20 per share for calendar 2012. We point these factors out to underscore our board's view that we're confident we can deliver superior value to our stockholders by continuing to execute our strategic plan. 
Finally, I want to be clear that there is tremendous opportunity for Airgas stockholders to benefit from the future value of the execution of our business strategies, as highlighted on Slide 10. Our industry is still very fragmented, and acquisitions are our core competency at Airgas. The benefits of our customer-centric culture and new sales alignment are just starting to develop. And on the subject of alignment, between the Airgas board and the management team, we own 12% of the company so that the interest of the Airgas board and management are aligned with those of all Airgas stockholders. 
We appreciate the tremendous amount of support we've received from our shareholders and look forward to continuing to deliver outstanding value to you in the years to come. Thank you. And now I'd like to turn it back to Jay for Q&A."

So we're seeing the strength across all customer segments, and we see business spending money, investing capital, making CapEx. That's helpful to us, and we're taking advantage of it."

We had a great quarter at Airgas, and as I've always said, the most exciting time at Airgas is right now. We delivered the second-best earnings quarter in our history, which is particularly",1233,"Thanks, Jay. Good morning, and thank you, all, for joining us. We had a great quarter at Airgas, and as I've always said, the most exciting time at Airgas is right now. 
We delivered the second-best earnings quarter in our history, which is particularly encouraging, given that at this early stage of the economic recovery, revenues have not yet recovered to pre-recession levels. Our business, which historically lags the economic cycle, is just starting to gather momentum in the economic recovery. 
In addition, Air Products' takeover attempt has cast a bright light on our business, revealing how undervalued the company was and energizing the 14,000 Airgas associates out there who make up the best team in the business, from drivers and retail store personnel to our plant operators, sales force and back office teams. We have proven year after year our ability to create real shareholder value. And as our quarterly results show, we're off to a great start in continuing that trend this year. 
Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.83 for the first quarter, up 26% from the prior year and up 20% sequentially. After posting strong earnings deep into the recession and solid results through the downturn, we are excited again to post double-digit earnings growth, the kind our shareholders have come to expect from Airgas. 
Before continuing with the business at hand today, I want to briefly address the Air Products' unsolicited takeover attempt including their revised offer of $63.50 per share. The Airgas board of directors unanimously believe that Air Products' revised offer, like their previous offers of $60 and $62 per share, grossly undervalue Airgas. And today, we filed our 14D-9 response to that effect. 
Our reasoning, simply stated, is that Air Products' proposals do not reflect the inherent value of our future prospects, our extraordinary track record in creating shareholder value and our position as the largest and most valuable package gas business in the world. They also failed to reflect our substantial recent investments and the significant opportunities for our business as the economy recovers, as further evidenced by our strong first quarter earnings. 
Since Airgas' IPO in 1986, we have employed a disciplined approach to steadily growing revenue, EBITDA and shareholder equity. Airgas stock has achieved total shareholder return over that period of time, more than 7x the return of the S&P 500 Index. We believe Air Products' unsolicited takeover attempt is an opportunistic effort to cut off the Airgas stockholders' ability to benefit as the domestic economy continues its recovery. It is also an effort to obtain the future value of Airgas at a bargain basement price. Air Products has essentially acknowledged the importance of their timing, declaring the timing of their proposals to be ""excellent or ideal"" as ""the economy is just beginning to emerge from the recession."" Indeed, our performance coming out of the last recession was robust, and we are a much stronger company today than we were then. 
Since Air Products commenced its tender offer, we've delivered excellent results, and economic conditions have continued to improve. We have reduced our adjusted debt by more than $160 million since Air Products first approached us with the $60 offer in October last year, and we have now just delivered the second-best earnings quarter in company history at a very early stage in the economic recovery. We believe that the improving sales climate bolsters the expectations of greater value. Our strategy through the downturn was to position Airgas to emerge from the recession as an even stronger company, and our results demonstrate our success. 
I invite you to review our materials on this topic posted in the Investor Information section of our website by clicking on the Air Products' Unsolicited Proposal link. In particular, we will be posting a new presentation today entitled It's All About Value, which provides additional support for our midterm goals and we believe further strengthens our position that Air Products' offer grossly undervalues Airgas. 
Please turn to Slide 2 for a recap of the outstanding quarter we just delivered. We're excited that the world is watching our performance, and we're all very bullish on the future of Airgas. Daily sales improved by 5% sequentially, the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement and another sign that business is strengthening. 
Total sales in the quarter were nearly $1.05 billion, an increase of 7% over the prior year, driven by a total same-store sales increase of 6%. Gas and rent same-store sales increased 5% and hardgoods increased 8%. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of 1%. Also, as expected, hardgoods continue to lead the recovery. 
Conditions continue to improve in most of our customer segments and geographies this quarter, led by Manufacturing and with the greatest strength in our Great Lakes region. We again expanded our book of business with another very strong quarter of signings in our Strategic Accounts program, which was established specifically for multi-location customers who benefit from sole-source supply and supply chain management services. Companies across a variety of industries continue to embrace the value proposition inherent in our integrated product and service offerings. 
In light of the accelerating pace of cost increases as the economy recovers, we announced our first broad-based price increase on gas, rents and hardgoods in nearly two years effective June 1. The price increase has been successful thus far, but we do not expect to realize the full benefits until the September quarter. 
Cash flow continues to be one of the strengths of our business model, and the first quarter was no exception. Free cash flow of $113 million resulted from a $171 million of adjusted cash flow from operation and continued CapEx discipline. We reduced our adjusted debt by $83 million during the quarter, and we're pleased to increase our dividend to $0.25 per share on the strength of our outstanding performance and future prospects. 
Our acquisition activity has historically accelerated during the recovery phase of the business cycle, and we hope that recent developments in the pipeline are signs of sustainable improvement. Year-to-date, we have acquired four small businesses with aggregate annual revenues of $5 million. Our acquisition strategy is unchanged. We have capacity to purchase and integrate quality businesses, and we remain diligent in sourcing transaction. We will continue to evaluate international opportunities as they arise, but our primary focus remains on domestic core product and service offering acquisition. 
Looking forward, in the second quarter, we expect another sequential improvement in daily sales. June finished well above our first quarter average daily sales, and given holiday and seasonal consideration, July is tracking well. The strengthening in our business and our robust result give us the confidence to raise our fiscal 2011 guidance by more than 7% from the previously announced range to a new range of $3.15 to $3.30 per share, which is an 18% to 23% increase over fiscal 2010. 
As I mentioned earlier, our strategy was to position Airgas to emerge an even stronger company in the economic recovery, and our results are a testament to the success of that strategy as we are running very close to record earnings and margin. We intend to stay focused on our fundamental strategies, enhance our sales organization and performance and continue to train our associates as we position Airgas to drive significant shareholder value creation during the recovery. 
Mike will now give us a review of market strategy and operation."

This morning, I'm going to give you a few examples of metrics we watch to illustrate this momentum. Then I'll review operating results, and I'll finish with a brief update on our SAP implementation. 
Welding hardgoods are a critical element of the offering in the U.S. Packaged Gas business. They also provide some useful leading indicators for us both in total and also within product categories. In general, hardgoods same-store sales lead gas and rent same-store sales in the recovery. 
In the first quarter, our daily sales of equipment were up sequentially 1% from the fourth quarter. Equipment, which consists primarily of welding and cutting machines, represents the capital purchase for our customers, and equipment sales tend to rise as customers invest in their business for future production. 
Daily sales of filler metals increased 11% sequentially. Customer production rates drive a significant portion of filler metal demand and account for most of the improvement. 
Another measure of hardgood activity is the number of invoice line items picked and shipped from our distribution centers to our branches and customers. The hardgoods in this category are primarily welding and gas handling accessories and safety supplies. First quarter line shipped from our DCs [distribution centers] increased by more than 10% from the fourth quarter. 
In the Gas business, production, distribution and asset management are key drivers of profitability and returns. Our production numbers have been on the rise, and the average number of industrial gas cylinders filled per day improved sequentially by 8% in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Excluding fuel gases, which declined seasonally in our first quarter, sales per day for cylinder gases improved 4% from the fourth quarter. Regardless of the metric you pick, solid improvement in our underlying business is evident. 
Our sales and marketing strategy focused on segment alignment also continues to gain momentum. Success thus far has been most pronounced in our Strategic Accounts program, where this strategy originated and was already underway in Medical and Construction segments. 
For the first quarter, Strategic Accounts business was up 12% from the prior year, driven by new account signings across all customer segments and by increased activity in our existing metal fabrication and materials and conglomerates customer base. Strategic Accounts present tremendous cross-sell opportunities both in terms of product line and locations and now represents 20% of total sales. 
Turning to Slide 3. Sales of our Strategic Products which combined make up over 40% of our revenue increased 9% for the quarter, stronger than the overall same-store sales increase of 6%. Our Strategic Products as a group continue to have particularly good long-term growth profile as many of our growth accelerators impact their performance. 
Safety products sales grew 15% year-over-year in the quarter, comparing favorably to the overall hardgoods same-store sales increase of 8%. On a sequential basis, daily sales of safety products were up 8%. The increase in safety products sales was broad based although most pronounced at our manufacturing customer base as operating rates have steadily improved. Safety products sales still represent a strong cross-sell opportunities for us, as our customer realize good value in vendor consolidation. 
Bulk gas sales were up 8% compared to prior year and up 4% sequentially compared to the fourth quarter, as sales of bulk nitrogen for food-freezing application continue to show strength supported by the launch of our FreezeRight line of cryogenic freezers, and bulk sales to industrial manufacturing customers continue to recover in segments such as Steel and Auto. 
Specialty Gas sales increased 7% year-over-year, driven largely by higher volumes. Sequentially, the Specialty Gas daily sales improved by 3%, driven by a broad-based increase in demand for core specialty gases, including further strengthening of our market position in EPA protocol and other calibration gas mixtures. 
Our Radnor private label products were up 15% for the quarter, better than the same-store sales increase in total hardgoods. The long-term growth opportunities for the Radnor brand remain strong. In addition of building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or more than comparable OEM products. 
Our operating efficiency programs, which focus on cylinder maintenance, testing, distribution and fill plant logistics, brake and fuel management, are progressing according to schedule. At our December Analyst Meeting, we set a goal to attain $40 million of new operating efficiency savings over the next four years, driven largely by logistics, plant studies and cylinder testing. We are on track to deliver the $10 million of those savings that are included in our fiscal 2011 guidance. 
As planned, we began the phased rollout of our highly customized SAP platform on July 5. Our hardgoods distribution infrastructure, including our six national distribution centers, our national purchasing organization and Safety Telesales organizations were the first to go live, and thus far, the feedback has been very positive. Our next SAP rollout will be to one of our regional distribution companies later in fiscal 2011. 
The commencement of our planned phased rollout, whereby business units implement the new system in succession, marks a major milestone in the structural development of our company. As in everything we do, we have taken a customer-centric approach to SAP, planning and executing to minimize conversion risk and ensure a seamless transition for our customers. We expect returns that will more than justify our investment, significantly above our internal hurdle rate of 15% to 20% IRR and return on capital and well above our cost of capital. 
Given our expertise with system conversion and the amount of time and energy we've invested, we are uniquely positioned to maximize the value of the this investment, and we are confident that the implementation of SAP will create meaningful value for all Airgas stockholders. 
Through June 2010, we have invested more than half of the total plan for the project. For fiscal 2011, we expect incremental operating expenses of approximately $14 million as we begin the implementation phase of the project, driven by training, conversion and depreciation. All SAP-related operating and implementation cost for the current implementation schedule are included in our mid-term financial goals introduced in December 2009, but the benefits of our SAP implementation and the positive impact we expected to have on our financial results are not included in our forecast. 
Benefits will include customer-facing applications that will improve the customers' buying experience, assisted with cross-selling and simplified account administration and enhanced visibility for multi-location customers. We also expect significant gains and efficiencies in both the gases and hardgoods supply chains, as well as in administrative process.
In addition, SAP tools and functionality will drive more structured and disciplined pricing. As we move forward with SAP conversions, we will further refine the quantity and timing of the benefits we anticipate and update our midterm financial goals accordingly. 
Now Bob will give our financial review of the quarter."

As I go through these results, please note that we have GAAP reconciliations for various metrics on Slides 11 through 15. 
Sales increased by 7% year-over-year to a little over $1 billion, reflecting acquisition growth of 1% and total same-store sales growth of 6%, comprised of the 5% increase in gas and rent and an 8% increase in hardgoods. Volume was up 5%, and price was up 1% with only one month of contribution from the June price increase. Sequentially, sales increased by 7%, driven by an incremental selling day and a 5% sequential increase in daily sales. Both hardgoods and gas and rent sales improved sequentially on a daily sales basis with gas and rent leading the way, up 6%. 
Consistent with the fourth quarter, gas and rent represented approximately 64% of our sales mix. The gas and rent mix was slightly higher in the first quarter last year at 65%. 
Gross margin was 54.9%, a decline of 40 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods that is characteristic of an industrial economic recovery. Sequentially, however, gross margin expanded by 50 basis points, reflecting seasonal rebound of certain businesses in the All Other Operation segments, which I will discuss on the next slide. 
Excluding pretax charges of approximately $4 million related to Air Products' unsolicited takeover attempt and approximately $3 million related to the withdrawal from multi-employer plans, adjusted operating income for the quarter was $130 million, up 20% from last year and up 24% sequentially from the fourth quarter. 
Adjusted operating margin was 12.3%, 130 basis point improvement over the prior year and 160 basis point improvement sequentially, driven by operating leverage on sales growth in the quarter, which more than overcame sequential and year-over-year expense headwinds from variable compensation resets and the SAP implementation. 
Adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.83 in the first quarter, a 26% increase from the prior year and a 20% increase on a sequential basis. This quarter marked the second highest earnings performance in our history, the highest being $0.86 in September 2008 quarter, just prior to the economic downturn. 
There were approximately 85 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, up about 2% year-over-year and up 1% on a sequential basis. Return on capital, which is a trailing four quarters calculation, was 10.5%, 130 basis points decline from the prior year, primarily driven by the recession and the related decline in operating income. Sequentially, however, return on capital improved by 50 basis points on the strength of our improved operating income this quarter. 
Turning now to Slide 5, we'll look at our segment results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 7% versus the prior year to $932 million with same-store sales up 5%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 3% and hardgoods were up 8%, with pricing up 1% in both categories, impacted in part by one month contribution from our June 1 price increase. 
On a sequential basis, distribution sales increased 5%, driven by a 3% increase in daily sales rate and an incremental selling day. Both hardgoods and gas and rent sales improved sequentially on a daily basis, with hardgoods up 4%, slightly outpacing gas and rent. This is the third consecutive quarter that we have seen our daily distribution rate increase, with a slight acceleration of that pace in this quarter. And as both Mike and Peter highlighted, we are clearly seeing signs that our business is gaining momentum. 
Distribution gross margin was 55.5%, a decrease of 60 basis points than the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift to lower margin hardgoods. Sequentially, distribution gross margin improved 20 basis points. Consistent with the fourth quarter, gas and rent represented close to 60% of distribution sales in the first quarter. 
Adjusted operating income in the Distribution segment increased 19% year-over-year to $107 million. Sequentially, adjusted operating income improved to $107 million from $100 million in the fourth quarter. It's worth highlighting that we achieved this strong sequential improvement in adjusted operating income after overcoming approximately $14 million in sequential expense hurdles, including post-recession reset of variable compensation and stock-based compensation expense, which is front-end loaded in our fiscal year due to retiree-eligible vesting provisions. 
Adjusted operating margin in the Distribution segment expanded sequentially for a fourth consecutive quarter to 11.5%. All Other Operation reflects our CO2, Dry Ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia and Nitrous Oxide business units. 
Sales for All Other Operations were up 14% in total and 13% on a same-store sales basis from the prior year, driven largely by strong performance in our Refrigerants business this quarter. The Refrigerants business benefited from some pent-up demand, as well as certain product shortages that we were able to leverage our broad platform to respond where other suppliers could not, generating both volume and margin expansion. Sequentially, the sales improvement was driven by seasonal improvement in the Refrigerants, CO2 and Dry Ice businesses, as well as by the strong performance in Refrigerants. 
Operating income for All Other Operations was $23 million. Operating margin increased by 160 basis points year-over-year, as margin compression in the Ammonia business resulting from rising cost was more than offset by margin expansion in the Refrigerants business. Sequentially, the more than 1,200 basis point improvement in operating margin is primarily attributable to the normal seasonal improvement in the CO2 and Dry Ice businesses, which carry higher fixed costs than our Distribution businesses, as well as the strong performance in Refrigerants for the first quarter. 
With respect to accounts receivable, our collection rates for the quarter have remained relatively consistent both year-over-year and sequentially, and our quarterly DSO of 47 days was slightly better than the fourth quarter's results. Inventory turns held consistent with recent trends, reflecting our disciplined management of inventory levels during the significant uptick in hardgoods sales. We generated strong free cash flow for the quarter of $130 million, driven by adjusted cash from operations of $171 million. 
The strength of our robust earnings, continued strong cash flow and outlook for the future, we increased our second quarter dividend by 14% to $0.25 per share. We have reduced adjusted debt by approximately $83 million in the first quarter to $1.7 billion at June 30, and reduced it by over $260 million on a year-over-year basis. Our fixed float ratio at the end of June was about 52% fixed, and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.6, within our revised target range of two to three. 
Please turn to Slide 6, Capital Expenditures. We have continued to be disciplined in our capital spending this year, which was down 9% in the quarter versus the prior year, as we lapped the completion of our new ASU in Kentucky that was completed last year. CapEx represented 5.8% of sales, consistent with our expectations. 
Slide 7 presents our fiscal 2011 second quarter and updated full year guidance. For the second quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.78 to $0.82, an increase of 15% to 21% over the prior year and including $0.03 of incremental SAP implementation cost. Excluding incremental SAP costs, our guidance represents a 19% to 25% improvement over the prior year. 
For the full year, we are raising our earnings per share expectations to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.30, up 18% to 23% over adjusted earnings per share for fiscal 2010, and including $0.10 of incremental SAP implementation costs. Excluding incremental SAP cost, our guidance for the full year reflects a 21% to 27% improvement over fiscal 2010. We expect same-store sales growth to be in the high single digits in the second quarter and in the mid to upper single digits for the for fiscal year. Our guidance range does include SAP expense. 
Operating margins are now expected to be in the 12% to 12 1/2% range, and we continue to estimate capital expenditures to be approximately 5.5% of sales. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 38% to 39%, and our guidance does not incorporate the impact of debt extinguishment, multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charges or cost related to the unsolicited takeover attempt. 
Slide 8 presents a walk through the primary elements of our guidance, using first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.83 and fiscal 2010 adjusted EPS of $2.68 as the starting points for the second quarter and full year, respectively. Sequentially, the second quarter has headwinds of approximately $0.06, driven by seasonality, in addition to strong first quarter performance in our Refrigerants business, seasonality in the Rental Welder business and incremental SAP implementation expenses. We expect the core business to expand sequentially 1% to 6% with price tailwind to overcome the normal seasonal slowing in July and early August in our core Distribution business. 
For the full year, our updated $3.15 to $3.30 guidance reflects headwinds from variable compensation reset, SAP implementation, tax rate and share count, which is more than offset by a 27% to 33% improvement in the underlying business, driven by continued momentum in our sales growth, our price increase initiative and operating efficiencies. The guidance also reflects the normal third and fourth quarter seasonal flowing in our CO2, Dry Ice and Refrigerants businesses. The underlying business improvement is consistent with the plan we developed in conjunction with our midterm financial goals we announced at the December Analyst Meeting. And in fact, our trajectory is higher. 
And now I'll turn it back to Peter."

Before we go to Q&A, I want to quickly highlight some of the reasons that underscore our confidence in Airgas' prospects for continued growth and shareholder value creation. 
Slide 9 illustrates the EPS growth generated in the economic recovery from calendar 2002 to 2005, and contrast that with the growth represented by our current midterm goals. In the three-year period following the last recession, we delivered a compound annual EPS growth rate of 18%. Our earnings growth tend to accelerate as an expansion continues, particularly after overcoming the initial headwinds of variable costs at the outset of recovery. 
We announced a new set of midterm financial goals at our December Analyst Meeting, consistent with our practice over the last decade. We are proud of our proven track record of meeting or exceeding our targets. 
The bottom chart shows the earnings growth trajectory from calendar 2009 to our calendar 2012 target of $4.20 per share or greater. The 16% CAGR is more conservative than our performance in the last recovery in spite of the fact that we are a much stronger operating company today. Attractive upside could come from a cooperative economy and/or the benefits of our SAP implementation. 
You can clearly see that our revised fiscal 2011 guidance range is above the earnings trajectory on which these current midterm goals are built, a point which Bob just made. In other words, if we continue at our current pace, I expect us to beat our target of $4.20 per share for calendar 2012. We point these factors out to underscore our board's view that we're confident we can deliver superior value to our stockholders by continuing to execute our strategic plan. 
Finally, I want to be clear that there is tremendous opportunity for Airgas stockholders to benefit from the future value of the execution of our business strategies, as highlighted on Slide 10. Our industry is still very fragmented, and acquisitions are a core competency at Airgas. The benefits of our customer-centric culture and new sales alignment are just starting to develop. 
And on the subject of alignment, between the Airgas board and the management team, we own 12% of the company, so that the interest of the Airgas board and management are aligned with those of all Airgas stockholders. We appreciate the tremendous amount of support we've received from our shareholders and look forward to continuing to deliver outstanding value to you in the years to come.

I'm seeing the greatest gains in productivity because we have assigned people to each customer segment. They're very familiar with these customer segments, and we're being very thorough in our approaches to all important customers in those segments. We're also seeing a lot of benefit from penetration of existing strategic accounts. That is, we have an account, we've had it for three years, but we only had 65% of the locations implemented for a number of reasons, and we're pressing hard for full implementation and having good results. The third area I would say is cross-selling. We want to sell all of our products and services to these companies, and there are many of these Strategic Accounts that only buy one or two products from us. So we're having great success in improving that. And then the signings have been terrific now for three quarters in a row, and I'll let Mike talk about the organization and what he thinks."

I mean we are just trying to be much more effective in penetrating the segments that we have always participated in to varying extents. And I think Peter's comments are right on because what we're trying to do is the needs of the chemical industry are very different than what the energy sector people want, which are very different than what the large metal fabrication and steel people want. And being able to take our full portfolio of products to each of those segments tailored to really maximize the value we can bring to them has already started to pay tremendous dividends, and we've got a long runway to drive that yet."

We've achieved really good margins for being so early in the recovery, and that shows the cost discipline that we've had. It reflects good execution on our price increase. I am very pleased. Back in December, I couldn't see as clearly the benefits of our reorganization of our national accounts group along customer segment lines, and that is going very, very well. On the SAP front, we have started our implementation. Knock on wood, it's going very well. That was three years of very hard work and a lot of planning by a terrific team, and we're looking forward to moving forward with our total implementation plan. And remember, our guidance for calendar '12 has all the SAP cost and none of the benefits. And hopefully, we're going to be in a position in the not-too-distant future to give some range of benefits and some idea of what SAP is going to look like at Airgas and what impact it might have, and we're working on that now.

And most people who have good companies, we'd like to see them in good hands and we've been the market leader here. So I continue to believe that the major factor in the slowness in acquisitions is the sellers unwilling to sell a company right near the trough of the recession or only four months into a recovery. It's a stupid thing to do, and they have the cash flow and don't need to do it. So they wait for a year into the recovery or a year and a half, and that's when they sell. And we have some increased activity going on now. And it's not gangbusters, but it's an uptick in activity, and maybe we're starting to see a little bit of that yet. But it's certainly not robust, and I wouldn't expect it to be until these companies could put up some higher numbers."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Our second quarter results served to reinforce the message we have expressed for some time now, that Airgas shareholders are poised to reach significant benefits as the economy recovers from recession.
Our business, which historically lags the economic cycle, is gathering momentum in the economic recovery and this growth engine runs on far more than just six cylinders.
In addition, Air Products' takeover attempt has cast the bright light on our business, revealing how undervalued the company was and energizing the 14,000 Airgas associates out there, who make up the best team in the business. We have proven year after year our ability to create real shareholder value. And as our results show, we're continuing that trend this year.
Before reviewing our earnings results, I'll briefly address the Air Products' unsolicited offer. In September, the Airgas Board determined that Air Products' unsolicited tender offer of $65.50 is grossly inadequate, and does not sufficiently compensate Airgas stockholders for the company's excellent prospects, inherent value and impressive economic performance.
Today, the newly constituted Board of Directors of Airgas sent a letter to Air Products unanimously reaffirming this position. Further, the letter made clear that if Air Products were to provide sufficient reason for the Airgas Board to believe that negotiations would lead to a transaction at a price that is consistent with the Board's valuation of the company, which is meaningfully in excess of $70 per share, the Board will authorize negotiations with Air Products. The letter was made public earlier today in a press release and is available in the Investor Relations section of the Airgas website.
As you know, we are appealing the Delaware Chancery Court ruling related to the Air Products bylaw amendment proposal that would require an annual meeting of stockholders to be held on January 18, 2011, and all future annual meetings to be held in January. We firmly believe that Air Products' bylaw amendment proposal is invalid under both Delaware Law and Airgas' Certificate of Incorporation. We also believe that the proposal has not been approved because it received the affirmative vote of less than 67% of the shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.
Since Air Products commenced its tender offer, we have delivered excellent results and economic conditions have continued to improve. We have reduced our adjusted debt by more than $200 million since Air Products approached us for the $62 offer. And we are now generating earnings in excess of 20% over last year.
We believe that the improving sales climate bolsters the expectations of greater value. Our strategy through the downturn was to position Airgas to emerge from the recession as an even stronger company, and our results demonstrate our success.
With that, I want to turn to the matter at hand today, our strong financial and operational performance this past quarter. Please turn to Slide 2. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.83 for the second quarter were up 22% from the prior year. We again delivered the second-best earnings quarter in our history, matching our first quarter earnings results in spite of $0.06 of sequential headwinds that we identified in our second quarter guidance.
Total sales on the quarter were $1.06 billion, an increase of 10% over the prior year, driven by a robust sound same-store sales increase of 9%. Gas and rent same-store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 12%. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of only 1%.
Conditions continued to improve in most of our customer segments and geographies this quarter, led by Manufacturing, and with a graded strength in our Great Lakes region. Our core Distribution business continues to reflect the improving industrial conditions in the U.S. Distribution segment same-store sales increased 8% over last year and were up 1% sequentially.
Hardgoods' growth is now significantly outpacing gas and rent, consistent with an economic recovery. We announced some important customer winds this quarter, including a contract to build an on-site air separation unit in Clarksville, Tennessee, to supply Hemlock Semiconductors $1.2 billion alloy silicon manufacturing facility when completed in 2012.
The new ASU will produce nitrogen and other atmospheric gases for Hemlock and the merchant market in the region. Our June 1 price increase has now been fully implemented and is producing results, as pricing accounted for roughly 1/3 of the same-store sales increase in the Distribution segment and for the total company.
Cash flow continues to be one of the strengths of our business model. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $179 million was driven by $290 million of adjusted cash flow from operations, as well as continued CapEx discipline. As a percent of sales, our capital spending this year is down 120 basis points from last year to 5.5%. Our adjusted debt at the end of September was $1.7 billion, a reduction of $127 million this fiscal year.
Our acquisition activity has historically slowed during recessions and then accelerated during the recovery phase of the business cycle, as owners are more interested in selling their businesses during strong performance. While we have acquired a few small businesses this year, we are more encouraged by recent signs of increased activity in our acquisition pipeline.
Our acquisition strategy is unchanged, we have capacity to purchase and integrate quality businesses and we remain diligent in sourcing transactions. We will continue to evaluate international opportunities as they arise, but our primary focus remains on our domestic core businesses and related adjacencies.
Looking forward, in the third quarter, we expect another sequential improvement in daily sales. September was a strong sales month and October is tracking well. We expect the U.S. Manufacturing will continue to expand and will continue to outpace GDP as it has so far this year.
Given our strong performance and expectations for steady growth, we raised our fiscal 2011 earnings guidance to $3.22 to $3.32 per share, which now represents a year-over-year increase of 20% to 24% over fiscal 2010, and 24% to 28% increase in underlying earnings before $0.11 of SAP cost.
As I mentioned earlier, our strategy was to position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery. And our results are a testament to the success of that strategy, as we are running very close to record earnings and margins. In fact, this quarter would've been a record but for the $0.04 incremental SAP cost, which we recorded this quarter. And that's very impressive when they consider that we're still 9% below peak revenues.
We intend to stay focused on our fundamental strategies, enhance our sales organization and performance and continue to train our associates as we position Airgas to drive significant shareholder value creation during the recovery. Mike will now give us a review of market strategy and operations."

As Peter had mentioned, our business, which historically lags the economic cycle, is gathering momentum in the economic recovery. This morning, I'm going to give you a few examples of metrics we watch in our business to illustrate this momentum. We'll review the operating results and I'll finish with a brief update on our SAP implementation.
In the second quarter, our Equipment sales began to accelerate, outpacing growth in total hardgoods sales, both sequentially from the first quarter and year-over-year. Equipment, which consists primarily of welding and cutting machines, represent the capital purchase for our customers and Equipment sales tend to rise as customers recapitalize for future production.
In the Gas business, production, distribution and asset management are the key drivers of profitability and returns. We refer to cylinders in our customers' possession as utilized cylinders. This quarter marked the first quarterly increase in the number of utilized cylinders since June of 2008, an indication that the increased working stocks of cylinders are needed to support growing customer demand.
Accounts receivable metrics and administrative error rates are also indicative of the health of any business. Our DSO and collection rates have improved noticeably this year through the second quarter, as have our invoice error rates. These are all the more impressive in the face of a hostile takeover attempt and are characteristic of a motivated and focused Airgas workforce.
Our sales and marketing strategy, focused on segment alignment, also continues to gain momentum. Success thus far has been most pronounced in our Strategic Accounts program where the strategy originated and was already underway in Medical and Construction segments.
For the second quarter, our Strategic Accounts business was up 9% from the prior year, driven by new account signings across All Customer Segments and by increased activity in our existing Metal Fabrication and materials and conglomerates customer bases. Strategic Accounts presents tremendous cross-sell opportunities both in terms of product lines and locations and now represents 20% of total sales.
Turning to Slide 3. Sales of our Strategic Products, which combine and make up over 40% of our revenue, increased 10% for the quarter, stronger than the overall same-store sales increase of 9%. Our Strategic Products as a group continue to have particularly good long-term growth profile, as many of our growth accelerators impact their performance.
Safety Products grew 13% year-over-year in the quarter, comparing favorably to the overall hardgoods same-store sales increase of 12%. Particularly noteworthy is that this strong growth occurred during the quarter in which we converted the majority of our safety business to SAP. On a sequential basis, sales of safety products were essentially flat after adjusting for the first quarter impact of revenue related to the Gulf oil spill remediation. Safety products sales still represent a strong cross-sell opportunity for us, as our customers realize good value and vendor consolidation.
Bulk Gas sales were up 12% compared to the prior year and up 5% sequentially compared to the first quarter, as Bulk sales to industrial manufacturing and petrochemical companies customers continue to recover, and bulk nitrogen for food freezing applications continued to show strength. 
Medical sales, which were relatively resilient throughout the downturn, were up 4% compared to prior year and 1% sequentially, outflowing in elective and non-critical procedures were more than offset by new customer signings.
Specialty Gas sales increased 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The growing demand for core specialty gases reflects further strengthening of our market position in EPA protocols and other calibration gas mixtures, as well as improving conditions in petrochemical markets.
Solid year-over-year growth in our CO2 and Dry ice business was primarily driven by new customer signings. Sequential growth was driven both by new customer signings in the normal seasonality and as our second quarter includes the hottest months of the year.
Our Radnor private label products were up 12% for the quarter. The long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remain strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or more than those of comparable OEM products.
Our operating efficiency programs, which focus on cylinder maintenance and testing, distribution of fill plant logistics, and freight and fuel management are progressing according to schedule. At our December Analyst Meeting, we set a goal to attain $40 million of new operating efficiency savings over the next four years, driven largely by logistics plant studies and cylinder testing. We are on track to deliver the $10 million of those savings that are included in our fiscal 2011 guidance.
I would like to conclude my remarks by providing an update on the status of our SAP conversion. The commencement of our planned phase rollout, whereby business units implement the new SAP system in succession, marks a major milestone in the structural development of our company.
In August, we provided you with an update regarding the value represented by the ongoing implementation of our highly customized SAP system, including quantification of the economic benefits expected to be achieved in three key areas: accelerated sales growth through expansion of the Telesales platform; price management; and administrative and operating efficiencies.
Upon full implementation, we expect these three areas alone to yield an aggregate of $75 million to $125 million in incremental operating income on an annual run rate basis and we expect to identify additional economic benefit as the implementation progresses. This will further optimize the power of the Airgas platform and we are excited about it's game-changing implications.
As planned, we successfully converted our hardgoods supply chain infrastructure to SAP in early July 2010. The Airgas hardgoods supply chain includes more than 300,000 stock-keeping units, six national distribution centers, four buying centers and a safety products Telesales organization, and serves as the hardgoods fulfillment source for over 875 regional company branches.
As a result, the Airgas hardgoods supply chain touches nearly every area of our company and therefore, its successful conversion to SAP is a significant indicator of the future success and timeline of this project.
Based on the conversion of the hardgoods supply chain, I'm happy to highlight for you some of the positive results we've seen so far. The SAP system is stable and our associates are becoming more proficient every day.
Customer service levels have remained as high as they were in the legacy system as many of our associates have noted that it's much easier to access account information on SAP. Hardgoods fulfillment rates remain at free conversion levels. Accounts receivable metrics have exceeded plan in every month since conversion, and there has been no increase in the number of billing errors or credit memos issued.
Our national distribution center personnel have been improving their productivity and accuracy every day through the use of SAP-enabled handheld radio frequency devices. Our Safety Telesales business had exceeded both forecast and prior year sale and EBITDA in every month since converting to SAP. And the new system has enabled a much faster month-end close process. Lastly, we are on track for our first regional company, Airgas South, to go live on SAP on April 1, 2011.
The regional SAP implementation plan called for full conversion of all Airgas businesses with the exception of Red-D-Arc by the end of calendar 2013. Based on our early success and the magnitude of the benefits, we've developed a modified and accelerated implementation plan. Under the accelerated schedule, we expect full implementation at nearly all our regional distribution companies where the majority of benefits are expected to be realized to occur by the summer of 2012, with implementation reaching all remaining business units by December 31, 2012.
Through September 2010, we've invested more than 75% of our original $85 million SAP project estimate. And the decision to accelerate the implementation was based on the early success of system conversions and the substantial benefits to be realized.
We expect the additional implementation costs of the accelerated schedule to be approximately $20 million, which will be more than offset by the economic benefits that will begin to accrue during the conversion process. These additional costs do not impact any previously issued earnings guidance we have provided.
Based on everything we've experienced to date, we are highly confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits detailed in our August 31 announcement will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in aggregate annual run rate benefits and operating income, with a strong likelihood that these benefits will reach or exceed $125 million in the aggregate.
Now Bob will give you our financial review of the quarter."

Sales increased 10% year-over-year to $1.06 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth of 1% and total same-store sales growth of 9%, comprised of the 7% increase in gas and rent and a 12% increase in hardgoods.
Volume was up 6% and price was up 3%, reflecting a full quarter's impact of the June 1 price increase. Sequentially, sales increased by 1%.
Both hardgoods and gas and rent sales improved sequentially, with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent as is typical in an industrial economic recovery. Consistent with the first quarter, gas and rent represented approximately 64% of our sales mix. The gas and rent mix was slightly higher in the second quarter of last year, at 65%.
Gross margin was 55.1%, a decline of 80 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift toward lower margin hardgoods. Sequentially, gross margin expanded by 20 basis points. Excluding pretax charges of approximately $4.7 million related to Air Products' unsolicited takeover attempt and approximately $1.4 million related to the withdrawal from multi-employer pension plans, adjusted operating income for the quarter was $128 million, up 15% from last year.
This is a strong performance, particularly in light of the significant year-over-year increases in variable compensation expense due to favorable performance relative to plan in the current year versus below-plan performance in the prior year, as well as incremental expenses in the current year related to our SAP implementation.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 12%, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by operating leverage on sales growth, which more than overcame year-over-year expense headwinds from variable compensation and SAP implementation costs.
Sequentially, adjusted operating margin was down slightly from 12.3% in the first quarter, reflecting 30 basis points of incremental impact from the commencement of our SAP system conversions in July. Adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 22% from the prior year to $0.83 in the second quarter, above our guided range and matching the first quarter as the second-best earnings quarter in our history.
There were approximately 85.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, up about 3% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Return on capital, which is a trailing four quarters calculation, was 10.9%, a 40 basis point improvement sequentially on the strength of our improving operating income. We expect our return on capital to continue to expand with operating income as the recovery continues and our business benefits from the significant capital investments we have made in the past few years, including new air separation plants, Bill Plant upgrades and SAP.
With respect to accounts receivable, our collection rates and our DSO for the quarter improved year-over-year and we're relatively consistent with the first quarter.
Inventory turns held consistent with recent trends, reflecting our disciplined management of inventory levels during the significant uptick in hardgoods sales. Year-to-date, we generated strong free cash flow of $179 million, driven by adjusted cash from operations of $290 million. We have reduced our adjusted debt by approximately $127 million fiscal year-to-date, to $1.7 billion at September 30. Over the past 12 months, we have reduced adjusted debt by more than $200 million.
Our fixed flow of ratio at the end of September was 60% fixed, and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.4% within our revised target range of 2% to 3%. During the quarter, we refinanced our revolving credit agreement, which would have matured in July 2011, at an approximate rate of LIBOR plus 212 basis points, and issued $250 million of 3.25% senior notes due in 2015. Both arrangements position us well for the future by extending our debt maturities and reducing our reliance on bank financing.
Now turn to Slide 5 and we'll look at our segment results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 10% versus the prior year to $944 million, with same-store sales up 8%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 6%, and hardgoods were up 12%, with pricing up 3% in both categories driven by a full quarter's contribution from our successful June 1 price increase.
On a sequential basis, Distribution sales increased by 1%. Both gas and hardgoods sales improved sequentially, with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent. Distribution gross margin was 55.5%, a decrease of 90 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods.
Sequentially, distribution gross margin was consistent with the first quarter. As in the first quarter, gas and rent represented close to 60% of Distribution sales in the second quarter.
Adjusted operating income in the Distribution segment increased 13% year-over-year to $106 million. And as noted in my comments on our consolidated results, Distribution operating income growth was also negatively impacted by incremental variable compensation and SAP implementation costs.
Adjusted operating margin in the Distribution segment was 11.3%, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by operating leverage in sales growth, which more than overcame year-over-year expense headwinds from variable compensation and SAP implementation costs. Sequentially, adjusted operating margin was down slightly from 11.5% in the first quarter, reflecting 30 basis points of incremental impact from the commencement of SAP conversions in July.
All Other Operations reflects our CO2, Dry ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia and nitrous oxide business units. Sales for All Operations (sic) [All Other Operations] were up 12% in total and on a same-store basis from the prior year, driven primarily by higher pricing for certain refrigerants, higher pricing in volumes for ammonia used in DeNOx applications in chemical processing and new customer signings on our liquid CO2 business.
Sequentially, sales for All Other Operations declined 2% as seasonal strength in our Ammonia, CO2 and Dry ice businesses was more than offset on a comparative basis by the effect of the significant outperformance in our Refrigerants business in the first quarter.
Gross margin for All Other Operations was down 50 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by higher costs in the Ammonia business relative to pricing. Sequentially, gross margin was up 180 basis points as lower margin Refrigerants represented a smaller portion of the sales mix.
Adjusted operating income for All Other Operations was $21 million. Adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points year-over-year, as operating leverage on sales growth in our Refrigerants and CO2 businesses more than offset the impact of a slight gross margin compression in our Ammonia business.
Sequentially, the 60 basis point decline in operating margin is primarily attributable to the gross margin compression in the Ammonia business and reduced operating leverage on lower sales in the Refrigerants business relative to the first quarter.
Please turn to Slide 6, capital expenditures. We have continued to be disciplined in our capital spending this year, as reflected in the 120 basis point year-over-year reduction in capital expenditures as a percent of sales to 5.5%.
Slide 7 presents our fiscal 2011 third quarter and updated full-year guidance. For the third quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.80, an increase of 17% to 23% over the prior year, impressive growth in the face of significant year-over-year headwinds in the third quarter from our variable compensation reset. Excluding $0.01 of incremental SAP implementation costs, our guidance represents a 19% to 25% improvement over the prior year.
For the full year, we are raising our earnings per share expectations to be in the range of $3.22 to $3.32, from $3.15 to $3.30, up 20% to 24% over adjusted EPS for fiscal 2010, which includes significant year-over-year impact of increased variable compensation and SAP implementation costs.
We expect same-store sales growth to be in the high-single digits in the third quarter and in the mid- to high-single digits for the full fiscal year. Operating margin is expected to be in the 12% to 12.5% range, and we continue to estimate capital expenditures to be approximately 5.5% of sales. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 38% to 39%, and our guidance excludes debt extinguishment charges, multi-employer pension withdraw charges and costs and charges related to the unsolicited takeover attempt.
Slide 8 presents a walk through the primary elements of our third quarter guidance, using second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.83 as a starting point. We have also included in this slide a walk through the primary elements of the resulting fourth quarter guidance implied by our third quarter and updated fiscal year guidance, using our third quarter guidance range as a starting point.
Sequentially, the third quarter includes a headwind of between $0.05 and $0.06, due to two fewer selling days and the impact of holidays in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter.
The third quarter also has a headwind of approximately $0.05 to $0.06 due to the seasonality of our CO2, Dry ice and Refrigerants businesses which typically slow during the cooler months of the year, partially offset by higher sales in our Red-D-Arc Rental Welder business due to the fall turnaround season.
We expect $0.02 of sequential benefit from lower SAP implementation costs in the third quarter, as we successfully completed the conversion of our first business units during the second quarter.
We expect the core business to expand sequentially, contributing $0.03 to $0.05 on continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy, and on solid execution of our operating efficiency programs. In the fourth quarter, the addition of two selling days and the loss of the negative third quarter impact of holidays should provide a $0.05 to $0.06 benefit to EPS.
The seasonal nature of our CO2, Dry ice and Red-D-Arc businesses will continue to be a headwind, and the preparation for implementation of SAP at our first regional company on April 1 is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.03 relative to the third quarter.
We expect our core business to expand sequentially over and above the incremental selling days, contributing $0.03 to $0.04 on a continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy and continued solid execution on our operating efficiency programs.
The underlying business improvement is consistent with the plan we developed in conjunction with our midterm financial goals we announced at the December Analyst Meeting. And in fact, our current trajectory is higher. I'll now turn it back to Peter."

Before we turn to Q&A, I'd like to highlight some of the reasons that underscore our confidence in Airgas' prospects for continued growth and shareholder value of creation, and some of our views on valuation.
Slide 9 illustrates the EPS growth Airgas generated in the economic recovery from calendar 2002 through calendar 2005, and contrast that with the growth represented by our current midterm goals.
In the three-year period following the last recession, we delivered compounded annual EPS growth of 18%. Our earnings growth tends to accelerate as an expansion continues, particularly after overcoming the initial headwinds of variable costs at the outset of recovery.
Our high EBITDA margins so early in this recovery bode very well for our earnings growth. Last year at our December Analyst Meeting, we announced a new set of financial goals consistent with our practice over the past decade.
The bottom chart shows the earnings growth trajectory from calendar 2009 to our calendar 2012 target of $4.20 plus per share. The 16% CAGR is more conservative than our performance in the last recovery in spite of the fact that we are a much stronger operating company today. You can clearly see that our revised fiscal 2011 guidance range is above the earnings trajectory on which these current midterm goals are built, even though the recent low and acquisition activity has us behind the acquisition assumptions in our plan.
In other words, if we continue with our current pace, I expect us to beat our target of $4.20-plus per share for calendar 2012, and an improving acquisition environment would then provide further upside to that target.
On September 2, we published a slide deck titled, ""It's All About Value"", wherein we highlighted many reasons that we believe Air Products' offer is inadequate and opportunistic. An important takeaway is that in the five-year time frame leading up to February 4, 2010, the day before Air Products announced its offer, Airgas had a median next 12 months price earnings multiple of 16.7x. That five-year period includes significant impact from the recession and almost all of our peers today are trading at or above their respective five-year average multiples.
Digging deeper into that same timeframe, when GDP growth was between 0% and 3%, our average NTM EPS multiple was 17.7x. Calendar 2010 is rapidly drawing to a close, and investors are sharpening their focus on calendar 2011 earnings. Since February, there's been a significant increase on our actual and expected earnings growth, substantial improvement in the markets and meaningful reduction of our debt. 
We point out these factors to underscore our Board's view that Air Products' $65.50 offer is grossly inadequate. The benefits of our customer-centric culture and new sales alignment are just starting to develop. Our industry is still very fragmented and acquisitions are our core competency in Airgas. We've never been stronger than we are today. We appreciate the tremendous amount of support we have received from our shareholders, and look forward to continuing to deliver outstanding value to you in the future.
Thank you, and now I'd like to turn it back to Jay to begin our question-and-answer session."

As I said, having such high EBITDA margins so early in the recovery bodes very, very well for our fall-through. And we're beating the plan that assumed $150 million a year in acquired revenue, basically without that acquired revenue. So I do think acquisitions are going to come back and they could be a fairly significant upside. There's no one that has more -- we have the biggest platform in the country, so no one has more synergies that we do and we've gotten pretty good at integrating companies. Regarding the activity, it has picked up in terms of the number of companies we're looking at. Most of them are domestic but there are some international opportunities as well. And we're looking forward to putting some acquisitions, getting some acquisitions under our belt over the next nine months."

But that tends to lead in an economic recovery any way. California continues to have its problems, so it's been a little slower to recovery but we're seeing solid signs of recovery out there now. I don't anticipate any areas turning down, geographies turning down. I do see an increase in our non-residential Construction business. Part of that will be seasonal, there are a lot of turnarounds that take place in the December quarter at refineries and paper mills and power plants. And a lot of our construction sales are into that sector, into the turnaround business. And there are a few projects starting up as well.

But one of the things that's happening, and keep in mind that was for DeNOx for trucks and cars and things like that, mobile. What's happening is a significant acceleration in DeNOx in general in stationary sources, smokestacks, cement kilns, power plants. And there's also a move, a higher growth than we we're expecting in Ammonia that is sold in aqua form, which is a water solution of Ammonia, which is less -- has lower risk in handling for customers. And as customers attempt to manage risk there's a high interest in this product. And what's interesting about it is that since it's mostly water, you can haul it very far. And our network of Ammonia locations, which is the most expensive in the country, I think, per tank trucks, is uniquely positioned. So we're getting higher growth than we expected from DeNOx, from the development and evolution of aqua Ammonia as a source. That's the Ammonia story. In the Retail story, that continues to go quite well and it's expanding. When we started it and told you about it in December, we were talking primarily about helium for balloons and things like that. It's now expanding into chains of grocery stores and chains of auto parts, auto body centers, repair centers, auto dealerships and things like that. And it's going well."

Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Our second quarter results served to reinforce the message we have expressed for some time now, that Airgas shareholders are poised to reach significant benefits as the economy recovers from recession.
Our business, which historically lags the economic cycle, is gathering momentum in the economic recovery and this growth engine runs on far more than just six cylinders.
In addition, Air Products' takeover attempt has cast the bright light on our business, revealing how undervalued the company was and energizing the 14,000 Airgas associates out there, who make up the best team in the business. We have proven year after year our ability to create real shareholder value. And as our results show, we're continuing that trend this year.
Before reviewing our earnings results, I'll briefly address the Air Products' unsolicited offer. In September, the Airgas Board determined that Air Products' unsolicited tender offer of $65.50 is grossly inadequate, and does not sufficiently compensate Airgas stockholders for the company's excellent prospects, inherent value and impressive economic performance.
Today, the newly constituted Board of Directors of Airgas sent a letter to Air Products unanimously reaffirming this position. Further, the letter made clear that if Air Products were to provide sufficient reason for the Airgas Board to believe that negotiations would lead to a transaction at a price that is consistent with the Board's valuation of the company, which is meaningfully in excess of $70 per share, the Board will authorize negotiations with Air Products. The letter was made public earlier today in a press release and is available in the Investor Relations section of the Airgas website.
As you know, we are appealing the Delaware Chancery Court ruling related to the Air Products bylaw amendment proposal that would require an annual meeting of stockholders to be held on January 18, 2011, and all future annual meetings to be held in January. We firmly believe that Air Products' bylaw amendment proposal is invalid under both Delaware Law and Airgas' Certificate of Incorporation. We also believe that the proposal has not been approved because it received the affirmative vote of less than 67% of the shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.
Since Air Products commenced its tender offer, we have delivered excellent results and economic conditions have continued to improve. We have reduced our adjusted debt by more than $200 million since Air Products approached us for the $62 offer. And we are now generating earnings in excess of 20% over last year.
We believe that the improving sales climate bolsters the expectations of greater value. Our strategy through the downturn was to position Airgas to emerge from the recession as an even stronger company, and our results demonstrate our success.
With that, I want to turn to the matter at hand today, our strong financial and operational performance this past quarter. Please turn to Slide 2. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.83 for the second quarter were up 22% from the prior year. We again delivered the second-best earnings quarter in our history, matching our first quarter earnings results in spite of $0.06 of sequential headwinds that we identified in our second quarter guidance.
Total sales on the quarter were $1.06 billion, an increase of 10% over the prior year, driven by a robust sound same-store sales increase of 9%. Gas and rent same-store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 12%. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of only 1%.
Conditions continued to improve in most of our customer segments and geographies this quarter, led by Manufacturing, and with a graded strength in our Great Lakes region. Our core Distribution business continues to reflect the improving industrial conditions in the U.S. Distribution segment same-store sales increased 8% over last year and were up 1% sequentially.
Hardgoods' growth is now significantly outpacing gas and rent, consistent with an economic recovery. We announced some important customer winds this quarter, including a contract to build an on-site air separation unit in Clarksville, Tennessee, to supply Hemlock Semiconductors $1.2 billion alloy silicon manufacturing facility when completed in 2012.
The new ASU will produce nitrogen and other atmospheric gases for Hemlock and the merchant market in the region. Our June 1 price increase has now been fully implemented and is producing results, as pricing accounted for roughly 1/3 of the same-store sales increase in the Distribution segment and for the total company.
Cash flow continues to be one of the strengths of our business model. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $179 million was driven by $290 million of adjusted cash flow from operations, as well as continued CapEx discipline. As a percent of sales, our capital spending this year is down 120 basis points from last year to 5.5%. Our adjusted debt at the end of September was $1.7 billion, a reduction of $127 million this fiscal year.
Our acquisition activity has historically slowed during recessions and then accelerated during the recovery phase of the business cycle, as owners are more interested in selling their businesses during strong performance. While we have acquired a few small businesses this year, we are more encouraged by recent signs of increased activity in our acquisition pipeline.
Our acquisition strategy is unchanged, we have capacity to purchase and integrate quality businesses and we remain diligent in sourcing transactions. We will continue to evaluate international opportunities as they arise, but our primary focus remains on our domestic core businesses and related adjacencies.
Looking forward, in the third quarter, we expect another sequential improvement in daily sales. September was a strong sales month and October is tracking well. We expect the U.S. Manufacturing will continue to expand and will continue to outpace GDP as it has so far this year.
Given our strong performance and expectations for steady growth, we raised our fiscal 2011 earnings guidance to $3.22 to $3.32 per share, which now represents a year-over-year increase of 20% to 24% over fiscal 2010, and 24% to 28% increase in underlying earnings before $0.11 of SAP cost.
As I mentioned earlier, our strategy was to position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery. And our results are a testament to the success of that strategy, as we are running very close to record earnings and margins. In fact, this quarter would've been a record but for the $0.04 incremental SAP cost, which we recorded this quarter. And that's very impressive when they consider that we're still 9% below peak revenues.
We intend to stay focused on our fundamental strategies, enhance our sales organization and performance and continue to train our associates as we position Airgas to drive significant shareholder value creation during the recovery. Mike will now give us a review of market strategy and operations.

As Peter had mentioned, our business, which historically lags the economic cycle, is gathering momentum in the economic recovery. This morning, I'm going to give you a few examples of metrics we watch in our business to illustrate this momentum. We'll review the operating results and I'll finish with a brief update on our SAP implementation.
In the second quarter, our Equipment sales began to accelerate, outpacing growth in total hardgoods sales, both sequentially from the first quarter and year-over-year. Equipment, which consists primarily of welding and cutting machines, represent the capital purchase for our customers and Equipment sales tend to rise as customers recapitalize for future production.
In the Gas business, production, distribution and asset management are the key drivers of profitability and returns. We refer to cylinders in our customers' possession as utilized cylinders. This quarter marked the first quarterly increase in the number of utilized cylinders since June of 2008, an indication that the increased working stocks of cylinders are needed to support growing customer demand.
Accounts receivable metrics and administrative error rates are also indicative of the health of any business. Our DSO and collection rates have improved noticeably this year through the second quarter, as have our invoice error rates. These are all the more impressive in the face of a hostile takeover attempt and are characteristic of a motivated and focused Airgas workforce.
Our sales and marketing strategy, focused on segment alignment, also continues to gain momentum. Success thus far has been most pronounced in our Strategic Accounts program where the strategy originated and was already underway in Medical and Construction segments.
For the second quarter, our Strategic Accounts business was up 9% from the prior year, driven by new account signings across All Customer Segments and by increased activity in our existing Metal Fabrication and materials and conglomerates customer bases. Strategic Accounts presents tremendous cross-sell opportunities both in terms of product lines and locations and now represents 20% of total sales.
Turning to Slide 3. Sales of our Strategic Products, which combine and make up over 40% of our revenue, increased 10% for the quarter, stronger than the overall same-store sales increase of 9%. Our Strategic Products as a group continue to have particularly good long-term growth profile, as many of our growth accelerators impact their performance.
Safety Products grew 13% year-over-year in the quarter, comparing favorably to the overall hardgoods same-store sales increase of 12%. Particularly noteworthy is that this strong growth occurred during the quarter in which we converted the majority of our safety business to SAP. On a sequential basis, sales of safety products were essentially flat after adjusting for the first quarter impact of revenue related to the Gulf oil spill remediation. Safety products sales still represent a strong cross-sell opportunity for us, as our customers realize good value and vendor consolidation.
Bulk Gas sales were up 12% compared to the prior year and up 5% sequentially compared to the first quarter, as Bulk sales to industrial manufacturing and petrochemical companies customers continue to recover, and bulk nitrogen for food freezing applications continued to show strength. 
Medical sales, which were relatively resilient throughout the downturn, were up 4% compared to prior year and 1% sequentially, outflowing in elective and non-critical procedures were more than offset by new customer signings.
Specialty Gas sales increased 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The growing demand for core specialty gases reflects further strengthening of our market position in EPA protocols and other calibration gas mixtures, as well as improving conditions in petrochemical markets.
Solid year-over-year growth in our CO2 and Dry ice business was primarily driven by new customer signings. Sequential growth was driven both by new customer signings in the normal seasonality and as our second quarter includes the hottest months of the year.
Our Radnor private label products were up 12% for the quarter. The long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remain strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or more than those of comparable OEM products.
Our operating efficiency programs, which focus on cylinder maintenance and testing, distribution of fill plant logistics, and freight and fuel management are progressing according to schedule. At our December Analyst Meeting, we set a goal to attain $40 million of new operating efficiency savings over the next four years, driven largely by logistics plant studies and cylinder testing. We are on track to deliver the $10 million of those savings that are included in our fiscal 2011 guidance.
I would like to conclude my remarks by providing an update on the status of our SAP conversion. The commencement of our planned phase rollout, whereby business units implement the new SAP system in succession, marks a major milestone in the structural development of our company.
In August, we provided you with an update regarding the value represented by the ongoing implementation of our highly customized SAP system, including quantification of the economic benefits expected to be achieved in three key areas: accelerated sales growth through expansion of the Telesales platform; price management; and administrative and operating efficiencies.
Upon full implementation, we expect these three areas alone to yield an aggregate of $75 million to $125 million in incremental operating income on an annual run rate basis and we expect to identify additional economic benefit as the implementation progresses. This will further optimize the power of the Airgas platform and we are excited about it's game-changing implications.
As planned, we successfully converted our hardgoods supply chain infrastructure to SAP in early July 2010. The Airgas hardgoods supply chain includes more than 300,000 stock-keeping units, six national distribution centers, four buying centers and a safety products Telesales organization, and serves as the hardgoods fulfillment source for over 875 regional company branches.
As a result, the Airgas hardgoods supply chain touches nearly every area of our company and therefore, its successful conversion to SAP is a significant indicator of the future success and timeline of this project.
Based on the conversion of the hardgoods supply chain, I'm happy to highlight for you some of the positive results we've seen so far. The SAP system is stable and our associates are becoming more proficient every day.
Customer service levels have remained as high as they were in the legacy system as many of our associates have noted that it's much easier to access account information on SAP. Hardgoods fulfillment rates remain at free conversion levels. Accounts receivable metrics have exceeded plan in every month since conversion, and there has been no increase in the number of billing errors or credit memos issued.
Our national distribution center personnel have been improving their productivity and accuracy every day through the use of SAP-enabled handheld radio frequency devices. Our Safety Telesales business had exceeded both forecast and prior year sale and EBITDA in every month since converting to SAP. And the new system has enabled a much faster month-end close process. Lastly, we are on track for our first regional company, Airgas South, to go live on SAP on April 1, 2011.
The regional SAP implementation plan called for full conversion of all Airgas businesses with the exception of Red-D-Arc by the end of calendar 2013. Based on our early success and the magnitude of the benefits, we've developed a modified and accelerated implementation plan. Under the accelerated schedule, we expect full implementation at nearly all our regional distribution companies where the majority of benefits are expected to be realized to occur by the summer of 2012, with implementation reaching all remaining business units by December 31, 2012.
Through September 2010, we've invested more than 75% of our original $85 million SAP project estimate. And the decision to accelerate the implementation was based on the early success of system conversions and the substantial benefits to be realized.
We expect the additional implementation costs of the accelerated schedule to be approximately $20 million, which will be more than offset by the economic benefits that will begin to accrue during the conversion process. These additional costs do not impact any previously issued earnings guidance we have provided.
Based on everything we've experienced to date, we are highly confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits detailed in our August 31 announcement will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in aggregate annual run rate benefits and operating income, with a strong likelihood that these benefits will reach or exceed $125 million in the aggregate.
Now Bob will give you our financial review of the quarter.

Sales increased 10% year-over-year to $1.06 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth of 1% and total same-store sales growth of 9%, comprised of the 7% increase in gas and rent and a 12% increase in hardgoods.
Volume was up 6% and price was up 3%, reflecting a full quarter's impact of the June 1 price increase. Sequentially, sales increased by 1%.
Both hardgoods and gas and rent sales improved sequentially, with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent as is typical in an industrial economic recovery. Consistent with the first quarter, gas and rent represented approximately 64% of our sales mix. The gas and rent mix was slightly higher in the second quarter of last year, at 65%.
Gross margin was 55.1%, a decline of 80 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift toward lower margin hardgoods. Sequentially, gross margin expanded by 20 basis points. Excluding pretax charges of approximately $4.7 million related to Air Products' unsolicited takeover attempt and approximately $1.4 million related to the withdrawal from multi-employer pension plans, adjusted operating income for the quarter was $128 million, up 15% from last year.
This is a strong performance, particularly in light of the significant year-over-year increases in variable compensation expense due to favorable performance relative to plan in the current year versus below-plan performance in the prior year, as well as incremental expenses in the current year related to our SAP implementation.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 12%, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by operating leverage on sales growth, which more than overcame year-over-year expense headwinds from variable compensation and SAP implementation costs.
Sequentially, adjusted operating margin was down slightly from 12.3% in the first quarter, reflecting 30 basis points of incremental impact from the commencement of our SAP system conversions in July. Adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 22% from the prior year to $0.83 in the second quarter, above our guided range and matching the first quarter as the second-best earnings quarter in our history.
There were approximately 85.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, up about 3% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Return on capital, which is a trailing four quarters calculation, was 10.9%, a 40 basis point improvement sequentially on the strength of our improving operating income. We expect our return on capital to continue to expand with operating income as the recovery continues and our business benefits from the significant capital investments we have made in the past few years, including new air separation plants, Bill Plant upgrades and SAP.
With respect to accounts receivable, our collection rates and our DSO for the quarter improved year-over-year and we're relatively consistent with the first quarter.
Inventory turns held consistent with recent trends, reflecting our disciplined management of inventory levels during the significant uptick in hardgoods sales. Year-to-date, we generated strong free cash flow of $179 million, driven by adjusted cash from operations of $290 million. We have reduced our adjusted debt by approximately $127 million fiscal year-to-date, to $1.7 billion at September 30. Over the past 12 months, we have reduced adjusted debt by more than $200 million.
Our fixed flow of ratio at the end of September was 60% fixed, and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.4% within our revised target range of 2% to 3%. During the quarter, we refinanced our revolving credit agreement, which would have matured in July 2011, at an approximate rate of LIBOR plus 212 basis points, and issued $250 million of 3.25% senior notes due in 2015. Both arrangements position us well for the future by extending our debt maturities and reducing our reliance on bank financing.
Now turn to Slide 5 and we'll look at our segment results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 10% versus the prior year to $944 million, with same-store sales up 8%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 6%, and hardgoods were up 12%, with pricing up 3% in both categories driven by a full quarter's contribution from our successful June 1 price increase.
On a sequential basis, Distribution sales increased by 1%. Both gas and hardgoods sales improved sequentially, with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent. Distribution gross margin was 55.5%, a decrease of 90 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods.
Sequentially, distribution gross margin was consistent with the first quarter. As in the first quarter, gas and rent represented close to 60% of Distribution sales in the second quarter.
Adjusted operating income in the Distribution segment increased 13% year-over-year to $106 million. And as noted in my comments on our consolidated results, Distribution operating income growth was also negatively impacted by incremental variable compensation and SAP implementation costs.
Adjusted operating margin in the Distribution segment was 11.3%, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by operating leverage in sales growth, which more than overcame year-over-year expense headwinds from variable compensation and SAP implementation costs. Sequentially, adjusted operating margin was down slightly from 11.5% in the first quarter, reflecting 30 basis points of incremental impact from the commencement of SAP conversions in July.
All Other Operations reflects our CO2, Dry ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia and nitrous oxide business units. Sales for All Operations (sic) [All Other Operations] were up 12% in total and on a same-store basis from the prior year, driven primarily by higher pricing for certain refrigerants, higher pricing in volumes for ammonia used in DeNOx applications in chemical processing and new customer signings on our liquid CO2 business.
Sequentially, sales for All Other Operations declined 2% as seasonal strength in our Ammonia, CO2 and Dry ice businesses was more than offset on a comparative basis by the effect of the significant outperformance in our Refrigerants business in the first quarter.
Gross margin for All Other Operations was down 50 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by higher costs in the Ammonia business relative to pricing. Sequentially, gross margin was up 180 basis points as lower margin Refrigerants represented a smaller portion of the sales mix.
Adjusted operating income for All Other Operations was $21 million. Adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points year-over-year, as operating leverage on sales growth in our Refrigerants and CO2 businesses more than offset the impact of a slight gross margin compression in our Ammonia business.
Sequentially, the 60 basis point decline in operating margin is primarily attributable to the gross margin compression in the Ammonia business and reduced operating leverage on lower sales in the Refrigerants business relative to the first quarter.
Please turn to Slide 6, capital expenditures. We have continued to be disciplined in our capital spending this year, as reflected in the 120 basis point year-over-year reduction in capital expenditures as a percent of sales to 5.5%.
Slide 7 presents our fiscal 2011 third quarter and updated full-year guidance. For the third quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.80, an increase of 17% to 23% over the prior year, impressive growth in the face of significant year-over-year headwinds in the third quarter from our variable compensation reset. Excluding $0.01 of incremental SAP implementation costs, our guidance represents a 19% to 25% improvement over the prior year.
For the full year, we are raising our earnings per share expectations to be in the range of $3.22 to $3.32, from $3.15 to $3.30, up 20% to 24% over adjusted EPS for fiscal 2010, which includes significant year-over-year impact of increased variable compensation and SAP implementation costs.
We expect same-store sales growth to be in the high-single digits in the third quarter and in the mid- to high-single digits for the full fiscal year. Operating margin is expected to be in the 12% to 12.5% range, and we continue to estimate capital expenditures to be approximately 5.5% of sales. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 38% to 39%, and our guidance excludes debt extinguishment charges, multi-employer pension withdraw charges and costs and charges related to the unsolicited takeover attempt.
Slide 8 presents a walk through the primary elements of our third quarter guidance, using second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.83 as a starting point. We have also included in this slide a walk through the primary elements of the resulting fourth quarter guidance implied by our third quarter and updated fiscal year guidance, using our third quarter guidance range as a starting point.
Sequentially, the third quarter includes a headwind of between $0.05 and $0.06, due to two fewer selling days and the impact of holidays in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter.
The third quarter also has a headwind of approximately $0.05 to $0.06 due to the seasonality of our CO2, Dry ice and Refrigerants businesses which typically slow during the cooler months of the year, partially offset by higher sales in our Red-D-Arc Rental Welder business due to the fall turnaround season.
We expect $0.02 of sequential benefit from lower SAP implementation costs in the third quarter, as we successfully completed the conversion of our first business units during the second quarter.
We expect the core business to expand sequentially, contributing $0.03 to $0.05 on continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy, and on solid execution of our operating efficiency programs. In the fourth quarter, the addition of two selling days and the loss of the negative third quarter impact of holidays should provide a $0.05 to $0.06 benefit to EPS.
The seasonal nature of our CO2, Dry ice and Red-D-Arc businesses will continue to be a headwind, and the preparation for implementation of SAP at our first regional company on April 1 is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.03 relative to the third quarter.
We expect our core business to expand sequentially over and above the incremental selling days, contributing $0.03 to $0.04 on a continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy and continued solid execution on our operating efficiency programs.
The underlying business improvement is consistent with the plan we developed in conjunction with our midterm financial goals we announced at the December Analyst Meeting. And in fact, our current trajectory is higher. I'll now turn it back to Peter.

Before we turn to Q&A, I'd like to highlight some of the reasons that underscore our confidence in Airgas' prospects for continued growth and shareholder value of creation, and some of our views on valuation.
Slide 9 illustrates the EPS growth Airgas generated in the economic recovery from calendar 2002 through calendar 2005, and contrast that with the growth represented by our current midterm goals.
In the three-year period following the last recession, we delivered compounded annual EPS growth of 18%. Our earnings growth tends to accelerate as an expansion continues, particularly after overcoming the initial headwinds of variable costs at the outset of recovery.
Our high EBITDA margins so early in this recovery bode very well for our earnings growth. Last year at our December Analyst Meeting, we announced a new set of financial goals consistent with our practice over the past decade.
The bottom chart shows the earnings growth trajectory from calendar 2009 to our calendar 2012 target of $4.20 plus per share. The 16% CAGR is more conservative than our performance in the last recovery in spite of the fact that we are a much stronger operating company today. You can clearly see that our revised fiscal 2011 guidance range is above the earnings trajectory on which these current midterm goals are built, even though the recent low and acquisition activity has us behind the acquisition assumptions in our plan.
In other words, if we continue with our current pace, I expect us to beat our target of $4.20-plus per share for calendar 2012, and an improving acquisition environment would then provide further upside to that target.
On September 2, we published a slide deck titled, ""It's All About Value"", wherein we highlighted many reasons that we believe Air Products' offer is inadequate and opportunistic. An important takeaway is that in the five-year time frame leading up to February 4, 2010, the day before Air Products announced its offer, Airgas had a median next 12 months price earnings multiple of 16.7x. That five-year period includes significant impact from the recession and almost all of our peers today are trading at or above their respective five-year average multiples.
Digging deeper into that same timeframe, when GDP growth was between 0% and 3%, our average NTM EPS multiple was 17.7x. Calendar 2010 is rapidly drawing to a close, and investors are sharpening their focus on calendar 2011 earnings. Since February, there's been a significant increase on our actual and expected earnings growth, substantial improvement in the markets and meaningful reduction of our debt. 
We point out these factors to underscore our Board's view that Air Products' $65.50 offer is grossly inadequate. The benefits of our customer-centric culture and new sales alignment are just starting to develop. Our industry is still very fragmented and acquisitions are our core competency in Airgas. We've never been stronger than we are today. We appreciate the tremendous amount of support we have received from our shareholders, and look forward to continuing to deliver outstanding value to you in the future.
Thank you, and now I'd like to turn it back to Jay to begin our question-and-answer session.

So I do think acquisitions are going to come back and they could be a fairly significant upside. There's no one that has more -- we have the biggest platform in the country, so no one has more synergies that we do and we've gotten pretty good at integrating companies. Regarding the activity, it has picked up in terms of the number of companies we're looking at. Most of them are domestic but there are some international opportunities as well.

And because the competitors are healthier and they need to cover their increased costs as well. So you get the double impact at causing that lag.

I don't anticipate any areas turning down, geographies turning down. I do see an increase in our non-residential Construction business. Part of that will be seasonal, there are a lot of turnarounds that take place in the December quarter at refineries and paper mills and power plants.

But one of the things that's happening, and keep in mind that was for DeNOx for trucks and cars and things like that, mobile. What's happening is a significant acceleration in DeNOx in general in stationary sources, smokestacks, cement kilns, power plants. And there's also a move, a higher growth than we we're expecting in Ammonia that is sold in aqua form, which is a water solution of Ammonia, which is less -- has lower risk in handling for customers. And as customers attempt to manage risk there's a high interest in this product. And what's interesting about it is that since it's mostly water, you can haul it very far. And our network of Ammonia locations, which is the most expensive in the country, I think, per tank trucks, is uniquely positioned. So we're getting higher growth than we expected from DeNOx, from the development and evolution of aqua Ammonia as a source. That's the Ammonia story. In the Retail story, that continues to go quite well and it's expanding. When we started it and told you about it in December, we were talking primarily about helium for balloons and things like that. It's now expanding into chains of grocery stores and chains of auto parts, auto body centers, repair centers, auto dealerships and things like that. And it's going well.

But there's a very high probability it's small, but it's a double digit kind of growth rate. And I think as more and more of these large customers look at their current supply, they are looking at wanting to have more than one choice. And from my perspective, from being a number two guy that has the ability to serve large swaths of the country for those customers that aren't happy with the supply they have or looking to split their business, we're positioned very, very well for that.

Our second quarter results served to reinforce the message we have expressed for some time now, that Airgas shareholders are poised to reach significant benefits as the economy recovers from rec",1132,"Thanks, Jay. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Our second quarter results served to reinforce the message we have expressed for some time now, that Airgas shareholders are poised to reach significant benefits as the economy recovers from recession.
Our business, which historically lags the economic cycle, is gathering momentum in the economic recovery and this growth engine runs on far more than just six cylinders.
In addition, Air Products' takeover attempt has cast a bright light on our business, revealing how undervalued the company was and energizing the 14,000 Airgas associates out there, who make up the best team in the business. We have proven year after year our ability to create real shareholder value. And as our results show, we're continuing that trend this year.
Before reviewing our earnings results, I'll briefly address the Air Products' unsolicited offer. In September, the Airgas Board determined that Air Products' unsolicited tender offer of $65.50 is grossly inadequate, and does not sufficiently compensate Airgas stockholders for the company's excellent prospects, inherent value and impressive economic performance.
Today, the newly constituted Board of Directors of Airgas sent a letter to Air Products unanimously reaffirming this position. Further, the letter made clear that if Air Products were to provide sufficient reason for the Airgas Board to believe that negotiations would lead to a transaction at a price that is consistent with the Board's valuation of the company, which is meaningfully in excess of $70 per share, the Board would authorize negotiations with Air Products. The letter was made public earlier today in a press release and is available in the Investor Relations section of the Airgas website.
As you know, we are appealing the Delaware Chancery Court ruling related to the Air Products' bylaw amendment proposal that would require an annual meeting of stockholders to be held on January 18, 2011, and all future annual meetings to be held in January. We firmly believe that Air Products' bylaw amendment proposal is invalid under both Delaware Law and Airgas' Certificate of Incorporation. We also believe that the proposal has not been approved because it received the affirmative vote of less than 67% of the shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.
Since Air Products commenced its tender offer, we have delivered excellent results and economic conditions have continued to improve. We have reduced our adjusted debt by more than $200 million since Air Products approached us with a $62 offer. And we are now generating earnings in excess of 20% over last year.
We believe that the improving sales climate bolsters the expectations of greater value. Our strategy through the downturn was to position Airgas to emerge from the recession as an even stronger company, and our results demonstrate our success.
With that, I want to turn to the matter at hand today, our strong financial and operational performance this past quarter. Please turn to Slide 2. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.83 for the second quarter were up 22% from the prior year. We again delivered the second-best earnings quarter in our history, matching our first quarter earnings results in spite of $0.06 of sequential headwinds that we identified in our second quarter guidance.
Total sales on the quarter were $1.06 billion, an increase of 10% over the prior year, driven by a robust same-store sales increase of 9%. Gas and rent same-store sales increased 7% and hardgoods increased 12%. Acquisitions contributed sales growth of only 1%.
Conditions continued to improve in most of our customer segments and geographies this quarter, led by Manufacturing, and with a graded strength in our Great Lakes region. Our core Distribution business continues to reflect the improving industrial conditions in the U.S. Distribution segment same-store sales increased 8% over last year and were up 1% sequentially.
Hardgoods' growth is now significantly outpacing gas and rent, consistent with an economic recovery. We announced some important customer wins this quarter, including a contract to build an on-site air separation unit in Clarksville, Tennessee, to supply Hemlock Semiconductors $1.2 billion alloy silicon manufacturing facility when completed in 2012.
The new ASU will produce nitrogen and other atmospheric gases for Hemlock and the merchant market in the region. Our June 1 price increase has now been fully implemented and is producing results, as pricing accounted for roughly 1/3 of the same-store sales increase in the Distribution segment and for the total company.
Cash flow continues to be one of the strengths of our business model. Year-to-date, free cash flow of $179 million was driven by $290 million of adjusted cash flow from operations, as well as continued CapEx discipline. As a percent of sales, our capital spending this year is down 120 basis points from last year to 5.5%. Our adjusted debt at the end of September was $1.7 billion, a reduction of $127 million this fiscal year.
Our acquisition activity has historically slowed during recessions and then accelerated during the recovery phase of the business cycle, as owners are more interested in selling their businesses during strong performance. While we have acquired a few small businesses this year, we are more encouraged by recent signs of increased activity in our acquisition pipeline.
Our acquisition strategy is unchanged, we have capacity to purchase and integrate quality businesses and we remain diligent in sourcing transactions. We will continue to evaluate international opportunities as they arise, but our primary focus remains on our domestic core businesses and related adjacencies.
Looking forward, in the third quarter, we expect another sequential improvement in daily sales. September was a strong sales month and October is tracking well. We expect the U.S. Manufacturing will continue to expand and will continue to outpace GDP as it has so far this year.
Given our strong performance and expectations for steady growth, we raised our fiscal 2011 earnings guidance to $3.22 to $3.32 per share, which now represents a year-over-year increase of 20% to 24% over fiscal 2010, and 24% to 28% increase in underlying earnings before $0.11 of SAP cost.
As I mentioned earlier, our strategy was to position Airgas to emerge as an even stronger company in the economic recovery. And our results are a testament to the success of that strategy, as we are running very close to record earnings and margins. In fact, this quarter would've been a record but for the $0.04 incremental SAP cost, which we recorded this quarter. And that's very impressive when you consider that we're still 9% below peak revenues.
We intend to stay focused on our fundamental strategies, enhance our sales organization and performance and continue to train our associates as we position Airgas to drive significant shareholder value creation during the recovery. Mike will now give us a review of market strategy and operations."

As Peter had mentioned, our business, which historically lags the economic cycle, is gathering momentum in the economic recovery. This morning, I'm going to give you a few examples of metrics we watch in our business to illustrate this momentum. We'll review the operating results and I'll finish with a brief update on our SAP implementation.
In the second quarter, our Equipment sales began to accelerate, outpacing growth in total hardgoods sales, both sequentially from the first quarter and year-over-year. Equipment, which consists primarily of welding and cutting machines, represent the capital purchase for our customers and Equipment sales tend to rise as customers recapitalize for future production.
In the Gas business, production, distribution and asset management are the key drivers of profitability and returns. We refer to cylinders in our customers' possession as utilized cylinders. This quarter marked the first quarterly increase in the number of utilized cylinders since June of 2008, an indication that increased working stocks of cylinders are needed to support growing customer demand.
Accounts receivable metrics and administrative error rates are also indicative of the health of any business. Our DSO and collection rates have improved noticeably this year through the second quarter, as have our invoice error rates. These are all the more impressive in the face of a hostile takeover attempt and are characteristic of a motivated and focused Airgas workforce.
Our sales and marketing strategy, focused on segment alignment, also continues to gain momentum. Success thus far has been most pronounced in our Strategic Accounts program where the strategy originated and was already underway in Medical and Construction segments.
For the second quarter, our Strategic Accounts business was up 9% from the prior year, driven by new account signings across All Customer Segments and by increased activity in our existing Metal Fabrication and materials and conglomerates customer bases. Strategic Accounts presents tremendous cross-sell opportunities both in terms of product lines and locations and now represents 20% of total sales.
Turning to Slide 3. Sales of our Strategic Products, which combined make up over 40% of our revenue, increased 10% for the quarter, stronger than the overall same-store sales increase of 9%. Our Strategic Products as a group continue to have particularly good long-term growth profile, as many of our growth accelerators impact their performance.
Safety Products grew 13% year-over-year in the quarter, comparing favorably to the overall hardgoods same-store sales increase of 12%. Particularly noteworthy is that this strong growth occurred during the quarter in which we converted the majority of our safety business to SAP. On a sequential basis, sales of safety products were essentially flat after adjusting for the first quarter impact of revenue related to the Gulf oil spill remediation. Safety Products sales still represent a strong cross-sell opportunity for us, as our customers realize good value and vendor consolidation.
Bulk Gas sales were up 12% compared to the prior year and up 5% sequentially compared to the first quarter, as Bulk sales to industrial manufacturing and petrochemical companies customers continue to recover, and bulk nitrogen for food freezing applications continued to show strength. 
Medical sales, which were relatively resilient throughout the downturn, were up 4% compared to prior year and 1% sequentially, outflowing in elective and non-critical procedures were more than offset by new customer signings.
Specialty Gas sales increased 10% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. The growing demand for core specialty gases reflects further strengthening of our market position in EPA protocols and other calibration gas mixtures, as well as improving conditions in petrochemical markets.
Solid year-over-year growth in our CO2 and Dry ice business was primarily driven by new customer signings. Sequential growth was driven both by new customer signings and the normal seasonality as our second quarter includes the hottest months of the year.
Our Radnor private label products were up 12% for the quarter. The long-term growth opportunity for the Radnor brand remain strong. In addition to building brand loyalty within our customer base, gross margins on Radnor products are 1.5x or more than those of comparable OEM products.
Our operating efficiency programs, which focus on cylinder maintenance and testing, distribution of fill plant logistics, and freight and fuel management are progressing according to schedule. At our December Analyst Meeting, we set a goal to attain $40 million of new operating efficiency savings over the next four years, driven largely by logistics plant studies and cylinder testing. We are on track to deliver the $10 million of those savings that are included in our fiscal 2011 guidance.
I would like to conclude my remarks by providing an update on the status of our SAP conversion. The commencement of our planned phase rollout, whereby business units implement the new SAP system in succession, marks a major milestone in the structural development of our company.
In August, we provided you with an update regarding the value represented by the ongoing implementation of our highly customized SAP system, including quantification of the economic benefits expected to be achieved in three key areas: accelerated sales growth through expansion of the Telesales platform; price management; and administrative and operating efficiencies.
Upon full implementation, we expect these three areas alone to yield an aggregate of $75 million to $125 million in incremental operating income on an annual run rate basis and we expect to identify additional economic benefit as the implementation progresses. This will further optimize the power of the Airgas platform and we are excited about it's game-changing implications.
As planned, we successfully converted our hardgoods supply chain infrastructure to SAP in early July 2010. The Airgas hardgoods supply chain includes more than 300,000 stock-keeping units, six national distribution centers, four buying centers and a safety products Telesales organization, and serves as the hardgoods fulfillment source for over 875 regional company branches.
As a result, the Airgas hardgoods supply chain touches nearly every area of our company and therefore, its successful conversion to SAP is a significant indicator of the future success and timeline of this project.
Based on the conversion of the hardgoods supply chain, I'm happy to highlight for you some of the positive results we've seen so far. The SAP system is stable and our associates are becoming more proficient every day.
Customer service levels have remained as high as they were on the legacy system as many of our associates have noted that it's much easier to access account information on SAP. Hardgoods fulfillment rates remain at free conversion levels. Accounts receivable metrics have exceeded plan in every month since conversion, and there has been no increase in the number of billing errors or credit memos issued.
Our national distribution center personnel have been improving their productivity and accuracy every day through the use of SAP-enabled handheld radio frequency devices. Our Safety Telesales business has exceeded both forecast and prior year sale and EBITDA in every month since converting to SAP. And the new system has enabled a much faster month-end close process. Lastly, we are on track for our first regional company, Airgas South, to go live on SAP on April 1, 2011.
The regional SAP implementation plan called for full conversion of all Airgas businesses with the exception of Red-D-Arc by the end of calendar 2013. Based on our early success and the magnitude of the benefits, we've developed a modified and accelerated implementation plan. Under the accelerated schedule, we expect full implementation at nearly all our regional distribution companies where the majority of benefits are expected to be realized to occur by the summer of 2012, with implementation reaching all remaining business units by December 31, 2012.
Through September 2010, we've invested more than 75% of our original $85 million SAP project estimate. And the decision to accelerate the implementation was based on the early success of system conversions and the substantial benefits to be realized.
We expect the additional implementation costs of the accelerated schedule to be approximately $20 million, which will be more than offset by the economic benefits that will begin to accrue during the conversion process. These additional costs do not impact any previously issued earnings guidance we have provided.
Based on everything we've experienced to date, we are highly confident that by the end of calendar 2013, the benefits detailed in our August 31 announcement will be achieved and will constitute a minimum of $75 million in aggregate annual run rate benefits and operating income, with a strong likelihood that these benefits will reach or exceed $125 million in the aggregate.
Now Bob will give you our financial review of the quarter."

Sales increased 10% year-over-year to $1.06 billion, reflecting acquisitions growth of 1% and total same-store sales growth of 9%, comprised of the 7% increase in gas and rent and a 12% increase in hardgoods.
Volume was up 6% and price was up 3%, reflecting a full quarter's impact of the June 1 price increase. Sequentially, sales increased by 1%.
Both hardgoods and gas and rent sales improved sequentially, with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent as is typical in an industrial economic recovery. Consistent with the first quarter, gas and rent represented approximately 64% of our sales mix. The gas and rent mix was slightly higher in the second quarter of last year, at 65%.
Gross margin was 55.1%, a decline of 80 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift toward lower margin hardgoods. Sequentially, gross margin expanded by 20 basis points. Excluding pretax charges of approximately $4.7 million related to Air Products' unsolicited takeover attempt and approximately $1.4 million related to the withdrawal from multi-employer pension plans, adjusted operating income for the quarter was $128 million, up 15% from last year.
This is a strong performance, particularly in light of the significant year-over-year increases in variable compensation expense due to favorable performance relative to plan in the current year versus below-plan performance in the prior year, as well as incremental expenses in the current year related to our SAP implementation.
Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 12%, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by operating leverage on sales growth, which more than overcame year-over-year expense headwinds from variable compensation and SAP implementation costs.
Sequentially, adjusted operating margin was down slightly from 12.3% in the first quarter, reflecting 30 basis points of incremental impact from the commencement of our SAP system conversions in July. Adjusted earnings per diluted share increased 22% from the prior year to $0.83 in the second quarter, above our guided range and matching the first quarter as the second-best earnings quarter in our history.
There were approximately 85.6 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter, up about 3% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Return on capital, which is a trailing four quarters calculation, was 10.9%, a 40 basis point improvement sequentially on the strength of our improving operating income. We expect our return on capital to continue to expand with operating income as the recovery continues and our business benefits from the significant capital investments we have made in the past few years, including new air separation plants, fill plant upgrades and SAP.
With respect to accounts receivable, our collection rates and our DSO for the quarter improved year-over-year and we're relatively consistent with the first quarter.
Inventory turns held consistent with recent trends, reflecting our disciplined management of inventory levels during the significant uptick in hardgoods sales. Year-to-date, we generated strong free cash flow of $179 million, driven by adjusted cash from operations of $290 million. We have reduced our adjusted debt by approximately $127 million fiscal year-to-date, to $1.7 billion at September 30. Over the past 12 months, we have reduced adjusted debt by more than $200 million.
Our fixed flow of ratio at the end of September was 60% fixed, and our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.4% within our revised target range of 2% to 3%. During the quarter, we refinanced our revolving credit agreement, which would have matured in July 2011, at an approximate rate of LIBOR plus 212 basis points, and issued $250 million of 3.25% senior notes due in 2015. Both arrangements position us well for the future by extending our debt maturities and reducing our reliance on bank financing.
Now turn to Slide 5 and we'll look at our segment results. Distribution sales in the quarter were up 10% versus the prior year to $944 million, with same-store sales up 8%. Gas and rent same-store sales were up 6%, and hardgoods were up 12%, with pricing up 3% in both categories driven by a full quarter's contribution from our successful June 1 price increase.
On a sequential basis, Distribution sales increased by 1%. Both gas and hardgoods sales improved sequentially, with hardgoods outpacing gas and rent. Distribution gross margin was 55.5%, a decrease of 90 basis points from the prior year, primarily reflecting the expected sales mix shift towards lower margin hardgoods.
Sequentially, distribution gross margin was consistent with the first quarter. As in the first quarter, gas and rent represented close to 60% of Distribution sales in the second quarter.
Adjusted operating income in the Distribution segment increased 13% year-over-year to $106 million. And as noted in my comments on our consolidated results, Distribution operating income growth was also negatively impacted by incremental variable compensation and SAP implementation costs.
Adjusted operating margin in the Distribution segment was 11.3%, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by operating leverage in sales growth, which more than overcame year-over-year expense headwinds from variable compensation and SAP implementation costs. Sequentially, adjusted operating margin was down slightly from 11.5% in the first quarter, reflecting 30 basis points of incremental impact from the commencement of SAP conversions in July.
All Other Operations reflects our CO2, Dry ice, Refrigerants, Ammonia and nitrous oxide business units. Sales for All Operations (sic) [All Other Operations] were up 12% in total and on a same-store basis [ph] (46:43) from the prior year, driven primarily by higher pricing for certain refrigerants, higher pricing in volumes for ammonia used in DeNOx applications in chemical processing and new customer signings on our liquid CO2 business.
Sequentially, sales for All Other Operations declined 2% as seasonal strength in our Ammonia, CO2 and Dry ice businesses was more than offset on a comparative basis by the effect of the significant outperformance in our Refrigerants business in the first quarter.
Gross margin for All Other Operations was down 50 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by higher costs in the Ammonia business relative to pricing. Sequentially, gross margin was up 180 basis points as lower margin Refrigerants represented a smaller portion of the sales mix.
Adjusted operating income for All Other Operations was $21 million. Adjusted operating margin increased 150 basis points year-over-year, as operating leverage on sales growth in our Refrigerants and CO2 businesses more than offset the impact of a slight gross margin compression in our Ammonia business.
Sequentially, the 60 basis point decline in operating margin is primarily attributable to the gross margin compression in the Ammonia business and reduced operating leverage on lower sales in the Refrigerants business relative to the first quarter.
Please turn to Slide 6, capital expenditures. We have continued to be disciplined in our capital spending this year, as reflected in the 120 basis point year-over-year reduction in capital expenditures as a percent of sales to 5.5%.
Slide 7 presents our fiscal 2011 third quarter and updated full-year guidance. For the third quarter, we expect earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.80, an increase of 17% to 23% over the prior year, impressive growth in the face of significant year-over-year headwinds in the third quarter from our variable compensation reset. Excluding $0.01 of incremental SAP implementation costs, our guidance represents a 19% to 25% improvement over the prior year.
For the full year, we are raising our earnings per share expectations to be in the range of $3.22 to $3.32, from $3.15 to $3.30, up 20% to 24% over adjusted EPS for fiscal 2010, which includes significant year-over-year impact of increased variable compensation and SAP implementation costs.
We expect same-store sales growth to be in the high-single digits in the third quarter and in the mid- to high-single digits for the full fiscal year. Operating margin is expected to be in the 12% to 12.5% range, and we continue to estimate capital expenditures to be approximately 5.5% of sales. We expect our tax rate to be in the range of 38% to 39%, and our guidance excludes debt extinguishment charges, multi-employer pension withdraw charges and costs and charges related to the unsolicited takeover attempt.
Slide 8 presents a walk through the primary elements of our third quarter guidance, using second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.83 starting point. We have also included in this slide a walk through the primary elements of the resulting fourth quarter guidance implied by our third quarter and updated fiscal year guidance, using our third quarter guidance range as a starting point.
Sequentially, the third quarter includes a headwind of between $0.05 and $0.06, due to two fewer selling days and the impact of holidays in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter.
The third quarter also has a headwind of approximately $0.05 to $0.06 due to the seasonality of our CO2, Dry ice and Refrigerants businesses which typically slow during the cooler months of the year, partially offset by higher sales in our Red-D-Arc Rental Welder business due to the fall turnaround season.
We expect $0.02 of sequential benefit from lower SAP implementation costs in the third quarter, as we successfully completed the conversion of our first business units during the second quarter.
We expect the core business to expand sequentially, contributing $0.03 to $0.05 on continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy, and on solid execution of our operating efficiency programs. In the fourth quarter, the addition of two selling days and the loss of the negative third quarter impact of holidays should provide a $0.05 to $0.06 benefit to EPS.
The seasonal nature of our CO2, Dry ice and Red-D-Arc businesses will continue to be a headwind, and the preparation for implementation of SAP at our first regional company on April 1 is expected to be a headwind of approximately $0.03 relative to the third quarter.
We expect our core business to expand sequentially over and above the incremental selling days, contributing $0.03 to $0.04 on a continued modest improvement in the manufacturing economy and continued solid execution on our operating efficiency programs.
The underlying business improvement is consistent with the plan we developed in conjunction with our midterm financial goals we announced at the December Analyst Meeting. And in fact, our current trajectory is higher. I'll now turn it back to Peter."

Before we turn to Q&A, I'd like to highlight some of the reasons that underscore our confidence in Airgas' prospects for continued growth and shareholder value of creation, and some of our views on valuation.Slide 9 illustrates the EPS grow",525,"Thanks, Bob. Before we turn to Q&A, I'd like to highlight some of the reasons that underscore our confidence in Airgas' prospects for continued growth and shareholder value of creation, and some of our views on valuation.
Slide 9 illustrates the EPS growth Airgas generated in the economic recovery from calendar 2002 through calendar 2005, and contrast that with the growth represented by our current midterm goals.
In the three-year period following the last recession, we delivered compounded annual EPS growth of 18%. Our earnings growth tends to accelerate as an expansion continues, particularly after overcoming the initial headwinds of variable costs at the outset of recovery.
Our high EBITDA margins so early in this recovery bode very well for our earnings growth. Last year at our December Analyst Meeting, we announced a new set of financial goals consistent with our practice over the past decade.
The bottom chart shows the earnings growth trajectory from calendar 2009 to our calendar 2012 target of $4.20 plus per share. The 16% CAGR is more conservative than our performance in the last recovery in spite of the fact that we are a much stronger operating company today. You can clearly see that our revised fiscal 2011 guidance range is above the earnings trajectory on which these current midterm goals are built, even though the recent low and acquisition activity has us behind the acquisition assumptions in our plan.
In other words, if we continue at our current pace, I expect us to beat our target of $4.20-plus per share for calendar 2012, and an improving acquisition environment would then provide further upside to that target.
On September 2, we published a slide deck titled, ""It's All About Value"", wherein we highlighted many reasons that we believe Air Products' offer is inadequate and opportunistic. An important takeaway is that in the five-year time frame leading up to February 4, 2010, the day before Air Products announced its offer, Airgas had a median next 12 months price earnings multiple of 16.7x. That five-year period includes significant impact from the recession and almost all of our peers today are trading at or above their respective five-year average multiples.
Digging deeper into that same timeframe, when GDP growth was between 0% and 3%, our average NTM EPS multiple was 17.7x. Calendar 2010 is rapidly drawing to a close, and investors are sharpening their focus on calendar 2011 earnings. Since February, there's been a significant increase on our actual and expected earnings growth, substantial improvement in the markets and meaningful reduction of our debt. 
We point out these factors to underscore our Board's view that Air Products' $65.50 offer is grossly inadequate. The benefits of our customer-centric culture and new sales alignment are just starting to develop. Our industry is still very fragmented and acquisitions are our core competency in Airgas. We've never been stronger than we are today. We appreciate the tremendous amount of support we have received from our shareholders, and look forward to continuing to deliver outstanding value to you in the future.
Thank you, and now I'd like to turn it back to Jay to begin our question-and-answer session."

In terms of our Distribution business, the strongest part of the country right now is Great Lakes in North Central, the Upper Midwest manufacturing part. But that tends to lead in an economic recovery any way. California continues to have its problems, so it's been a little slower to recovery but we're seeing solid signs of recovery out there now. I don't anticipate any areas turning down, geographies turning down. I do see an increase in our non-residential Construction business. Part of that will be seasonal, there are a lot of turnarounds that take place in the December quarter at refineries and paper mills and power plants. And a lot of our construction sales are into that sector, into the turnaround business. And there are a few projects starting up as well. So that went pretty low, non-residential Construction, I think, 28% unemployment. And so it's nice to see that come back and that might help us a little bit in the quarter, as well offsetting the two less selling days and the impact of the holidays --"

That has begun to take hold. It's slow, it's going to be slow, I think we said that. Most of the containers that are being sold for that today are gallon jugs and totes and things like that. But one of the things that's happening, now keep in mind that was for DeNOx for trucks and cars and things like that, mobile. What's happening is a significant acceleration in DeNOx in general in stationary sources, smokestacks, cement kilns, power plants. And there's also a move, a higher growth than we were expecting in Ammonia that is sold in aqua form, which is a water solution of Ammonia, which is less -- has lower risk in handling for customers. And as customers attempt to manage risk there's a high interest in this product. And what's interesting about it is that since it's mostly water, you can't haul it very far. And our network of Ammonia locations, which is the most extensive in the country, I think, per tank trucks, is uniquely positioned. So we're getting higher growth than we expected from DeNOx, from the development and evolution of aqua Ammonia as a source. That's the Ammonia story. In the Retail story, that continues to go quite well and it's expanding. When we started it and told you about it in December, we were talking primarily about helium for balloons and things like that. It's now expanding into chains of grocery stores and chains of auto parts, auto body centers, repair centers, auto dealerships and things like that. And it's going well."

The Bulk business is getting better in the United States, but I think we're growing faster than the industry. And if you look at our CapEx, so far this year, you can see that our cylinders and Bulk tanks are still pretty robust and most of that is Bulk tanks. And we have a lot of relationships where, as I said, we have all the business. We're in there three times a week sometimes on the more active customers, at least a couple of times a month on the medium-sized customers. So we know the people and when these bulk accounts come up for renewal, we have an opportunity. Also, for new applications. We have 1,500 sales people out there beating the streets every single day and the chances of them tripping over -- and it's not tripping, believe me, they're well-trained, then digging up Bulk prospects are very, very good. And that goes to the strength of our operating model. And that Bulk volume has nothing to do with on-sites. On-sites are -- we report them separately.

So as relates to Construction sale, those efforts, even though overall those contractors' business is down, our sales to those contractors are up. And in fact, on Construction sales, we are now in positive territory. And expect -- based on what we know in their pipeline, again, even though their business is down, our piece of the pie is up pretty significantly and we have positive Construction sales. Now with that said, Red-D-Arc is not yet in positive territory. But based on what's on the books right now, in this quarter we're entering right now, at the end of this quarter, if those jobs don't get canceled, and we've had far fewer cancellations now than we had a year ago. Everything was being taken off even at the time after we made deliveries.
