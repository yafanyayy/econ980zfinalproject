Q4 was our best ever quarter for product revenue, margin and cash flow, reflecting a dramatic reversal in our results when compared to the fourth quarter a year ago.  Pricing held up well throughout the fourth quarter and product margins benefited from a 20% sequential reduction in cost per gigabyte. A year ago, the fourth quarter of 2008 marked the bottom of the industry down cycle with all flash memory manufacturers operating at negative margin and reporting heavy losses. By the fourth quarter of 2009, all NAND suppliers, including ourselves, were reporting vastly improved results, partly resulting from production cutbacks in the first half of 2009. Despite the recession, global demand from NAND flash continued to grow and by the second half of 2009, flash manufacturers returned to 100% capacity utilization. This turnaround happened considerably more rapidly than expected, demonstrating the remarkable ability of this young industry to self- correct. This is an important factor that we have discussed with you in the past. While we benefited significantly as did others from the general improvement in market conditions, that is, ""a rising tide, lift all boats,"" I do believe that our decisive actions at SanDisk contributed much more so to our rapid turnaround, amidst the ongoing industry-wide recovery. I'd like to reflect on the more important of these SanDisk actions. In the fourth quarter of '08, we structured the company to streamline our organization along Retail and OEM businesses, which allowed us to reduce our non-GAAP operating expenses by 25% in 2009 compared to 2008. We opened up major new OEM sales channels and we set our number one priority to return to profitability, as evidenced in our Q3 and Q4 results. In Q1 '09, we sold approximately 20% of our captive capacity to Toshiba and we further cut our captive output by throttling back capacity utilization rates at our Yokkaichi fabs by more than 20% in the first half of 2009. At the same time throughout 2009, we sustained our investments in advanced NAND Flash and 3D read/write technology, 3-bits-per-cell and 4-bits-per-cell NAND architectures, advanced proprietary controller chips and new products for both our Retail and OEM businesses. And in Q2 '09, we renewed our patent cross license agreement with Samsung Electronics.Looking forward now, with no new NAND fab expected to come on stream in 2010, we expect the NAND industry to continue to experience a healthy balance between demand and supply. Flash storage in mobile handsets is expected to continue to be the primary demand growth engine for the industry in 2010. Exciting new devices, such as the iPAD launched yesterday are demonstrating the significant new opportunities ahead for flash mass storage. We see a similar trend in digital camcorders, which have abandoned optical recording media and have largely embraced flash memory. Today, Verizon announced its launch of our slotRadio cards in 2000 Verizon stores for use with their high-end cell phones. Solid state drive, SSD, are making well-publicized inroads in enterprise storage. And we believe it is only a matter of time before the tipping point is reached for the broader adoption of Flash SSD in notebooks and netbook PCs.The iPAD, as well as the Kindle, are already past their tipping point, as these class of devices are very thin and are required to deliver long operating time on a battery charge, therefore doing away altogether with rotating disk drive or DVD players, and relying exclusively on NAND Flash for mass storage.Turning to capacity. Current industry forecasts project a 2010 total NAND industry bit growth in the range of 70% to 90%. For SanDisk, we currently project our captive bit output to increase in 2010 by up to 70% compared to our output in 2009, approximately in line with our currently projected bit demand growth in 2010. Our bit output increase will come primarily from completion of the technology transition to 32-nanometer by late 2010, as well as modest incremental wafer capacity, utilizing the unused clean-room space in Yokkaichi Fab 4. We believe this capacity expansion at Fab 4 will be extremely cost-effective. And we plan to exercise our option to invest and take up to 50% of that capacity. As for the timing and pace for this final increment of Fab 4 capacity, we will proceed with caution to align capacity additions with demand from our customers. Currently, we expect this to add approximately 10% to our monthly captive wafer production in the second half of 2010, the rest coming in 2011. This is all factored into the 2010 bit growth guidance that I have just provided you. This does mean that our usage of flash memory from NAND captive sources will likely be minimal in 2010. Flash industry pricing is expected to reflect a healthy balance between demand and supply in 2010. In the next several years, industry-wide NAND cost reductions are expected to decelerate from the pace of the prior five years due to increasingly more challenging scaling of future NAND technology nodes that we have discussed on previous occasions.We estimate our own cost reduction in 2010 will be in the range of 30% to 40% compared to 52% in 2009 when we captured the cost benefits of 3-bits-per-cell technology. We expect to start transitioning to 24-nanometer node late in 2010 with cost benefits expected in 2011.Looking to the future, we enter 2010 with a superb captive manufacturing base, great technology and products and a lean and focused team that is driving our global opportunity. Our strategic actions in 2009 and our uniquely balanced participation in both OEM and retail global markets is working very well for us and we'll guide our business activity in 2010.I'll now turn it over to Sanjay."

The strong performance in our fourth quarter was driven by healthy demands for our product from both our retail and OEM customers, leading to record unit sales. We have seen a strong lift in seasonal consumer demand. And we also benefited from our channel diversification efforts and our strategy to achieve a balanced retail and OEM business focus. Our operational execution was solid with out wafer fab production remaining at high efficiencies and the supply chain executing well to meet rising demand levels. Following a record fourth quarter in product sales, channel inventory levels remain healthy and we exited of 2009 maintaining our focus on profitable growth augmented by continued tight control on costs and expenses. We are exceptionally well-positioned now in mobile storage. Five of our top 10 customers in Q4 '09 were tier-1 handset manufacturers. And in addition, we are working closely with the leading mobile network operators and mobile retailers. Sales of our mobile cards and embedded flash products drove nearly half of the fourth quarter's record total product revenue. All in all in Q4, we sold 82 million mobile products. Our embedded flash product sales grew very strongly and that accounted for more than 20% of our total mobile OEM business.                                                                       Design win momentum for the iNAND continues to be strong. Finally, within OEM, revenues from the new channels and customers that we discussed with you in the third quarter grew nicely with strong revenue and profit contribution.Shifting to our Retail business, the fourth quarter was seasonally strong with retail sales within all of our end markets posting sequential revenue growth. Our retail market share remains strong in the major geographies. And our Retail business is growing vertically well in the APAC region. With regard to new products and markets, there is a tremendous amount of innovation and energy. And we will share some of this with you at our Investor Day meeting on February 26.In 2009, the combination of a strong ramp of 3-bits-per-cell technology along with seamless process technology migration enabled SanDisk to reduce product cost per gigabyte by more than 50% for the fifth consecutive year. Furthermore, our supply chain scaled up efficiently throughout the year to meet the 26% increase in unit volume demand compared to the prior year levels. Our Shanghai Assembly and Test Facility significantly ramped output with strong productivity gains. This, in combination with capacity ramp at our contract manufacturers allowed us to flexibly meet the seasonally strong demand in a cost-effective fashion. In Q4, we continued to ramp our 32-nanometer process technology and it accounted for slightly more than 10% of our total bit output. We began shipments of microSD, SD and Memory Stick PRO Duo cards using our 32-nanometer C disk 3-bits-per-cell technology as planned. To summarize, we are pleased with our Q4 and 2009 results. And we look forward to delivering more in 2010. With that, I will turn the call over to Judy."

Our fourth quarter results reflected strong growth in both OEM and retail channels, with retail revenue up 41% and OEM revenue up 40% sequentially. OEM represented 56% of our fourth quarter product revenue, the same proportion as in the third quarter. And for the year, our product revenue was equally balanced at a 50/50 mix of retail and OEM.Our fourth quarter retail revenue was down 6% year-over-year with the decline due primarily to increasing amounts of our mobile business going through mobile networks operator stores that we now count as OEM.  Our fourth quarter OEM revenue was up 215% year-over-year with the mix from the mobile market increasing to more than 80% of our OEM revenue. Our total fourth quarter product revenue grew 54% year-over-year with units up 55%, ASP per gigabyte down 23% and average capacity up 29%. On a sequential basis, our ASP per gigabyte declined 2%. And our total average capacity was up 18%, driven primarily by the OEM mobile product mix. License and Royalty revenue of $100 million in the fourth quarter included Samsung royalties based half on the old license agreement and half on the new license agreement. Q4 product gross margin of 44% on a GAAP basis and 45% on a non-GAAP basis was higher than we had anticipated due to less price decline and stronger cost reduction, which was 20% per gigabyte. In addition, we received a higher than expected benefit of $95 million from selling products, which carried previously taken reserves. The reserve benefit came primarily from lower of cost or market reserves taken on inventory built in 2008, but also reflected the sale of inventory that had been reserved as excess or obsolete. Without these inventory reserve benefits, our underlying product gross margin was 36%, a level that generates strong profitability on our product business and a very good return on invested capital.Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses of $192 million were in the range we expected and reflected a seasonal lift in sales and marketing, a 14-week quarter and an increase in the accrual of incentive compensation related to our 2009 performance. Comparing the full year of 2009 to 2008, we decreased our non-GAAP expenses by 25%.  Our fourth quarter non-GAAP operating income was $417 million or 34% of revenue. Without the benefit received from inventory reserves, the underlying operating income was $322 million or 26% of revenue with more than 70% of this operating profit coming from our product business. Our non-GAAP other income increased sequentially by $5 million due primarily to certain one-time investment gains and to a lesser extent, due to higher invested cash balances. On the balance sheet, cash and short and long-term liquid investments increased sequentially by $432 million to $3.0 billion. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations was the highest ever in a single quarter at $388 million, and free cash flow was even higher at $431 million.Cash flow from investing included a $57 million receipt of excess cash from the Flash Partners joint venture, zero outgoing capital payments to the joint ventures and a modest outflow for property and equipment. For the full year, we generated cash flow from operations of $488 million and free cash flow of $438 million. For 2009, net cash used for capital related investing was only $49 million. Key elements included $378 million outflow for capital investments in the joint ventures and $60 million outflow for property and equipment. With these outflows largely offset by the receipt of $277 million from the joint venture restructuring, $110 million of cash returned from Flash Partners and $13 million received from the wind down of FlashVision.We ended 2010 with $1.07 billion of equipment lease obligations, down from $2.1 billion at the end of 2008. Our inventory ended 2009 at 596 million, almost the same number as at the end of 2008. However, both the gross level of inventory and the offsetting reserves have been significantly reduced and reserves have returned to normal levels.I'll now turn to forward-looking commentary. I'll provide guidance for Q1 as well as for the full year 2010. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance are posted on our website. We are expecting a normal level of seasonally reduced demand in the first quarter, coupled with the impact of Q1 being a regular 13-week quarter compared to our 14-week Q4. We are forecasting total revenue for Q1 between $875 million and $950 million, which includes license and royalty revenue between $80 million and $90 million, fully reflecting the new Samsung license agreement. For the full-year 2010, we forecast total revenue between $4.0 billion and $4.4 billion including license and royalty revenue between $320 million and $360 million. Turning to gross margin. We expect that first quarter cost decline may be a bit less than price decline as we expect more modest cost decline in Q1 than we generated in the previous two consecutive quarters of very strong cost reduction. For the full-year 2010, we expect that the annual cost decline, which Eli estimated at 30% to 40% will be greater than the annual price decline, allowing product gross margin to expand from our 2009 underlying product gross margin, which was in the teens on a full-year basis. We are forecasting a non-GAAP product gross margin for Q1 and for the full year of approximately 31%, plus or minus three percentage points. We forecast non-GAAP operating expenses in Q1 of $175 million to $185 million and for 2010 of $725 million to $750 million. We forecast non-GAAP other income for 2010 to be approximately $40 million spread relatively evenly across the year. We forecast a non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 37%, up from 36% in 2009 based primarily on certain tax law changes for 2010. On a GAAP basis, we are still in a valuation allowance position. And as such, the GAAP tax rate is too difficult to predict.Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We expect our total capital investment in 2010 to be between $700 million and $900 million, covering fab technology transitions, incremental wafer capacity and Fab 4, as Eli described and back-end supply chain and other CapEx requirements across the business. We expect to fund this, primarily from a combination of cash flow from operations and working capital from the joint ventures. And we expect continuing positive free cash flow in 2010. As in the past, we will provide further color on CapEx and our funding plans at our Investor Day on February 26. In summary, we are expecting solid performance in 2010. And we look forward to sharing more information with you at our upcoming Investor Day. We'll now open the call for your questions."

And new applications that are coming out are continuing to drive a new demand for storage as well. On top of all of this, the demand is being driven globally.

And I think that there's a whole class of devices like this where consumers will appreciate the other attributes of flash memory, in terms of very low power. It's very responsive, tremendous functions and in small form factor to pay the premium. If you look at the iPAD price quote going from 32 gigabytes to 64 gigabytes, $100 incremental cost to the consumer, which is not that much, that still translates to about $3 per gigabyte. And I would kind of venture to bet my annual salary that there will be a big number of customer that wants a 64 gigabytes at $3 per gigabyte. And yet you hear a lot of people saying, you need $0.50 per gigabyte in order for SSD to take off.  I think when SSD becomes commoditized, yes, it would need to be playing at this price range. But we have tremendous opportunities over the next several years.  But to answer your question, I think this is an ongoing process. I've said the enterprise, of course, is ready, willing to pay the additional cost per gigabyte of Flash. And I think that by the end of this year and certainly into 2011, you're going to see more and more notebook computers and people asking and be willing to pay a lot more than $0.50 per gigabyte.  And of course, within two years, we ought to be able to reach the $1 per gigabyte and I think that that will be another important -- I don't want to say tipping point, but another important milestone for SSD adoption.  In the meantime, the SSDs are getting much, much better for us as well as for competitors. And I think that this is a market that's here to stay. And it's going to grow and become a very important part.  By 2012, I've seen some estimates that this will be -- that SSDs will consume maybe 15% to 20% of the total NAND bit output.

The provisioning of the remaining space in Fab 4 -- there's not that much capacity left in Fab 4. And as you can well imagine, filling up what remains of a clean room space is very cost effective because your fixed cost basically is in place already.  And therefore, running additional wafers, yes, you need new equipment and so on. But the cost of wafer is actually very favorable, which is very different from the first tranche of extension of new capacity in a brand new fab, whether it's an existing empty shell or a new facility that you build from the ground up. The first, let's say 50,000, 70,000, 80,000 wafers a month carry the full fixed cost even though I'm not using the full capacity available.  So we think that this is a very, very important element for us to take advantage of through our 50/50 option with our partner. And, of course, this does mean that we delay the move to greater lines of non-captive. But in general, our desire continues to be relying on non-captive supply, for around 10%, 15% to 25% or so of our future capacity. We do have the agreements in place. These non-captive capacity cannot obviously be turned on an instant. You need to invest in dollars and qualify and so on. And at the appropriate time, we plan to absolutely exercise those."

And then, of course, there's general economy and consumer confidence in some of the things that are outside of our control. I would say that we've always believed that pricing -- it's healthy for the industry and for us to continually cost reduce and share the benefit of that with consumers. That expands and creates a few markets. We have not changed in our thinking. All we are saying and what I said is that the rate of a price reduction that we saw in the last three years, which was close to 60% annually, was disastrous and would not be supportable by cost reductions. And we are seeing now good stability in the market. And it is my hope that we are at the beginning of a long period of health in the industry, with continuing price reductions and cost reductions, but at the level that makes economic sense."

First quarter results were considerably better than we had expected. Our OEM business was start at the quarter, driven by strong demand from our mobile customers as well as new channels and customers added in 2009.
The OEM business accounted for 63% of total product revenue in Q1, and has been a stabilizing factor compensating for the first quarter seasonality in our retail business, which has yet to recover from the economic downturn in the U.S. and Europe. Our focus in retail continuous to be to maximize profitability, while expanding into new geographies where we believe we are making steady inroads.
In the mobile end market we continue to see strong adopting of our iNAND embedded storage solutions as well as mobile card. Mobile has now grown to half of our product revenues, compares to virtually nothing five years ago.
MicroSD has become the de facto cards in mobile phones and the market place has bifurcated into low capacity one and two gigabyte MircoSD cards for low end phones and high capacity for 32 gigabyte MircoSD card for high end Smartphone and we believe we hold strong leadership positions in both segments.
The mobile market for FLASH is still in its early days. Just to remind you mobile Apps hardly existed and Smartphones were hardly household word just two years ago. The iPod along with other similar products is expected to drive demand for FLASH memory 64 gigabyte in higher capacities, where the DISK demand comes in the form of embedded storage or removable cards. We are now well positioned in both categories.
We continue to gain traction with leading OEMs for our modular SSD solutions, Solid State Disk in netbook and public computers. In the first quarter we also entered the retail Solid State drive market with our G3 products. At current NAND pricing levels, SSD solutions are still expensive. However, we believe this market too should drive very substantial consumption of high capacity flash as it becomes much more affordable. We expect this will occur with add vented of 20Xnanometer flash memory technology in mass production next year, and with 1 X NAND technology in 2012.
We're now executing to our aggressive solid disk road map that should take us to being top tier supplier as SSD adoption accelerates in net books, notebooks, and tablet PC platforms in the years ahead. On the operations and technology front we're very pleased with the ramp of our 32-nanometer technology as well as the continuing cost benefits that we see from broad implementation of our 3-bit-per-cell X3 technology into our products where we believe we are significantly ahead of competition. In the first, quarter our cost per gigabyte declined by 14% sequentially, continuing our highly competitive cost structure.
As for the industry environment, demand and supply appears to be in balance for 2010. For our sales we now expect our captive bit output to increase in 2010 over 2009 by approximately 75%, up from approximately 70% estimated previously with outside coming late in the year from better productivity and Fab 4 expansion.
Last month, Toshiba announced the intention to commence construction of the shell for a new clean image that will eventually be Fab 5. We're evaluating the timing of our participation in Fab 5, and we will provide further details as they become available later in the year.
In summery the first quarter was a very-very good start for 2010. With our leading technology, large scale manufacturing, diversified end markets, broad product portfolio, premium brand, and a strong balance sheet, we have powerful momentum to capitalize on future opportunities and we believe that in the coming decade flash will be bigger than you think. I will now turn it over to Jude.

We delivered our best ever first quarter results driven by strong OEM demand, minimal price reduction and continued execution in product cost reduction and expense management. Our total product revenue was down sequentially by 13% which was less than we had expected given historical Q1 seasonality and a 14-week fourth quarter.
Our retail business reflected normal seasonality with revenue down 27% sequentially while our OEM revenue was down only 2% sequentially. As a result, the Q1 mix of our product revenue was 63% OEM and 37% retail. Our retail revenue grew 7% year-over-year, and our OEM revenue increased to 158% reflecting strong demand in the mobile market and the new channels we added in 2009. Looking at our revenue by end market, our first quarter product revenue came 49% from the mobile phone market, up from 38% in the first quarter of last year.
Retail demand continued to be soft in Europe and the U.S while Asia retail sales increased sequentially from Q4 to Q1. We believe we maintained share in U.S retail while we may have given up some share in low priced USB products in Europe retail. In Asia, we benefited from strong consumer demand as well as from our geographic expansion efforts.
Our first quarter OEM revenue benefited from strong demand in the mobile market and in general from new customers for mobile embedded solutions, cards, as well as wafers and components. Our overall ASP per gigabyte declined 7% in the first quarter much less than in the previous first quarter reflecting a healthy supply demand balance. And some of our 7% decline in ASP per gigabyte reflected the mix of product sold rather than price decreases.
Our units sold decreased 3% sequentially and grew 62% year-over-year. Average capacity remained fairly steady as the pricing environment has created strong demand for lower capacity units. Average capacity was down 4% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year our total gigabyte sold declined 7% sequentially and grew 71% year-over-year.
Our license and royalty revenue was slightly stronger than we had forecasted at $93 million and now fully reflects our new license agreement with Samsung. Our first quarter non-GAAP total gross margin of 46.5% and non-GAAP product gross margin of 41.5% benefited from a better than anticipated pricing environment and also from stronger than forecasted OEM sales that resulted in recognizing more of our 32-nanometer 3-bits-per-cell production in first quarter results.
Our product gross margin improved sequentially from an underlying product gross margin of 36% in Q4 '09 to 41.5% in Q1 driven by a 14% sequential cost reduction on a per gigabyte basis, compared to our 7% decline in price per gigabyte.
Non-GAAP operating expenses of 172 million were down 20 million from the fourth quarter reflecting a 13-week quarter compared to Q4's 14 weeks as well as seasonality in sales and marketing expenses.
Our first quarter non-GAAP operating profit was 334 million or 31% of revenue, and as with the last quarter, more than 70% of this operating profit came from our product business. Our non-GAAP other income of 23 million included gains of 15 million related to the sale of certain assets and investments.
On the balance sheet cash and short and long-term marketable securities increased sequentially by 279 million to nearly $3.3 billion. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was 328 million, and our cash flow from investing yielded a positive $1 million resulting in free cash flow of 329 million.
During Q1, we called our $75 million convertible paying it off with cash, and we reduced our off-balance sheet equipment lease guarantees ending Q1 with a balance of 931 million.
I will now turn to forward-looking commentary. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance are posted on our website.
Given our strong results in the first quarter, we are raising our guidance for 2010. Our broad channels and growing demand from the mobile market give us confidence to increase our full year revenue range to 4.5 billion to $4.8 billion.
For the second quarter, we expect total revenue between 1.1 billion and 1.175 billion which reflects tightness in supply for certain low capacity products. Within this total Q2 revenue, we expect license and royalty revenue between 80 million and 90 million, slightly down sequentially since our second quarter royalty revenue reflects the seasonal first quarter revenue of our licensees. For the full year, we are also raising our expectations for license and royalty revenue to a range of 350 million to 375 million.
Turning to gross margin, we expect a sequential improvement in cost to be less in Q2 than in Q1 due to anticipated higher mix of demand for certain products in our portfolio.
We also expect our second quarter sales to reflect more promotional pricing in the retail channel associated with the moms, proms, dads and grad season. We expect non-GAAP total gross margin for Q2 between 42% and 45%, and non-GAAP product gross margin between 37% and 40%.
For the full year 2010 we now anticipate that our cost reduction will be at the high-end of the 30% to 40% range we provided in January and we expect price reduction to be less than our previous estimates. Partially offsetting these factors we may utilize some non-captive supply in the second half of the year.
We are raising our full year 2010 forecast for non-GAAP total gross margin to a range of 41 to 44%, and for non-GAAP product gross margin to a range of 36% to 39%. For the 2010 total gross margin this represents a more than 5 percentage point increase in the mid-point of the range from the previous guidance.
Given our increased top line expectations for the year, we now expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be at the higher end of the range previously provided or approximately 750 million. For Q2 we forecast non-GAAP operating expenses of 180 to 190 million.
We now expect non-GAAP other income to be approximately 60 million for the year and we forecast the non-GAAP tax rate to remain at approximately 37%. We expect our 2010 Capital Investments to be at the higher end of the 700 to $900 million range, we previously provided and the estimated cash requirement for 2010 Capital Investments remains in the range of 300 to 400 million concentrated later in the year.
In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter performance and it is looking like 2010 will be a year in which we exceed the operating margin in our long-term financial model.
We'll now open the call for your questions.

At the Analyst Day, we talked about AFM, that’s the adopted flash management, which is part of our controller intelligence to allow us to optimized embedded flash to the specific application of the platform, and we're seeing very significant reception, productivity reception for that. So I would say that we probably have moved now quite solidly from a model where maybe a year ago or a little bit more than that we were maybe one third OEM and two-thirds retail to just opposite, one third retail and two-thirds OEM. And I don’t - I expect to this thing is going to be with us for the foreseeable future.

The iPod is driving 64 gigabyte. We fully expect that the competition will be really driving at the 64 gigabyte and opening up to 128 and 256 gigabyte. This is very, very positive development for the NAND industry no matter who serves it, and also very important because again the Analyst Day we talked about thin is in.
What thin means when you have very thin products and you can't have a fan to cool the environment, you basically are driven to use modular flash which modular SSD which is SSD functionality but not necessarily in the 1.8 inch or 2.5 inch form factors, and that clearly plays to our strength because we have the ability to customize solid state disk to be basically to fit into very, very thin and any kind of profile which of course no disk drive can do.
So in that kind of environment people are starting to look at SSD not just is it lower - does it match the cost of hard disk drive but more is it enabling technology that allows that kind of form factor.

So, Judy has indicated we're raising our guidance for the year from 4 billion to 4.4 to 4.5, 4.8. That's $500 million additional revenues which of course would require very substantial additional gigabytes, petabytes and units that we are forecasting we will need flash for this year.
So of course the solution to getting that supply is from captive which is Fab 4, and then non-captive, and then anything we do with Fab 5 will definitely not have any impact.
It will not be available until really 2011 at the earliest.
So, this is what in my remarks I said we're striving to get our output this year to about 75% more bids this year, later in the year, and this comes from primarily greater efficiency in Fab 4, better yields than we had expected in Fab 4, as much utilization of X3 we can squeeze out of wafers and that's going very well and building some additional capacity in Fab 4 in the clean room space and there we're somewhat limited by equipment lead times and of course not much space left in there. So all of these in combination give you that 75% so increase and that may not be enough and in that case we will explore non-captive option.

As you know, Paul, we announced more than two years ago in MOU with Toshiba and nonbinding memorandum of understanding with Toshiba for the creation of fab 5, and that of course ran into the recession that the whole industry and really was put on hold.
About a month ago, Toshiba announced that they will commence the construction of the shell in the KG. This is basically a decision to build just a building. And we certainly plan to continue the partnership that we have with Toshiba in fab 5. However, I also said in the past and we really feel very strongly that we need to play our part as best we can to maintain health in the industry by not bringing our new capacity - any new capacity that we have from any new sources too soon to the market that would be not good for us and of course, we can't control what our competitors are doing. But basically this for the last, I term last quarter is curbing our enthusiasm.
That said, we do need to - we do see demand for flash growing at a very strong pace both from the mobile and from other markets including SSD, and therefore we do - again, I have said on February 26, it’s not a question of if we’re going to participate in fab 5 but when, and to what extent and the timing and so on, and all of those have not yet been decided.

We do feel that you heard me say as saying that in the next decade we think that flash already bigger than you think and that’s really based on the mobile in the way it's going as well as that’s obviously there is two major new markets that are very, very early, so the industry will need to build additional capacity that doesn’t exist. I think we all know that, and you know the key is really the timing of those because the return on investment by itself is tied to the timing.
Now, what that leads me to say is over the next several years there will be a period, I believe, of shortages of flash memory, and that will be times where people will understand, OEMs, particularly large OEMs, that flash is becoming very strategic to their business. You can view it as a commodity, but when you can't get it at any price because it is just not there because your demand far exceeds the available capacity of the industry, and the cumulative demand of all customers, then of course people will start wanting to secure for themselves some of that capacity, so I do expect some of that may happen.
Of course we don't know for a fact, but I would not be surprised if the strategic nature in the next few years is going to become effective. It's no secret flash is a very, very tough technology. There are very few companies that can really deliver leading-edge technology, very high volume, both from the technology and the manufacturing and the balance sheet. So the answer to your question is yes, I think there is going to be some of that but there are some OEMs will start taking steps to assure themselves of supply.

Now we have 20 nanometer class which means whatever you want. It has a two in somewhere in the number. Anyway from 32 nanometer - first of all, 32 nanometer from 43 nanometer is very substantial cost reduction, and particularly if you stay 3 bits to 3 bits, 43 nanometer X3 to 32 nanometer X3.
As we get to lower geometries more scaled, I am sure again I said before we expect the difficulty of implementing X3 will increase but we feel they were playing to our strength. So we fully expect that when we go to 24-nanometer we will be able to take our X3 with us without in anyway comprising performance.
So from 32 to 24 again pretty substantial cost reduction and basically you're looking at - we have said NAND is going to start slowing down and we truly believe that, but at the same time the industry and we are moving still at a pretty rapid pace and I would say that the end of scaling of NAND has probably been greatly exaggerated, maybe by us as well. So, actually it's looking a little bit better all the time and that of course would be very good news for SSD particularly.

First quarter results were considerably better than we had expected. Our OEM business was the star of the quarter, driven by strong demand from our mobile customers as well as new channels and customers added",631,"Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. First quarter results were considerably better than we had expected. Our OEM business was the star of the quarter, driven by strong demand from our mobile customers as well as new channels and customers added in 2009.
Our OEM business accounted for 63% of total product revenue in Q1 and has been the stabilizing factor compensating for the first quarter seasonality in our Retail business, which has yet to recover from the economic downturn in the U.S. and Europe. Our focus in Retail continues to be to maximize profitability, while expanding into new geographies where we believe we are making steady inroads. 
In the mobile end market, we continue to see strong adoption of our iNAND embedded store solutions as well as mobile cards. Mobile has now grown to half of our product revenues compared to virtually nothing five years ago.
MicroSD has become the de facto standard for cards in mobile phones, and the marketplace has bifurcated into low capacity, one- and two-gigabyte microSD cards for low-end phones and high-capacity four- to 32-gigabyte microSD cards for high-end smartphones, and we believe we hold strong leadership position in both segments.
The mobile markets for Flash is still in its early days. Just to remind you, mobile apps hardly existed and Smartphones were hardly a household word just two years ago. The iPod, along with other similar products, is expected to drive demand for Flash memory, 64 gigabyte and higher capacities. Whether this demand comes in the form of embedded storage or removable cards, we are now well positioned in both categories.
We continue to gain traction with leading OEMs for our modular SST solutions, solid state disk, in netbook and tablet computers. In the first quarter, we also entered the retail solid state drive market with our G3 products.
At current NAND pricing levels, SSD solutions are still expensive. However, we believe this market, too, should drive very substantial consumption of high capacity flash as it becomes much more affordable. We expect this will occur with the advent of 20x nanometer flash memory technology in mass production next year and with 1x NAND-technology in 2012.
We are now advocating to our aggressive solid state disk technology roadmap that should take us to being a top-tier supplier as SSD adoption accelerates in netbooks, notebooks and tablet PC platforms in the years ahead.
On the operations and technology front, we are very pleased with the ramp of our 32-nanometer technology, as well as the continuing cost benefits that we see from broader built[ph]implementation of our 3-bits-per-cell X3 technology into our products, where we believe we are significantly ahead of competition.
In the first quarter, our cost per gigabyte declined by 14% sequentially, continuing our highly competitive cost structure. As for the industry environment, demand and supply appears to be in balance for 2010. For ourselves, we now expect our captive bit output to increase in 2010 over 2009 by approximately 75%, up from approximately 70% estimated previously with the upside coming late in the year from better productivity and Fab 4 expansion.
Last month, Toshiba announced their intention to commence construction of the shell for a new clean-room at Yokkaichi, that will eventually be Fab 5. We are evaluating the timing of our participation in Fab 5, and we will provide further details as they become available later in the year.
In summary, the first quarter was a very, very good start for 2010. With our leading technology, large scale manufacturing, diversified end markets, broad product portfolio, premium brand and a strong balance sheet, we have powerful momentum to capitalize on future opportunities, and we believe that in the coming decade Flash will be bigger than you think. 
I will now turn it over to Judy."
34032,100534549,61153,"SanDisk Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-21-2010",2010-04-21,"Earnings Calls","SanDisk LLC","Executives","Thank you, Eli. We delivered our best ever first quarter results, driven by strong OEM demand, minimal price reduction and continued execution in product cost reduction and expense management. Our total product revenue was down sequentially by 13%, which",1092,"Thank you, Eli. We delivered our best ever first quarter results, driven by strong OEM demand, minimal price reduction and continued execution in product cost reduction and expense management. Our total product revenue was down sequentially by 13%, which was less than we had expected given historical Q1 seasonality and a 14-week fourth quarter. Our Retail business reflected normal seasonality with revenue down 27% sequentially, while our OEM revenue was down only 2% sequentially.
As a result, the Q1 mix of our product revenue was 63% OEM and 37% retail. Our retail revenue grew 7% year-over-year, and our OEM revenue increased 158%, reflecting strong demand in the mobile market and the new channels we added in 2009. Looking at our revenue by end market, our first quarter product revenue came 49% from the mobile phone market, up from 38% in the first quarter last year.
Retail demand continued to be soft in Europe and the U.S., while Asia retail sales increased sequentially from Q4 to Q1. We believe we maintained share in U.S. retail while we may have given up some share in low-priced USB products in Europe retail. In Asia, we benefited from strong consumer demand, as well as from our geographic expansion efforts.
Our first quarter OEM revenue benefited from strong demand in the mobile market and, in general, from new customers for mobile embedded solutions, cards, as well as wafers and components. Our overall ASP per gigabyte declined 7% in the first quarter, much less than in the previous first quarters, reflecting a healthy supply-demand balance.  And some of our 7% decline in ASP per gigabyte reflected the mix of products sold rather than price decreases. 
Our units sold, decreased 3% sequentially and grew 62% year-over-year. Average capacity remained fairly steady as the pricing environment has created strong demand for lower capacity units. Average capacity was down 4% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year. Our total gigabytes sold, declined 7% sequentially and grew 71% year-over-year.
Our license and royalty revenue was slightly stronger than we had forecasted at $93 million and now fully reflects our new license agreement with Samsung. Our first quarter non-GAAP total gross margin of 46.5% and non-GAAP product gross margin of 41.5% benefited from a better-than-anticipated pricing environment and also from stronger-than-forecasted OEM sales that resulted in recognizing more of our 32-nanometer 3-bit-per-cell production in first quarter results.
Our product gross margin improved sequentially from an underlying product gross margin of 36% in Q4 '09 to 41.5% in Q1, driven by a 14% sequential cost reduction on a per-gigabyte basis compared to our 7% decline in price per gigabyte.
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $172 million were down $20 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting a 13-week quarter compared to Q4's 14 weeks, as well as seasonality in sales and marketing expenses. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating profit was $334 million or 31% of revenue. And as with the last quarter, more than 70% of this operating profit came from our Product business.
Our non-GAAP other income of $23 million included gains of $15 million related to the sale of certain assets and investments.
On the balance sheet, cash and short- and long-term marketable securities increased sequentially by $279 million to nearly $3.3 billion. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was $328 million, and our cash flow from investing yielded a positive $1 million, resulting in free cash flow of $329 million.
During Q1, we called our $75 million convertible, paying it off with cash, and we reduced our off-balance sheet equipment lease guarantees, ending Q1 with a balance of $931 million. 
I'll now turn to forward-looking commentary. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance are posted on our website.
Given our strong results in the first quarter, we are raising our guidance for 2010. Our broad channels and growing demand from the mobile market give us confidence to increase our full year revenue range to $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion. For the second quarter, we expect total revenue between $1.1 billion and $1.175 billion, which reflects tightness in supply for certain low capacity products.
Within this total Q2 revenue, we expect license and royalty revenue between $80 million and $90 million, slightly down sequentially since our second quarter royalty revenue reflects the seasonal first quarter revenue of our licensees.
For the full year, we are also raising our expectations for license and royalty revenue to a range of $350 million to $375 million.
Turning to gross margin, we expect the sequential improvement in cost to be less in Q2 than in Q1 due to anticipated higher mix of demand for certain products in our portfolio. We also expect our second quarter sales to reflect more promotional pricing in the retail channel associated with the moms, proms, dads and grads season.
We expect non-GAAP total gross margin for Q2 between 42% and 45% and non-GAAP product gross margin between 37% and 40%. For the full year 2010, we now anticipate that our cost reduction will be at the high end of the 30% to 40% range we provided in January, and we expect price reduction to be less than our previous estimates.
Partially offsetting these factors, we may utilize some non-captive supply in the second half of the year. We are raising our full year 2010 forecast for non-GAAP total gross margin to a range of 41% to 44% and for non-GAAP product gross margin to a range of 36% to 39%. For the 2010 total gross margin, this represents a more than five-percentage-point increase in the midpoint of the range from the previous guidance. 
Given our increased top line expectations for the year, we now expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be at the higher end of the range previously provided or approximately $750 million. For Q2, we forecast non-GAAP operating expenses of $180 million to $190 million. We now expect non-GAAP other income to be approximately $60 million for the year, and we forecast the non-GAAP tax rate to remain at approximately 37%.
We expect our 2010 capital investments to be at the higher end of the $700 million to $900 million range we previously provided and the estimated cash requirement for 2010 capital investments remains in the range of $300 million to $400 million concentrated later in the year.
In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter performance, and it is looking like 2010 will be a year in which we exceed the operating margin in our long-term financial model. We'll now open the call for your questions."

The iPAD is driving 64 gigabytes. We fully expect that the competition will be really driving at the 64 gigabyte and opening up to 128 and 260 gigabyte. This is very, very positive development for the NAND-industry, no matter who serves it, and also very important because, again, the analyst day, we talked about thin is in. What thin means, when you have very thin product and you can't have a fan to cool the environment, you basically are driven to use modular flash, modular SSD, which is SSD functionality but not necessarily in the 1.8-inch or 2.5-inch form factors, [ph] and that clearly plays to our strength because we have the ability to customize solid state disks to be basically -- to fit into very, very thin in any kind of a profile, which, of course, no disk drives can do.

So let me try and address those, and I'm sure there'll be maybe a few other questions on that.
Judy has indicated we are raising our guidance for the year from $4 billion to $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion. That's $500 million additional revenues, which, of course, would require best potential [ph] additional gigabytes, petabytes in units that we are forecasting we will need flash for this year. So, of course, the solution to getting this supply is from, first from captive, which is Fab 4, and then non-captive. And then anything we do with Fab 5 will definitely not have any impact. It will not be available until well into 2011 at the earliest. So this is what, in my remarks, I said we are striving to get our output this year to about 75% more bits this year later in the year. And this comes from primarily greater efficiency in Fab 4, better yields than we had expected in Fab 4 as much utilization as X3 as we can squeeze out of wafers, [ph] and that's going very well and building some additional capacity in Fab 4 in the cleaning space. And there we are somewhat limited by equipment lead times and, of course, there's not much space left in there. So all of these in combination give you that 75% or so increase, and that may not be enough, and in that case, we will explore the non-captive option."

There's two major new markets that are very, very early. So the industry really need to build additional capacity that doesn't exist. I think we all know that. And the key is really the timing of those because the return investment by itself is tied to the timing. Now, what that leads me to say is that over the next several years, there will be periods, I believe, of shortages of flash memory. And that will be times where people will understand OEMs, particularly large OEMs, that flash is becoming very strategic to their business. You can view it as a commodity. But when you can't get it at any price because it's just not there because your demand far exceeds the available capacity of the industry and the cumulative demand of all customers, then, of course, people will start wanting to secure for themselves some of that capacity. So I do expect that some of that may happen. Of course, we don't know for a fact, but I would not be surprised if the strategic nature in the next few years is going to start becoming effective. It's no secret. Flash is a very, very tough technology. There are very few companies that can really deliver leading-edge technology and very high volume both from the technology and the manufacturing and the balance sheet.

Our OEM business was the star of the quarter, driven by strong demand from our mobile customers as well as new channels and customers added",635,"Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. First quarter results were considerably better than we had expected. Our OEM business was the star of the quarter, driven by strong demand from our mobile customers as well as new channels and customers added in 2009.
The OEM business accounted for 63% of total product revenue in Q1 and has been the stabilizing factor compensating for the first quarter seasonality in our Retail business, which has yet to recover from the economic downturn in the U.S. and Europe. Our focus in Retail continues to be to maximize profitability, while expanding into new geographies where we believe we are making steady inroads. 
In the mobile end market, we continue to see strong adoption of our iNAND embedded storage solutions as well as mobile cards. Mobile has now grown to half of our product revenues compared to virtually nothing five years ago.
microSD has become the de facto standard for cards in mobile phones and the marketplace has bifurcated into low capacity one- and two-gigabyte microSD cards for low-end phones and high capacity four- to 32-gigabyte microSD cards for high-end smartphones. And we believe we hold strong leadership position in both segments.
The mobile market for flash is still in its early days. Just to remind you, mobile apps hardly existed and smartphones were hardly a household word just two years ago. The iPod, along with other similar products, is expected to drive demand for Flash memory, the 64 gigabyte and higher capacities. Whether this demand comes in the form of embedded storage or removable cards, we are now well positioned in both categories.
We continue to gain traction with leading OEMs for our modular SSD solutions, solid state disk, in netbook and tablet computers. In the first quarter, we also entered the retail solid state drive market with our G3 products.
At current NAND pricing levels, SSD solutions are still expensive. However, we believe these markets, too, should drive very substantial consumption of high capacity flash as it becomes much more affordable. We expect this will occur with the advent of 20x nanometer flash memory technology in mass production next year and with 1x NAND technology in 2012.
We are now executing to our aggressive solid state disk technology roadmap that should take us to being a top-tier supplier as SSD adoption accelerates in netbooks, notebooks and tablet PC platforms in the years ahead.
On the operations and technology front, we are very pleased with the ramp of our 32-nanometer technology, as well as the continuing cost benefits that we see from broad-adopt implementation of our 3-bits-per cell (X3) technology into our products, where we believe we are significantly ahead of competition.
In the first quarter, our cost per gigabyte declined by 14% sequentially, continuing our highly competitive cost structure. As for the industry environment, demand and supply appears to be in balance for 2010. For ourselves, we now expect our captive bit output to increase in 2010 over 2009 by approximately 75%, up from approximately 70% estimated previously, with the upside coming late in the year from better productivity and Fab 4 expansion.
Last month, Toshiba announced their intention to commence construction of the shell for a new clean room at Yokkaichi that will eventually be Fab 5. We are evaluating the timing of our participation in Fab 5, and we will provide further details as they become available later in the year.
In summary, the first quarter was a very, very good start for 2010. With our leading technology, large-scale manufacturing, diversified end markets, broad product portfolio, premium brand and a strong balance sheet, we have powerful momentum to capitalize on future opportunities, and we believe that in the coming decade flash will be bigger than you think. 
I will now turn it over to Judy."

We delivered our best ever first quarter results, driven by strong OEM demand, minimal price reduction and continued execution in product cost reduction and expense management. Our total product revenue was down sequentially by 13%, which was less than we had expected given historical Q1 seasonality and a 14-week fourth quarter. Our Retail business reflected normal seasonality with revenue down 27% sequentially, while our OEM revenue was down only 2% sequentially.
As a result, the Q1 mix of our product revenue was 63% OEM and 37% retail. Our retail revenue grew 7% year-over-year, and our OEM revenue increased 158%, reflecting strong demand in the mobile market and the new channels we added in 2009. Looking at our revenue by end market, our first quarter product revenue came 49% from the mobile phone market, up from 38% in the first quarter last year.
Retail demand continued to be soft in Europe and the U.S., while Asia retail sales increased sequentially from Q4 to Q1. We believe we maintained share in U.S. retail while we may have given up some share in low-priced USB products in Europe retail. In Asia, we benefited from strong consumer demand, as well as from our geographic expansion efforts.
Our first quarter OEM revenue benefited from strong demand in the mobile market and, in general, from new customers for mobile embedded solutions, cards as well as wafers and components. Our overall ASP per gigabyte declined 7% in the first quarter, much less than in the previous first quarters, reflecting a healthy supply-demand balance.  And some of our 7% decline in ASP per gigabyte reflected the mix of products sold rather than price decreases. 
Our units sold, decreased 3% sequentially and grew 62% year-over-year. Average capacity remained fairly steady as the pricing environment has created strong demand for lower capacity units. Average capacity was down 4% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year. Our total gigabytes sold, declined 7% sequentially and grew 71% year-over-year.
Our license and royalty revenue was slightly stronger than we had forecasted at $93 million and now fully reflects our new license agreement with Samsung. Our first quarter non-GAAP total gross margin of 46.5% and non-GAAP product gross margin of 41.5% benefited from a better-than-anticipated pricing environment and also from stronger-than-forecasted OEM sales that resulted in recognizing more of our 32-nanometer 3-bit-per-cell production in first quarter results.
Our product gross margin improved sequentially from an underlying product gross margin of 36% in Q4 '09 to 41.5% in Q1, driven by a 14% sequential cost reduction on a per-gigabyte basis compared to our 7% decline in price per gigabyte.
Non-GAAP operating expenses of $172 million were down $20 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting a 13-week quarter compared to Q4's 14 weeks, as well as seasonality in sales and marketing expenses. Our first quarter non-GAAP operating profit was $334 million or 31% of revenue. And as with the last quarter, more than 70% of this operating profit came from our Product business. Our non-GAAP other income of $23 million included gains of $15 million related to the sale of certain assets and investments.
On the balance sheet, cash and short- and long-term marketable securities increased sequentially by $279 million to nearly $3.3 billion. Our first quarter cash flow from operations was $328 million, and our cash flow from investing yielded a positive $1 million, resulting in free cash flow of $329 million. During Q1, we called our $75 million convertible, paying it off with cash, and we reduced our off-balance sheet equipment lease guarantees, ending Q1 with a balance of $931 million. 
I'll now turn to forward-looking commentary. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance are posted on our website.
Given our strong results in the first quarter, we are raising our guidance for 2010. Our broad channels and growing demand from the mobile market give us confidence to increase our full year revenue range to $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion. For the second quarter, we expect total revenue between $1.1 billion and $1.175 billion, which reflects tightness in supply for certain low capacity products.
Within this total Q2 revenue, we expect license and royalty revenue between $80 million and $90 million, slightly down sequentially since our second quarter royalty revenue reflects the seasonal first quarter revenue of our licensees.
For the full year, we are also raising our expectations for license and royalty revenue to a range of $350 million to $375 million.
Turning to gross margin, we expect the sequential improvement in cost to be less in Q2 than in Q1 due to anticipated higher mix of demand for certain products in our portfolio. We also expect our second quarter sales to reflect more promotional pricing in the retail channel associated with the moms, proms, dads and grads season.
We expect non-GAAP total gross margin for Q2 between 42% and 45% and non-GAAP product gross margin between 37% and 40%. For the full year 2010, we now anticipate that our cost reduction will be at the high end of the 30% to 40% range we provided in January, and we expect price reduction to be less than our previous estimates.
Partially offsetting these factors, we may utilize some non-captive supply in the second half of the year. We are raising our full year 2010 forecast for non-GAAP total gross margin to a range of 41% to 44% and for non-GAAP product gross margin to a range of 36% to 39%. For the 2010 total gross margin, this represents a more than five-percentage-point increase in the midpoint of the range from the previous guidance. 
Given our increased top line expectations for the year, we now expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be at the higher end of the range previously provided or approximately $750 million. For Q2, we forecast non-GAAP operating expenses of $180 million to $190 million. We now expect non-GAAP other income to be approximately $60 million for the year, and we forecast the non-GAAP tax rate to remain at approximately 37%.
We expect our 2010 capital investments to be at the higher end of the $700 million to $900 million range we previously provided and the estimated cash requirement for 2010 capital investments remains in the range of $300 million to $400 million concentrated later in the year.
In summary, we are pleased with our first quarter performance, and it is looking like 2010 will be a year in which we exceed the operating margin in our long-term financial model. We'll now open the call for your questions."

At the analyst day, We talked about AFM, that's the Adaptive Flash Management, which is part of our controller intelligence to allow us to optimize embedded flash to the specific applications of that platform. And we have seen very significant reception, positive reception for that.

The iPAD is driving 64 gigabytes. We fully expect that the competition will be really driving at the 64 gigabyte and opening up to 128 and 260 gigabyte. This is very, very positive development for the NAND industry, no matter who serves it. And also very important because, again, in the analyst day, we talked about thin is in. What thin means, when you have very thin products and you can't have a fan to cool the environment, you basically are driven to use modular flash, modular SSD, which is SSD functionality but not necessarily in the 1.8-inch or 2.5-inch form factors, and that clearly plays to our strength because we have the ability to customize solid state disks to be basically -- to fit into very, very thin in any kind of a profile, which, of course, no disk drive can do. So in that kind of environment, people are starting to look at SSD not just, is it lower -- does it match the cost of hard disk drive but more is it an enabling technology that allows that kind of full function."

So let me try and address those, and I'm sure there'll be maybe a few other questions on that.
Judy has indicated we are raising our guidance for the year from $4 billion to $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion. That's $500 million additional revenues, which, of course, would require very substantial additional gigabytes, petabytes in units that we are forecasting we will need flash for this year. So, of course, the solution to getting this supply is from, first from captive, which is Fab 4, and then non-captive. And then anything we do with Fab 5 will definitely not have any impact. It will not be available until well into 2011 at the earliest. So this is what, in my remarks, I said we are striving to get our output this year to about 75% more bits this year later in the year. And this comes from primarily greater efficiency in Fab 4, better yields than we had expected in Fab 4 as much utilization as X3 as we can squeeze out of wafers, and that's going very well and building some additional capacity in Fab 4 in the cleaning space. And there we are somewhat limited by equipment lead times and, of course, there's not much space left in there. So all of these in combination give you that 75% or so increase, and that may not be enough, and in that case, we will explore the non-captive option."

We do feel that -- you've heard me say or us say that in the next decade, we think that flash will be bigger than you think, and that's really based on the mobile, the way it's going, as well as the solid state. There's two major new markets that are very, very early. So the industry really need to build additional capacity that doesn't exist. I think we all know that. And the key is really the timing of those because the return investment by itself is tied to the timing. Now, what that leads me to say is that over the next several years, there will be periods, I believe, of shortages of flash memory. And that will be times where people will understand OEMs, particularly large OEMs, that flash is becoming very strategic to their business. You can view it as a commodity. But when you can't get it at any price because it's just not there because your demand far exceeds the available capacity of the industry and the cumulative demand of all customers, then, of course, people will start wanting to secure for themselves some of that capacity. So I do expect that some of that may happen. Of course, we don't know for a fact, but I would not be surprised if the strategic nature in the next few years is going to start becoming effective. It's no secret. Flash is a very, very tough technology. There are very few companies that can really deliver leading-edge technology and very high volume both from the technology and the manufacturing and the balance sheet. So the answer to your question is yes, I think there's going to be some of that. Some OEMs will start taking steps to assure themselves of supply."

As we get to lower geometries, more scaled, I'm sure -- again I've said before, we expect that the difficulty of implementing X3 will increase. But we feel that there we're playing to our strength. So we fully expect that when we go to 24-nanometer, we will be able to take our X3 with us without in any way a compromising performance. So from 32 to 24, again, a pretty substantial cost reduction. And basically, you're looking at -- we've said NAND is going to start slowing down, and we truly believe that. But at the same time, the industry and we are moving still at a pretty rapid pace, and I would say the end of scaling of NAND has probably been greatly exaggerated, maybe by us as well.

We are very pleased with our excellent second quarter results continuing the positive trend of the past several quarters and setting the stage for a strong finish to 2010.I will lyric my remarks in the prev",869,"Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone.  We are very pleased with our excellent second quarter results continuing the positive trend of the past several quarters and setting the stage for a strong finish to 2010.
I will lyric my remarks in the prevailing industrywide demand supply conditions and our Fab 5 announcement last week with our partner Toshiba.  I will then comment on today's announcement regarding my decision to retire as Chairman and CEO of SanDisk at the end of this calendar year and our succession plan.
Sanjay and Judy will provide details on the second quarter and the outlook for the second half of this year.  We believe the NAND Flash industry continues to experience a healthy demand supply balance as evidenced by modest price declines throughout the second quarter.
In the second half, our customer demand is expected to exceed our supply driven primarily by strong mobile OEM sales as well as seasonal improvement in retail demand.  Our own supply situation is looking quite tight in the second half, the result of our OEM business doing much better than we had forecasted just six months ago and we continue to work closely with our customers in this environment.
We now have greater visibility and are more confident in the sustained demand from our diversified channels and market and, therefore, we have now approved the final phase of Fab 4 extension which will result in additional petabytes in the first half of 2011.
Last week in Yokkaichi, Japan we signed the Fab 5 agreement with our long-term strategic partner Toshiba.  This represents a major strategic decision for us, one that will allow us to keep face with the projected strong growth in our Flash market in the coming decade.
Due to long construction and equipment lead times, this decision is now timely and necessary and the Fab 5 contribution to our existing supply base will become meaningful starting in late 2011.
The Fab 5 agreement provides us flexibility to participate in up to 50% of the investment and corresponding capacity allocation with our actual percentage participation being determined at our discretion.
Furthermore, beyond the initial startup ramp and within certain limits we have the flexibility to time our own production ramp rate to best meet our customers' demand profile.
Fab 5 will take several years to ramp to full capacity at which point it is expected to be one of the largest, most efficient and most advanced NAND Flash memory fab in the world.  It will be capable of supporting extreme UV, that's UV lithography tools when they become available for production and we also see possibly our first trial for 3D redrive when this technology becomes ready for commercialization.
Fab 5 will require substantial capital investments.  It will be spread primarily over 2011 through 2014 as well as startup costs in the second half of 2011.  We have not finalized our Fab 5 production plans beyond the initial minimum commitment and we will provide Fab 5 CapEx projections in the first quarter of 2011 when we have better playing visibility.
We believe that the much-improved strength of our balance sheet and the growing scale and diversity of our business support this important investment in Fab 5.
Moving now to today's announcement of my retirement from SanDisk and our succession plan; I consider myself to have been the luckiest guy in our industry these past 22 years.  Together with our team we built SanDisk from the proverbial idea sketch on a napkin into a great company in an industry that we pioneered.
This year I turn 65.  Also, this year SanDisk is stronger than ever and poised to do even better in the years ahead.  This is good timing to pass the baton to a new leader.  We are very fortunate that my partner and co-founder, Sanjay Mohrotra, has accepted the CEO roll effective January 1, 2011.
Sanjay is 52 years old and over the last 22 years he has contributed in numerous, major rolls as SanDisk grew to its current size and stature.  He has tremendous integrity and business acumen and, as a superb memory engineer, he is as knowledgeable about flash storage as any other person in our industry.
Sanjay has displayed strong leadership through the years and, in particular, during the recent difficult downturn when we restructured and strategically redirected SanDisk on its current course.  He has mine and the Board's full confidence and support and is ready and able to lead SanDisk to the next level in the years ahead.
SanDisk's new non-executive Chairman of the Board effective January 1, 2011 will be Michael Marks, a long-term SanDisk Board director and former Flextronics CEO.  At the Board's request, I have agreed to provide the company with advisory service, particularly technology related on a part-time basis in the two years subsequent to my retirement.
For myself I will continue driving SanDisk hard until midnight December 31, 2010.  During the next five months I hope to also meet with many of our shareholders, customers and partners.  Beyond that, I currently have no specific plans and am looking forward to new adventures with my wife, my life's partner.  I will now pass it over to Sanjay.

Over the last 22 years I have benefited from the valuable mentoring and insight provided to me by Eli as SanDisk grew from a [starter] to one of the most recognized companies in the high tech industry.  It is my honor to have the [fortune] to follow in Eli's footsteps and as successful as SanDisk is today I'm confident that our best days are still ahead.
I look forward to working with the SanDisk team to bring innovative products to market that anticipate our customers' requirements and drawing standards to new heights.
Now moving on to our second quarter review, our revenue reserves were strong, driven primarily by continued success in the OEM market.  Our OEM business grew 181% from the year-ago quarter with unit volume more than doubling during the same period.  Within our OEM business, our micro SD cards boasted strong unit and revenue growth.
In addition, our embedded storage products business grew substantially setting a record for both units and revenue with robust increases in [payments] of high capacity, eight gigabytes or greater [product].
In retail we maintained our focus on continued improvements in profitability and [ramp premium] in all regions.  The ramp of our 32 nanometer technology has progressed will with high yield and productivity.  The mix of 32 nanometer technology using X2 and our current generation X3 architecture was about two-thirds of our total production output.
We expect to complete the 32 nanometer transition in the third quarter.  This progress, combined with continued usage of S3 is delivering better cost reductions than we expected for the year.  Our [x phase 9]s are now fully mature and we believe that they deliver significantly superior performance and reliability compared to competitors' X3 products.
Just for year-to-date, the use of our X3 and our card and embedded products is essentially [subsequent] to the user from what we price at no differently from comparable X2 (inaudible) products from our sales or competitors.
Addressing our next generation technology we are on track to start transitioning to the 24 nanometer [node] later this year.
Our supply chain [really did] well, delivered record unit sales in the second quarter.  We now expect to ship well over 500 million memory units during 2010 with approximately 50% of these units assembled, (inaudible) and shipped from our Shanghai manufacturing facility.  The scaleup of this factory has improved our cycle time, inventory management, costs and customer responsiveness.
As we look into the second half of the year and beyond, new product cycles from Smart phones, tablets, e-books and other mobile internet devices should continue to drive the need for the (inaudible) NAND Flash based storage solution.
We see plenty of design activity among the [QC] and other technology leaders to develop iPad-like products.  We believe that the runaway success of the iPad and its future composition should [eliminate] that option of flash storage in such ultra mobile platforms.
This new generation of tablets [appears] a fast-moving category which sports a 10 lightweight compactor four-day [web dream], is web connected, application driven, always on and rugged and highly reliable.  These (inaudible) can best be enabled by NAND Flash [waves], high-capacity sorted solutions including SSD.
Customer engagement with our product roadmap that includes PC solid state drive designed for tablets, network PCs and also (inaudible) and [GCD]s, SSDs for mainstream notebook PCs continues to evolve well.
We are gaining traction with design wins that key OEMs and look forward to growth in this important business.  The SanDisk team is excited about the prospects for our business ahead and we look forward to a successful 2010.  With that, I will turn over the call to Judy.

We delivered our highest-ever second quarter revenue, gross margin, operating margin and EPS and our cash on investments stand at the highest level in the company's history on both a gross and net basis.Our product revenue was up 10%",1207,"Thank you, Sanjay.  We delivered our highest-ever second quarter revenue, gross margin, operating margin and EPS and our cash on investments stand at the highest level in the company's history on both a gross and net basis.
Our product revenue was up 10% sequentially and 79% year-over-year with the growth generated primarily from mobile handset products, imaging products and wafers and components.
Our license and royalty revenue was in the range we forecasted with a 27% year-over-year decline reflecting the current Samsung license agreement.  Our Q2 product revenue channel mix was 65% OEM and 35% retail.  Our retail revenue grew 3% sequentially and 7% year-over-year with the strongest retail growth coming from the imaging market.
Looking at our retail revenue by geography, on a year-over-year basis we experienced strong growth in Asia, modest growth in the Americas and a decline in EMEA reflecting weak economic conditions in Europe.
Our OEM revenue grew 14% sequentially and 181% year-over-year with the strongest growth coming from the mobile market.  Across all channels, the mobile market generated 48% of our Q2 revenue.
Turning to a few statistics on pricing and bids, our ASP per gigabyte declined a modest 8% sequentially and 18% year-over-year and our gigabytes sold grew 18% sequentially and 116% year-over-year.
The average capacity of our products sold grew 9% sequentially and 16% year-over-year.  Our non-GAAP product gross margin improved sequentially by approximately one percentage point to 42.4% as our product costs per gigabyte improved 9% sequentially, slightly more than price decline.
Gross margin exceeded our previous forecast primarily because we were able to manage the quarter with less retail promotional spend and our usage of three bits per cell memory or X3 remains similar to the strong level in Q1 whereas we had previously anticipated a slightly lower mix of X3 in the second quarter.
Non-GAAP operating expenses grew only $2 million sequentially and at 14.7% of revenue expenses are slightly below our long-term financial model range of 15% to 17%.  We continue to prioritize investment in technology and innovation and we are hiring in order to manage growth and invest for the future.
Our operating margin improved sequentially on a GAAP basis from 29% to 30% and on a non-GAAP basis from 31% to 32%, second only to the fourth quarter of 2009.  Our non-GAAP other income of $14 million included gains of $7 million related to the sale of certain investments.
Our expected non-GAAP tax rate for the year has come down from 37% to 35.5% and, as a result, the non-GAAP tax rate in Q2 is approximately 34% in order to bring the year-to-date rate to 35.5%.
On the balance sheet, cash and short and long-term marketable securities increased sequentially by $422 million to $3.7 billion.  Second quarter cash flow from operations was $385 million and our six-month year-to-date cash flow from operations is $713 million, higher than we have previously generated in any full year.
During Q2 we purchased $22 million in non-fab capital equipment resulting in free cash flow of $363 million.  SanDisk Fab 3 and 4 joint venture capital investments have been approximately $265 million on a year-to-date basis, all for technology transitions and this has been funded entirely by joint venture working capital resulting in no payments to the joint ventures and no new leases so far this year.
Our off balance sheet equipment lease guarantees totaled $966 million at the end of Q2, slightly up sequentially due to the Yen to dollar exchange rate.  Our inventory dollars ended Q2 below $500 million, the lowest dollar level wince the third quarter of 2006 when our business was substantially smaller.
Measured on a petabyte basis, our inventory is between eight and nine weeks of supply, which is lean for our vertically integrated supply chain model.
I'll now turn to forward-looking commentary.  Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance are posted on our website.
Demand indications from our customers are strong for the second half of the year and we expect to be supply constrained in the second half.  Incremental supply from Fab 4 expansion will primarily be available in Q4 which will help with end-of-year seasonality and we have placed orders for some non-captive supply which will also primarily benefit Q4 but we do not expect our available supply to be adequate to meet demand.
We expect Q3 total revenue to be between $1.175 billion and $1.25 billion.  Within this total Q3 revenue we forecast license and royalty revenue to be between $90 million and $100 million.  Despite supply constraints we are raising our full-year revenue estimate.
Recall we started this year with an estimate of $4 billion to $4.4 billion in revenue and after Q1 we raised that range to $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion.  We now expect total revenue to be between $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion for 2010 including license and royalty revenue between $360 million and $375 million.
Turning to gross margins, we now expect our full-year cost per gigabyte improvement to be better than 40% and we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable.  In the second half we will have some unfavorable gross margin impact from non-captive supply and from the Yen to dollar exchange rate which has moved against us in recent weeks.
Based upon all of these factors, we now expect the product gross margin percentage in the second half to be roughly comparable to the first half of the year.  For the full year, this would result in product gross margin more than four percentage points above the midpoint of our previous guidance.
Our forecast for non-GAAP operating expenses for the full year remains at approximately $750 million with Q3 at approximately $195 million.  Our forecast for non-GAAP other income remains at approximately $60 million for the year and we forecast the non-GAAP tax rate to be 35.5%.
We are pulling in the timing of Fab 4 expansion plans with the completion of Fab 4 expansion still in the first half of 2011.  With this pull-in, our forecasted capital investments for 2010 have increased to approximately $1.1 billion compared to our last estimate of approximately $900 million.
The $1.1 billion is comprised of an estimated $1 billion of joint venture fab equipment in Fabs 3 and 4 and $100 million of non-fab capital equipment.  Roughly $300 million of these investments were made in the first half of 2010 and approximately $800 million remain in the second half.  Recall that there are three sources of funding for our capital investments including joint venture working capital, equipment leases and SanDisk cash.
While our 2010 capital investments have increased due to the pull-in of Fab 4 expansion, the estimated cash requirement for 2010 remains at the low end of the range we provided early this year, approximately $300 million due to strong joint venture working capital and certain expansion payments occurring in 2011.
In closing, we are extremely pleased with our Q2 results and we are working very hard to optimize and maximize supply for our customer demand in the second half.  At the same time, we are managing our business and strategic investments to drive future growth, profitability and cash generation.
We will now open the call for your questions.

In fact, we have raised the revenue estimate a second time compared to the start of the year now.  So we basically are running as fast as we can in terms of really fulfilling the demand and that includes maximizing our captive supply but yet also tapping into demand non-captive sources.
So we saw the demand increasing during the second quarter.  We placed orders for the non-captive supply.  We'll be receiving it in the third quarter.  So in terms of shipments, the impact of non-captive in the third quarter will be small and in the fourth quarter it will be somewhat larger.
As Judy said, overall for the second half still it will be in single digit percentage.  So there are several factors that we look at in managing our non-captive business.  We want to make sure that we are managing it prudently.  Some of the considerations include margin, the mix of the product as well as basically the timing of the supply that's available.
So looking at all of that, our picture ahead is a single-digit percentage in the second half of non-captive utilization.

Of course, things have changed dramatically since that time.  With the visibility that we have into the future now with our new significantly more diversified channels we felt that we would need basically to structure agreement on a 50, 50 basis just as we had in the prior agreement.
However, the difference that we were able to achieve here is to give us flexibility since our ramp profile and customer requirements may be somewhat different than Toshiba's to give us the ability, except for the initial ramp up phase which is jointly undertaken and committed to give us flexibility to have a different ramp that Toshiba while still maintaining an equal cost structure and also be able to catch up on that capacity.  Of course, if we did not want to use a full 50% we have that flexibility as well.

Video, HD video and your digital cameras as well as camcorders, more and more camcorder models coming out that are pretty much all flash based now, those are -- that's really the primary trend in the retail business in terms of the demand aspect.
In terms of the demand from Europe, as Judy said, Q2 was somewhat slow.  I mean, the consumer sentiment in Europe or in America is not totally back.  However, in Q3 we do expect seasonal uptick in demand particularly associated with back to school.

But then as you shift your mix to X3 and as you start the transition to 24 nanometer, number one, are you concerned about the technology roadmap beyond 24 nanometer and then does this sort of faster transition also affect how you're thinking about cost reduction that you'd previously guided to for 2011 and 2012?

We have in the past been conservative about how scalable is 20 nanometer below.  We feel that as we get closer to 20 nanometer we are gaining significantly more confidence that we can drive the technology below 20 nanometer and hopefully also maintain our ability to ship X3 with 20 nanometer and below in the next, let's say, couple of years.
It is very important for being able to maintain a more aggressive cost reduction than we have previously projected, at least let's say the 20 nanometer and slightly below 20 nanometer.  Beyond that, of course, you start getting into extreme UV and UV and that does require new manufacturing technology.
But overall I would say that we're getting more and more confident that we can take together with Toshiba nan technology to 20 nanometer and at least, let's say, the next generation below that, hopefully with X3.  That makes the [LOI] decision on Fab 5 a lot better, a lot more attractive.

This is the last quarterly call that I will address here as SanDisk Chairman and CEO. Therefore, rather than discussing our business in the third and fourth quarter, allow me to take this opportunity to review",1158,"Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. This is the last quarterly call that I will address here as SanDisk Chairman and CEO. Therefore, rather than discussing our business in the third and fourth quarter, allow me to take this opportunity to review our most recent past and where I see our opportunities and challenges in the coming years.
Sanjay and Judy will discuss our Q3 results and our expectations for Q4. In the past three years, we experienced the industry's most severe downturn followed by strong recovery. We experienced six consecutive weak quarters generating a substantial operating loss followed by six consecutive quarters of remarkable recovery. 
The current recovery continues even in the face of adverse macroeconomic conditions in the U.S., much of Europe and Japan. For SanDisk, our cumulative non-GAAP operating profit for the six quarters ending this year will be more than 2.5x greater than the cumulative non-GAAP operating loss in the preceding six quarters. 
We believe our industry is driven by several powerful secular trends that point to sustainable profitable growth for us in the coming years. First, in the more developed economies, growth for us continues to be driven by the phenomenal rise of the mobile Internet and social networks that fueled a surging demand for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, that in turn drive strong demand for flash memory. 
The second major secular force is the surging consumer middle-class in emerging countries such as China, India, Latin America, Middle East and Africa. We are directing substantial resources to expand our businesses in these emerging countries and in the coming years, we are encouraged by our gains to date.
The past downturn has taught the industry that even relatively small in balances, either up or down, between the managed supply and disproportionately amplify market volatility. I have often said that the non-industry is self-correcting and in the current recovery, the industry did an excellent job of adjusting to compensate for the excessive capital investments that were made in the 2005 through 2008 timeframe. 
Industry cycles, are a fact of life in our business and even severe downturns are in fact, quite manageable provided you have a solid balance sheet, competitive technology and manufacturing base and diversified sales channels so that you're not overly reliant on any single channel or any single local economy. 
New found capacity decisions are made 18 months ahead of production and even on the best laid plans, it's not easy to achieve and maintain a healthy balance. Some products such as the iPhone, the iPad and the Kindle come out of nowhere and very quickly enter hockey-stick growth trajectory that creates a whole new market category, while other products such solid state drives, SSD, can take much longer to develop. Our focus in SanDisk has been, and will continue to be, long-term value creation, where we do our best to balance growth with profitability and cash flow.
Turning now to flash technology. Non-flash has confounded many skeptics as it marches with confidence to mass production at the 24 through 27-nanometer technology node a fact that seemed iffy to many just two years ago. An important element in the success of this rapid scaling has been the all but mandatory adoption of managed NAND, requiring sophisticated controllers to compensate for deteriorating raw NAND reliability and performance. This is amply demonstrated for 3-bits-per-cell, X3 NAND, where the market is witnessing a wide variability in performance and reliability between the X3 product from different NAND suppliers. 
I believe that SanDisk is uniquely well-positioned in this space because from day one, we stayed true to delivering system flash and managed non-solutions, and this is our third generation X3 in production, where we have optimized our chip designs and perfected our controllers to deliver a solid solution. 
We now expect NAND to scale down to below 20 nanometers in the next few years. This will likely be achieved with existing lithography tools running in existing and new advanced non-fab and this bodes well for our Yokkaichi fabs as they become more fully depreciated in the coming years. 
As we push the roadmap even further, extreme ultraviolet, UV lithography tools will become indispensable and I expect the transition to UV to be spread over a number of years and to be quite challenging for the industry. With regards to post non-technology alternatives, I remain optimistic about our three-dimensional 3D read/writes diode rates, currently under development with our partner Toshiba. As I've said previously, I expect highly skilled NAND and post-NAND technology to happily coexist over the next decade.
Moving to IT. Our flash memory and system portfolio and know-how are now dominated by many strong second-generation patents. These patents cover managed NAND, multi-bits NAND, advanced NAND device, process and memory chip design patents, solid state disk, secure portable content, strong air correcting algorithms, high-speed flash caching, wear out optimization, application Adaptive storage, 3D memories and so on. We believe this IP will provide us substantial leverage in the years ahead.
Turning now to our target markets. We have previously spoken about the legacy consumer markets, the mobile market and computing, including SSD and cloud storage. Of these, we believe that mobile continues to present us the greatest opportunities in the coming years. The more than 1.2 billion handsets that will be sold this year drove any other consumer or computing market. Increasingly, these are smartphones and tablets, which are morphing into sophisticated portable PCs that are always connected and that increasingly require more flash storage to support the explosion in third-party mobile apps and user content. 
Handsets are also rapidly assuming the role of the ultimate portable convergence device first with music and cameras then with video games, video capture, GPS and apps. As for SSD, these are transforming Enterprise Storage as we speak and we are within one or two generations from their mass adoption in notebook PCs and other sim clients. 
To be a market leader in SSD, you need to have access to leading-edge, high-quality flash, shippable in high volumes at a competitive cost, applying sophisticated know how for managing highly skilled NAND, having the recorded patents and building on strong OEM credentials. SanDisk has it all and we are working diligently to gain leadership position in this space. 
As for our balance sheet, the numbers speaks for themselves and I believe that SanDisk is exceptionally well-equipped to execute our long term global growth strategy. Last but not the least, our people. SanDisk people, the ""Can Do"" team, driven by passion for innovation with a consistent track record of flawless execution through good and bad times. 
SanDisk technologists and engineers retain the deep technology DNA from our early days. Under Sanjay's leadership, I believe SanDisk will continue to grow and prosper in the coming years. The management transition is going well and I expect 2011 will be another strong year for SanDisk. I will now pass it on to Sanjay."

As expected, the mobile market remains the key driver of the company's revenue in the third quarter and it represented half of our total quarter's revenue mix. Our top five customers in the third quarter were all in the mobile phone end market. We are particularly pleased with the strong growth of our embedded products business during the quarter. 
With an increasing number of handsets with our iNANDs for embedded storage going into production, iNAND units sold increased by more than 100% from Q2 levels. Our embedded products, including iNANDs, made up nearly 30% of our OEM revenues, up from just under 20% in Q2. 
Furthermore, strong focus on customer qualification and adoption of our FC-based iNAND products are starting to pay off and certain handsets with FCI NAND embedded are now starting production. Our iNAND product line is also starting to generate design wins in numerous tablet SKUs, and we are excited to be part of this rapidly evolving new category. 
Additionally, in the third quarter, we had a successful launch of our embedded solid state dryer, the iSSD with capacity ranging from four to 64 gigabytes and it has a generated a high level of interest from both the PC and non-PC OEMs. We expect this product category to grow in 2011 and beyond.
Retail delivered a solid quarter as total unit sales grew at a healthy double-digit rate on a year-over-year and sequential basis with the average capacity of retail units sold approaching five gigabytes. In North America, we saw the anticipated seasonal lift in USB flash drive sales, primarily driven by the back-to-school season. 
We also saw healthy double-digit revenue growth from the BRIC regions both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. In Europe, despite weak consumer sentiment, our sales grew nicely and we believe increases in channel penetration and strong brand preference are leading to market share gains there.
From an operational standpoint, our fabs completed the transition to 32-nanometer technology. Our high mix of 32-nanometer FC technology in the third quarter enabled us to deliver record product gross margins. We expect to begin volume production of both X2 and X3 memory architectures on our 24-nanometer technology in the fourth quarter. 
I would like to make a few comments about the pricing environment. Industry pricing trends began to soften in the second half of Q3 in certain segments. We believe that this is primarily due to pockets of demand, supply imbalances caused by low grade TLC, meaning competitor's three level cell NAND and early production of 2x nanometer products from other suppliers that are not qualified by large OEMs. 
We believe that this low grade pricing impacted certain parts of our OEM business, specifically white label cards and wafers, while we choose not to compete at some of these prices with our high-quality X3. A brief update on fab capacity. The final phase of fab four expansion is underway and we expect the facility to attain its full capacity in mid-2011. Regarding Fab 5, we continue to proceed with caution and have not made the final decision regarding the NAND start date or the days of expansion. 
To summarize, we are very pleased with our third quarter execution and performance. The fundamental growth drivers for NAND flash remain firmly in place and I look forward to providing you an update on our fourth quarter results and future outlook early next year. I will now hand the call over to Judy."

With third quarter revenue growth of 32% year-over-year and operating margins of 35% on a GAAP basis and 37% non-GAAP, I believe our performance stands out even within a favorable NAND industry environment. Our revenue of $1.234 billi",1264,"Thank you, Sanjay. With third quarter revenue growth of 32% year-over-year and operating margins of 35% on a GAAP basis and 37% non-GAAP, I believe our performance stands out even within a favorable NAND industry environment. 
Our revenue of $1.234 billion within the higher end of the range we predicted in July with both product revenue and license and royalty revenue coming in as expected. Our product revenue for the third quarter shifted a bit toward retail with a mix of 62% OEM and 38% retail. Our ASP per gigabyte declined a modest 5% with our prices mostly firm through August and some price reductions in September. 
Our Q3 gigabyte sold grew 8% sequentially and 71% year-over-year. And on a year-to-date basis, our gigabyte sold have grown 84%. In Q3, we experienced solid retail growth both sequentially and year-over-year in Americas, Europe and Asia, with overall retail revenue of 13% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. Our retail channels delivered sequential unit and revenue growth in all key end markets including mobile, imaging, USB, audio video and gaming with the strongest retail growth coming from USB for back-to-school and for mobile products. 
Our OEM revenue was flat sequentially and up 55% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, OEM revenue did grow for mobile products but was offset by a reduction in other product categories primarily white label cards and wafers. Across all channels, our third quarter revenue by end market came 50% from the mobile market, 22% up from imaging, 10% from USB's, 10% from other product markets and 8% from license and royalty revenue. 
Our product gross margins increased six percentage points sequentially to 48%, our highest ever product gross margin. With our product cost per gigabyte improving 13% sequentially compared to only a 5% price decline. Our cost decline was stronger than expected, due primarily to higher 32-nanometer yields and rapid transition to 32-nanometer X3. X3 memory continued to account for more than half of our shipments and non-captive memory was used for only 1% of our shipments. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses grew $13 million sequentially with the growth predominantly in R&D. Sales and marketing expenses were down slightly sequentially as certain expenses we had anticipated in Q3 moved to Q4. Our non-GAAP other income of $15 million included gains of $8 million related to foreign exchange and the sale of certain investments. Our expected non-GAAP tax rate for the year has come down to 35% and this reduced rate combined the certain onetime items resulted in a third quarter non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 34%.
On the balance sheet, cash and short and long term marketable securities increased sequentially by $1.3 billion to over $5 billion. Deducting the maturity value of our convertible debt securities, our net cash is a record $2.9 billion. Cash increases during Q3 included $878 million from our convertible debt financing, $379 million of cash flow from operations, $60 million of excess cash returned from the Flash Partners joint venture and $23 million from employee options and the employee Stock purchase plan. We utilized $22 million of cash for non-fab capital purchases. 
Free cash flow for Q3 was $416 million, bringing the year-to-date free cash flow to over $1.1 billion. SanDisk's portion of Fab 3 and Fab 4 investments on a year-to-date basis has been approximately $615 million, with zero cash infusion to the joint ventures.
Total capital investments, both fab and non-fab are $675 million on a year-to-date basis. Our off balance sheet equipment lease guarantees stand at $891 million at the end of the third quarter, reflecting a reduction of $125 million from Q3 payments, partially offset by a $50 million increase due to the appreciation of the yen in the third quarter. 
Inventory on our balance sheet increased $33 million to $527 million, primarily due to the appreciation of the yen. Measured on a petabyte basis, our SanDisk-owned inventory remains lean at approximately eight basis points. And retail owned channel inventory is also on the low side ending the quarter at a global six weeks. 
I'll now turn to forward-looking commentary. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance are posted on our website. As we forecast Q4, we believe that demand for NAND is fundamentally strong with the strongest growth drivers being the secular trends in mobile phones and tablets and growth from these end markets primarily shows up in our OEM business. 
We believe that macroeconomic weakness, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, continues to limit growth in our retail demand. However, consumers are still buying as seen in our Q3 retail results and we expect increased retail demand in Q4 for the holiday season. 
So in terms of unit and petabyte demand, we expect good growth from both our OEM and retail channels in the fourth quarter. On the pricing front, we do expect higher price decline in our Q4 than in our Q3 and we have already made certain price adjustments. Taking into account these factors, we expect fourth quarter total revenue to be between $1.25 billion and $1.325 billion and within this total Q4 revenue, we forecast license and royalty revenue between $85 million in $90 million. This fourth quarter forecast would lead to full-year revenue between $4.75 billion and $4.825 billion in the middle of our July forecast of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion.
Turning to gross margin. There are three key factors that we expect will lead to lower gross margin in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. First, we expect a higher rate of price decline. Second, the yen has depreciated relative to the dollar by approximately 7% since the beginning of our third quarter to present. This increases the dollar cost of the wafers we purchased in the last quarter and these wafers will be reflected in our fourth quarter sales. 
And last, with the 32-nanometer transition completed and more non-captive purchases in Q4, we will see less cost reduction in Q4 as compared to Q3. Our forecasted non-GAAP product gross margin for Q4 is between 39% and 42%, yielding a total non-GAAP gross margin, including license and royalty of 43% to 46%. To put this in perspective, our 32-nanometer transition was faster with higher yields than expected, which accelerated some of our planned second half cost reductions into Q3. Our guidance for Q4 leads to a second half product gross margin above the estimate I've provided in July.
We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses between $205 million and $210 million with increases primarily in R&D and in sales and marketing for seasonal retail marketing programs. Our Q4 forecast for non-GAAP other income is approximately $10 million. And we estimate a non-GAAP tax rate of 34% including some onetime benefits. On a GAAP basis, there is the possibility that we will release a substantial portion of our tax valuation allowances in the fourth quarter.
Our total capital investment forecast for fab and non-fab purchases remains at approximately $1.1 billion for 2010, meaning that the investment level in Q4 is estimated at approximately $425 million, reflecting investments for both the 24-nanometer transition and Fab 4 expansion. 
The estimated fourth quarter cash requirements for these investments is expected to be approximately $75 million in loans to the fab joint ventures and approximately $30 million for non-fab purchases. Given this, the fourth quarter should be another good quarter for free cash flow. 
In summary, our third quarter results were outstanding and our fourth quarter gross margins and operating margins are forecasted to be very attractive. We will now open the call for your questions."

And I think that going with the standards of notebook PC that has nothing but flash memory, I think it's going to force competitors to much more seriously go in that direction. But we all know that the real driver for mass adoption of flash memory SSD in these type of notebook PCs is very much -- we need to get to a lower cost and that will happen, I believe. Tablets is a different matter. This is really a product category that came out of nowhere. Never was expected to be where it is today even just six months ago and the nice thing about tablets, almost by definition, 10-hour operation, very thin, lightweight, none of the tablets anymore -- actually none of the tablets are designed to use hard disk drives. That was not the case for netbook PCs where we all expected netbook PCs to be, primarily, with flash memory SSD but PSSD, but in fact, turned out to be hard disk drive based. So tablet PC is to the extent that they cannibalized notebook PCs, that's good news for us and for the industry because notebook PCs really are not, today, using SSD to any large extent. As where tablet PCs, to the extent that they cannibalize notebook PCs that could use flash for all industries and certainly for ourselves."

Of course, other people think the same of theirs way and are entitled to that. But Toshiba and SanDisk combined generate about 40% of the world output and our own quality standards are very high as we penetrate more and more OEM business, OEMs major OEMs, have very high standards for quality. And we have really, to a large extent, stayed away from playing in these low quality, low prices markets. Now I've also said many times, that I believe it's very important for the industry to have continuos price reductions that are in-line with cost reductions. The industry has had the benefit of really two generations of technology from the 43-nanometer to the 32-nanometer and next year, 24, 27 with very, very substantial cost reductions that are leading to the very excellent gross margins, which has been wonderful for stable pricing and so on. On the other hand, there's no question about it that some markets do require, like SSD, require some price reductions that take advantage of these cost reductions and I used to accelerate these new markets as well as broadened appeal to a new strata of customers. So I think, price reductions like we said this year, we think the industry total price reduction year-to-year is about 20%. That's very unusual. It has helped the industry recover it's health but the cost reductions really do allow us and the industry, I believe, in 2011 to get closer to what some of these new markets need to have. So in general, actually I feel very good about our ability and for the industry to continue cost reductions through technology, through execution of our 24-nanometer with 3-bits-per-cell and we expected this will allow us to be a very competitive player in these new markets in 2011."

So that impacted somewhat our bit growth there. Also, I'll also mention that our bit growth and OEM in the third quarter was also impacted somewhat by the fact that there were some non-memory component shortages early in the third quarter that limited somewhat the shipment of certain handsets.

This is the last quarterly call that I will address here as SanDisk Chairman and CEO. Therefore, rather than discussing our business in the third and fourth quarter, allow me to take this opportunity to review",1158,"Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. This is the last quarterly call that I will address here as SanDisk Chairman and CEO. Therefore, rather than discussing our business in the third and fourth quarter, allow me to take this opportunity to review our most recent past and where I see our opportunities and challenges in the coming years.
Sanjay and Judy will discuss our Q3 results and our expectations for Q4. In the past three years, we experienced the industry's most severe downturn followed by strong recovery. We experienced six consecutive weak quarters generating a substantial operating loss followed by six consecutive quarters of remarkable recovery. 
The current recovery continues even in the face of adverse macroeconomic conditions in the U.S., much of Europe and Japan. For SanDisk, our cumulative non-GAAP operating profit for the six quarters ending this year will be more than 2.5x greater than the cumulative non-GAAP operating loss in the preceding six quarters. 
We believe our industry is driven by several powerful secular trends that point to sustainable profitable growth for us in the coming years. First, in the more developed economies, growth for us continues to be driven by the phenomenal rise of the mobile Internet and social networks that fueled a surging demand for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, that in turn drive strong demand for flash memory. 
The second major secular force is the surging consumer middle-class in emerging countries such as China, India, Latin America, Middle East and Africa. We are directing substantial resources to expand our businesses in these emerging countries and in the coming years, we are encouraged by our gains to date.
The past downturn has taught the industry that even relatively small in balances, either up or down, between the managed supply and disproportionately amplify market volatility. I have often said that the non-industry is self-correcting and in the current recovery, the industry did an excellent job of adjusting to compensate for the excessive capital investments that were made in the 2005 through 2008 timeframe. 
Industry cycles, are a fact of life in our business and even severe downturns are in fact, quite manageable provided you have a solid balance sheet, competitive technology and manufacturing base and diversified sales channels so that you're not overly reliant on any single channel or any single local economy. 
New found capacity decisions are made 18 months ahead of production and even on the best laid plans, it's not easy to achieve and maintain a healthy balance. Some products such as the iPhone, the iPad and the Kindle come out of nowhere and very quickly enter hockey-stick growth trajectory that creates a whole new market category, while other products such solid state drives, SSD, can take much longer to develop. Our focus in SanDisk has been, and will continue to be, long-term value creation, where we do our best to balance growth with profitability and cash flow.
Turning now to flash technology. Non-flash has confounded many skeptics as it marches with confidence to mass production at the 24 through 27-nanometer technology node a fact that seemed iffy to many just two years ago. An important element in the success of this rapid scaling has been the all but mandatory adoption of managed NAND, requiring sophisticated controllers to compensate for deteriorating raw NAND reliability and performance. This is amply demonstrated for 3-bits-per-cell, X3 NAND, where the market is witnessing a wide variability in performance and reliability between the X3 product from different NAND suppliers. 
I believe that SanDisk is uniquely well-positioned in this space because from day one, we stayed true to delivering system flash and managed non-solutions, and this is our third generation X3 in production, where we have optimized our chip designs and perfected our controllers to deliver a solid solution. 
We now expect NAND to scale down to below 20 nanometers in the next few years. This will likely be achieved with existing lithography tools running in existing and new advanced non-fab and this bodes well for our Yokkaichi fabs as they become more fully depreciated in the coming years. 
As we push the roadmap even further, extreme ultraviolet, UV lithography tools will become indispensable and I expect the transition to UV to be spread over a number of years and to be quite challenging for the industry. With regards to post non-technology alternatives, I remain optimistic about our three-dimensional 3D read/writes diode rates, currently under development with our partner Toshiba. As I've said previously, I expect highly skilled NAND and post-NAND technology to happily coexist over the next decade.
Moving to IT. Our flash memory and system portfolio and know-how are now dominated by many strong second-generation patents. These patents cover managed NAND, multi-bits NAND, advanced NAND device, process and memory chip design patents, solid state disk, secure portable content, strong air correcting algorithms, high-speed flash caching, wear out optimization, application Adaptive storage, 3D memories and so on. We believe this IP will provide us substantial leverage in the years ahead.
Turning now to our target markets. We have previously spoken about the legacy consumer markets, the mobile market and computing, including SSD and cloud storage. Of these, we believe that mobile continues to present us the greatest opportunities in the coming years. The more than 1.2 billion handsets that will be sold this year drove any other consumer or computing market. Increasingly, these are smartphones and tablets, which are morphing into sophisticated portable PCs that are always connected and that increasingly require more flash storage to support the explosion in third-party mobile apps and user content. 
Handsets are also rapidly assuming the role of the ultimate portable convergence device first with music and cameras then with video games, video capture, GPS and apps. As for SSD, these are transforming Enterprise Storage as we speak and we are within one or two generations from their mass adoption in notebook PCs and other sim clients. 
To be a market leader in SSD, you need to have access to leading-edge, high-quality flash, shippable in high volumes at a competitive cost, applying sophisticated know how for managing highly skilled NAND, having the recorded patents and building on strong OEM credentials. SanDisk has it all and we are working diligently to gain leadership position in this space. 
As for our balance sheet, the numbers speaks for themselves and I believe that SanDisk is exceptionally well-equipped to execute our long term global growth strategy. Last but not the least, our people. SanDisk people, the ""Can Do"" team, driven by passion for innovation with a consistent track record of flawless execution through good and bad times. 
SanDisk technologists and engineers retain the deep technology DNA from our early days. Under Sanjay's leadership, I believe SanDisk will continue to grow and prosper in the coming years. The management transition is going well and I expect 2011 will be another strong year for SanDisk. I will now pass it on to Sanjay."

As expected, the mobile market remains the key driver of the company's revenue in the third quarter and it represented half of our total quarter's revenue mix.

As expected, the mobile market remains the key driver of the company's revenue in the third quarter and it represented half of our total quarter's revenue mix. Our top five customers in the third quarter were all in the mobile phone end market. We are particularly pleased with the strong growth of our embedded products business during the quarter. 
With an increasing number of handsets with our iNANDs for embedded storage going into production, iNAND units sold increased by more than 100% from Q2 levels. Our embedded products, including iNANDs, made up nearly 30% of our OEM revenues, up from just under 20% in Q2. 
Furthermore, strong focus on customer qualification and adoption of our FC-based iNAND products are starting to pay off and certain handsets with FCI NAND embedded are now starting production. Our iNAND product line is also starting to generate design wins in numerous tablet SKUs, and we are excited to be part of this rapidly evolving new category. 
Additionally, in the third quarter, we had a successful launch of our embedded solid state dryer, the iSSD with capacity ranging from four to 64 gigabytes and it has a generated a high level of interest from both the PC and non-PC OEMs. We expect this product category to grow in 2011 and beyond.
Retail delivered a solid quarter as total unit sales grew at a healthy double-digit rate on a year-over-year and sequential basis with the average capacity of retail units sold approaching five gigabytes. In North America, we saw the anticipated seasonal lift in USB flash drive sales, primarily driven by the back-to-school season. 
We also saw healthy double-digit revenue growth from the BRIC regions both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. In Europe, despite weak consumer sentiment, our sales grew nicely and we believe increases in channel penetration and strong brand preference are leading to market share gains there.
From an operational standpoint, our fabs completed the transition to 32-nanometer technology. Our high mix of 32-nanometer FC technology in the third quarter enabled us to deliver record product gross margins. We expect to begin volume production of both X2 and X3 memory architectures on our 24-nanometer technology in the fourth quarter. 
I would like to make a few comments about the pricing environment. Industry pricing trends began to soften in the second half of Q3 in certain segments. We believe that this is primarily due to pockets of demand, supply imbalances caused by low grade TLC, meaning competitor's three level cell NAND and early production of 2x nanometer products from other suppliers that are not qualified by large OEMs. 
We believe that this low grade pricing impacted certain parts of our OEM business, specifically white label cards and wafers, while we choose not to compete at some of these prices with our high-quality X3. A brief update on fab capacity. The final phase of fab four expansion is underway and we expect the facility to attain its full capacity in mid-2011. Regarding Fab 5, we continue to proceed with caution and have not made the final decision regarding the NAND start date or the days of expansion. 
To summarize, we are very pleased with our third quarter execution and performance. The fundamental growth drivers for NAND flash remain firmly in place and I look forward to providing you an update on our fourth quarter results and future outlook early next year. I will now hand the call over to Judy."

With third quarter revenue growth of 32% year-over-year and operating margins of 35% on a GAAP basis and 37% non-GAAP, I believe our performance stands out even within a favorable NAND industry environment. 
Our revenue of $1.234 billion within the higher end of the range we predicted in July with both product revenue and license and royalty revenue coming in as expected. Our product revenue for the third quarter shifted a bit toward retail with a mix of 62% OEM and 38% retail. Our ASP per gigabyte declined a modest 5% with our prices mostly firm through August and some price reductions in September. 
Our Q3 gigabyte sold grew 8% sequentially and 71% year-over-year. And on a year-to-date basis, our gigabyte sold have grown 84%. In Q3, we experienced solid retail growth both sequentially and year-over-year in Americas, Europe and Asia, with overall retail revenue of 13% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. Our retail channels delivered sequential unit and revenue growth in all key end markets including mobile, imaging, USB, audio video and gaming with the strongest retail growth coming from USB for back-to-school and for mobile products. 
Our OEM revenue was flat sequentially and up 55% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, OEM revenue did grow for mobile products but was offset by a reduction in other product categories primarily white label cards and wafers. Across all channels, our third quarter revenue by end market came 50% from the mobile market, 22% up from imaging, 10% from USB's, 10% from other product markets and 8% from license and royalty revenue. 
Our product gross margins increased six percentage points sequentially to 48%, our highest ever product gross margin. With our product cost per gigabyte improving 13% sequentially compared to only a 5% price decline. Our cost decline was stronger than expected, due primarily to higher 32-nanometer yields and rapid transition to 32-nanometer X3. X3 memory continued to account for more than half of our shipments and non-captive memory was used for only 1% of our shipments. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses grew $13 million sequentially with the growth predominantly in R&D. Sales and marketing expenses were down slightly sequentially as certain expenses we had anticipated in Q3 moved to Q4. Our non-GAAP other income of $15 million included gains of $8 million related to foreign exchange and the sale of certain investments. Our expected non-GAAP tax rate for the year has come down to 35% and this reduced rate combined the certain onetime items resulted in a third quarter non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 34%.
On the balance sheet, cash and short and long term marketable securities increased sequentially by $1.3 billion to over $5 billion. Deducting the maturity value of our convertible debt securities, our net cash is a record $2.9 billion. Cash increases during Q3 included $878 million from our convertible debt financing, $379 million of cash flow from operations, $60 million of excess cash returned from the Flash Partners joint venture and $23 million from employee options and the employee Stock purchase plan. We utilized $22 million of cash for non-fab capital purchases. 
Free cash flow for Q3 was $416 million, bringing the year-to-date free cash flow to over $1.1 billion. SanDisk's portion of Fab 3 and Fab 4 investments on a year-to-date basis has been approximately $615 million, with zero cash infusion to the joint ventures.
Total capital investments, both fab and non-fab are $675 million on a year-to-date basis. Our off balance sheet equipment lease guarantees stand at $891 million at the end of the third quarter, reflecting a reduction of $125 million from Q3 payments, partially offset by a $50 million increase due to the appreciation of the yen in the third quarter. 
Inventory on our balance sheet increased $33 million to $527 million, primarily due to the appreciation of the yen. Measured on a petabyte basis, our SanDisk-owned inventory remains lean at approximately eight basis points. And retail owned channel inventory is also on the low side ending the quarter at a global six weeks. 
I'll now turn to forward-looking commentary. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance are posted on our website. As we forecast Q4, we believe that demand for NAND is fundamentally strong with the strongest growth drivers being the secular trends in mobile phones and tablets and growth from these end markets primarily shows up in our OEM business. 
We believe that macroeconomic weakness, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, continues to limit growth in our retail demand. However, consumers are still buying as seen in our Q3 retail results and we expect increased retail demand in Q4 for the holiday season. 
So in terms of unit and petabyte demand, we expect good growth from both our OEM and retail channels in the fourth quarter. On the pricing front, we do expect higher price decline in our Q4 than in our Q3 and we have already made certain price adjustments. Taking into account these factors, we expect fourth quarter total revenue to be between $1.25 billion and $1.325 billion and within this total Q4 revenue, we forecast license and royalty revenue between $85 million in $90 million. This fourth quarter forecast would lead to full-year revenue between $4.75 billion and $4.825 billion in the middle of our July forecast of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion.
Turning to gross margin. There are three key factors that we expect will lead to lower gross margin in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. First, we expect a higher rate of price decline. Second, the yen has depreciated relative to the dollar by approximately 7% since the beginning of our third quarter to present. This increases the dollar cost of the wafers we purchased in the last quarter and these wafers will be reflected in our fourth quarter sales. 
And last, with the 32-nanometer transition completed and more non-captive purchases in Q4, we will see less cost reduction in Q4 as compared to Q3. Our forecasted non-GAAP product gross margin for Q4 is between 39% and 42%, yielding a total non-GAAP gross margin, including license and royalty of 43% to 46%. To put this in perspective, our 32-nanometer transition was faster with higher yields than expected, which accelerated some of our planned second half cost reductions into Q3. Our guidance for Q4 leads to a second half product gross margin above the estimate I've provided in July.
We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses between $205 million and $210 million with increases primarily in R&D and in sales and marketing for seasonal retail marketing programs. Our Q4 forecast for non-GAAP other income is approximately $10 million. And we estimate a non-GAAP tax rate of 34% including some onetime benefits. On a GAAP basis, there is the possibility that we will release a substantial portion of our tax valuation allowances in the fourth quarter.
Our total capital investment forecast for fab and non-fab purchases remains at approximately $1.1 billion for 2010, meaning that the investment level in Q4 is estimated at approximately $425 million, reflecting investments for both the 24-nanometer transition and Fab 4 expansion. 
The estimated fourth quarter cash requirements for these investments is expected to be approximately $75 million in loans to the fab joint ventures and approximately $30 million for non-fab purchases. Given this, the fourth quarter should be another good quarter for free cash flow. 
In summary, our third quarter results were outstanding and our fourth quarter gross margins and operating margins are forecasted to be very attractive. We will now open the call for your questions."

And I think that going with the standards of notebook PC that has nothing but flash memory, I think it's going to force competitors to much more seriously go in that direction. But we all know that the real driver for mass adoption of flash memory SSD in these type of notebook PCs is very much -- we need to get to a lower cost and that will happen, I believe. Tablets is a different matter. This is really a product category that came out of nowhere. Never was expected to be where it is today even just six months ago and the nice thing about tablets, almost by definition, 10-hour operation, very thin, lightweight, none of the tablets anymore -- actually none of the tablets are designed to use hard disk drives. That was not the case for netbook PCs where we all expected netbook PCs to be, primarily, with flash memory SSD but PSSD, but in fact, turned out to be hard disk drive based. So tablet PC is to the extent that they cannibalized notebook PCs, that's good news for us and for the industry because notebook PCs really are not, today, using SSD to any large extent.

Of course, other people think the same of theirs way and are entitled to that. But Toshiba and SanDisk combined generate about 40% of the world output and our own quality standards are very high as we penetrate more and more OEM business, OEMs major OEMs, have very high standards for quality. And we have really, to a large extent, stayed away from playing in these low quality, low prices markets. Now I've also said many times, that I believe it's very important for the industry to have continuos price reductions that are in-line with cost reductions. The industry has had the benefit of really two generations of technology from the 43-nanometer to the 32-nanometer and next year, 24, 27 with very, very substantial cost reductions that are leading to the very excellent gross margins, which has been wonderful for stable pricing and so on. On the other hand, there's no question about it that some markets do require, like SSD, require some price reductions that take advantage of these cost reductions and I used to accelerate these new markets as well as broadened appeal to a new strata of customers. So I think, price reductions like we said this year, we think the industry total price reduction year-to-year is about 20%. That's very unusual. It has helped the industry recover it's health but the cost reductions really do allow us and the industry, I believe, in 2011 to get closer to what some of these new markets need to have. So in general, actually I feel very good about our ability and for the industry to continue cost reductions through technology, through execution of our 24-nanometer with 3-bits-per-cell and we expected this will allow us to be a very competitive player in these new markets in 2011."

In the third quarter, we actually were quite pleased with the bit growth in the retail part of our business. We saw strong bit growth sequentially in the retail business. In the OEM business, we saw more modest bit growth but we had good bit growth overall in the mobile handset part of our OEM business, and that was offset somewhat by the fact that we chose not to participate, as Sanjay described, in some of the low-price business in the white label card and also in the Wafer business. So that impacted somewhat our bit growth there. Also, I'll also mention that our bit growth and OEM in the third quarter was also impacted somewhat by the fact that there were some non-memory component shortages early in the third quarter that limited somewhat the shipment of certain handsets. And when those handsets shipments were limited, that also then limited somewhat our sales of NAND into those handsets. We believe that, that issue has been solved in the marketplace and that's not an issue in the fourth quarter. So turning to the fourth quarter, in the fourth quarter, we believe that we will have strong bit growth, both in the retail part of our business and in the OEM part of our business and so, we're not giving any specific guidance but I think you are thinking about it correctly as you try to model your bit growth for the year."

Therefore, rather than discussing our business in the third and fourth quarter, allow me to take this opportunity to review our most recent past and where I see our opportunities and challenges in the coming years. Sanjay and Judy will discuss our Q3 results and our expectations for Q4.
In the past three years, we experienced the industry’s most severe downturn followed by a strong recovery. We experienced six consecutive weak quarters generating a substantial operating loss, followed by six consecutive quarters of remarkable recovery. The current recovery continues even in the face of adverse macroeconomic in the US, much of Europe and Japan.
For SanDisk, our cumulative non-GAAP operating profit for the six quarters ending this year will be more than 2.5 times greater than the cumulative non-GAAP operating loss in the preceding six quarters.
We believe our industry is driven by several powerful secular trends that point to sustainable profitable growth for us in the coming years. First, in the more developed economies growth for us continues to be driven by the phenomenal rise of the mobile internet and social networks that fuel the surging demand for mobile devices such as Smartphones and tablets that in turn drive strong demand for flash memory.
The second major secular force is the surging consumer middle class in emerging countries such as China, India, Latin America, Middle East and Africa. We are directing substantial resources to expand our businesses in these emerging countries and in the coming years we are encouraged by our gains to-date.
The past downturn has taught the industry that even relatively small imbalances, either up or down, between demand and supply can disproportionately amplify market volatility. I have often said that the NAND industry is self-correcting and in the current recovery the industry did an excellent job of adjusting to compensate for the excessive CapEx investments that were made in the 2005 through 2008 timeframe.
Industry cycles are a fact of life in our business and even severe downturns are in fact quite manageable provided you have solid balance sheet competitive technology and manufacturing base and diversified sales channels so that you’re not overly reliant on any single channel or any single local economy.
New fab capacity decisions are made 18 months ahead of production and even under best laid plans it is now easy to achieve and maintain a healthy balance. Some products such as the iPhone, the iPad and the Kindle come out of nowhere and very quickly enter hockey stick growth trajectory that creates a whole new market category while other products such as solid state drives, SSD, can take much longer to develop. Our focus at SanDisk has been and will continue to be long-term value creation but we do our best to balance growth with profitability and cash flow.
Turning now to flash technology. NAND flash has confounded many skeptics as it marches with confidences to mass production at a 24 through 27-nanometer technology node, a fact that seemed iffy to manage just two years ago. An important element in the success of this rapid scaling has been the all but mandatory adoption of managed NAND requiring sophisticated controllers to compensate for deteriorating [raw] NAND reliability and performance.
This is amply demonstrated for 3-bits per cell X3 NAND where the market is witnessing a wide variability in performance and reliability between the X3 product from different NAND suppliers. I believe that SanDisk is uniquely well-positioned in this space because from day 1 we stayed true to delivering system flash and managed NAND solutions and this is our third generation X3 in production where we have optimized our chip designs and perfected our controllers to deliver a solid solution.
We now expect NAND to scale down to below 20 nanometers in the next few years. This will likely be achieved with existing lithography tools running in existing and new advanced NAND fab and this bodes well for our Yokkaichi fab as they become more fully depreciated in the coming years.
As we push the roadmap even further, extreme ultraviolet, EUV lithography tools will become indispensable and I expect the transition to EUV to be spread over a number of years and to be quite challenging for the industry.
With regard to post NAND technology alternatives, I remain optimistic about our three-dimensional 3D Read/Write directories currently under development with our partner, Toshiba. As I have said previously, I expect highly-scaled NAND and post-NAND technology to happily co-exist over the next decade.
Moving to IT, our flash memory and system portfolios and know-how are now dominated by many strong second-generation patents. These patents cover managed NAND, multi-bits NAND, advanced NAND device, process and memory chip design patents, solid-state disk, secure portable content, strong error-correcting algorithms, high-speed flash caching, wear-out optimization, application adaptive storage, 3D memories and so on. We believe this IT will provide us substantial leverage in the years ahead.
Turning now to our target markets, we have previously spoken about the legacy consumer markets, the mobile market and computing including SSD and cloud storage. Of these, we believe that mobile continues to present us the greatest opportunities in the coming years. The more than 1.2 billion handsets that will be sold this year dwarf any other consumer or computing market.
Increasingly, these are Smartphones and tablets which are morphing into sophisticated portable PCs that are always connected and that increasingly require more flash storage to support the explosion in third-party mobile apps and user content. Handsets are also rapidly assuming the role of the ultimate portable convergence device first with music and cameras, then with video games, video capture, GPS and Apps.
As for SSD, these are transforming enterprise storage as we speak and we are within one or two generations from the mass adoption in notebook PCs and other thin clients. To be a market leader in SSD, you need to have access to leading edge, high quality flash, shippable in high volumes at a competitive cost, applying sophisticated know-how for managing highly scaled NAND, having the requisite patents and building on strong OEM credentials. SanDisk has it all and we are working diligently to gain leadership position in this space.
As for our balance sheet, the numbers speaks for themselves, and I believe that Sandak is exceptionally well-equipped to execute our long term global growth strategy. Last but not the need least, our people. SanDisk people the can-do team driven by passion for innovation with a consistent track record of flawless execution through good and bad times. SanDisk’s technologies and engineers retained deep technology DNA from our early days.
Under Sanjay’s leadership, I believe SanDisk will continue to grow and prosper in the coming years. The management transition is going well and I expect 2011 will be another strong year for SanDisk.
I will now pass it on to Sanjay.

We are p",579,"As expected the mobile market remained the key driver of the Company’s revenue in the third quarter and has represented half of our total product revenue mix.
Our top five customers in the third quarter were all in the mobile phone end market. We are particularly pleased with the strong growth of our embedded products business during the quarter. With an increasing number of handsets with our iNANDs for embedded storage going into production, iNAND units sold increased more than 100% from Q2 levels.
Our embedded products including iNANDs made up nearly 30% of our OEM revenues, up from just under 20% in Q2. Furthermore, strong focus on customer qualification and adoption of our X3 based iNAND products is starting to pay off as certain handsets with our X3 iNAND embedded are now starting production.
Our iNAND product line is also starting to generate design wins in numerous tablet SKUs and we are excited to be part of this rapidly evolving new product category. Additionally, in the third quarter, we had a successful launch of our embedded solid state drive, the iSSD with capacities ranging from 4 to 64 gigabytes and it has generated a high level of interest from both the PC and non-PC OEMs. We expect this product category to grow in 2011 and beyond.
Retail delivered a solid quarter as total unit sales grew at a healthy double digit rate on a year-over-year basis and sequential basis with the average capacity of retail units sold approaching 5 gigabytes. In North America, we saw the anticipated seasonal lift in USB flash drive sales primarily driven by back-to-school season.
We also saw a healthy double-digit revenue growth from BRIC regions, both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. In Europe, despite weak consumer sentiments our sales grew nicely and we believe increases in channel penetration and strong brand preference are leading to market share gains there.
From an operation standpoint, our fabs completed the transition to 32-nanometer technology is. A high mix of 32-nanometer X3 technology in the third quarter enabled us to deliver record product gross margins. We expect to begin volume production of both X2 and X3 memory architectures on our 24-nanometer technology in the fourth quarter.
I would like to make a few comments about the pricing environment. Industry pricing trends began to soften in the second half of Q3 in certain segments. We believe that this is primarily due to pockets of demand, supply, imbalances caused by low grade TLC, meaning competitors three-level cell NAND and early production of 2X nanometer products from other suppliers that are not qualified by large OEMs.
We believe that this low grade pricing impacted certain parts of our OEM business, specifically white label cards and wafers where we chose not to compete at some of these prices with our high quality X3.
A brief update on Fab capacity. The final phase of Fab 4 expansion is underway and we expect the facility to attain its full capacity in mid 2011. Regarding Fab 5, we continue to proceed with caution and have not made the final decision regarding ramp start date or the base of expansions.
To summarize, we are very pleased with our third quarter execution and performance. The fundamental growth drivers for NAND flash remained firmly in place and I look forward to providing you an update on our fourth quarter results and future outlook earlier next year. 
I will now hand the call over to Judy.

Our revenue of $1.234 billion was in the higher end of the range we predicted in July, with both product revenue and license and royalty revenue coming in as expected. Our product revenue for the third quarter shifted a bit toward retail, with a mix of 62% OEM and 38% retail. Our ASP per gigabyte declined a modest 5% with our prices mostly firm through August and some price reductions in September.
Our Q3 gigabytes sold grew 8% sequentially and 71% year-over-year and on a year-to-date basis, our gigabytes sold have grown 84%. In Q3, we experienced solid retail growth both sequentially and year-over-year in the Americas, Europe, and Asia with overall retail revenue of 13% sequentially and 20% year-over-year.
Our retail channels delivered sequential unit and revenue growth in all key end markets, including mobile, imaging, USB, audio/video, and gaming with the strongest retail growth coming from USB for back-to-school and from mobile products.
Our OEM revenue was flat sequentially and up 55% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, OEM revenue did grow from mobile products but was offset by a reduction in other product categories, primarily white label cards and wafers.
Across all channels, our third quarter revenue by end market came 50% from the mobile market, 22% from imaging, 10% from USBs, 10% from other product markets, and 8% from license and royalty revenue.
Our product gross margin increased 6 percentage points sequentially to 48%, our highest ever product gross margin with our products cost per gigabyte improving 13% sequentially compared to only a 5% price decline. Our cost decline was stronger than expected due primarily to higher 32-nanometer yields and rapid transition to 32-nanometer X3.
X3 memory continued to account to more than half of our shipments and non-captive memory was used for only 1% of our shipments. Non-GAAP operating expenses grew $13 million sequentially with the growth predominantly in R&D. Sales and marketing expenses were down slightly sequentially as certain we had anticipated in Q3 moved to Q4.
Our non-GAAP other income of $15 million included gains of $8 million related to foreign exchange and the sale of certain investments. Our expected non-GAAP tax rate for the year has come down to 35% and this reduced rate combined with certain one-time items resulted in a third quarter non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 34%.
On the balance sheet, cash and short and long-term marketable securities increased sequentially by $1.3 billion to over $5 billion. Deducting the maturity value of our convertible debt securities, our net cash is a record $2.9 billion. Cash increases during Q3 included $878 million from our convertible debt financing, $379 million of cash flow from operations, $60 million of excess cash returned from the Flash Partners joint venture and $23 million from employee options and the employee stock purchase plan.
We utilized $22 million of cash for non-fab capital purchases. Free cash flow for Q3 was $416 million, bringing the year-to-date free cash flow to over $1.1 billion. SanDisk’s portion of Fab 3 and Fab 4 investments on a year-to-date basis has been approximately $615 million with zero cash infusion to the joint ventures. Total capital investments both Fab and non-Fab are $675 million on a year-to-date basis.
Our off-balance sheet equipment lease guarantees stand at $891 million at the end of the third quarter, reflecting a reduction of $125 million from Q3 payments, partially offset by a $50 million increase due to the appreciation of the yen in the third quarter. Inventory on our balance sheet increased $33 million to $527 million primarily due to the appreciation of the yen.
Measured on a petabyte basis, our SanDisk-owned inventory remains lean at approximately eight weeks and retail-owned channel inventory is also on the low side ending the quarter at a global six weeks.
I will now turn to forward-looking commentary. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance is posted on our website.
As we forecast Q4, we believe that demand for NAND is fundamentally strong with the strongest growth drivers being the secular trends in mobile phones and tablets, and growth from these end markets primarily shows up in our OEM business. We believe macroeconomic weakness, particularly in the US and Europe, continues to limit growth in our retail demand. However, consumers are still buying as seen in our Q3 retail results and we expect increased retail demand in Q4 for the holiday season.
In terms of unit and headed by demand, we expect good growth from both our OEM and retail channels in the fourth quarter. On the pricing front, we do expect higher price decline in our Q4 than in our Q3 and we have already made certain price adjustments.
Taking into account these factors, we expect fourth quarter total revenue to be between $1.25 billion and $1.325 billion, and within this total Q4 revenue, we forecast license and royalty revenue between $85 million and $90 million. This fourth quarter forecast was lead to full year revenue between $4.75 billion and $4.825 billion in the middle of our July forecast of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion.
Turning to gross margin, there are three key factors that we expect will lead to lower gross margin in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. First, we expect the higher rate of price decline. Second, the yen has appreciated relative to the dollar by approximately 7% since the beginning of our third quarter to present. This increases the dollar costs of the wafers we purchased in the last quarter and these wafers will be reflected in our fourth quarter sales.
Last, with the 32-nanometer transition completed and more non-captive purchases in Q4, we will see less cost reduction in Q4 as compared to Q3. Our forecasted non-GAAP product gross margin for Q4 is between 39% and 42%, yielding a total non-GAAP gross margin including licensee and royalty of 43% to 46%. To put this in perspective, our 32-nanometer transition was faster with higher yields than expected, which accelerated some of our planned second half cost reductions into Q3.
Our guidance for Q4 leads to a second half product gross margin above the estimate I provided in July. We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses between $205 million and $210 million, with increases primarily in R&D and in sales and marketing for seasonal retail marketing programs.
Our Q4 forecast for non-GAAP other income is approximately $10 million and we estimate a non-GAAP tax rate of 34%, including some one-time benefits. On a GAAP basis, there is the possibility that we will release a substantial portion of our tax valuation allowances in the fourth quarter.
Our total capital investment forecast for Fab and non-Fab purchases remains at approximately $1.1 billion for 2010, meaning that the investment level in Q4 is estimated at approximately $425 million, reflecting investments for both the 24-nanometer transition and Fab 4 expansion.
The estimated fourth quarter cash equipment for these investments is expected to be approximately $75 million in loans to the Fab joint ventures and approximately $30 million for non-Fab purchases. Given this, the fourth quarter should be another good quarter for free cash flow.
In summary, our third quarter results were outstanding and our fourth quarter gross margins and operating margins are forecasted to be very attractive. We will now open the call for your questions.
Elizabeth, could you poll the callers for questions please?

Apple has done so in the past.
Apple was a first company to introduce PCs without a floppy disk at a time where everybody thought you’ve got to have floppies and I think that this going with a standard notebook PC that has nothing but flash memory, I think is going to force competitors to much more seriously go in that direction, but we all know that the real driver for mass adoption of flash memory, SSD in this type of notebook PCs is very much we need to get to a lower cost and that will happen I believe.
Tablets are, it’s really in different manner. This is really a product category that came out nowhere, it never was expected to be where it is today, even just six months ago and the nice thing about tablets almost by definition, 10-hour operations, very thin light weight, none of the tablets anymore actually none of the tablets are designed to use hard disk drive that was not the case for netbook PCs, where we all expected netbook PCs to be with primarily with flash memory SSD but pSSD but, in fact, turned out to be hard disk drive based.
Tablet PCs to the extend that they cannibalize notebook PCs, that’s good news for us and for the industry because notebook PCs really are not today using SSD to any large extent, whereas tablet PCs to the extent that they cannibalize notebook PCs, that’s good news for flash for all the industry and certainly for ourselves.

So, the full year price decline even with higher price decline in the fourth quarter is going to be quite low in historical terms. In terms of our non-captive for the fourth quarter and assumed in our guidance is that we’ll utilize non-captive in the sort of the low to mid single digit range as a percentage of our total supply.

If to the extent that there is any low grade memory from others that, such as the TLC memory from some competitors or other low grade memory, which may be coming from early 2X nanometer production of others, that does impact some parts of our business but in the third quarter we chose not to compete with our high quality X3 memory with respect to the low pricing that was there from the TLC, the low grade memory of others.

I firmly believe that the combination of Toshiba and SanDisk really have superior NAND technology and products. Of course, other people think the same of theirs and they are entitled to do that. Toshiba and SanDisk combined generate about 40% of world output and our own quality standards are pretty high. As we penetrate more and more OEM business, OEMs, major OEMs, have very high standards for quality and we have really to a large extent stayed away from playing in these low quality, low price markets.
Now, I’ve also said many times that I believe it’s very important for the industry to have continuous price reductions that are in line with cost reductions. The industry has had the benefit of really two generations of technology from the 43-nanometer to the 32 and next year 24, 27, with very, very substantial cost reductions that area leading to the very excellent gross margins which have been wonderful for stable pricing and so on. On the other hand, there is no question about it that some markets do require, like SSD, require some price reductions that take advantage of these cost reductions.
I used to accelerated these new markets as well as broaden our appeal to new strata of customers. So, I think price reductions, like we said, this year we think the industry, total price reduction year-to-year is about 20%, that’s very unusual. It has helped industry recover its health but the cost reductions really do allow us and the industry I believe in 2011 to get closer to what some of these markets need to have. So, in general I feel very good about our ability and I can’t speak for the industry, to continue cost reductions through technology through execution on our 24-nanometer with 3 bits per cell and we expect that this will allow us to be a very competitive player in these new markets in 2011.

We saw a strong bit growth sequentially in the retail business. 
In the OEM business, we saw more modest bit growth, but we had good bit growth overall in the mobile handset part of our OEM business and that was offset somewhat by the fact that we chose not to participate, as Sanjay described, in some of the low-priced business in the white label card and also in the wafer business. So, that impacted somewhat our bit growth there.
I’ve also mentioned that our bit growth in OEM in the third quarter was also impacted somewhat by the fact that there were some non-memory component shortages early in the third quarter that limited somewhat the shipment of certain handsets. When those handset shipments were limited that also then limited somewhat our sales of NAND into those handsets. We believe that that issue has been solved in the marketplace and that’s not an issue in the fourth quarter.

This is the last quarterly call that I will address here as SanDisk Chairman and CEO. Therefore, rather than discussing our business in the third and fourth quarter, allow me to take this opportunity to review",1162,"Thank you, Jay, and good afternoon, everyone. This is the last quarterly call that I will address here as SanDisk Chairman and CEO. Therefore, rather than discussing our business in the third and fourth quarter, allow me to take this opportunity to review our most recent past and where I see our opportunities and challenges in the coming years.
Sanjay and Judy will discuss our Q3 results and our expectations for Q4. In the past three years, we experienced the industry's most severe downturn followed by a strong recovery. We experienced six consecutive weak quarters generating a substantial operating loss followed by six consecutive quarters of remarkable recovery. 
The current recovery continues even in the face of adverse macroeconomic conditions in the U.S., much of Europe and Japan. For SanDisk, our cumulative non-GAAP operating profit for the six quarters ending this year will be more than 2.5x greater than the cumulative non-GAAP operating loss in the preceding six quarters. 
We believe our industry is driven by several powerful secular trends that point to sustainable profitable growth for us in the coming years. First, in the more developed economies, growth for us continues to be driven by the phenomenal rise of the mobile Internet and social networks that fueled a surging demand for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, that in turn drive strong demand for flash memory. 
The second major secular force is the surging consumer middle-class in emerging countries such as China, India, Latin America, Middle East and Africa. We are directing substantial resources to expand our businesses in these emerging countries and in the coming years, we are encouraged by our gains to date.
The past downturn has taught the industry that even relatively small imbalances, either up or down, between demand and supply can disproportionately amplify market volatility. I have often said that the NAND industry is self-correcting and in the current recovery, the industry did an excellent job of adjusting to compensate for the excessive CapEx investments that were made in the 2005 through 2008 timeframe. 
Industry cycles, are a fact of life in our business and even severe downturns are in fact, quite manageable provided you have a solid balance sheet, competitive technology and manufacturing base and diversified sales channels so that you're not overly reliant on any single channel or any single local economy. 
New fab capacity decisions are made 18 months ahead of production and even under the best-laid plans, it's not easy to achieve and maintain a healthy balance. Some products such as the iPhone, the iPad and the Kindle come out of nowhere and very quickly enter hockey-stick growth trajectory that creates a whole new market category, while other products such as solid state drives, SSD, can take much longer to develop. Our focus at SanDisk has been, and will continue to be, long-term value creation, where we do our best to balance growth with profitability and cash flow.
Turning now to flash technology. NAND flash has confounded many skeptics as it marches with confidence to mass production at the 24 through 27-nanometer technology node, a fact that seemed iffy to many just two years ago. An important element in the success of this rapid scaling has been the all but mandatory adoption of managed-NAND, requiring sophisticated controllers to compensate for deteriorating raw NAND reliability and performance. This is amply demonstrated for 3-bits-per-cell, X3 NAND, where the market is witnessing a wide variability in performance and reliability between the X3 product from different NAND suppliers. 
I believe that SanDisk is uniquely well positioned in this space because from day one, we stayed true to delivering system flash and managed-NAND solutions, and this is our third generation X3 in production where we have optimized our chip designs and perfected our controllers to deliver a solid solution. 
We now expect NAND to scale down to below 20 nanometers in the next few years. This will likely be achieved with existing lithography tools running in existing and new advanced NAND fabs, and this bodes well for our Yokkaichi fabs as they become more fully depreciated in the coming years. 
As we push the roadmap even further, Extreme Ultra Violet, EUV lithography tools will become indispensable and I expect the transition to EUV to be spread over a number of years and to be quite challenging for the industry. With regards to post-NAND technology alternatives, I remain optimistic about our three-dimensional 3D read/writes diode arrays, currently under development with our partner Toshiba. As I've said previously, I expect highly skilled NAND and post-NAND technology to happily coexist over the next decade.
Moving to IT. Our flash memory and system portfolios and know-how are now dominated by many strong second-generation patents. These patents cover managed NAND, multi-bits NAND, advanced NAND device, process and memory chip design patents, solid state disk, secure portable content, strong error correcting algorithms, high-speed Flash caching, wear out optimization, application-adaptive storage, 3D memories and so on. We believe this IP will provide us substantial leverage in the years ahead.
Turning now to our target markets. We have previously spoken about the legacy consumer markets, the mobile market and computing, including SSD and cloud storage. Of these, we believe that mobile continues to present us the greatest opportunities in the coming years. The more than 1.2 billion handsets that will be sold this year dwarf any other consumer or computing market. Increasingly, these are smartphones and tablets, which are morphing into sophisticated portable PCs that are always connected and that increasingly require more Flash storage to support the explosion in third-party mobile apps and user content. 
Handsets are also rapidly assuming the role of the ultimate portable convergence device first with music and cameras, then with video games, video capture, GPS and apps. As for SSD, these are transforming Enterprise Storage as we speak and we are within one or two generations from their mass adoption in notebook PCs and other thin clients. 
To be a market leader in SSD, you need to have access to leading-edge, high-quality Flash, shippable in high volumes at a competitive cost, applying sophisticated know how for managing highly skilled NAND, having the requisite patents and building on strong OEM credentials. SanDisk has it all and we are working diligently to gain leadership position in this space. 
As for our balance sheet, the numbers speaks for themselves and I believe that SanDisk is exceptionally well equipped to execute our long term global growth strategy. Last but not the least, our people. SanDisk people, the ""Can Do"" team, driven by passion for innovation with a consistent track record of flawless execution through good and bad times. 
SanDisk technologists and engineers retain the deep technology DNA from our early days. Under Sanjay's leadership, I believe SanDisk will continue to grow and prosper in the coming years. The management transition is going well and I expect 2011 will be another strong year for SanDisk. I will now pass it on to Sanjay."

As expected, the mobile market remained the key driver of the company's revenue in the third quarter and it represented half of our total quarter's revenue mix.

As expected, the mobile market remained the key driver of the company's revenue in the third quarter and it represented half of our total quarter's revenue mix. Our top five customers in the third quarter were all in the mobile phone end market. We are particularly pleased with the strong growth of our Embedded Products business during the quarter. 
With an increasing number of handsets with our iNANDs for embedded storage going into production, iNAND units sold increased by more than 100% from Q2 levels. Our embedded products, including iNANDs, made up nearly 30% of our OEM revenues, up from just under 20% in Q2. 
Furthermore, strong focus on customer qualification and adoption of our X3-based iNAND products are starting to pay off and certain handsets with our X3 iNAND embedded are now starting production. Our iNAND product line is also starting to generate design wins in numerous tablet SKUs, and we are excited to be part of this rapidly evolving new product category. 
Additionally, in the third quarter, we had a successful launch of our embedded solid-state drive, the iSSD, with capacity ranging from four to 64 gigabytes and it has generated a high level of interest from both the PC and non-PC OEMs. We expect this product category to grow in 2011 and beyond.
Retail delivered a solid quarter as total unit sales grew at a healthy double-digit rate on a year-over-year and sequential basis with the average capacity of retail units sold approaching five gigabytes. In North America, we saw the anticipated seasonal lift in USB flash drive sales, primarily driven by the back-to-school season. 
We also saw healthy double-digit revenue growth from the BRIC regions both on a sequential and year-over-year basis. In Europe, despite weak consumer sentiment, our sales grew nicely and we believe increases in channel penetration and strong brand preference are leading to market share gains there.
From an operational standpoint, our fabs completed the transition to 32-nanometer technology. Our high mix of 32-nanometer X3 technology in the third quarter enabled us to deliver record product gross margins. We expect to begin volume production of both X2 and X3 memory architectures on our 24-nanometer technology in the fourth quarter. 
I would like to make a few comments about the pricing environment. Industry pricing trends began to soften in the second half of Q3 in certain segments. We believe that this is primarily due to pockets of demand, supply imbalances caused by low grade TLC, meaning competitors' three level cell NAND and early production of 2x nanometer products from other suppliers that are not qualified by large OEMs. 
We believe that this low grade pricing impacted certain parts of our OEM business, specifically white label cards and wafers, where we choose not to compete at some of these prices with our high-quality X3. A brief update on fab capacity. The final phase of Fab 4 expansion is underway and we expect the facility to attain its full capacity in mid-2011. Regarding Fab 5, we continue to proceed with caution and have not made the final decision regarding the ramp start date or the pace of expansion. 
To summarize, we are very pleased with our third quarter execution and performance. The fundamental growth drivers for NAND flash remain firmly in place and I look forward to providing you an update on our fourth quarter results and future outlook early next year. I will now hand the call over to Judy."

With third quarter revenue growth of 32% year-over-year and operating margins of 35% on a GAAP basis and 37% non-GAAP, I believe our performance stands out, even within a favorable NAND industry environment. 
Our revenue of $1.234 billion was in the higher end of the range we predicted in July with both product revenue and license and royalty revenue coming in as expected. Our product revenue for the third quarter shifted a bit toward retail with a mix of 62% OEM and 38% retail. Our ASP per gigabyte declined a modest 5% with our prices mostly firm through August and some price reductions in September. 
Our Q3 gigabyte sold grew 8% sequentially and 71% year-over-year. And on a year-to-date basis, our gigabytes sold have grown 84%. In Q3, we experienced solid retail growth both sequentially and year-over-year in Americas, Europe and Asia, with overall retail revenue of 13% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. Our retail channels delivered sequential unit and revenue growth in all key end markets including mobile, imaging, USB, audio video and gaming with the strongest retail growth coming from USB for back-to-school and for mobile products. 
Our OEM revenue was flat sequentially and up 55% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, OEM revenue did grow for mobile products but was offset by a reduction in other product categories primarily white label cards and wafers. Across all channels, our third quarter revenue by end market came 50% from the mobile market, 22% up from imaging, 10% from USBs, 10% from other product markets and 8% from license and royalty revenue. 
Our product gross margins increased six percentage points sequentially to 48%, our highest ever product gross margin. With our product cost per gigabyte improving 13% sequentially compared to only a 5% price decline. Our cost decline was stronger than expected, due primarily to higher 32-nanometer yields and rapid transition to 32-nanometer X3. X3 memory continued to account for more than half of our shipments and non-captive memory was used for only 1% of our shipments. 
Non-GAAP operating expenses grew $13 million sequentially with the growth predominantly in R&D. Sales and marketing expenses were down slightly sequentially as certain expenses we had anticipated in Q3 moved to Q4. Our non-GAAP other income of $15 million included gains of $8 million related to foreign exchange and the sale of certain investments. Our expected non-GAAP tax rate for the year has come down to 35% and this reduced rate combined the certain onetime items resulted in a third quarter non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 34%.
On the balance sheet, cash and short and long term marketable securities increased sequentially by $1.3 billion to over $5 billion. Deducting the maturity value of our convertible debt securities, our net cash is a record $2.9 billion. Cash increases during Q3 included $878 million from our convertible debt financing, $379 million of cash flow from operations, $60 million of excess cash returned from the Flash Partners joint venture and $23 million from employee options and the employee stock purchase plan. We utilized $22 million of cash for non-fab capital purchases. 
Free cash flow for Q3 was $416 million, bringing the year-to-date free cash flow to over $1.1 billion. SanDisk's portion of Fab 3 and Fab 4 investments on a year-to-date basis has been approximately $615 million, with zero cash infusion to the joint ventures.
Total capital investments, both fab and non-fab are $675 million on a year-to-date basis. Our off balance sheet equipment lease guarantees stand at $891 million at the end of the third quarter, reflecting a reduction of $125 million from Q3 payments, partially offset by a $50 million increase due to the appreciation of the yen in the third quarter. 
Inventory on our balance sheet increased $33 million to $527 million, primarily due to the appreciation of the yen. Measured on a petabyte basis, our SanDisk-owned inventory remains lean at approximately eight basis points. And retail owned channel inventory is also on the low side ending the quarter at a global six weeks. 
I'll now turn to forward-looking commentary. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance are posted on our website. As we forecast Q4, we believe that demand for NAND is fundamentally strong with the strongest growth drivers being the secular trends in mobile phones and tablets and growth from these end markets primarily shows up in our OEM business. 
We believe that macroeconomic weakness, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, continues to limit growth in our retail demand. However, consumers are still buying as seen in our Q3 retail results and we expect increased retail demand in Q4 for the holiday season. 
So in terms of unit and petabyte demand, we expect good growth from both our OEM and retail channels in the fourth quarter. On the pricing front, we do expect higher price decline in our Q4 than in our Q3 and we have already made certain price adjustments. Taking into account these factors, we expect fourth quarter total revenue to be between $1.25 billion and $1.325 billion and within this total Q4 revenue, we forecast license and royalty revenue between $85 million in $90 million. This fourth quarter forecast would lead to full-year revenue between $4.75 billion and $4.825 billion in the middle of our July forecast of $4.7 billion to $4.9 billion.
Turning to gross margin. There are three key factors that we expect will lead to lower gross margin in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. First, we expect a higher rate of price decline. Second, the yen has depreciated relative to the dollar by approximately 7% since the beginning of our third quarter to present. This increases the dollar cost of the wafers we purchased in the last quarter and these wafers will be reflected in our fourth quarter sales. 
And last, with the 32-nanometer transition completed and more non-captive purchases in Q4, we will see less cost reduction in Q4 as compared to Q3. Our forecasted non-GAAP product gross margin for Q4 is between 39% and 42%, yielding a total non-GAAP gross margin, including license and royalty of 43% to 46%. To put this in perspective, our 32-nanometer transition was faster with higher yields than expected, which accelerated some of our planned second half cost reductions into Q3. Our guidance for Q4 leads to a second half product gross margin above the estimate I've provided in July.
We expect fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses between $205 million and $210 million with increases primarily in R&D and in sales and marketing for seasonal retail marketing programs. Our Q4 forecast for non-GAAP other income is approximately $10 million. And we estimate a non-GAAP tax rate of 34% including some onetime benefits. On a GAAP basis, there is the possibility that we will release a substantial portion of our tax valuation allowances in the fourth quarter.
Our total capital investment forecast for fab and non-fab purchases remains at approximately $1.1 billion for 2010, meaning that the investment level in Q4 is estimated at approximately $425 million, reflecting investments for both the 24-nanometer transition and Fab 4 expansion. 
The estimated fourth quarter cash requirements for these investments is expected to be approximately $75 million in loans to the fab joint ventures and approximately $30 million for non-fab purchases. Given this, the fourth quarter should be another good quarter for free cash flow. 
In summary, our third quarter results were outstanding and our fourth quarter gross margins and operating margins are forecasted to be very attractive. We will now open the call for your questions."

Apple has done so in the past. Apple was the first company to introduce PCs without a floppy disk at a time where everybody thought you've got to have floppys. And I think that going with the standards of notebook PC that has nothing but flash memory, I think it's going to force competitors to much more seriously go in that direction. But we all know that the real driver for mass adoption of flash memory SSD in these type of notebook PCs is very much -- we need to get to a lower cost and that will happen, I believe. Tablets is a different matter. This is really a product category that came out of nowhere. Never was expected to be where it is today even just six months ago and the nice thing about tablets, almost by definition, 10-hour operation, very thin, lightweight, none of the tablets anymore -- actually none of the tablets are designed to use hard disk drives. That was not the case for netbook PCs where we all expected netbook PCs to be, primarily, with flash memory SSD but PSSD, but in fact, turned out to be hard disk drive based. So tablet PC to the extent that they cannibalized notebook PCs, that's good news for us and for the industry because notebook PCs really are not, today, using SSD to any large extent. As where tablet PCs, to the extent that they cannibalize notebook PCs that could use flash for all industries and certainly for ourselves."

Of course, other people think the same of theirs and they're entitled to that. But Toshiba and SanDisk combined generate about 40% of the world output and our own quality standards are very high as we penetrate more and more OEM business, OEMs, major OEMs have very high standards for quality. And we have really, to a large extent, stayed away from playing in these low quality, low prices markets. Now I've also said many times, that I believe it's very important for the industry to have continuous price reductions that are in-line with cost reductions. The industry has had the benefit of really two generations of technology from the 43-nanometer to the 32-nanometer and next year, 24, 27 with very, very substantial cost reductions that are leading to these very excellent gross margins, which has been wonderful for stable pricing and so on. On the other hand, there's no question about it that some markets do require, like SSD, require some price reductions that take advantage of these cost reductions, and are used to accelerate these new markets as well as broadened appeal to a new strata of customers. So I think, price reductions, like we said this year, we think the industry total price reduction year-to-year is about 20%. That's very unusual. It has helped the industry recover its health, but the cost reductions really do allow us and the industry, I believe, in 2011 to get closer to what some of these new markets need to have. So in general, actually I feel very good about our ability and for the industry to continue cost reductions through technology, through execution of our 24-nanometer with 3-bits-per-cell and we expect that this will allow us to be a very competitive player in these new markets in 2011."

In the third quarter, we actually were quite pleased with the bit growth in the Retail part of our business. We saw strong bit growth sequentially in the Retail business. In the OEM business, we saw more modest bit growth but we had good bit growth overall in the mobile handset part of our OEM business, and that was offset somewhat by the fact that we chose not to participate, as Sanjay described, in some of the low-price business in the white label card and also in the wafer business. So that impacted somewhat our bit growth there. Also, I'll also mention that our bit growth and OEM in the third quarter was also impacted somewhat by the fact that there were some non-memory component shortages early in the third quarter that limited somewhat the shipment of certain handsets. And when those handsets shipments were limited, that also then limited somewhat our sales of NAND into those handsets. We believe that, that issue has been solved in the marketplace and that's not an issue in the fourth quarter. So turning to the fourth quarter, in the fourth quarter, we believe that we will have strong bit growth, both in the Retail part of our business and in the OEM part of our business and so, we're not giving any specific guidance, but I think you are thinking about it correctly as you try to model your bit growth for the year."

We are very pleased with our excellent second quarter results continuing the positive trend of the past several quarters and setting the stage for a strong finish to 2010.
I will lyric my remarks in the prevailing industry-wide demand supply conditions and our Fab 5 announcement last week with our partner Toshiba. I will then comment on today's announcement regarding my decision to retire as Chairman and CEO of SanDisk at the end of this calendar year and our succession plan.
Sanjay and Judy will provide details on the second quarter and the outlook for the second half of this year. We believe the NAND Flash industry continues to experience a healthy demand supply balance as evidenced by modest price declines throughout the second quarter.
In the second half, our customer demand is expected to exceed our supply driven primarily by strong mobile OEM sales as well as seasonal improvement in retail demand. Our own supply situation is looking quite tight in the second half, the result of our OEM business doing much better than we had forecasted just six months ago and we continue to work closely with our customers in this environment.
We now have greater visibility and are more confident in the sustained demand from our diversified channels and market and, therefore, we have now approved the final phase of Fab 4 extension which will result in additional petabytes in the first half of 2011.
Last week in Yokkaichi, Japan we signed the Fab 5 agreement with our long-term strategic partner Toshiba. This represents a major strategic decision for us, one that will allow us to keep face with the projected strong growth in our Flash market in the coming decade.
Due to long construction and equipment lead times, this decision is now timely and necessary and the Fab 5 contribution to our existing supply base will become meaningful starting in late 2011.
The Fab 5 agreement provides us flexibility to participate in up to 50% of the investment and corresponding capacity allocation with our actual percentage participation being determined at our discretion.
Furthermore, beyond the initial startup ramp and within certain limits we have the flexibility to time our own production ramp rate to best meet our customers' demand profile.
Fab 5 will take several years to ramp to full capacity at which point it is expected to be one of the largest, most efficient and most advanced NAND Flash memory fab in the world. It will be capable of supporting extreme UV, that's UV lithography tools when they become available for production and we also see possibly our first trial for 3D redrive when this technology becomes ready for commercialization.
Fab 5 will require substantial capital investments. It will be spread primarily over 2011 through 2014 as well as startup costs in the second half of 2011. We have not finalized our Fab 5 production plans beyond the initial minimum commitment and we will provide Fab 5 CapEx projections in the first quarter of 2011 when we have better playing visibility.
We believe that the much-improved strength of our balance sheet and the growing scale and diversity of our business support this important investment in Fab 5.
Moving now to today's announcement of my retirement from SanDisk and our succession plan; I consider myself to have been the luckiest guy in our industry these past 22 years. Together with our team we built SanDisk from the proverbial idea sketch on a napkin into a great company in an industry that we pioneered.
This year I turn 65. Also, this year SanDisk is stronger than ever and poised to do even better in the years ahead. This is good timing to pass the baton to a new leader. We are very fortunate that my partner and co-founder, Sanjay Mehrotra, has accepted the CEO roll effective January 1, 2011.
Sanjay is 52 years old and over the last 22 years he has contributed in numerous, major rolls as SanDisk grew to its current size and stature. He has tremendous integrity and business acumen and, as a superb memory engineer, he is as knowledgeable about flash storage as any other person in our industry.
Sanjay has displayed strong leadership through the years and, in particular, during the recent difficult downturn when we restructured and strategically redirected SanDisk on its current course. He has mine and the Board's full confidence and support and is ready and able to lead SanDisk to the next level in the years ahead.
SanDisk's new non-executive Chairman of the Board effective January 1, 2011 will be Michael Marks, a long-term SanDisk Board director and former Flextronics CEO. At the Board's request, I have agreed to provide the company with advisory service, particularly technology related on a part-time basis in the two years subsequent to my retirement.
For myself I will continue driving SanDisk hard until midnight December 31, 2010. During the next five months I hope to also meet with many of our shareholders, customers and partners. Beyond that, I currently have no specific plans and am looking forward to new adventures with my wife, my life's partner. I will now pass it over to Sanjay."

Good afternoon, everyone. First, I would like to thank Eli and the SanDisk Board of Directors for their confidence in asking me to take over the role of SanDisk president and CEO starting January 1, 2011.
Over the last 22 years I have benefited from the valuable mentoring and insight provided to me by Eli as SanDisk grew from a [ starter ] to one of the most recognized companies in the high tech industry. It is my honor to have the [ fortune ] to follow in Eli's footsteps and as successful as SanDisk is today I'm confident that our best days are still ahead.
I look forward to working with the SanDisk team to bring innovative products to market that anticipate our customers' requirements and drawing standards to new heights.
Now moving on to our second quarter review, our revenue reserves were strong, driven primarily by continued success in the OEM market. Our OEM business grew 181% from the year-ago quarter with unit volume more than doubling during the same period. Within our OEM business, our micro SD cards boasted strong unit and revenue growth.
In addition, our embedded storage products business grew substantially setting a record for both units and revenue with robust increases in [ payments ] of high capacity, eight gigabytes or greater [ product ].
In retail we maintained our focus on continued improvements in profitability and [ ramp premium ] in all regions. The ramp of our 32 nanometer technology has progressed will with high yield and productivity. The mix of 32 nanometer technology using X2 and our current generation X3 architecture was about two-thirds of our total production output.
We expect to complete the 32 nanometer transition in the third quarter. This progress, combined with continued usage of S3 is delivering better cost reductions than we expected for the year. Our [ x Phase 9s ] are now fully mature and we believe that they deliver significantly superior performance and reliability compared to competitors' X3 products.
Just for year-to-date, the use of our X3 and our card and embedded products is essentially [ subsequent ] to the user from what we price at no differently from comparable X2 [indiscernible] products from our sales or competitors.
Addressing our next generation technology we are on track to start transitioning to the 24 nanometer [ node ] later this year.
Our supply chain [ really did ] well, delivered record unit sales in the second quarter. We now expect to ship well over 500 million memory units during 2010 with approximately 50% of these units assembled, [indiscernible] and shipped from our Shanghai manufacturing facility. The scaleup of this factory has improved our cycle time, inventory management, costs and customer responsiveness.
As we look into the second half of the year and beyond, new product cycles from Smart phones, tablets, e-books and other mobile internet devices should continue to drive the need for the [indiscernible] NAND Flash based storage solution.
We see plenty of design activity among the [ QC ] and other technology leaders to develop iPad-like products. We believe that the runaway success of the iPad and its future composition should [ eliminate ] that option of flash storage in such ultra mobile platforms.
This new generation of tablets [ appears ] a fast-moving category which sports a 10 lightweight compactor four-day [ web dream ], is web connected, application driven, always on and rugged and highly reliable. These [indiscernible] can best be enabled by NAND Flash [ waves ], high-capacity sorted solutions including SSD.
Customer engagement with our product roadmap that includes PC solid state drive designed for tablets, network PCs and also [indiscernible] and [ GCD ]s, SSDs for mainstream notebook PCs continues to evolve well.
We are gaining traction with design wins that key OEMs and look forward to growth in this important business. The SanDisk team is excited about the prospects for our business ahead and we look forward to a successful 2010. With that, I will turn over the call to Judy."

We delivered our highest-ever second quarter revenue, gross margin, operating margin and EPS and our cash on investments stand at the highest level in the company's history on both a gross and net basis.Our product revenue was up 10%",1207,"Thank you, Sanjay. We delivered our highest-ever second quarter revenue, gross margin, operating margin and EPS and our cash on investments stand at the highest level in the company's history on both a gross and net basis.
Our product revenue was up 10% sequentially and 79% year-over-year with the growth generated primarily from mobile handset products, imaging products and wafers and components.
Our license and royalty revenue was in the range we forecasted with a 27% year-over-year decline reflecting the current Samsung license agreement. Our Q2 product revenue channel mix was 65% OEM and 35% retail. Our retail revenue grew 3% sequentially and 7% year-over-year with the strongest retail growth coming from the imaging market.
Looking at our retail revenue by geography, on a year-over-year basis we experienced strong growth in Asia, modest growth in the Americas and a decline in EMEA reflecting weak economic conditions in Europe.
Our OEM revenue grew 14% sequentially and 181% year-over-year with the strongest growth coming from the mobile market. Across all channels, the mobile market generated 48% of our Q2 revenue.
Turning to a few statistics on pricing and bids, our ASP per gigabyte declined a modest 8% sequentially and 18% year-over-year and our gigabytes sold grew 18% sequentially and 116% year-over-year.
The average capacity of our products sold grew 9% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP product gross margin improved sequentially by approximately one percentage point to 42.4% as our product costs per gigabyte improved 9% sequentially, slightly more than price decline.
Gross margin exceeded our previous forecast primarily because we were able to manage the quarter with less retail promotional spend and our usage of three bits per cell memory or X3 remains similar to the strong level in Q1 whereas we had previously anticipated a slightly lower mix of X3 in the second quarter.
Non-GAAP operating expenses grew only $2 million sequentially and at 14.7% of revenue expenses are slightly below our long-term financial model range of 15% to 17%. We continue to prioritize investment in technology and innovation and we are hiring in order to manage growth and invest for the future.
Our operating margin improved sequentially on a GAAP basis from 29% to 30% and on a non-GAAP basis from 31% to 32%, second only to the fourth quarter of 2009. Our non-GAAP other income of $14 million included gains of $7 million related to the sale of certain investments.
Our expected non-GAAP tax rate for the year has come down from 37% to 35.5% and, as a result, the non-GAAP tax rate in Q2 is approximately 34% in order to bring the year-to-date rate to 35.5%.
On the balance sheet, cash and short and long-term marketable securities increased sequentially by $422 million to $3.7 billion. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $385 million and our six-month year-to-date cash flow from operations is $713 million, higher than we have previously generated in any full year.
During Q2 we purchased $22 million in non-fab capital equipment resulting in free cash flow of $363 million. SanDisk Fab 3 and 4 joint venture capital investments have been approximately $265 million on a year-to-date basis, all for technology transitions and this has been funded entirely by joint venture working capital resulting in no payments to the joint ventures and no new leases so far this year.
Our off balance sheet equipment lease guarantees totaled $966 million at the end of Q2, slightly up sequentially due to the Yen to dollar exchange rate. Our inventory dollars ended Q2 below $500 million, the lowest dollar level wince the third quarter of 2006 when our business was substantially smaller.
Measured on a petabyte basis, our inventory is between eight and nine weeks of supply, which is lean for our vertically integrated supply chain model.
I'll now turn to forward-looking commentary. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance are posted on our website.
Demand indications from our customers are strong for the second half of the year and we expect to be supply constrained in the second half. Incremental supply from Fab 4 expansion will primarily be available in Q4 which will help with end-of-year seasonality and we have placed orders for some non-captive supply which will also primarily benefit Q4 but we do not expect our available supply to be adequate to meet demand.
We expect Q3 total revenue to be between $1.175 billion and $1.25 billion. Within this total Q3 revenue we forecast license and royalty revenue to be between $90 million and $100 million. Despite supply constraints we are raising our full-year revenue estimate.
Recall we started this year with an estimate of $4 billion to $4.4 billion in revenue and after Q1 we raised that range to $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion. We now expect total revenue to be between $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion for 2010 including license and royalty revenue between $360 million and $375 million.
Turning to gross margins, we now expect our full-year cost per gigabyte improvement to be better than 40% and we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable. In the second half we will have some unfavorable gross margin impact from non-captive supply and from the Yen to dollar exchange rate which has moved against us in recent weeks.
Based upon all of these factors, we now expect the product gross margin percentage in the second half to be roughly comparable to the first half of the year. For the full year, this would result in product gross margin more than four percentage points above the midpoint of our previous guidance.
Our forecast for non-GAAP operating expenses for the full year remains at approximately $750 million with Q3 at approximately $195 million. Our forecast for non-GAAP other income remains at approximately $60 million for the year and we forecast the non-GAAP tax rate to be 35.5%.
We are pulling in the timing of Fab 4 expansion plans with the completion of Fab 4 expansion still in the first half of 2011. With this pull-in, our forecasted capital investments for 2010 have increased to approximately $1.1 billion compared to our last estimate of approximately $900 million.
The $1.1 billion is comprised of an estimated $1 billion of joint venture fab equipment in Fabs 3 and 4 and $100 million of non-fab capital equipment. Roughly $300 million of these investments were made in the first half of 2010 and approximately $800 million remain in the second half. Recall that there are three sources of funding for our capital investments including joint venture working capital, equipment leases and SanDisk cash.
While our 2010 capital investments have increased due to the pull-in of Fab 4 expansion, the estimated cash requirement for 2010 remains at the low end of the range we provided early this year, approximately $300 million due to strong joint venture working capital and certain expansion payments occurring in 2011.
In closing, we are extremely pleased with our Q2 results and we are working very hard to optimize and maximize supply for our customer demand in the second half. At the same time, we are managing our business and strategic investments to drive future growth, profitability and cash generation.
We will now open the call for your questions."

So we saw the demand increasing during the second quarter. We placed orders for the non-captive supply. We'll be receiving it in the third quarter. So in terms of shipments, the impact of non-captive in the third quarter will be small and in the fourth quarter it will be somewhat larger.
As Judy said, overall for the second half still it will be in single digit percentage. So there are several factors that we look at in managing our non-captive business. We want to make sure that we are managing it prudently. Some of the considerations include margin, the mix of the product as well as basically the timing of the supply that's available.

You saw the numbers today for the second quarter. In terms of price decline it was 18% per gigabyte on a year-over-year basis and we continue to expect to see a favorable pricing environment in the second half."

We are very pleased with our excellent second quarter results continuing the positive trend of the past several quarters and setting the stage for a strong finish to 2010.
I will lyric my remarks in the prevailing industry-wide demand supply conditions and our Fab 5 announcement last week with our partner Toshiba. I will then comment on today's announcement regarding my decision to retire as Chairman and CEO of SanDisk at the end of this calendar year and our succession plan.
Sanjay and Judy will provide details on the second quarter and the outlook for the second half of this year. We believe the NAND Flash industry continues to experience a healthy demand supply balance as evidenced by modest price declines throughout the second quarter.
In the second half, our customer demand is expected to exceed our supply driven primarily by strong mobile OEM sales as well as seasonal improvement in retail demand. Our own supply situation is looking quite tight in the second half, the result of our OEM business doing much better than we had forecasted just six months ago and we continue to work closely with our customers in this environment.
We now have greater visibility and are more confident in the sustained demand from our diversified channels and market and, therefore, we have now approved the final phase of Fab 4 extension which will result in additional petabytes in the first half of 2011.
Last week in Yokkaichi, Japan we signed the Fab 5 agreement with our long-term strategic partner Toshiba. This represents a major strategic decision for us, one that will allow us to keep face with the projected strong growth in our Flash market in the coming decade.
Due to long construction and equipment lead times, this decision is now timely and necessary and the Fab 5 contribution to our existing supply base will become meaningful starting in late 2011.
The Fab 5 agreement provides us flexibility to participate in up to 50% of the investment and corresponding capacity allocation with our actual percentage participation being determined at our discretion.
Furthermore, beyond the initial startup ramp and within certain limits we have the flexibility to time our own production ramp rate to best meet our customers' demand profile.
Fab 5 will take several years to ramp to full capacity at which point it is expected to be one of the largest, most efficient and most advanced NAND Flash memory fab in the world. It will be capable of supporting extreme UV, that's UV lithography tools when they become available for production and we also see possibly our first trial for 3D redrive when this technology becomes ready for commercialization.
Fab 5 will require substantial capital investments. It will be spread primarily over 2011 through 2014 as well as startup costs in the second half of 2011. We have not finalized our Fab 5 production plans beyond the initial minimum commitment and we will provide Fab 5 CapEx projections in the first quarter of 2011 when we have better playing visibility.
We believe that the much-improved strength of our balance sheet and the growing scale and diversity of our business support this important investment in Fab 5.
Moving now to today's announcement of my retirement from SanDisk and our succession plan; I consider myself to have been the luckiest guy in our industry these past 22 years. Together with our team we built SanDisk from the proverbial idea sketch on a napkin into a great company in an industry that we pioneered.
This year I turn 65. Also, this year SanDisk is stronger than ever and poised to do even better in the years ahead. This is good timing to pass the baton to a new leader. We are very fortunate that my partner and co-founder, Sanjay Mehrotra, has accepted the CEO roll effective January 1, 2011.
Sanjay is 52 years old and over the last 22 years he has contributed in numerous, major rolls as SanDisk grew to its current size and stature. He has tremendous integrity and business acumen and, as a superb memory engineer, he is as knowledgeable about flash storage as any other person in our industry.
Sanjay has displayed strong leadership through the years and, in particular, during the recent difficult downturn when we restructured and strategically redirected SanDisk on its current course. He has mine and the Board's full confidence and support and is ready and able to lead SanDisk to the next level in the years ahead.
SanDisk's new non-executive Chairman of the Board effective January 1, 2011, will be Michael Marks, a long-term SanDisk Board director and former Flextronics CEO. At the Board's request, I have agreed to provide the company with advisory service, particularly technology related on a part-time basis in the two years subsequent to my retirement.
For myself I will continue driving SanDisk hard until midnight December 31, 2010. During the next five months I hope to also meet with many of our shareholders, customers and partners. Beyond that, I currently have no specific plans and am looking forward to new adventures with my wife, my life's partner. I will now pass it over to Sanjay."

It is my honor to have the [ fortune ] to follow in Eli's footsteps and as successful as SanDisk is today I'm confident that our best days are still ahead.
I look forward to working with the SanDisk team to bring innovative products to market that anticipate our customers' requirements and drawing standards to new heights.
Now moving on to our second quarter review, our revenue reserves were strong, driven primarily by continued success in the OEM market. Our OEM business grew 181% from the year-ago quarter with unit volume more than doubling during the same period. Within our OEM business, our micro SD cards boasted strong unit and revenue growth.
In addition, our embedded storage products business grew substantially setting a record for both units and revenue with robust increases in [ payments ] of high capacity, eight gigabytes or greater [ product ].
In retail we maintained our focus on continued improvements in profitability and [ ramp premium ] in all regions. The ramp of our 32 nanometer technology has progressed will with high yield and productivity. The mix of 32 nanometer technology using X2 and our current generation X3 architecture was about two-thirds of our total production output.
We expect to complete the 32 nanometer transition in the third quarter. This progress, combined with continued usage of S3 is delivering better cost reductions than we expected for the year. Our [ x Phase 9s ] are now fully mature and we believe that they deliver significantly superior performance and reliability compared to competitors' X3 products.
Just for year-to-date, the use of our X3 and our card and embedded products is essentially [ subsequent ] to the user from what we price at no differently from comparable X2 [indiscernible] products from our sales or competitors.
Addressing our next generation technology we are on track to start transitioning to the 24 nanometer [ node ] later this year.
Our supply chain [ really did ] well, delivered record unit sales in the second quarter. We now expect to ship well over 500 million memory units during 2010 with approximately 50% of these units assembled, [indiscernible] and shipped from our Shanghai manufacturing facility. The scaleup of this factory has improved our cycle time, inventory management, costs and customer responsiveness.
As we look into the second half of the year and beyond, new product cycles from Smart phones, tablets, e-books and other mobile internet devices should continue to drive the need for the [indiscernible] NAND Flash based storage solution.
We see plenty of design activity among the [ QC ] and other technology leaders to develop iPad-like products. We believe that the runaway success of the iPad and its future composition should [ eliminate ] that option of flash storage in such ultra-mobile platforms.
This new generation of tablets [ appears ] a fast-moving category which sports a 10 lightweight compactor four-day [ web dream ], is web connected, application driven, always on and rugged and highly reliable. These [indiscernible] can best be enabled by NAND Flash [ waves ], high-capacity sorted solutions including SSD.
Customer engagement with our product roadmap that includes PC solid state drive designed for tablets, network PCs and also [indiscernible] and [ GCD ]s, SSDs for mainstream notebook PCs continues to evolve well.
We are gaining traction with design wins that key OEMs and look forward to growth in this important business. The SanDisk team is excited about the prospects for our business ahead and we look forward to a successful 2010. With that, I will turn over the call to Judy."

We delivered our highest-ever second quarter revenue, gross margin, operating margin and EPS and our cash on investments stand at the highest level in the company's history on both a gross and net basis.
Our product revenue was up 10% sequentially and 79% year-over-year with the growth generated primarily from mobile handset products, imaging products and wafers and components.
Our license and royalty revenue was in the range we forecasted with a 27% year-over-year decline reflecting the current Samsung license agreement. Our Q2 product revenue channel mix was 65% OEM and 35% retail. Our retail revenue grew 3% sequentially and 7% year-over-year with the strongest retail growth coming from the imaging market.
Looking at our retail revenue by geography, on a year-over-year basis we experienced strong growth in Asia, modest growth in the Americas and a decline in EMEA reflecting weak economic conditions in Europe.
Our OEM revenue grew 14% sequentially and 181% year-over-year with the strongest growth coming from the mobile market. Across all channels, the mobile market generated 48% of our Q2 revenue.
Turning to a few statistics on pricing and bids, our ASP per gigabyte declined a modest 8% sequentially and 18% year-over-year and our gigabytes sold grew 18% sequentially and 116% year-over-year.
The average capacity of our products sold grew 9% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP product gross margin improved sequentially by approximately one percentage point to 42.4% as our product costs per gigabyte improved 9% sequentially, slightly more than price decline.
Gross margin exceeded our previous forecast primarily because we were able to manage the quarter with less retail promotional spend and our usage of three bits per cell memory or X3 remains similar to the strong level in Q1 whereas we had previously anticipated a slightly lower mix of X3 in the second quarter.
Non-GAAP operating expenses grew only $2 million sequentially and at 14.7% of revenue expenses are slightly below our long-term financial model range of 15% to 17%. We continue to prioritize investment in technology and innovation and we are hiring in order to manage growth and invest for the future.
Our operating margin improved sequentially on a GAAP basis from 29% to 30% and on a non-GAAP basis from 31% to 32%, second only to the fourth quarter of 2009. Our non-GAAP other income of $14 million included gains of $7 million related to the sale of certain investments.
Our expected non-GAAP tax rate for the year has come down from 37% to 35.5% and, as a result, the non-GAAP tax rate in Q2 is approximately 34% in order to bring the year-to-date rate to 35.5%.
On the balance sheet, cash and short and long-term marketable securities increased sequentially by $422 million to $3.7 billion. Second quarter cash flow from operations was $385 million and our six-month year-to-date cash flow from operations is $713 million, higher than we have previously generated in any full year.
During Q2 we purchased $22 million in non-fab capital equipment resulting in free cash flow of $363 million. SanDisk Fab 3 and 4 joint venture capital investments have been approximately $265 million on a year-to-date basis, all for technology transitions and this has been funded entirely by joint venture working capital resulting in no payments to the joint ventures and no new leases so far this year.
Our off balance sheet equipment lease guarantees totaled $966 million at the end of Q2, slightly up sequentially due to the Yen to dollar exchange rate. Our inventory dollars ended Q2 below $500 million, the lowest dollar level wince the third quarter of 2006 when our business was substantially smaller.
Measured on a petabyte basis, our inventory is between eight and nine weeks of supply, which is lean for our vertically integrated supply chain model.
I'll now turn to forward-looking commentary. Please note that non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation tables for all applicable guidance are posted on our website.
Demand indications from our customers are strong for the second half of the year and we expect to be supply constrained in the second half. Incremental supply from Fab 4 expansion will primarily be available in Q4 which will help with end-of-year seasonality and we have placed orders for some non-captive supply which will also primarily benefit Q4 but we do not expect our available supply to be adequate to meet demand.
We expect Q3 total revenue to be between $1.175 billion and $1.25 billion. Within this total Q3 revenue we forecast license and royalty revenue to be between $90 million and $100 million. Despite supply constraints we are raising our full-year revenue estimate.
Recall we started this year with an estimate of $4 billion to $4.4 billion in revenue and after Q1 we raised that range to $4.5 billion to $4.8 billion. We now expect total revenue to be between $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion for 2010 including license and royalty revenue between $360 million and $375 million.
Turning to gross margins, we now expect our full-year cost per gigabyte improvement to be better than 40% and we expect the pricing environment to remain favorable. In the second half we will have some unfavorable gross margin impact from non-captive supply and from the Yen to dollar exchange rate which has moved against us in recent weeks.
Based upon all of these factors, we now expect the product gross margin percentage in the second half to be roughly comparable to the first half of the year. For the full year, this would result in product gross margin more than four percentage points above the midpoint of our previous guidance.
Our forecast for non-GAAP operating expenses for the full year remains at approximately $750 million with Q3 at approximately $195 million. Our forecast for non-GAAP other income remains at approximately $60 million for the year and we forecast the non-GAAP tax rate to be 35.5%.
We are pulling in the timing of Fab 4 expansion plans with the completion of Fab 4 expansion still in the first half of 2011. With this pull-in, our forecasted capital investments for 2010 have increased to approximately $1.1 billion compared to our last estimate of approximately $900 million.
The $1.1 billion is comprised of an estimated $1 billion of joint venture fab equipment in Fabs 3 and 4 and $100 million of non-fab capital equipment. Roughly $300 million of these investments were made in the first half of 2010 and approximately $800 million remain in the second half. Recall that there are three sources of funding for our capital investments including joint venture working capital, equipment leases and SanDisk cash.
While our 2010 capital investments have increased due to the pull-in of Fab 4 expansion, the estimated cash requirement for 2010 remains at the low end of the range we provided early this year, approximately $300 million due to strong joint venture working capital and certain expansion payments occurring in 2011.
In closing, we are extremely pleased with our Q2 results and we are working very hard to optimize and maximize supply for our customer demand in the second half. At the same time, we are managing our business and strategic investments to drive future growth, profitability and cash generation.
We will now open the call for your questions."

In fact, we have raised the revenue estimate a second time compared to the start of the year now. So we basically are running as fast as we can in terms of really fulfilling the demand and that includes maximizing our captive supply but yet also tapping into demand non-captive sources.
So we saw the demand increasing during the second quarter. We placed orders for the non-captive supply. We'll be receiving it in the third quarter. So in terms of shipments, the impact of non-captive in the third quarter will be small and in the fourth quarter it will be somewhat larger.
As Judy said, overall for the second half still it will be in single digit percentage. So there are several factors that we look at in managing our non-captive business. We want to make sure that we are managing it prudently. Some of the considerations include margin, the mix of the product as well as basically the timing of the supply that's available.
So looking at all of that, our picture ahead is a single-digit percentage in the second half of non-captive utilization."

In terms of the demand from Europe, as Judy said, Q2 was somewhat slow. I mean, the consumer sentiment in Europe or in America is not totally back. However, in Q3 we do expect seasonal uptick in demand particularly associated with back to school."

It is very important for being able to maintain a more aggressive cost reduction than we have previously projected, at least let's say the 20 nanometer and slightly below 20 nanometer.
