I want to point out we'll be speaking in the presentation that is available on the website if you're so inclined to follow through it. And as we have done in",1786,"Thank you very much, and thank you everybody for joining us for the 2009 fourth quarter briefing. I want to point out we'll be speaking in the presentation that is available on the website if you're so inclined to follow through it. And as we have done in the past, I'll spend a few minutes to give a summary of the business results. We will give an update on where we are with the Morgan Stanley Van Kampen combination and specifically Karen is going to talk about some of the fixed income opportunities that we see there and Loren will get into review of the financials and we'll open up to questions as we have in the past.
So just for an overview for the fourth quarter, what you'll note is our consistent and good long-term performances benefiting the organization where we saw close net inflows during the quarter and again you'll see areas of exceptional performance during the quarter but all-in-all consistent good long-term performance. And although markets have improved considerably during the fourth quarter, we continue to take a very disciplined approach to our business. It helps when maintaining these net inflows that I just talk about in a strong operating margins and increasing results and operating income. And as we have been speaking of more recently that we're going to continue to look for areas to reinvest in the business as we become more optimistic looking forward that will result in identifying those areas that we think will make a difference and with that operating expenses would follow that once we make those decisions.
I would like to point out too since we announced the other combination with Morgan Stanley, Van Kampen Asset Management in October we've made very, very good progress in achieving our goal of close by in mid-2010. The integration work is very very much on track, the (inaudible) factor is really just getting the shareholder votes during that process but we'll speak more specifically about that in a few minutes.
If you take a look at the financial highlights then again I'll just hit on a few points, Loren will get into more detail. It was a real solid quarter, we ended the quarter with $423 billion in assets under management, operating income improved 6% to $161 million during the quarter, what you are beginning to see though is that we will highlight the impact of the expenses that we will be incurring as we work through the combination with Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen. Integration and on that basis, you can see that the operating margin was 31.4% during the quarter versus 29% in the prior quarter and 19% a year ago, and you can follow through on earnings per share, the same way, $0.27 this quarter, and $0.25 the prior quarter and $0.8 a year ago in that quarter. So a good result for the quarter.
If you take a look at the flows, again, I would highlight if you look quarter-by-quarter throughout 2009, we had positive flows, long-term flows in each of the quarters during that year, which we think recognized the environment and our asset mix was really quite an accomplishment.
For the full year, we had $9 billion in net long-term inflows, and if you compare that to the $21 billion in outflows a year ago, literally a $30 billion year-over-year-improvement when you compare the full year flows. The other element that I would point to is that we continue to see increasing gross sales, which we think is a good indicator of future flows. With regard to money funds, we saw $7.7 billion in outflows during the quarter not inconsistent with what we're seeing with the low yield environment. That said, we continue to do very well, and on a relative basis have done very well on the flow picture there.
Taking a look at investment performance, and you can see over one, three, five years, again, the performance is quite strong, and particularly on a three-year and five-year basis.69% of the assets are exceeding top half of the peers and on a three-year basis 73, on a five-year basis. I would like to point out again the very detailed performance charts are attached in the appendix if you're so inclined to follow area-by-area. We have put forward some relative investment highlights across the organization, Invesco aim, and Invesco Asia Pacific, and Invesco perpetual across the institutional business. What you'll know again area-by-area it continues to be quite stronger over the three-year and five-year basis where there tends to be some lag would be under one-year basis and that’s largely a result of the type of money that we manage and that will be more conservatively positioned.
That said, I think we've done a very good job for our investors, for our clients, and the investors are staying dedicated to their investment disciplines, which is exactly what we want. If you take a look at a summary of the fourth quarter results, I would just add this and leave the rest of it to Loren. We continue to be very, very focused on our balance sheet, continuing strength in the balance sheet. We have $762 billion in cash at the end of the quarter, and with regard to the dividend, the fourth quarter dividend was $10.25 per share, and that was consistent with the dividend that we paid throughout 2009.
So now let me spend a few minutes and give an update on the acquisition combination with Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen. If you are following among slide 11 and from my point of view and the organizations point of view, we feel very strongly that the benefits of our clients and shareholders and the organization just gets stronger and stronger, and the more time we spend with the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen organization, as we said at the time of the announcement, it is very, very strongly aligned with our strategy and our acquisition guidelines. The rationale is really quite compelling. We have stronger, deeper investment management team. There's a focus on investment excellence within that organization, too. The depth, breadth, and complementary nature of our investment strategies and vehicles that strengthen throughout the whole process and also another area that we continue to just feel better about all the time is the complementary nature of the client relationships and the overall strength of our distribution capability that will be coming out of it, the combination of the three will really make quite a difference for us.
And if you take a look at it from a shareholder point of view, we still are focused on IRR's of 30%, so really quite strong, and we'll spend some time on that again. If you take a look at the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen investment performance at 12/131, you can see on a one, three, five-year basis again very strong set of performance that they are delivering too. And again when you look at it in combination with what we are doing, again, very, very strong, and when we look at the underlying complementary nature of the different vehicles that we'll be offering clients, we just think it's a very, very compelling situation for our clients.
If you take a look at the diversification of the combined firm, again, you can see on page 13, at 12/31, the combined firm would have $542 billion in assets under management, but I would highlight again if you look at the diversification by asset class, by channel, by domicile very, very well the risk by organization which will serve not just the clients well, but also the shareholders well as we go forward as an organization.
Now, let me spend a minute just, as we've been spending significant time bringing the organizations together, we just think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity that's coming out of these joint efforts of the two organizations. We see tremendous opportunities from the combined organization and deepening coverage in some real key growth areas here in the United States, whether it be RIA [D.C.] the independent advisor channel, and also the combination is going to give us just a real very, very strong coverage model, and our ability to do a much better job collectively for our top 10 clients is a very real opportunity for us, and as you would imagine, we are very focused on developing joint strategies to become that much more important to all of our clients.
Since the announcement, we have had extensive outreach with key clients to share with them our view of the organization, of the combined organization going forward, and we have had just very, very strong feedback from those meetings. And so, again, I'm just very excited about the prospects, and also, very important news and very engaged and have extensive engagement with our future colleagues. It's a very talented group of people. We are very aligned culturally, and as we have been spending time identifying the future opportunities for the firm, we think they are very real and meaningful.
With regard to the operating platform, the efforts are well underway. Its going very, very well we are doing as you can imagine focused on delivering a single operating platform as we've been working on here over the last number of years. That is very, very much on track. And I feel good about the outcome. With regard to the closing, again, as I said, the operational integration is going very, very well. What we view as the negating factor is simply getting the client consent through the shareholder vote, and with that we feel we are on track to close by mid-2010. And the other element that I would just highlight again, there are no changes to the cost synergies that we identified at $70 million, and all of the other guidance continues to be very much on track. 
So, in summary, when you look at it, collectively, we think there are real bests to our client, to our shareholders, to our employees by putting this organization together, and we just think we have a much stronger, deeper organization coming out of this, and we are just very much anticipating working up close. But at this stage, everything is very, very well on track. And what we wanted to do was to start to spend time with you all and give you some greater insights into what some of those opportunities might be. Most of you know Karen Dunn-kelly, and we thought it would be helpful for her to talk about some of the opportunities that she's seen in the fixed income areas we put your inflation together so Karen can I turn it over to you?

As Marty has said that the combination of these two groups is incredibly complementary and it really just enhances what we do and what we look like as a business. So what I'd like to do over the next couple of page",1139,"Yes, thank you, Marty, and good morning. As Marty has said that the combination of these two groups is incredibly complementary and it really just enhances what we do and what we look like as a business. So what I'd like to do over the next couple of pages is sort of just from the fixed income perspective, give you a concept of who are we currently. What are we going to look like post merger, where are we going and what are some of those opportunities we see for our customers. So if you're looking at slide 17, you can see this is what we are as a fixed platform today. We are number one. We are very, very large. We are major in all of these classes. We are a global business, and you can see that we have offices and people, fixed experts across the globe. We also have the way we describe our business four major asset classes, and in each of those asset classes we are very deep, we are very diversified, and we have a long history and a long standing in those businesses.
So with that in mind, the next slide really says what are those investment capabilities and investment strategies, how do we view ourselves? But if you look on the side of the slide, there is the S curve. And so you can see from that S curve, we manage more assets in every aspect of the fixed income market and you can see on the bottom you have got the more conservative asset classed such as money market, stable value, and then as you go through it from the municipal slide, the core plus, high yield side you get to the more opportunistic where we do thinks like we will, as you know, named it one of the (inaudible) managers in 2009, we also priced the Invesco mortgage capital, which is a REIT, so we not only go from the very conservative to the very opportunistic, but we have got capabilities and strength in all of these areas. And then we then do is we capture those opportunities for our customers in any delivery vehicle they want. So you can see we not only from the separate account side, the mutual fund, collective trust, private placements, ETFs. We are across the platform in how we deliver those mechanisms to our customer.
So with that in mind, and taking that as the basic format of the way we view our fixed income business, the following slide says, okay, what is this exciting opportunity with Van Kampen. Well, as you can see, and we really parcel it out in the asset classes, we talk about it is an absolutely complementary joining of the two businesses. As you can see from each of the four major asset classes, cash will end at about $83 billion, stable value $30 billion, bringing the broad fixed income together, it will bring about $50 billion in assets, and on the alternative side, particularly in the bank loan side, we will have about $20 billion in asset and on our bank loan platform will be one of the largest in the country.
One of the areas that we think is incredibly opportunistic for us, and on both sides, is the municipal merger grouping. So on the following page, I just wanted to spend a few minutes and just sort of highlight that to you. And, first of all, when you talk about the two businesses, if you look at the Van Kampen side of the house, they did not have a lot of cash business. Invesco aim has cash business. On the Invesco side, we have no state specific business. That's not a business that we've really been in. Van Kampen has state-specific businesses. So when you combine these two units and think about the S curve I showed a couple of pages ago, on then municipal side, we have a total full S curve from maturities of overnight out to long-term from sectors from investment grade municipals all the way out to high-yield, high-income municipals we do both now state-specific as well as national tax-free products and the vehicles in which we can provide into the customers stand from opening, closing separately managed accounts, ETFs, UITs, et cetera. So we really will have a full complement, and we really will become an industry leader in the municipal space and if you take that to a further step obviously the assets merging in will be about $22 billion in asset but that puts us as the fifth largest non-proprietary municipal manager in the country. And so it really puts us in a place to deliver all of the products that we have.
With that said, and with the full capabilities of fixed income, we really believe that 2010 and going on, there's great opportunities for fixed income, and we look at them in a couple of different ways. From the overall fixed income platform, we believe that the demographic changes are absolutely favorable to increase allocation of fixed income. That will just naturally happen as the demographic trend continues to be positive for fixed income. The other thing that we've seen though in the fixed income environment, particularly coming out of the market problems and crisis over the past couple of years is that fixed income provides a risk profile for investors, whether they want a low-risk profile and want to be down at the bottom of that S curve or they want to take more risks and be opportunity and there is a lot of opportunistic places to be on the fixed income curve as you go out the curve.
So again, from a risk profile, fixed income is a place that can handle all sides of that and a combination for the client need. In particular, on tax-free side, we are very, very encouraged by what we're seeing, number one, with the anticipated increased tax rates we believe that that will drive investors to look towards the municipal bonds and that type of an asset class. The other thing, again, complementing the risk profile we talked about is the fact that if you look on the tax-free and the municipal asset class, over the last 10 years, they have provided very strong taxable equivalent returns with the ability to take lower volatility than certain of their counter party asset classes. So it is a place where you can really go in and get tax equivalent returns and low volatility. So with that in mind and all of these things coming together, we really believe this is a tremendous opportunity and a place where the fixed income asset class and that of municipals is going to be enhanced and grow in the next years to come.

384779,84499805,47403,"Invesco Ltd., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan-28-2010",2010-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Invesco Ltd.","Executives","Great. Thanks, Marty. During the quarter, as Marty pointed out, we saw positive long-term flows, also market gains, favorable foreign exchange which was offset somewhat by net outflows in our money market funds resulting in 6.2 billion increase in AUM as",1597,"Great. Thanks, Marty. During the quarter, as Marty pointed out, we saw positive long-term flows, also market gains, favorable foreign exchange which was offset somewhat by net outflows in our money market funds resulting in 6.2 billion increase in AUM as we ended the quarter with $422.1 billion in assets under management that’s up 1.5% since the end of September, and our average AUM for the quarter increased $13.4 billion to $420.3 billion. And also we're pleased to see the modest improve independent in our net revenue yield in Q4, driven by the growth in the higher fee asset categories so its 53 basis points or net revenue yields excluding performance is now roughly in line with where we were in Q3 of 2008. So, clearly moving in the right direction.
Let's move to operating results. As you see on the next page total operating revenue increased $42 million that's 6% increase quarter-over-quarter. Investment management fees are up 7.3% $41.5 million increase. That was a result of a positive mix shift and again higher overall average AUM. Within our mix, importantly, equities as a percentage of total AUM increased from 39.2% in the third quarter, now to 41% in the fourth quarter. Service and distribution revenues which typically move in line with our average AUM actually decreased quarter-over-quarter by 0.4%, and this was a result of certain annual fund expense recovery limits being reached in Canada. The impact was a full year reduction of $5.4 million in TA and administrative revenues, all of which were reflected in Q4. So that's an important note.
Performance fees going down, came out at $6.8 million. The magnitude of our performance fees in Q4 was lower than what we have typically seen in prior quarters at this time, but I'll be going into more detail on this later in the presentation. On the revenues declined by 8.2% to $17.8 million, result of lower transportation to commissions within our real estate and private equity business. This trend as you've seen began with the dislocation of the credit markets in the fourth quarter of last year, and we continue to feel the impact on this particular revenue line item. Again, I'll be talking about this more fully later in the in presentation.
Moving on down the slide, you will see that total operating expenses at $587 million grew quarter-over-quarter be $33.1 million, an increase of 6%. The majority of this increase is due to third party distribution which tends to move in line with AUM, but also the post signing costs related to the acquisition of Morgan Stanley's retail asset management business, and there are also some other notable increases in certain expense categories in Q4 which I'll discuss. 
Employee compensation expenses increased by $8.2 million, that's 3.4% versus Q3. This included $4.1 million of a charge related to the annual revaluations of general legacy non-U.S. defined benefit plan, as well as $4.3 million due to payroll taxes related to the vesting of several large share base awards in the quarter. Our third party distribution service and advisory expense increased $11.9 million that's 6.5% up. That's in line with investment management and service and distribution fees.
Marketing expenses grew in the quarter-over-quarter by $2.7 million, 9.7%. Again mainly due to marketing support payments which move in line with AUM, but also due to a slightly stepped up increase in advertising. Property office and technology decreased by $8.2 million that was a 13% decline. However, you'll remember in the third quarter, we incurred a $12 million charge relating to vacating leased property in Denver adjusting for this charge, the fourth quarter costs were actually up about $3.5 million primarily due to the outsourcing of facilities management in North America and the significant growth in our operating platform in Hyderabad, India.
General and administrative came in at $49.8 million in the quarter that's up $9.7 million versus Q3. And this difference was driven by seasonally higher fund expenses in Q4, when investor statements go out in UK and Europe. In addition, we had professional expenses up, related to a variety of new fund launches, including a new series of ETF products in Canada. Travel costs which have been constrained through most of 2009 also grew as business activities returned to a more normal run rate level.
Then we go to a new line item, transaction and integration. Going forward, we'll be using this line item to separately identify the expenses related to the acquisition of Morgan Stanley's retail asset management business and during this fourth quarter $9.8 million this cost is recorded compared to $1 million in the prior quarter, and this is all part of the transaction and integration charge guidance that we previously announced in Q3.
So moving down the P&L, you'll see that operating income increased 8.9% or 5.9% to $161 million. Below the operating income line, equity and earnings of our unconsolidated affiliates increased slightly to $9 million from $8 million in the third quarter. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 30.3%, up slightly versus 29.3% in the third quarter, and so coming to the punch line if you had come in at $0.25 for the quarter, after adjusting for the acquisition costs, $0.27, and then for to those of you who would have some interest, some of the notable items in the quarter, the pension charge, the Canadian service revenue impact and the payroll expense, all amounted to about $0.022 and again we would be happy to go through that in more detail if you want.
So going to the next slide, as I promised, we're going to talk a little bit more about performance fees and other revenues. I just want to make a point and according to point that we don't use performance fees pervasively within the firm. We have about $30 billion of our assets under management. They can earn performance fees, and that's only about 7% of our total AUM. The top half of this chart shows performance fees by quarter, and I think demonstrates that there's a fairly significant lack of predictability in this line item. Performance fees from our UK trusts in yellow have occurred historically in Q1 and Q4, however, in this quarter, there were no performance fees from the UK due to the one-year track record lagging benchmarks. However, this quarter the majority of the performance fees actually came from other, which is in gray. And this was specifically from Atlantic Trust as a result of strong performance from a (inaudible) fee that they manage.
And moving to the bottom half of the slide, you'll see that other revenues consist primarily of front end load fees in yellow, most of it is generated in the UK. But also transaction commissions in blue, earned by a real estate and private equity businesses. The other fees in gray include either fund expenses, (inaudible) consolidation revenue among other items. So similar to performance fees, other revenues in 2009 remained at a lower level, relative to prior years, and the decline in other revenues is largely the result of fewer real estate and private equity transactions, which I would say is consistent with the market environment that we find ourselves in today.
For the final slide, before we turn it over to questions, is a preview of some of the reporting changes that we plan to adopt in the first quarter of 2010. We are expecting to adopt a new accounting standard, FAS 167, related to the consolidation of certain of our investment products on January 1. Part of the standard, as you may know, as been deferred by the FASB. Nevertheless we will be required to consolidate certain of our managed CLOs and at December 31 of this year, Invesco managed about $11.2 billion of CLO structures and we would expect some portion of these structures to be consolidated in the first quarter, possibly in the range of $4 billion to $6 billion. We are still working through those numbers.
Good news, if there is any, is that the bottom line impact of this consolidation on Invesco's net income and ETF will be minimal. However, there will be an impact on operating income due to the elimination of management fees for the consolidated products, which will then be offset by below the line increases in interest income and expense. In addition, the balance sheets will be grossed up for all the collateral assets told by the entities that gets consolidate and by the debt issued by these entities, and this is despite the fact that no recourse exists either or implied against the assets of Invesco. And in addition, the cash flow statement under GAAP will be grossed up to reflect the cash flows of these entities. So in order to provide what we would expect you want us to provide, which is transparency, we will start next quarter to allow you to see those financial statements without the effect of the FAS 167 consolidation. So hopefully I'll be helpful.
In addition given our plan to complete the acquisition of Van Kampen prior to June 2010, and given the expected P&L impacts of what we discussed the non-cash intangible amortization post close we intend, beginning in Q1, to disclose our earnings on cash EPS basis. And we think this additional disclosure will provide greater transparency into the cash flow generation of our business and, also allow for more appropriate comparisons with our competitors, many of them who use cash EPS as well.
So with that, I'm going to hand it back to Marty.

This 2010 really should be lynchpin here, the inflection point for this part of the business?

In fact we've had the market crisis that started in '07 went through '08, and what we really did in 2009 and so we need to position ourselves for the future. So what we did is we did a couple of things. We went out on extensive road shows across the U.S., Asia, and the UK to talk to the consultants about how are we looking in our business, what are we doing in our business, how are we growing it, where are we going? We did a full blown training on all of the retail sectors at the Invesco [interface], fixed income the time and the place is now as I mentioned in the earlier comments. We also went through that obviously we became a PPIP manager, and now its one of the PPIP managers. Again we launched the Invesco Mortgage Capital REIT that was launched. So what we did during 2009 is really say in every aspect of our business, let's bolster it, let's solidify it and lets say okay be prepared for the future.
And so what has happened from that is we have gotten more consulting conversations going on. We have gotten higher levels of RFPs. We have gone more discussions going on, which is exactly what leads to two more sales. So one of the things that I have been saying and I will continue to say is that 2009 was a year that we positioned ourselves for the future, and that plus all the things I have said plus is very, very exciting Van Kampen merger I believe very strongly that 2010 is the future. We are really poised to do great things in fixed income this year.

And then it's offsetting kind of other elements and other expenses in other parts of the P&L. So in that it's saving money and we do think it's the right approach for us to continue to grow that. So I would say that's kind of one point.
On G&A, there is some seasonality there typically in the fourth quarter and the second quarter, there's a spike offer about $1.5 million of every time mailings go out in Europe and UK as you'll see some spike up there. Also in terms of product launches, that can be a little bit hard to predict as to when those things happen. So I don't want to say it's non-recurring, because we do tend to launch new products and have plans to launch new products, but some of the pickup that you saw quarter-over-quarter is really because of business activity picking up.
Once again I think it’s a good point, I assume I could say that’s a travel which has been constrained as a general matter is something that we're beginning to travel more and go out and work on and do things of that nature. So that's the productive part it. So general guidance is there may some return going down to a lower level, but I wouldn't take it down to the Q3 level, because I think that would not be a correct run rate.

So as we have looked through them at the macro level; number one, generally we think they are very consistent with the expectations as we have worked and the industry has worked closely on this issue; number two, they are going to be managing money market products much more aligned and much more closely to the way we've been managing them for over 20 years; and then finally, I would just conclude by directly answering your question that, no, we do not believe there are going to be any material changes from what we have seen.

And the impact of those are about $0.022 also on margin was about 29%. So if you added all that back and we wanted to do that, the margin, adjusted margin would be 32.3%, and EPS would be $0.29. So again, it depends on what you want to take as one-time.
And the reason I could qualify, the Canadian service is definitely pension charge is more one-off. Payroll expense when stock and assets depends on the stock price at the time of divesting, so that could be one of those things that happens in the future quarter, but this one was a little exception on the sense of kind of how large it was.

I think if you go back to 2007 that number was in the high-40s. And so there's an element there that would drive our efficiency rate at 53 basis points, where sort of an Q3 '08 levels, but if you go back to '07, the effective fee rate was as a much higher level high 50s, low 60s even. So getting to that can be done most effectively by the market but obviously we can't count on that. I think the other part of that is definitely going to have an impact, would be the continued launch and the attractiveness of the product that we're offering on the alternative side. So Wilbur Ross is a perfect example of some of those funds have a very high fee. We have talked about fund five at some point being something that could happen in 2010.
So I do think, you can do the math as well as I can, but a $4 billion asset that's coming in a 150 basis points can definitely move the dial in the year, and the more that we can do of those types of things the better and certainly that is where we're seeing a lot of the interest from the consultants and clients in terms of our capability.

And then within that, again, the traditional advice channel whether it'd be broker dealers and regional, we will be very, very strong.

So if you look across the spectrum, by channel, within the United States with the investment capabilities we have and the ability to deliver them in really any vehicle that the clients want them and it sets us up very, very strongly for some real strong success.

We think that those opportunities exist in terms of the combining platforms, technology, stream lines and product lines and so forth. The opportunities beyond that are areas that I think will fall into consideration only as we look at these things broadly across Invesco, and its only the process where we're looking to find ways to bring the parts of the firm together more effectively. We don't have any insight at this point that the $70 million grows to something different. And I don't think we're in a position right now to talk about that. I think if there's one area where we feel most excited at least from what we're seeing right now is the ability to have more distribution synergies than originally in our modeling. And again, it's hard to quantify those elements. But when you think about the potential of having platforms open up for both their products and our products that they traditionally have not experienced.

Well, probably the most important one is on the UK, and the only thing I can say is their performance over the last three months has been spectacular, just because I think they have more than 90% of their assets meeting peers and benchmarks as some of the financial stocks have sort of given up some of the gains they got for the full year of 2009. So depending on your review of financials I think it will have a lot to do with, how well the one-year numbers kind of shape up going into 2010 and specifically Q1. I think to assume that there's going to enough to actually move the one-year numbers by Q1, that I couldn't really tell you specifically, other than the trend, I would say, is encouraging. And so I wouldn't want to provide any sense of total pessimism that there's no more performance fees coming from the UK. That would probably be an incorrect way to interpret what we're showing you here. I do think near term, it's still a question.
I think in terms of the other products. Real estate continues to be very strong, direct real estate very strong. And the quant products, I think there obviously is some maybe a little bit more mixes depending on which product you're looking at. But it’s a very strong performance, and some less strong, but they have not jet generated, got enough above benchmark to generate performance fees. And again it's not something that I would necessarily guide you to expect in Q1.

And when you consider that the flow has been coming from equity that's really quite astonishing considering the market that we've been in.
So one level that's interesting, good news, the bad news is we haven't seen these strong fixed income flows, and the reason is we've not been recognized broadly as a fixed income manager that in fact we are. So we just need to continue to make that progress. And to your point at least on the retail side, I do think one of the real strengths that's coming out of the combination with Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen is depth and breadth of our combined distribution capability broadly throughout United States, and I think that should make a difference.

This is Marty Flanagan and I'm here with Loren and we will be speaking to the presentation that's available on the website if you are so inclined to follow.

This is Marty Flanagan and I'm here with Loren and we will be speaking to the presentation that's available on the website if you are so inclined to follow. We'll do a review of the business, give an update on the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen combination, Loren will go into the financial results, and then we will open up to Q&A.
So just to start with, if you take a quick overview look at the quarter, it was a strong quarter, continued strength in investment results, further improvement in net flows, it was the strongest quarter of net flows we've had since the fourth quarter of the year 2000. So quite a period. Strong operating results, offset by foreign exchange and also in industry trends away from money market funds, and the high level update of Van Kampen, we expect - Van Kampen and Morgan Stanley, we expect to close on June 1st, and we will get into some details of revised synergies, which are meaningful - meaningfully better than our initial thoughts.
So with that, if you take a look, I'd like to do a quick summary of the results. We ended March 31st with $419 billion in assets under management. That was down from $423 billion in the prior quarter. What that resulted in, obviously, was a slight decrease in operating income first quarter versus fourth quarter, down 2.6%. The - during the quarter, we were very disciplined on the expense side of the business; with the decrease in revenue, what we were able to do was have a margin of 33.6% versus 33.2% in the fourth quarter last year. Also during the first quarter, the dividend will be $0.11 per share, which is a 7.3% increase versus the fourth quarter of last year.
So if we take a look at flows on the next page, you can see gross flows were $21 billion and you can see that just the increase in gross flows is really what's leading the improvement in net flows. Our long-term net flows are $3.7 billion. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter of positive flows for Invesco. And as I mentioned, it's the best quarter of net flows in the fourth quarter of year 2010.
And what we are seeing across the industry in the money fund business is that low yield and people seeking yield and greater returns continue to have outflows and money funds moving, still tends to be right now into fixed income products. That said, our money funds team continues to just do a very, very good job, high quality team.
  Taking a look at flows, by the different channels what you will see is largely from this quarter, it was gross sales in the institutional channel that was a real contributor to positive overall flows for Invesco. During the quarter, IVR, which is the mortgage capital closed-end fund that has been in the market for over a year now, they had a capital raise in January, raising $171 million in this year - a press release just went up this morning, they just raised another $185 million just as of last night, just got prices last night.
Also on Tuesday, we announced the final close of the mortgage recovery fund. This is the fund that's part of the U.S. Treasury's PPIP program. We closed the fund with $1.46 billion of equity commitments. It's - and it's performing very, very well. So that's all good news for us.
The retail business continues to perform well. As I said, it's the fifth quarter of the flows. We saw strong net flows in U.K., Europe, and United States, and also the private wealth management had its 12th quarter of net inflows also.
Taking a look at high level performance, what you will see again is a - on a three-year basis, very strong with 73% of the assets under management beating peers, five years 78%. The one-year number was weaker than three and five years, largely what happened in that March to March period when there was that rally.
We have been conservatively positioned in our portfolio and as you would imagine, in a rally like that, we would tend to underperform. That said, the teams are doing very, very well and very focused on their investment disciplines. And as always, the very detailed charts of performance area-by-area are in the appendix to this presentation.
On the next page, just a couple of areas where I like performance. Invesco Aim continues to have a strong performance, Morningstar ratings are near the highest level since the year 2000. Lipper in Canada awarded Invesco Trimark the Group Equity Award over the last three-year period, which is good and you are also seeing the short-term performance improve strongly there.
65% of Invesco Asia-Pacific assets remain above their long-term benchmarks. Invesco
Perpetual, again, has very strong long-term performance, 94% of the assets beating over a five-year period. And continued strength in performance on quantitative strategies, global equity, and within the fixed income area, cash, high yield, and muni bonds in particular.
  So with that, I'd like to move into an update of the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen combination and those that are following, it's page 11 that I'm on right now. And from just the initial announcement, we've talked that the combination aligns very well for our long-term strategic direction and it meets all our acquisition criteria for the combination.
We view the combination as a real opportunity to enhance already our very, very strong investment management teams, expanding the depth and breadth of our investment strategies and the vehicles that we can offer clients really give us a very, very broad capability to meet our client needs. And then finally, it is such a tremendous opportunity for us to deepen our relationship with clients and just have a much stronger distribution capability.
So a quick update on the combination. So June 1st is coming quickly, our focus is very much on - to be effective from that day forward from - and as we learn more about the business, you will see we've revised our synergies based on that and they are meaningfully stronger than what we thought originally. But we are on track for a June 1st close.
  Let me give you some highlights of that to give you a sense of that. You will see that the investment teams are obviously being resourced, our focus has been to make sure that they are not diverted at all where they can continue to focus on managing their portfolios, the combined sales teams will provide very broad, deep coverage to all the channels in the United States here following our top clients also that are currently undergoing very intensive cross training across the product lineup.
The overall structure of the business is in place and as I communicated, we have very extensive plans to make sure that our colleagues at Morgan Stanley and Van Kampen when they transition over on June 1st, they are up and running and effective. Also on track is the operation IT efforts. The global operating platform will be in place at close and the transfer agency for the U.S. mutual fund business will also be converted at close.
  So again, you can tell our absolute focus has been on making sure by the time we close on June 1st that we begin to offer benefits to our clients and shareholders and the people of the organization. So I think good news on that front.
So let's spend a minute on some of the momentum within Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen. As you can see, if you follow the asset grow forward, at the time of the combination, they - Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen had about $119 billion under management, at the end of March to $123 billion in assets under management. You will also note that in Q4 last year, there was approximately $2.8 billion in outflows; in the first quarter of this year, it's about $700 million in outflows. So an improving higher asset and an improving flow trend.
What also though is extremely impressive and obviously important, if you look at the relative investment performance over one, three, and five years, at September 30th, '09, it was very strong at 69%, 72%, and 73% one, three, five. Years now, if you look at what the investment teams have done, one year literally 88% of the portfolios that are beating peers, three years 79%, five years 77%. So really very, very strong as we get close to the combination.
The other thing that we wanted to do was be responsive to what does the organization look like, how does it match up against industry trends, so what the analyst community is thinking about how successful could we be. And so what we want to do is highlight a couple of areas and one of the market shifts that we anticipate happening is that there is going to be increased demand for U.S. equities and international equities and all of us are keenly aware - if you look at the last 12 months, there's literally only been 17% of the flows going into equities in the U.S. mutual fund market.
So how do we look at after close? Literally 63% of our retail assets will be in equities. There is also - if you look at the relative performance, it is very, very strong for U.S. and international equities. 80% of the international/global assets are rated 4 and 5 star by Morningstar, 97% of the domestic core assets are 4 and 5-rated, 66% of the equity AUM are 4 and 5-star rated. So if you believe there is going to be a movement towards equities, we are positioned very, very well. Also within - there is probably going to be increased demand for munis and you also know that the combined firm's muni position is going to be very strong too.
We all know the growing opportunity in the retirement market. The firm becomes very well positioned against that with $56 billion in DC assets, strong distribution coverage, strong range of not just investment capabilities, but packaging into that marketplace.
The other area is growing demand for ETF and structured products. We are the fourth largest ETF provider with $50 billion in ETFs. What comes into this transaction also is Van Kampen has a UIT business, they are the second largest in the industry and it is a very specific structured product capability that is attractive to a group of advisors and that is going to, again, be an additional factor for us as we move forward.
And then finally, increasing focus within the distribution landscape. Again, I think all of us are keenly aware that the top five broker/dealer organizations, top five planners are just becoming stronger and stronger. We end up being a leading partner with these very important distribution channels. And again, our - the depth and breadth of our coverage is really quite strong in these channels.
So that's the backdrop of some trends that we see happening and how we match up against it. So if you move on to page 16, what we do want to do is give you an update on the accretion, dilution synergies that we talked about. So originally when we came forward, we thought it would be $0.13 a share in the first year from what we had known at the time of the signing of the transaction.
  What we like to do is first talk about the areas that we can control. So when you look at expense synergies, our estimate now is basically $80 million to $85 million in the first year. That's up from what was $70 million and is still largely in the areas that we talked about, product streamlining properties and moving to the single operating platform. When we move to a steady state, what that translates into in year two is $90 million to $95 million a year in expense savings.
The other area that we'd update is really what is the flow attrition from this combination. Originally, we thought it would be about $10 billion out. We now think it would be about $5 billion out.
And now, moving into the area underlying is these are a set of assumptions. They are areas that we can't control, it relates to the market and the flows. So our base assumption is that the markets go to a normal state and with that, we think blended return between equity and fixed income is 6%. That's one of the key assumptions.
The other key assumption is that with respect to flows for the Van Kampen business where there are net flows now in the second year, we think the punch ratio - the punch ratio that we used is 3.4%. What that translates into is what was $0.13 a share is at the end of the first year; after the closing is $0.17 a share; after the second year, $0.19 a share. So a meaningful increase from what we previously discussed.
If you flip the page, just to give you an update on where we are on timing, we are just about done with phase one. It's well on track, as I outlined, we - all indication is we are going to close on June 1st. What we will then do is very quickly, as an organization, get very focused on consideration of product changes, mergers, and the like.
Once management makes a set of recommendations, then it must be evaluated and approved by the Fund Boards and that's a very, very diligent process that has gone through. After the Fund Boards approve that, it goes to shareholders and we think that process will take nine to 12 months. And after that period, we will be in what we would say a steady state moving forward as we operate.
So collectively, we feel that Invesco and Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen, the combination, it's a much stronger organization. Clients are going to just be that much better off, employees are going to be better off, shareholders are going to be better off. I think it's just going to be a great combination. We are very excited about it and literally, across all the areas that you consider, we think we are in a better position.
I'm going to stop there and turn it over to Loren.

During the quarter, you will see that we saw a continued momentum as Marty mentioned in our long-term net flows, also market gains, but offset by net outflows in our money market funds. And notably, some unfavorable foreign exchan",1147,"Thanks very much, Marty. During the quarter, you will see that we saw a continued momentum as Marty mentioned in our long-term net flows, also market gains, but offset by net outflows in our money market funds. And notably, some unfavorable foreign exchange resulting in $3.5 billion of decline in our AUM.
We ended the quarter with $419.6 billion in AUM. That's down 28% since the end of December and the average AUM also declined marginally by 0.6% to $417.6 billion. Primarily, as a result of the quarter-over-quarter declines in performance fees and transaction fees, which we'll talk about a little bit later, you will see that our net revenue yields in Q1 declined by 1.7 basis points and ultimately had a small impact to day count in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter.
So now let's turn to the operating results. As we indicated previously in our March 12th 8-K filing, we have expanded our non-GAAP financial measures, hopefully to improve the transparency of our core business. Given the required adoption of FAS 167, which we've talked about in the past and we had to adopt it in Q1, but also to reflect the impact of the pending Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen combination. And so the operating results that were shown here reflect this new non-GAAP presentation.
You will see that net revenues declined $21.4 million, about 3.8% quarter-over-quarter. Unfavorable movements in the foreign exchange rates resulted in of about $7 million of this decrease. And drilling down on to this aggregate number, you will see that investment management fees fell by 1.7% or about $10.8 million and that was, again, primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange, largely the depreciation of British pound against the U.S. dollar and also fewer revenue earning days in Q1 versus Q4, which is 90 versus 92.
Service and distribution revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by 1%. This was despite the decline in average AUM. As we mentioned on our fourth quarter call, certain annual fund expense recovery limits were reached in Canada, resulting in lower-than-expected revenue for the fourth quarter.
Performance fees in Q4 came in at $1.4 million and that was a reduction of $5.4 million quarter-over-quarter and you will also see that other revenues fell by $6.6 million to $11.3 million as a result of lower transaction commission within our real estate and private equity. You'll remember that we provided a slide in Q4 that highlighted the potential for lower performance fees and other revenues in Q1. And I will emphasize, however, that they remain very difficult to forecast. Third party distribution, service, and advisory expenses declined marginally, 0.2% in line with lower investment management and service and distribution fees.
And moving on down the slide, moving to expenses, you will see that adjusted operating expenses at $361 million declined quarter-over-quarter by $16.5 million or 4.4%. The primary driver of this reduction was lower compensation expense. However, that was combined with foreign exchange. FX reduced our adjusted operating expenses by $6 million out of the $16.5 million.
Employee compensation expenses decreased by $11 million or 4.3% versus the fourth quarter. This $11 million decline is explained by two factors. First, there was about $8 million of unusual expenses in Q4, as you remember, which included a pension charge and some payroll taxes related to the vesting certain large stock grants. And the second piece was - or is $3.5 million of compensation reduction due primarily to FX. Now, the seasonally higher levels of payroll taxes that occurred in Q1 were fully offset by lower variable compensation in the quarter, which include both bonus and sales commissions.
Our marketing expenses decreased by $2.5 million or 8.1%, largely due to a reduction in client events, but also due to the impact of FX. Property, office, and technology decreased $1.5 million or $1.4 million, also due to the foreign exchange. G&A expenses came in at $44.8 million in the quarter. That was down $2.1 million versus the prior quarter and as again you'll note, the fourth quarter included seasonally higher fund expenses due to year-end mailings in U.K. and continental Europe, as well as some professional expenses related to new fund launches.
So despite the net revenue decline of $21.4 million, we are - we were able to mitigate this with very, I'd say, good disciplined expense management and so our adjusted operating income declined by only $4.5 million or $4.9 million to about $183 million.
One other point is that you will note that in our non-GAAP presentation, equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates no longer reflects our China JV. We now include those revenues and expenses from our JV in China to our adjusted operating results. And you can see a reconciliation of this in the appendix of the press release.
Below the line in Q1, we did incur a $5 million non-cash charge and so this - approximately half of this was due to negative FX on some of our inter-company loans, which was a non-cash impact and the rest was due to a write-down of a portion of our seed capital portfolio, that was other than temporary impairment, again a non-cash impact.
The effective tax rate declined to 28.7% or - sorry, increased to 28.7% versus 26.2% in the fourth quarter, largely due to the mix of our assets and revenues. And then - so adjusted EPS came in at $0.27 for the quarter and the adjusted net operating margin was - came in at 33.6%, slightly above the fourth quarter.
Moving to the next page, just - before I turn things to Marty, I just want to note that we are making some changes going forward to our monthly AUM release, beginning with our April release. So we will now provide ending AUM with asset class detail that's consistent with our earnings presentations and furthermore, in our effort to align with industry standards and also present our businesses in a more consistent and complete manner, we will start including assets for the Powershares, QQQs and the Deutsche Bank or the DB Powershares ETFs. Currently, these assets are not included in our AUM or flows, and given the limited definition of AUM that we previously used.
And in addition to our normal disclosures going forward, we will be providing a supplemental schedule that will break out EPS and constantly managed AUM which will now be counted as part of our total AUM. And so in the appendix in today's presentation on page 37, you will see that new format for AUM disclosure going forward, as well as a historical representation of the data going back five quarters and we will provide quarter-to-quarter average AUM when relevant and a qualitative statement on any material activity during the month going forward.
So with that, let me turn it back to Marty and then we can get to Q&A

What will likely happen during this is always - I think we put ourselves in a position to be up and running and as effective as we can at least from my historical experience, has probably been the best that I can associate it with.
That said, what's going to happen and as you get too close and then in the next couple of quarters afterwards, on the sales distribution side, it will probably slow down a little bit because what happens is realignment of the territories for the wholesalers, the big distribution partners are making sure that they go through and do all their diligence again and making sure that we've not done anything that they are not happy with and the like. And then it literally starts to pick up, probably the second quarter or the third quarter as we start moving forward.

Well, on expenses, I mean, other than the impact on FX, no - I mean, in the first quarter, it was pretty straightforward. There wasn't any noise, so to speak. Obviously, you had the seasonal payroll taxes, but as I mentioned, that was offset by lower variable compensation. So I mean, if there was anything that was worth noting, those were the two things that were happening in the quarter. The other expenses, I think, were pretty much in line with where we thought they would be.
In terms of cash flow guidance 2011, I mean, our priorities have not changed in terms of using our cash for funding capital needs for the business is the first call. The next would be acquisitions if they make sense strategically. And if they also have the financial merit that we require and then we'd be into somewhat increasing dividend and pay - and then stock buyback.
The only other thing I would note on top of that we overlay, still a strong desire and a continued focus on maintaining a strong financial position on our balance sheet that there is value to the organization to have a certain amount of cash sitting on the balance sheet, which would make us less vulnerable if there were disruptions in the market as we saw obviously in 2009 and 2008.
So our goal is to certainly run with enough cash, excess cash. That would allow us to have that flexibility and you can say somewhere around $500 million in excess cash above what's needed in the European subgroup. And so that would be kind of a - just a stake put in the ground right now, but I think to the extent they were generating a lot of cash flow, which we should post this deal and we've got those metrics in place in terms of the cash, we are probably back into certainly either whether it's an acquisition or a stock buyback. I mean, one of the two would be the next logical place where the cash would be used.

So I think that's one of the things misunderstood about our fixed income business and how we are participating. The fundamental fact is if you look where we are strong, it's a big - liquidity business is big and strong and also, it's bank loans, CDOs, high yield, those are strengths where we have good teams and (inaudible) middle of that spectrum and some good performance. Largely, as I talked earlier, just about if you look at the results from IVR and net participation in the PPIP, very, very strong teams.
But when you look at where all the flows are going, will it be global fixed income, in the retail market or some of the core fixed income mandate, that has just not been territory that has been an area we have penetrated on the retail business historically. So that's really what that gap is and I think that's probably most misunderstood in the market.
  Institutionally, the global fixed income product is getting some real traction and we had some good core numbers, but again it's different than what's happened on the retail side of the business.
So a point - so to answer your question, what I really think is going to continue the fixed income business is going to be stronger when we talked about it a couple of calls ago, was there is a strong muni capability that we have, we have more of a - sort of the national muni presence. Van Kampen has a long history in muni bonds, largely state-specific, they also have a good high yield product too, which complements ours. So we are going to be very, very strong in muni market. So I think if we think we are going into a rising cost environment, we are going to be positioned very well there.
So I think we will see some good strong growth in the muni part of the market for us on fixed income, regardless of a movement to equities. But to me, what we are trying to highlight on page 15, the key trends, so if you believe that flows into U.S. and international equities that's 17% of industry flows is too low, we are going to be a strong beneficiary of a movement away from equities into fixed income. And I don't think we'll be cannibalized that much on the fixed income side just because of the way that we are positioned in fixed income.

Now, you probably have to add the, at a minimum, the Aim revenues and costs in to look at that on a combined basis, but I guess the question is how would you look at the operating margin of those two businesses combined relative to your company total, because it looks like it could be considerably higher?

That's kind of the definite goal. Clearly, having more assets under management allows one to improve one's margins.
And so I think it is clearly going to help our margin in terms of bringing on the business. So the firm will benefit significantly. I wouldn't say we are going to be at a 50% margin, but I do think we feel very confident that we can get back to margins that were sort of in high to the numbers that you've seen historically in 2007, with this acquisition and also with some equity markets behind us.

There is really two places where we typically have realized performance fees in the year, the first quarter and the fourth quarter and that's just the way that these contracts have been set up and just to remind people, it's really a small part of the U.K. business, some investment trusts that have these triggers.
I ask that very same question all the time, kind of are we going to get the performance fees or not and the reality, it's very hard to predict as to whether we will or not. I think the idea that it is within the realm of possibility that we could see it in the fourth quarter, but the fourth quarter is still pretty far away relative to where we are today.
So certainly in the second quarter on the U.K. side, we wouldn't traditionally see any performance fees. The other place where we've been able to generate performance fees on a quarterly basis, second quarter and third quarter had been in our quantitative group, quantitative equities. Right now, I think where they are relative to the benchmark, that's probably not a realistic assumption for us to be looking for.
So again, I would say it's hard for me to guide people on performance fees, because it's a tough one to predict and - but I'd say where we are right now in the first quarter is probably not a reasonable - I mean, it's probably a reasonable point to think about going forward and we will continue to update you if we see any change.

You match that up against really the improving talent on the sales servicing side, I think that's going to be a very important factor for us going forward.
It is also what is the appetite. So where we continue to see the appetite, it is - stable value continues to be an appetite, real estate continues to be very, very attractive to people, bank loans, CLOs, CDOs, those types of things are very attractive to people. This is the things that we are seeing.
On the equity side - actually global fixed income is another area that we are seeing quite a bit of interest. On the equity side, the global equity capability is getting more interest. So it's pretty broad. But again, it's very reflective of what clients are looking for and it's different in different parts of the world, where if you go to U.K. and Europe, part of the quantitative team is based there. So there is a global equity quantitative product that's been doing very, very well in the U.K. So it literally is different region by region.

This is Marty Flanagan, and I'm here with Loren, and we'll be speaking to the presentation that's available on the website, if you're so inclined to follow. We'll review the business, give an update on the Morgan Stanley Van Kampen combination, Loren will go into the financial results and then we'll open it up to Q&A.
So just to start with, if you'd take a quick overview look at the quarter, it was a strong quarter; continued strength in investment results; further improvement in net flows. It was the strongest quarter of net flows we've had since the fourth quarter of the year 2000, so quite a period. Strong operating results offset by foreign exchange and also an industry trend away from money market funds. And the high-level update on Van Kampen, we expect -- the Van Kampen Morgan Stanley we expect to close on June 1, and we'll get into some details of our revised synergies which are meaningfully better than our initial thoughts.
So with that, if you’d take a look, I'd like to do a quick summary of the results. We ended March 31 with $419 billion in Assets under management. That was down from $423 billion in the prior quarter. What that resulted in, obviously, was a slight decrease in operating income first quarter versus fourth quarter, down 2.6%. During the quarter, we were very disciplined on the expense side of the business with a decrease in revenue. What we're able to do was have a margin of 33.6% versus 33.2% in the fourth quarter last year. Also during the first quarter, the dividend will be $0.11 per share, which is a 7.2% increase versus the fourth quarter of last year.
So if we take a look at the flows, on the next page you can see gross flows were $21 billion and you can see that. Just the increase in gross flows is really what's leading the improvement in net flows. Our long-term net flows were $3.7 billion. It represents the fifth consecutive quarter of positive flows from Invesco. And as I mentioned, it's the best quarter of net flows since the fourth quarter of the year 2000. And what we are seeing across the industry in the money fund business is that low yield and people seeking yield and greater returns, continue to have outflows in money funds moving; still tends to be right now into fixed income products. That said, our money funds seem to just do a very, very good job, a high-quality team.
Taking a look at flows by the different channels, what you'll see largely from this quarter, it was gross sales in the institutional channel that was a real contributor to positive overall flows for Invesco. During the quarter, IVR, which is the mortgage capital closed-end fund that has been in the market for over a year now, they had a capital raise in January, raising $171 million. And a press release just went out this morning, they just raised another $185 million just as of last night, just got priced last night.
Also on Tuesday, we announced the final close of the Mortgage Recovery Fund. This is the fund that's part of the U.S. Treasury’s PPIP program. We closed the fund with $1.46 billion of equity commitment, and it's performing very, very well. So that's all good news for us. 
The Retail business continues to perform well. As I said, it's the fifth quarter of positive flows. We saw strong net flows in the U.K., Europe and the United States. And also, the Private Wealth Management had its 12th quarter of net inflows also.
Taking a look at high-level performance, what you'll see again is on a three-year basis, very strong, with 73% of the Assets under management being peers; five years, 78%. The one-year number was weaker than three and five years. Largely what's happened in that March-to-March period, when there was that rally, we have been conservatively positioned in our portfolios. And as you would imagine, in a rally like that, we would tend to underperform. That said, the teams are doing very, very well and very focused on their investment disciplines. And as always, the very detailed charts of performance area-by-area are in the appendix of this presentation.
Of the next page, just a couple of areas where I highlight performance. Invesco Aim continues to have strong performance. The Morningstar ratings are near the highest level since year 2000. Lipper, in Canada, awarded Invesco Trimark the Group Equity Award for the last three-year period, which is good, and you're also seeing the short-term performance improve strongly there. 
65% of Invesco Asia-Pacific assets remain above their long-term benchmarks. Invesco Perpetual, again, had very strong long-term performance, 94% of the assets beating peers over a five-year period. And continued strength and performance in the Quantitative Strategies, Global Equity, and within the Fixed Income area, cash, high-yield and muni bonds in particular.
So with that, I'd like to move into an update of the Morgan Stanley Van Kampen combination, and those that are following, it's Page 11 that I'm on right now. And from just the initial announcement, we talked that the combination aligns very well for a long-term strategic direction, and it meets all our acquisition criteria for combinations. We view the combination as a real opportunity to enhance already our very, very strong investment management teams, expanding the depth and breadth of our investment strategies and the vehicles that we can offer clients really give us a very, very broad capability to meet our client's needs. And then finally, there’s just a tremendous opportunity for us to deepen our relationship with clients and just have a much stronger distribution capability.
So a quick update on the combination. So June 1 is coming quickly. Our focus is very much to be effective from that day forward. And as we've learned more about the business, you'll see we've revised our synergies based on that and they are meaningfully stronger than what we thought originally. But we are on track for a June 1 close. 
Let me give you some highlights of that, to give you a sense of that. You'll see that the investment teams are obviously fully resourced. Our focus has been to make sure that they are not diverted at all, that they can continue to focus on managing their portfolios. The combined sales teams will provide very broad, deep coverage to all the channels in the United States here, following our top clients also. They are currently undergoing very intensive cross training across the product lineups. The overall structure of the business is in place and they’re communicated. We have very extensive plans to make sure that our colleagues at Morgan Stanley Van Kampen, when they transition over on June 1, they're up and running and effective.
Also on track is the operation IT efforts. The global operating platform will be in place. We’ll have that at close, and the transfer agency for the U.S. Mutual Fund business will also be converted at close. So again, you can tell our absolute focus has been making sure of a timely close on June 1, that we begin to offer benefits to our clients and shareholders and the people at the organization. So I'd say we have good news on that front.
So let's spend a minute on some of the momentum within Morgan Stanley Van Kampen. As you can see, if you follow the assets full-forward, at the time of the combination, Morgan Stanley Van Kampen had about $119 billion under management; at the end of March, $123 billion in Assets under management. You'll also note that in Q4 last year, there was approximately $2.8 billion in outflows. In the first quarter of this year, it's about .7, $700 million in outflow. So an improving higher assets and an improving flow trend.
What also, though, is extremely impressive and obviously important, if you look at the relative investment performance over one, three and five years, at September 30, ’09 was very strong, at 69%, 72% and 73%, one through five years. Now if you look at what the investment teams have done, the one-year, literally 88% of the portfolios are beating peers, three years, 79%; five years, 77%. So really very, very strong as we get close to the combination.
The other thing that we wanted to do was be responsive to what does the organization look like, how does it match up against industry trends, so as the analyst community is thinking about how successful could we be. And so what we want to do is highlight a couple of areas. One of the market shifts that we anticipate happening is that there’s going to be increased demand for U.S. equities and international equities. And all of us are keenly aware, if you look at the last 12 months, it’s literally only been 17% of the flows going into equities in the U.S. mutual fund market.
So how do we look after close? Literally, 63% of our retail assets will be in equities. There is also, if you look at the relative performance, it is very, very strong for U.S. and international equities. 80% of the international global assets are rated four- and five-star by Morningstar, 97% of the domestic core assets are four- and five-star rated, 66% of the equity AUMs are four- and five-star rated. So if you believe there’s going to be a movement towards equities, we are positioned very, very well. Also, there’s probably going to be increased demand for munies, and you also know that with the combined firm, muni position is going to be very strong, too.
We all know the growing opportunity in the retirement market. The firm becomes very well positioned against that with $56 billion in DC assets, strong distribution coverage, strong range of not just investment capabilities, but packaging into that marketplace. 
The other area is growing demand for ETFs and structured products. Be the fourth largest ETF provider with $50 billion in ETFs. What comes into this transaction also is Van Kampen has a new IT business. They are the second largest in the industry, and it is a very specific structured product capability that is attractive to a group of advisers. And that is going to, again, be an additional factor for us as we move forward. 
And then finally, increasing focus within the distribution landscape. Again, I think all of us are keenly aware that the top five broker/dealer organizations, top five planners are just becoming stronger and stronger. We end up being a leading partner with these very important distribution channels. And again, the depth and breadth of our coverage is really quite strong in these channels.
So that's the backdrop of some trends that we see happening and how we match up against it. So if you move on to Page 16, what we do want to do is give you an update on the accretion dilution synergies there that we’ve talked about. 
Originally when we came forward, we thought it'd be $0.13 a share in the first year from what we had known at the time of the signing of the transaction. What we’d like to do is first talk about the areas that we can control. So when you look at expense synergies, our estimate now is $80 million, $85 million. In the first year, that's up from what was $70 million and is still largely in the areas that we talked about, product streamlining, properties, and moving to the single operating platform. When we move to a steady state, what that translates into in year two is $90 million to $95 million a year in expense savings.
The other area that we’d update is really whether the – the flow attrition from this combination. Originally we thought it would be about $10 billion out. We now think it will be about $5 billion out. 
Now moving into the area, underlying – these are stated assumptions, areas that we can’t control that relates to the market and the flows. So our base assumption is that markets will go to a normal state. And with that, we think blended return between equity and fixed income is 6%. That's one of the key assumptions. 
The other key assumption is that with respect to flows for the Van Kampen business, whether net outflows now, in the second year we think the punch ratio –- the punch ratio that we use at 3.4%. What that translates into is what was $0.13 a share at the end of the first year after the closing it’s $0.17 a share; after the second year, $0.19 a share. So a meaningful increase from what we had previously discussed.
If you flip the page, just to give you an update on where we are on timing, we’re just about done with Phase I. It’s well on track, as I outlined. All indications we’re going to close on June 1. What we will then do is very quickly, as an organization, get very focused on consideration of product changes, mergers and the like. Once management makes a set of recommendations, they must be evaluated and approved by the fund board. And that's a very, very diligent process that is gone through. After the fund board’s approved that, it goes to shareholders. And we think that process will take 9 to 12 months. And after that period, we will be, what we would say, is a steady state, moving forward as we operate.
So collectively, we feel that Invesco and Morgan Stanley Van Kampen, the combination, is a much stronger organization. Clients are that much better off. Employees are going to be better off. Shareholders are going to be better off. We think this is going to be a great combination. We’re very excited about it and, literally, across all the areas that you consider, we think we are in a better position. So I'm going to stop there and turn it over to Loren."
384779,100860494,58276,"Invesco Ltd., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Invesco Ltd.","Executives","Thanks very much, Marty. During the quarter, you'll see that we saw continued momentum, as Marty mentioned, in our long-term net flows, also market gains but offset by net outflows in our money market funds and, notably, some unfavorable foreign exchange,",1116,"Thanks very much, Marty. During the quarter, you'll see that we saw continued momentum, as Marty mentioned, in our long-term net flows, also market gains but offset by net outflows in our money market funds and, notably, some unfavorable foreign exchange, resulting in a $3.5 billion decline in our AUM.
We ended the quarter with $419.6 billion in AUM. That’s down .8% since end of December. And the average AUM also declined marginally by .6% to $417.6 billion, primarily the result of the quarter-over-quarter declines and the performance fees and transaction fees, which we’ll talk about a little later. You'll see that our net revenue yield in Q1 declined by 1.7 basis points, and also we had a small impact to day count in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter.
So now let’s turn to the operating results. As we indicated previously in our March 12 8-K filing, we have expanded our non-GAAP financial measures, hopefully to improve the transparency of our core business, given the required adoption of FAS [Financial Accounting Standards Board] 167, which we’ve talked about in the past. And we had to adopt this in Q1. But also to reflect the impact of the pending Morgan Stanley Van Kampen combination. And the operating results that we’re showing here reflect this new non-GAAP presentation.
You'll see that net revenues declined $21.4 million, about 2.8% quarter-over-quarter. Unfavorable movements in the foreign exchange rates resulted in about $7 million of this decrease. And drilling down onto this aggregate number, you'll see that investment management fees fell by 1.7% to about $7.8 million, and that was, again, primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange, largely the depreciation of the British pound against the U.S. dollar and also fewer revenue earning days in Q1 versus Q4, which is 90 versus 92.
Service and distribution revenue increased quarter-over-quarter by 1%. This was despite the decline in average AUM. As we mentioned on our fourth quarter call, certain annual fund expense recovery limits were reached in Canada, resulting in lower than expected revenues for the fourth quarter. Performance fees in Q4 came in at $1.4 million and that was a reduction of $5.4 million quarter-over-quarter. And you’ll also see that other revenues fell by $6.6 million to $11.3 million as a result of lower transaction commissions within our real estate and private equity businesses. You'll remember that we provided a slide in Q4 that highlighted the potential for lower performance fees and other revenues in Q1. And I will emphasize, however, that they remain very difficult to forecast still.
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses declined marginally, .2%, in line with lower investment management and service and division fees. 
And moving on down the slide, moving to expenses, you'll see that adjusted operating expenses of $361 million declined quarter-over-quarter by $16.5 million or 4.4%. The primary driver of this reduction was lower compensation expense, however, that was combined with foreign exchange. FX reduced our adjusted operating expenses by $6 million, 16.5. 
Our employee compensation expenses decreased by $11 million or 4.2% versus the fourth quarter. This $11 million decline is explained by two factors. First, there was about $8 million of unusual expenses in Q4, as you’ll remember, which included a pension charge and some payroll taxes related to the vesting of certain large stock grants. And the second phase was $3.5 million of compensation reduction due primarily to FX. Now the seasonally higher level of the payroll taxes that occurred in Q1 were fully offset by lower variable compensation in the quarter, which would include both bonus and sales commissions. 
Our marketing expenses decreased by $2.5 million or 8.1%, largely due to a reduction in client events, but also due to the impact of FX. Property, office and technology decreased $1.5 million or 1.4 million, also due to foreign exchange. G&A expenses came in at $44.8 million in the quarter. That was down 2.1 versus the prior quarter. And as again you'll note, the fourth quarter included seasonably higher fund expenses due to year-end mailings in the U.K. and Continental Europe, as well as some professional expenses related to new fund launches.
So despite the net revenue decline of $21.4 million, we were able to mitigate that with very, I’d say, good disciplined expense management. And so our adjusted operating income declined by only $4.9 million to about $183 million. 
One other point is that you'll note that in our non-GAAP presentation, equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliate no longer reflects our China JV. We now include those revenues and expenses from our JV to our adjusted operating results. And you can see a reconciliation of this in the appendix of the press release.
Below the line in Q1, we did incur a $5 million non-cash charge, and so this -- approximately half of this was due to negative effects on some of our intercompany loans, which was a non-cash impact, and the rest was due to a write-down of a portion of our capital portfolio that was other than temporary impairment. Again, a non-cash impact. 
The effective tax rate increased to 28.7% versus 26.2% in the fourth quarter, largely due to the mix of our assets and revenues. And then so adjusted EPS came in at $0.27 for the quarter, and the adjusted net operating margin came in at 33.6%, slightly above the fourth quarter.
Moving to the next page, just before I turn things over to Marty, I just want to note that we are making some changes going forward to our monthly AUM release beginning with our April release. So we’ll now provide ending AUM without the class decal that's consistent with our earnings presentations. And furthermore, in our effort to align with industry standards and also present our businesses in a more consistent and complete manner, we’ll start including assets for the PowerShares QQQ and the Deutsche Bank, or the DB PowerShares ETF. Currently these assets are not included in our AUM or flows and given the limited definition of AUM that we’d previously used. 
In addition to our normal disclosures going forward, we'll be providing a supplemental schedule that I'll break out ETFs and possibly managed AUM, which will now be counted as part of our total AUM. And so the appendix in today's presentation on Page 37, you'll see that new format for AUM disclosure going forward, as well as a historical representation of the data going back five quarters, and we will provide a quarter-to-quarter average AUM when relevant, and a qualitative statement on any material activity during the month going forward. With that, let me turn it back to Marty, and then we can get to Q&A."

And it was really just this rally that kicked in, in March, and so first part of April, it really has quite an impact on those short-term numbers. That said, you have to look at the strong teams, the strong long-term performance. If we're in a period where you’re going to get another 20% up-market, I suspect the performance would suffer some. It’s just hard to respond to that in a very specific way, other than what I would say is the long-term numbers are strong. Our teams are very consistent with how they’ve been managing the money.

Obviously, you had the seasonal payroll taxes, but as I mentioned, that was offset by lower variable compensation. So if there’s anything that was worth noting, those were the two things that were happening in the quarter. The other expenses I think were pretty much in line with where we thought they would be. In terms of cash flows in 2011, our priorities have not changed in terms of using our cash for funding capital needs for the business as the first call. The next would be acquisitions, if they make sense strategically, and if they also have the financial merit that we require. And then we’d be into somewhat increasing dividend and then stock buybacks. The only other thing I would note on top of that we overlay still a strong desire and a continued focus on maintaining a strong financial position on our balance sheet, that there’s value to the organization to have a certain amount of cash sitting on the balance sheet, which would make us less vulnerable if there were disruptions in the market, as we saw, obviously, in 2009 and 2008. So our goal is to certainly run with enough cash, excess cash and that would allow us to have that flexibility and you can say somewhere around $500 million in excess cash above what's needed in the European subgroup. So that would be kind of just a stake put in the ground right now. But I think to the extent that we’re generating a lot of cash flow, which we should, as opposed to steel, and we've got those metrics in place in terms of the cash, we’d probably back into certainly either – you know, whether as an acquisition or stock buybacks. One of the two would be the next logical place where the cash would be used."

The fundamental fact is, if you look where we are strong, it's a big -- liquidity business is big and strong. And also, it's bank loans, CDOs, high-yields. Those are the strengths where we have good teams in the middle of that spectrum and some good performance, largely due to, as I talked earlier, if you look at the results from IVR and their participation, they’re very, very strong teams. But when you look at where all the flows are going, whether it be global fixed income in the retail market or some of the core fixed income mandates, that is just not a territory that has been an area we’ve penetrated on the retail business historically. So that's really what that gap is, and I think that's probably most misunderstood in the market. Institutionally, the global fixed income product is getting some real traction and we have some good core numbers, but again, it’s different that what’s happened on the retail side of the business. So to answer your question, what I really think is going to continue, the fixed income business can be stronger. What we talked about a couple of calls ago was, there's a strong muni capability that we have. We have more of a national muni presence. Van Kampen has a long history of muni bonds, largely state specific, but also the good high yield product, too, which complements ours. So we’re going to be very, very strong in the muni market. So I think if we think we’re going to a rising tax environment, were going to be positioned fairly well there. So I think we'll see some good strong growth in the muni part of the market for us, fixed income, regardless of the movement to equities. But to me, what we're trying to highlight on Page 15, we have a key trend. If you believe that flows into U.S. and international equities at 17% of industry flows is too low, we are going to be a strong beneficiary of this movement away from equities into fixed income, and I don't think we’ll be cannibalized that much on the fixed income side, just because of the way that we are positioned in fixed income."

I ask that very same question all the time, Ken. Are we going to get the performance fees or not. And the reality is, it's very hard to predict as to whether we will or not. I think the idea is that it's within the realm of possibility that we could see it in the fourth quarter, but the fourth quarter still seems pretty far away relative to where we are today. So certainly in the second quarter on the U.K. side we wouldn’t traditionally see any performance fees. The other place where we've been able to generate performance fees on a quarterly basis, second quarter and third quarter, have been in our Quantitative group, Quantitative Equity. Right now I think where they are relative to the benchmark, it's probably not a realistic assumption for us to be looking for. So again, I would say it’s hard for me to guide people on performance fees because it's a tough one to predict.

It was the strongest quarter of net flows we've had since the fourth quarter of the year 2000, so quite a period. Strong operating results offset by foreign exchange and also an industry trend away from money market funds. And the high-level update on Van Kampen, we expect -- the Van Kampen Morgan Stanley we expect to close on June 1, and we'll get into some details of our revised synergies which are meaningfully better than our initial thoughts.
So with that, if you’d take a look, I'd like to do a quick summary of the results. We ended March 31 with $419 billion in Assets under management. That was down from $423 billion in the prior quarter. What that resulted in, obviously, was a slight decrease in operating income first quarter versus fourth quarter, down 2.6%. During the quarter, we were very disciplined on the expense side of the business with a decrease in revenue. What we're able to do was have a margin of 33.6% versus 33.2% in the fourth quarter last year. Also during the first quarter, the dividend will be $0.11 per share, which is a 7.2% increase versus the fourth quarter of last year.
So if we take a look at the flows, on the next page you can see gross flows were $21 billion and you can see that. Just the increase in gross flows is really what's leading the improvement in net flows. Our long-term net flows were $3.7 billion. It represents the fifth consecutive quarter of positive flows from Invesco. And as I mentioned, it's the best quarter of net flows since the fourth quarter of the year 2000. And what we are seeing across the industry in the money fund business is that low yield and people seeking yield and greater returns, continue to have outflows in money funds moving; still tends to be right now into fixed income products. That said, our money funds seem to just do a very, very good job, a high-quality team.
Taking a look at flows by the different channels, what you'll see largely from this quarter, it was gross sales in the institutional channel that was a real contributor to positive overall flows for Invesco. During the quarter, IVR, which is the mortgage capital closed-end fund that has been in the market for over a year now, they had a capital raise in January, raising $171 million. And a press release just went out this morning, they just raised another $185 million just as of last night, just got priced last night.
Also on Tuesday, we announced the final close of the Mortgage Recovery Fund. This is the fund that's part of the U.S. Treasury’s PPIP program. We closed the fund with $1.46 billion of equity commitment, and it's performing very, very well. So that's all good news for us. 
The Retail business continues to perform well. As I said, it's the fifth quarter of positive flows. We saw strong net flows in the U.K., Europe and the United States. And also, the Private Wealth Management had its 12th quarter of net inflows also.
Taking a look at high-level performance, what you'll see again is on a three-year basis, very strong, with 73% of the Assets under management being peers; five years, 78%. The one-year number was weaker than three and five years. Largely what's happened in that March-to-March period, when there was that rally, we have been conservatively positioned in our portfolios. And as you would imagine, in a rally like that, we would tend to underperform. That said, the teams are doing very, very well and very focused on their investment disciplines. And as always, the very detailed charts of performance area-by-area are in the appendix of this presentation.
Of the next page, just a couple of areas where I highlight performance. Invesco Aim continues to have strong performance. The Morningstar ratings are near the highest level since year 2000. Lipper, in Canada, awarded Invesco Trimark the Group Equity Award for the last three-year period, which is good, and you're also seeing the short-term performance improve strongly there. 
65% of Invesco Asia-Pacific assets remain above their long-term benchmarks. Invesco Perpetual, again, had very strong long-term performance, 94% of the assets beating peers over a five-year period. And continued strength and performance in the Quantitative Strategies, Global Equity, and within the Fixed Income area, cash, high-yield and muni bonds in particular.
So with that, I'd like to move into an update of the Morgan Stanley Van Kampen combination, and those that are following, it's Page 11 that I'm on right now. And from just the initial announcement, we talked that the combination aligns very well for a long-term strategic direction, and it meets all our acquisition criteria for combinations. We view the combination as a real opportunity to enhance already our very, very strong investment management teams, expanding the depth and breadth of our investment strategies and the vehicles that we can offer clients really give us a very, very broad capability to meet our client's needs. And then finally, there’s just a tremendous opportunity for us to deepen our relationship with clients and just have a much stronger distribution capability.
So a quick update on the combination. So June 1 is coming quickly. Our focus is very much to be effective from that day forward. And as we've learned more about the business, you'll see we've revised our synergies based on that and they are meaningfully stronger than what we thought originally. But we are on track for a June 1 close. 
Let me give you some highlights of that, to give you a sense of that. You'll see that the investment teams are obviously fully resourced. Our focus has been to make sure that they are not diverted at all, that they can continue to focus on managing their portfolios. The combined sales teams will provide very broad, deep coverage to all the channels in the United States here, following our top clients also. They are currently undergoing very intensive cross training across the product lineups. The overall structure of the business is in place and they’re communicated. We have very extensive plans to make sure that our colleagues at Morgan Stanley Van Kampen, when they transition over on June 1, they're up and running and effective.
Also on track is the operation IT efforts. The global operating platform will be in place. We’ll have that at close, and the transfer agency for the U.S. Mutual Fund business will also be converted at close. So again, you can tell our absolute focus has been making sure of a timely close on June 1, that we begin to offer benefits to our clients and shareholders and the people at the organization. So I'd say we have good news on that front.
So let's spend a minute on some of the momentum within Morgan Stanley Van Kampen. As you can see, if you follow the assets full-forward, at the time of the combination, Morgan Stanley Van Kampen had about $119 billion under management; at the end of March, $123 billion in Assets under management. You'll also note that in Q4 last year, there was approximately $2.8 billion in outflows. In the first quarter of this year, it's about .7, $700 million in outflow. So an improving higher assets and an improving flow trend.
What also, though, is extremely impressive and obviously important, if you look at the relative investment performance over one, three and five years, at September 30, ’09 was very strong, at 69%, 72% and 73%, one through five years. Now if you look at what the investment teams have done, the one-year, literally 88% of the portfolios are beating peers, three years, 79%; five years, 77%. So really very, very strong as we get close to the combination.
The other thing that we wanted to do was be responsive to what does the organization look like, how does it match up against industry trends, so as the analyst community is thinking about how successful could we be. And so what we want to do is highlight a couple of areas. One of the market shifts that we anticipate happening is that there’s going to be increased demand for U.S. equities and international equities. And all of us are keenly aware, if you look at the last 12 months, it’s literally only been 17% of the flows going into equities in the U.S. mutual fund market.
So how do we look after close? Literally, 63% of our retail assets will be in equities. There is also, if you look at the relative performance, it is very, very strong for U.S. and international equities. 80% of the international global assets are rated four- and five-star by Morningstar, 97% of the domestic core assets are four- and five-star rated, 66% of the equity AUMs are four- and five-star rated. So if you believe there’s going to be a movement towards equities, we are positioned very, very well. Also, there’s probably going to be increased demand for munis, and you also know that with the combined firm, muni position is going to be very strong, too.
We all know the growing opportunity in the retirement market. The firm becomes very well positioned against that with $56 billion in DC assets, strong distribution coverage, strong range of not just investment capabilities, but packaging into that marketplace. 
The other area is growing demand for ETFs and structured products. Be the fourth largest ETF provider with $50 billion in ETFs. What comes into this transaction also is Van Kampen has a new IT business. They are the second largest in the industry, and it is a very specific structured product capability that is attractive to a group of advisers. And that is going to, again, be an additional factor for us as we move forward. 
And then finally, increasing focus within the distribution landscape. Again, I think all of us are keenly aware that the top five broker/dealer organizations, top five planners are just becoming stronger and stronger. We end up being a leading partner with these very important distribution channels. And again, the depth and breadth of our coverage is really quite strong in these channels.
So that's the backdrop of some trends that we see happening and how we match up against it. So if you move on to Page 16, what we do want to do is give you an update on the accretion dilution synergies there that we’ve talked about. 
Originally when we came forward, we thought it'd be $0.13 a share in the first year from what we had known at the time of the signing of the transaction. What we’d like to do is first talk about the areas that we can control. So when you look at expense synergies, our estimate now is $80 million, $85 million. In the first year, that's up from what was $70 million and is still largely in the areas that we talked about, product streamlining, properties, and moving to the single operating platform. When we move to a steady state, what that translates into in year two is $90 million to $95 million a year in expense savings.
The other area that we’d update is really whether the – the flow attrition from this combination. Originally we thought it would be about $10 billion out. We now think it will be about $5 billion out. 
Now moving into the area, underlying – these are stated assumptions, areas that we can’t control that relates to the market and the flows. So our base assumption is that markets will go to a normal state. And with that, we think blended return between equity and fixed income is 6%. That's one of the key assumptions. 
The other key assumption is that with respect to flows for the Van Kampen business, whether net outflows now, in the second year we think the punch ratio –- the punch ratio that we use at 3.4%. What that translates into is what was $0.13 a share at the end of the first year after the closing it’s $0.17 a share; after the second year, $0.19 a share. So a meaningful increase from what we had previously discussed.
If you flip the page, just to give you an update on where we are on timing, we’re just about done with Phase I. It’s well on track, as I outlined. All indications we’re going to close on June 1. What we will then do is very quickly, as an organization, get very focused on consideration of product changes, mergers and the like. Once management makes a set of recommendations, they must be evaluated and approved by the fund board. And that's a very, very diligent process that is gone through. After the fund board’s approved that, it goes to shareholders. And we think that process will take 9 to 12 months. And after that period, we will be, what we would say, is a steady state, moving forward as we operate.
So collectively, we feel that Invesco and Morgan Stanley Van Kampen, the combination, is a much stronger organization. Clients are that much better off. Employees are going to be better off. Shareholders are going to be better off. We think this is going to be a great combination. We’re very excited about it and, literally, across all the areas that you consider, we think we are in a better position. So I'm going to stop there and turn it over to Loren."
384779,100860494,58447,"Invesco Ltd., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2010",2010-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Invesco Ltd.","Executives","Thanks very much, Marty. During the quarter, you'll see that we saw continued momentum, as Marty mentioned, in our long-term net flows, also market gains but offset by net outflows in our money market funds and, notably, some unfavorable foreign exchange,",1115,"Thanks very much, Marty. During the quarter, you'll see that we saw continued momentum, as Marty mentioned, in our long-term net flows, also market gains but offset by net outflows in our money market funds and, notably, some unfavorable foreign exchange, resulting in a $3.5 billion decline in our AUM.
We ended the quarter with $419.6 billion in AUM. That’s down .8% since end of December. And the average AUM also declined marginally by .6% to $417.6 billion, primarily the result of the quarter-over-quarter declines and the performance fees and transaction fees, which we’ll talk about a little later. You'll see that our net revenue yield in Q1 declined by 1.7 basis points, and also we had a small impact to day count in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter.
So now let’s turn to the operating results. As we indicated previously in our March 12 8-K filing, we have expanded our non-GAAP financial measures, hopefully to improve the transparency of our core business, given the required adoption of FAS [Financial Accounting Standards] 167, which we’ve talked about in the past. And we had to adopt this in Q1. But also to reflect the impact of the pending Morgan Stanley Van Kampen combination. And the operating results that we’re showing here reflect this new non-GAAP presentation.
You'll see that net revenues declined $21.4 million, about 2.8% quarter-over-quarter. Unfavorable movements in the foreign exchange rates resulted in about $7 million of this decrease. And drilling down onto this aggregate number, you'll see that investment management fees fell by 1.7% to about $7.8 million, and that was, again, primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange, largely the depreciation of the British pound against the U.S. dollar and also fewer revenue earning days in Q1 versus Q4, which is 90 versus 92.
Service and distribution revenue increased quarter-over-quarter by 1%. This was despite the decline in average AUM. As we mentioned on our fourth quarter call, certain annual fund expense recovery limits were reached in Canada, resulting in lower than expected revenues for the fourth quarter. Performance fees in Q4 came in at $1.4 million and that was a reduction of $5.4 million quarter-over-quarter. And you’ll also see that other revenues fell by $6.6 million to $11.3 million as a result of lower transaction commissions within our real estate and private equity businesses. You'll remember that we provided a slide in Q4 that highlighted the potential for lower performance fees and other revenues in Q1. And I will emphasize, however, that they remain very difficult to forecast still.
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses declined marginally, .2%, in line with lower investment management and service and division fees. 
And moving on down the slide, moving to expenses, you'll see that adjusted operating expenses of $361 million declined quarter-over-quarter by $16.5 million or 4.4%. The primary driver of this reduction was lower compensation expense, however, that was combined with foreign exchange. FX reduced our adjusted operating expenses by $6 million, 16.5. 
Our employee compensation expenses decreased by $11 million or 4.2% versus the fourth quarter. This $11 million decline is explained by two factors. First, there was about $8 million of unusual expenses in Q4, as you’ll remember, which included a pension charge and some payroll taxes related to the vesting of certain large stock grants. And the second phase was $3.5 million of compensation reduction due primarily to FX. Now the seasonally higher level of the payroll taxes that occurred in Q1 were fully offset by lower variable compensation in the quarter, which would include both bonus and sales commissions. 
Our marketing expenses decreased by $2.5 million or 8.1%, largely due to a reduction in client events, but also due to the impact of FX. Property, office and technology decreased $1.5 million or 1.4 million, also due to foreign exchange. G&A expenses came in at $44.8 million in the quarter. That was down 2.1 versus the prior quarter. And as again you'll note, the fourth quarter included seasonably higher fund expenses due to year-end mailings in the U.K. and Continental Europe, as well as some professional expenses related to new fund launches.
So despite the net revenue decline of $21.4 million, we were able to mitigate that with very, I’d say, good disciplined expense management. And so our adjusted operating income declined by only $4.9 million to about $183 million. 
One other point is that you'll note that in our non-GAAP presentation, equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliate no longer reflects our China JV. We now include those revenues and expenses from our JV to our adjusted operating results. And you can see a reconciliation of this in the appendix of the press release.
Below the line in Q1, we did incur a $5 million non-cash charge, and so this -- approximately half of this was due to negative effects on some of our intercompany loans, which was a non-cash impact, and the rest was due to a write-down of a portion of our capital portfolio that was other than temporary impairment. Again, a non-cash impact. 
The effective tax rate increased to 28.7% versus 26.2% in the fourth quarter, largely due to the mix of our assets and revenues. And then so adjusted EPS came in at $0.27 for the quarter, and the adjusted net operating margin came in at 33.6%, slightly above the fourth quarter.
Moving to the next page, just before I turn things over to Marty, I just want to note that we are making some changes going forward to our monthly AUM release beginning with our April release. So we’ll now provide ending AUM without the class decal that's consistent with our earnings presentations. And furthermore, in our effort to align with industry standards and also present our businesses in a more consistent and complete manner, we’ll start including assets for the PowerShares QQQ and the Deutsche Bank, or the DB PowerShares ETF. Currently these assets are not included in our AUM or flows and given the limited definition of AUM that we’d previously used. 
In addition to our normal disclosures going forward, we'll be providing a supplemental schedule that I'll break out ETFs and possibly managed AUM, which will now be counted as part of our total AUM. And so the appendix in today's presentation on Page 37, you'll see that new format for AUM disclosure going forward, as well as a historical representation of the data going back five quarters, and we will provide a quarter-to-quarter average AUM when relevant, and a qualitative statement on any material activity during the month going forward. With that, let me turn it back to Marty, and then we can get to Q&A."

Obviously, you had the seasonal payroll taxes, but as I mentioned, that was offset by lower variable compensation. So if there’s anything that was worth noting, those were the two things that were happening in the quarter. The other expenses I think were pretty much in line with where we thought they would be. In terms of cash flows in 2011, our priorities have not changed in terms of using our cash for funding capital needs for the business as the first call. The next would be acquisitions, if they make sense strategically, and if they also have the financial merit that we require. And then we’d be into somewhat increasing dividend and then stock buybacks. The only other thing I would note on top of that we overlay still a strong desire and a continued focus on maintaining a strong financial position on our balance sheet, that there’s value to the organization to have a certain amount of cash sitting on the balance sheet, which would make us less vulnerable if there were disruptions in the market, as we saw, obviously, in 2009 and 2008. So our goal is to certainly run with enough cash, excess cash and that would allow us to have that flexibility and you can say somewhere around $500 million in excess cash above what's needed in the European subgroup. So that would be kind of just a stake put in the ground right now. But I think to the extent that we’re generating a lot of cash flow, which we should, as opposed to steel, and we've got those metrics in place in terms of the cash, we’d probably back into certainly either – you know, whether as an acquisition or stock buybacks. One of the two would be the next logical place where the cash would be used."

The fundamental fact is, if you look where we are strong, it's a big -- liquidity business is big and strong. And also, it's bank loans, CDOs, high-yields. Those are the strengths where we have good teams in the middle of that spectrum and some good performance, largely due to, as I talked earlier, if you look at the results from IVR and their participation, they’re very, very strong teams. But when you look at where all the flows are going, whether it be global fixed income in the retail market or some of the core fixed income mandates, that is just not a territory that has been an area we’ve penetrated on the retail business historically. So that's really what that gap is, and I think that's probably most misunderstood in the market. Institutionally, the global fixed income product is getting some real traction and we have some good core numbers, but again, it’s different that what’s happened on the retail side of the business. So to answer your question, what I really think is going to continue, the fixed income business can be stronger. What we talked about a couple of calls ago was, there's a strong muni capability that we have. We have more of a national muni presence. Van Kampen has a long history of muni bonds, largely state specific, but also the good high yield product, too, which complements ours. So we’re going to be very, very strong in the muni market. So I think if we think we’re going to a rising tax environment, were going to be positioned fairly well there. So I think we'll see some good strong growth in the muni part of the market for us, fixed income, regardless of the movement to equities. But to me, what we're trying to highlight on Page 15, we have a key trend. If you believe that flows into U.S. and international equities at 17% of industry flows is too low, we are going to be a strong beneficiary of this movement away from equities into fixed income, and I don't think we’ll be cannibalized that much on the fixed income side, just because of the way that we are positioned in fixed income."

I ask that very same question all the time, Ken. Are we going to get the performance fees or not. And the reality is, it's very hard to predict as to whether we will or not. I think the idea is that it's within the realm of possibility that we could see it in the fourth quarter, but the fourth quarter still seems pretty far away relative to where we are today. So certainly in the second quarter on the U.K. side we wouldn’t traditionally see any performance fees. The other place where we've been able to generate performance fees on a quarterly basis, second quarter and third quarter, have been in our Quantitative group, Quantitative Equity. Right now I think where they are relative to the benchmark, it's probably not a realistic assumption for us to be looking for. So again, I would say it’s hard for me to guide people on performance fees because it's a tough one to predict. But I'd say where we are right now in the first quarter is probably a reasonable point to think about and we can surely update you if we see any change."

So we’re going to continue to see the appetite. Stable value continues to be an appetite, real estate continues to be very, very attractive to people. Bank loans, CLOs, CDOs, those types of banks are very attractive to people. This is the things that were seeing. On the equity side -- Actually Global Fixed Income is another area that we're seeing quite a bit of interest. On the equity side, the Global Equity capability is getting more interest.

And we'll be speaking to the presentation that's available on our website, if you're so inclined to follow. And also, as you know, we've scheduled an Investor Day presentation later this",1375,"Thank you very much, and thank you, everybody for joining us today. And we'll be speaking to the presentation that's available on our website, if you're so inclined to follow. And also, as you know, we've scheduled an Investor Day presentation later this afternoon, where we're going to much greater detail, regarding the impact of our recent acquisition. But for this call, we'll review the business results, brief update on the combination with Morgan Stanley's retail business, and then Loren will go into financial details, and then as always, we'll go into Q&A.
So those that are so inclined to follow, I'm on Slide 3 right now. In spite of continued volatility in the markets, Invesco's commitment to invest in excellence continue to yield strong long-term investment performance for our clients. Investment performance across the enterprise remain very strong in the second quarter, with some areas that's just exceptional performance. 
Our strong investment performance supported a continued trend of positive long-term net flows for the firm. And as you know on June 1, we completed the acquisition of Morgan Stanley's Retail Asset Management business, which included Van Kampen Investments. This marked a key milestone for our long-term success as a company. 
In one month after the close, we're seeing strong momentum in the combined business. And as we announced last quarter, based on more detailed analysis and understanding of the business, the synergies will be meaningfully stronger than our initial expectations. We'll provide an update on the benefits we're seeing from the acquisition later in this discussion this morning.
So moving now to the second quarter results. Assets under management, end of the quarter at $557 billion under management, and this reflects the combined organization. Adjusted operating income for the second quarter was $188.7 million. That was a 3.1% increase as compared to the first quarter. And long-term net flows for the quarter were $13.9 billion, continuing the positive trend we've demonstrated over the past several quarters. And during the quarter, there'll be a second quarter dividend of $0.11 per share. This is consistent with the first quarter dividend and represents a 7.3% increase over the dividend from the fourth quarter of 2009.  And again, as I've mentioned, Loren's going to go into much greater detail of the financial results in just a minute. 
If you take a look of the quarterly flows starting on Slide  5, what you'll notice, strength in the second quarter gross sales particularly in the passive channel, which led to continued momentum of our long-term flows. And as I mentioned earlier, our long-term net flows for the quarter were $13.9 billion. This represents the sixth consecutive quarter positive flows for Invesco. 
And on Slide 6, you'll note that strong gross sales across the Institutional channel contributed to the positive flows for Invesco, overall, during the quarter.  We also saw so positive flows in our Private Wealth Management business, which has experienced consistent asset growth in each quarter over the past three years. 
And if you take a look at the investment performance, that's one of the key reasons for the enhanced stability of our flows. It's, again, as always, driven by consistent good long-term performance. If you look at the firm as a whole, 75% of the assets under management were ahead of peers on a three-year basis at end of this quarter. This is a significant improvement from 69% of assets ahead of peers on a three-year basis at the end of last year. 
We also saw a strong improvement in performance over the one-year period, now 68% of the assets from the top half of peer group versus 44% in the first quarter. And as always, you'll find the detailed charts in the appendix. But let me take a moment to highlight some of the investment performance across the firm. 
As I mentioned earlier, we saw strong performance across the enterprise, with pockets of exceptional performance. If you start with Invesco Perpetual, they continue to have outstanding performance, with 91% and 95% of their assets under management in the top half of peers over three and five years. With the addition of Van Kampen, the US Value franchise has -- results are stellar performance, with 92% of the assets in the top half of the peer group over three- and five-year period.
Our global fixed income capability continues to achieve strong outstanding performance, with 95% of the assets in the top half of peers on a one year basis and 80% of the asset in the top half over years three and five.  And our Morningstar ratings continue to be near the highest levels since October of the year 2000. So all in all, strong performance across the enterprise.
We'll go into a much greater detail regarding the positive impact of the acquisition on our business at the Investor Day meeting later today, as I mentioned. But for now let's spend a few minutes on a brief update of that business. 
We're pleased to report that businesses were fully integrated with minimal transition issues. More importantly, the work done in the month, leading up to the close, ensured that we are ready to deliver for clients on day one. That was our goal, and that's actually happened. This was also supported by an intensive pre-close training effort for our U.S. sales force so they could engage with clients immediately after the close, to help them understand the added value of the combined organization. And our increased relevance as a top 10 investment manager in this channel is enhancing Invesco's profile in the marketplace in helping gain greater access to top platforms, which, obviously in time, will drive new business. So the work to refine and enhance the product lineup is on schedule.
And as I mentioned, we'll go into much greater detail this afternoon, but some of the points I'd like to highlight: Our focus now is very much on delivering the tremendous value of the combined organization to our clients. The combined investment teams were fully resourced at close to ensure they remain focused on delivering that strong investment performance that they have. And we've organized the combined sales team to provide broad deep coverage in key growth channels and of course to our top clients. And we transitioned clients to the acquired business onto our global operating platform with minimal disruption. And our transfer agency operations begins reporting fund shareholders on first day after close. 
So our goal over the past several months is that to insure we are well positioned to begin delivering the tremendous value of the combined organization to our clients and shareholders and continue the momentum that we have prior to the transaction. So obviously, tremendous work has been done, but most importantly, this is what will drive the momentum of the combined business going forward.
I would like to focus on the next steps remaining until we get to a sort of steady-state operation. We are very focused on sharpening our offering to the clients. Work continues on Phase II, as we are referring to it as, and that's really refining our product lineup. We anticipate this product process, which includes seeking approvals from the fund boards and shareholders will take nine to 12 months after the close. But we are very much on track to accomplish that.
So we're very excited about the combination of the businesses. We see this as a great opportunity to even further enhance our ability to meet our clients' needs. And as always, we're primarily focused on delivering consistent good long-term investment performance to our clients. And the complementary nature of the shared commitment to invest in excellence is very apparent, already within the organization. So we feel very good about the investment teams going forward. 
The acquisition will expand the depth and breath for our investment strategies, providing Invesco with an even greater, more comprehensive range investment capabilities we can offer our clients. And we feel the combined businesses enhances our ability to deliver meaningful solutions to our clients and better position the firm for long-term success.  So with that as a backdrop, I'm going to turn it over to Loren, who'll talk in more depth about the results. And we'll go to questions."

These increases in asset",1414,"Thanks, Marty. So going to the next slide, Page 15. You'll see that during the quarter, our net flows provided $13 billion in assets under management.  And the Morgan Stanley, Van Kampen acquisition added $114.6 billion on June 1. These increases in assets under management were partially offset by a negative market and foreign exchange impacts.
The net increase in AUM was $100 billion, however, quarter-over-quarter. We should point out that the net long-term inflow of $13.9 billion was largely driven by a $15.8 billion lower fee International Equity passive mandate, which was sourced by the Morgan Stanley Japanese team that came over on June 1.  So we ended the quarter with $557.7 billion in assets under management. That's up 21.8% since the end of March. And average AUM for the quarter increased 6.9% to $480.5 billion.
You'll also see at the bottom of the page, our net revenue yield in Q2 increased by 0.6 basis points. And this was primarily a result of strong UIT revenues during the month of June, and also increase in performance fees.
Now let's turn to the next page for the operating results.  You'll see that net revenues increased $44.6 million or 8.2% quarter-over-quarter. The acquired business added $48  million to net revenues for the quarter, but that was offset by $5.5 million from unfavorable foreign exchange rates. 
Drilling a little bit further down on this, you'll see that investment management fees increased by 5.7%, $35.4 million, that was driven by $36.3 million, which was contributed by the acquired business. Service and distribution revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by $26.9 million, about 24%. And again, this is really due to the acquisition, which contributed $25.2 million for the quarter.
Performance fees,  it came in a little higher than the first quarter at $3.5 million. And that was due to fees earned by our real estate group. Other revenues increased by $5.1 million to $16.4 million. And as I mentioned, the acquisition contributed $5.5 million related to new UIT issuance in the month of June. That was very good month for UITs. Third party distribution, service and advisory expense increased by $24.9 million. The acquisition contributed $19 million to the increase. The remainder of that, largely explained by new product launches and somewhat higher average assets under management in Europe.
Moving on down the slide, you'll see that adjusted operating expenses of $400.3 million increased quarter-over-quarter by $38.9  million or 10.8%.  The acquisition added $29.4 million for the quarter, while foreign exchange reduced operating expenses by $2.9 million, when compared to the first quarter. Employee compensation increased by $26 million or 11.1% versus the first quarter. The acquisition added $16.2 million as 580 new staff joined the company on June 1. 
Additionally, the second quarter reflected a full three months worth of expense for share-based, and deferred cash compensation was granted at the end of February of this year. This resulted in the $6 million increase quarter-over-quarter. Furthermore, we recognized about $5 million in severance costs in Q2. And that was related to the reorganization and the continued upgrading of our U.S. institutional sales force.
Marketing expense increased $7.1 million, 25%, that was largely due to the acquired business, which contributed about $6 million of this. Property office and technology increased by 2.3%. Again, largely driven by the new business. The acquired business added $3 million. G&A expenses came in at $48.3 million in the quarter, up $3.5 million. And the acquired business added $4.3 million.
Just going down the page a little bit further, you'll see equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by $3.8  million from the first quarter to $4.3 million. This is a result of some gains that were taken in some of our private equity partnership and equity interest. 
For the effective tax rate on pretax adjusted cash net income for the quarter was 29.3% versus 28.7% in the prior quarter. I should note that for the second half of 2010, we expect that our effective tax rate on adjusted basis or comparable basis, that's what I've been talking about, will be about 28%. Although we'll be somewhat lower in Q3 and somewhat higher in Q4 due to the impact of FIN 48. So finishing on this page, we saw that adjusted cash EPS came in $0.27 and the operating margin was 32%.  
Let's just go to the next page and talk a little bit about some more deal metrics. We've updated the deal accretion guidance to $0.22 per share in year one and $0.24 per share in year two. This is due to the net benefit related to the differences in tax amortization of goodwill and definite-lived intangibles versus accounting amortization. The benefit equates about $4 million per year or about $0.01 per share.
We are confirming that we have about a $5 billion expectation of outflow in year one, related to the businesses coming together. And we also believe that the net cost synergy in year one is still around $80 million to $85 million and $90 million to $95 million, year two. I should point out, however, that these cost synergies are net numbers. We have some planned new investments included within these numbers, about $15 million annually, which is an amount largely tied to additional marketing expenses.  And finally on the page, we provide some further detail on our U.S. GAAP intangible amortization for you, those who want to model it. 
Moving to the final slide. I just wanted to provide a reconciliation to you regarding our original set of run rate financials for the acquired business, with the actual results that we've received for one month of earnings disclosed in the press release.  You may remember on September 30 of last year, we provided some high-level information to you that reflected our modeling for the revenues and the expenses of the business that was being carved out and acquired. That time the business had $119 billion in AUM, a run-rate-adjusted operating margin of 32% and a net revenue yield of 40 basis points. Now that's the first column of numbers on the page. 
If you fast-forward nine months later, you'll see that the one month of June actuals annualized shows $114.6 billion of AUM, with an adjusted operating margin of 39% and a net revenue yield of 50.3 basis points. So I wanted to make sure we reconcile these two views for you. 
In September 30 of 2009, run rate P&L, we netted certain operating expenses, specifically related to revenue sharing and fund accounting, against their associated revenues. However, our accounting standards dictate that these expenses in revenues be grossed up for Invesco's income statement and to that added $80 million to revenues and $80 million to expenses, of course with no impact to net income. This does however, have an impact of increase in our net revenue yield of the acquired business by 6.7 basis points.
Next, introducing the net cost synergies in the amount of $80 million to $85 million against the September 30, 2009 P&L. You'll see a view of the business that operates in the adjusted net operating margin of 42% to 43% and a net revenue yield of 46.7 basis points. Comparing this to the annualized one month results, I believe confirms that we're on track to achieve our expected financial results. June seems to be yielding a somewhat higher net revenue yield, about 3.5 basis points, with $20 million more per year. That's a result, we believe, of a very successful month for the UIT business, which generated, as I mentioned about $5.5 million in other revenues, but also a somewhat B share revenue stream that we had originally modeled. 
The annualized June operating expenses are about $30 million greater than what the September 30 P&L after synergies we've forecast. And this difference, however, is in line with our expectations. To state the obvious, there's some noise around one month of data.  So annualizing is tricky, but also, some of the synergies have not been fully realized in the first month of operation.
So overall, I hope this shows you that we're on track period. I should point out, however, that going forward, we're going to be operating this business as one unit. And as a result, we won't be able to provide meaningful or reliable P&L data on Invesco and the Van Kampen, Morgan Stanley business separated from each other. So I am done. And Marty, I'll turn it over to you before Q&A."

I guess, when you look on the flow side, in particular, as it relates to the Retail business, you've obviously, seen a pickup on the redemption side and sales in the industry just had been pretty sluggish. So I guess, it's going to be hard to do this, but just in the quarter, can you kind of strip out what's related, what you see as more noise versus core and imply more importantly, when you do look over the next quarter, two quarters, three quarters, when do you expect some of the noise to start muting out and being able to take advantage of -- you have the products, your performance is solid and then you're able to take advantage of the distribution opportunity?"

It's hard to answer specifically, but let me just -- typically what happens. By June 30, there was very little impact of so-called the strength of the combined firm, it's just not practically going to happen, and as various talk, previously, now you go through a diligence process and the like. It will literally take, in my mind, two to three quarters by the time you communicate the depth and breadth of the firm, all the way down through the adviser channel. That's just how long it takes. It's tens of thousands of advisers that you need to get in front of and discuss why they're better off the depth and breadth of the firm. The noise, as you talk about it, the fund close stuff, we were trying to put a date out there. So as soon as the fund mergers are done, which we expect to be nine to 12 months after the close, that will be the noisiest period taken out of the system. And the reason why we say nine to 12 months, there's a shareholder vote, we can't control that. So we are very much on track at everything we control, and so it's just an ongoing process. But what you're seeing right now, again, it's very hard to separate market sentiment from parsing sort of a normal course. If you talk to advisers literally from that May period, it wasn't such a redemption topic that drove outflows. It was sales just dropped like a rock, people just froze. So that is really what you're seeing. Now it's really the normal process of people coming back through difficult markets determining when are they going to get back engage and take some exposures to the equity market. So you have two very strong factors happening at the moment."

And so the answer, we really have to do with what the one year numbers look like for the  U.K. at that point in time. Obviously, the three and five numbers are quite strong. Again, sort of a performance based and is there a chance that we could see some performance fees? Yes, I mean, there is. But again, I think the general guidance that we've provided right now is it's probably, there would be a bit of a bet that we're going to get there in time to realize that performance fee. Longer-term, absolutely, we could see those things come back. But certainly, sort of near-term was not in our planning right now, that we're going to see a large performance in the fourth quarter from the U.K. even though, I grant you, their near term performance has really come back very strongly. Beyond that, there aren't that many assets that have performance fees. So the emerging class of products that would have performance fees would be some of the Wilbur Ross products, because they have some carry associated with them. And again, in terms of the carry that we would get, it would be on the newer funds or the funds that were launched after October of 2006. That's the really Fund IV and then any future funds. And we're not quite at the point where we're, I think, seeing realizations on those particular products. The gains that we took weren't related to those products, they're related to other global products. And so again, I just want to make sure you don't assume that we're starting to see a lot of carry coming through in some of those products yet. It's too soon. So again, we do think that some of the performance fees you may have seen in the past also came from our quantitative group, and so there's a potential there that we could see those come back. But right now, given where the performance is, it's not part of our planning that we're going to see that come back this year. So again, hopefully, that helps you again sort of give you a sense of where they can come from."

If you were to look going forward, would it be more $5 million or $4.5 million, somewhere in that range probably if you were to ask UIT folks, that they would say is a normal sort of run rate for them. Again, the way it works, it's a little complicated because there are different fees and revenues based on what type of UITs you're generating with it, there's fixed income or equity. So again, it would probably take more time than you probably want, and I have to go through exactly how it works. But the revenues have generated upfront upon the sale, so they're not really based on ongoing management fees, and the margins are very healthy with that business. It's a very profitable business."

It's finding its place in the marketplace with advisers, in addition to portfolio managers and the like. So our place has not changed, right.

And from a strategic point of view though, many, many people are trying to get into the business. I think differently than mutual fund where you can have, pick a number, 200 of the same mandate mutual fund. That really is not possible with ETFs, because you need a market maker and capital has to go bought. So you really can have maybe a couple three, possibly four light-designed ETF. So I think there is limited shelf space ultimately. I think that's one of the other attractive things to that business. But we're very pleased with where we are with the ETF business.

We’ll be speaking to the presentation that’s available on our Web site, if you’re still inclined to follow.
Also as you know, we scheduled an Investor Day presentation later this afternoon, where we’ll go into much greater detail regarding the impact of recent acquisition, but for this call we’ll provide a review of the business results, a brief update on the combination with Morgan Stanley’s retail business, then Loren will go into financial detail, and then as always we’ll go into Q&A.
So those that are so inclined to follow, I’m on slide #3 right now. In spite, of continued volatility in the markets, Invesco’s commitment to investment excellence continued to yield strong long-term investment performance for our clients.
Investment performance across the enterprise remained very strong in the second quarter with some areas with just exceptional performance. Our strong investment performance supported a continued trend of positive long-term net flows for the firm.
As you know, on June 1, the acquisition of Morgan Stanley’s retail asset management business, which included Van Kampen Investments. This marked a key milestone for our long-term success as a company.
One month after the close, we’re seeing strong momentum in the combined business, and as we announced last quarter based on more detailed analysis and understanding of the business, the synergies will be meaningfully stronger than our initial expectations. We’ll provide an update on the benefits we’re seeing from the acquisition later in this discussion this morning.
So moving out to the second quarter results; assets under management ended the quarter at $557 billion under management, and this reflects the combined organization.
Adjusted operating income for the second quarter was $188.7 million. That was a 3.1% increase as compared to the first quarter, and long-term net flows for the quarter were $13.9 billion continuing the positive trend we’ve demonstrated over the past several quarters.
And during the quarter, there’ll be a second quarter dividend of $0.11 per share. This is consistent with the first quarter dividend and represents a 7.3% increase over the dividend from the fourth quarter of 2009. And again as I mentioned, Loren is going to go into much greater detail of the financial results in just a minute.
If you take a look at the quarterly flows starting on slide #5, what you’ll note is strength in the second quarter gross sales particularly in the passive channel which led to continued momentum of our long-term flows. And as I mentioned earlier, our long-term net flows for the quarter were $13.9 billion. This represents the sixth consecutive quarter of positive flows for Invesco.
And on slide #6, you’ll note the strong gross sales across the institutional channel contributed to the positive flows for Invesco overall during the quarter. We also saw positive flows in our private wealth management business, which has experienced consistent aspect growth in each quarter over the past three years.
And if you take a look at the investment performance, it’s one of the key reasons for the enhanced ability of our flows. It’s again as always driven by consistent good long-term performance. If you look at the firm as a whole, 75% of the assets under management were ahead of peers on a three-year basis at the end of this quarter. This is a significant improvement from 69% of assets ahead of peers on a three-year basis at the end of last year.
We also saw a strong improvement in performance over the one year period, now 68% of the assets in the top half are peer group versus 44% during the first quarter, and as always you’ll find the detailed charts in the appendix. But let me take a moment to highlight some of the investment performance across the firm.
As I mentioned earlier, we saw strong performance across the enterprise with pockets of exceptional performance. If you start with Invesco Perpetual, it continued to have outstanding performance with 91% and 95% of their assets under management in the top half of peers over three and five years.
With the addition of Van Kampen the U.S. value franchise’s results are stellar performance with 92% of the assets in the top half of the peer group over three and five-year period.
Our global fixed income capability continues to achieve strong outstanding performance with 95% of the assets in the top half of peers on a one-year basis and 80% of the assets in the top half over years three and five, and our Morningstar ratings continue to be near the highest level since October of the year 2000. So, all-in-all strong performance across the enterprise.
We’ll go into much greater detail regarding the positive impact of the acquisition on our business at the Investor Day meeting later today as I mentioned. But for now let’s spend a few minutes on a brief update of that business.
We’re pleased to report the businesses were fully integrated with minimal transition issues and more importantly the work done in the months leading up to the close ensured that we are ready to deliver for clients on day one. That was our goal and that actually happened.
This was also supported by an intensive pre-close training effort for our U.S. sales force, so they could engage with clients immediately after the close to help them understand the added value of the combined organization, and our increased relevance as a top 10 investment manager in this channel is enhancing Invesco’s profile in the marketplace and helping gain greater access to top platforms, which obviously in time will drive new business. So the work to refine and enhance the product lineup is on schedule. And as I mentioned we will go into much greater detail this afternoon, but some of the points I’d like to highlight.
Our focus now is very much on delivering the tremendous value of the combined organizations to our clients, the combined investment teams were fully resourced at close to ensure they remain focused on delivering the strong investment performance that they have, and we’ve organized the combined sales team to provide broad deep coverage in key growth channels, and of course to our top clients, and we transitioned clients of the acquired business on to our global operating platform with minimal disruption and our transfer agency operations began supporting fund shareholders on first day after close.
So our goal over the past several months has been to ensure we are well positioned to begin delivering the tremendous value of the combined organization to our clients and shareholders, and continue the momentum that we had prior to the transaction. So obviously, tremendous work has been done, but most importantly, this is what will drive momentum of the combined business going forward.
Yes, I would like to focus on the next steps remaining to get to sort of a steady state operation. We are very focused on sharpening our offering to the clients, work continues on phase 2 as we are referring to it as, and that’s really refining our product lineup. We anticipate this process which includes seeking approvals from the fund boards and shareholders will take nine to 12 months after the close, but we are very much on track to accomplish that.
So, we’re very excited about the combination of the businesses. We see this as a great opportunity to even further enhance our ability to meet our clients’ needs, and as always, we’re primarily focused on delivering consistent good long-term investment performance to our clients and the complementary nature of the shared commitment to investment excellence is very apparent already within the organization. So, we feel very good about the investment teams going forward.
The acquisition will expand the depth and breadth of our investment strategies providing Invesco with even greater more comprehensive range of investment capabilities we can offer our clients, and we feel the combined business enhances our ability to deliver meaningful solutions to our clients and better position the firm for long-term success.
So with that as a backdrop, I am going to turn it over to Loren, who’ll talk in more depth about the results and we then we’ll go to questions.

So going to the next slide, page #15, you’ll see that during the quarter, our net flows provided $13 billion in assets under management, and the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen acquisition added $114.6 billion on June 1. These increases in assets under management were partially offset by a negative markets and foreign exchange impacts.
The net increase in AUM was $100 billion, however, quarter-over-quarter. We should point out that the net long-tem inflow of $13.9 billion was largely driven by a $15.8 billion lower fee international equity passive mandates which was sourced by the Morgan Stanley Japanese team that came over on June 1.
So we ended the quarter with $557.7 billion in assets under management, that’s up 21.8% since the end of March and average AUM for the quarter increased 6.9% to $480.5 billion.
Now you’ll also see at the bottom of the page, our net revenue yield in Q2 increased by 0.6 basis points and this was primarily a result of strong UIT revenues during the month of June and also an increase in performance fees.
Now let’s turn to the next page for the operating results. You’ll see that net revenues increased $44.6 million or 8.2% quarter-over-quarter and the acquired business added $48 million to net revenues for the quarter, but that was offset by $5.5 million from unfavorable foreign exchange rates.
Drilling a little bit further down on this, you’ll see that investment management fees increased by 5.7%, $35.4 million, that was driven by $36.3 million, which was contributed by the acquired business.
Service and distribution revenues increased quarter-over-quarter by $26.9 million, about 24% and again, this is really due to the acquisition which contributed $25.2 million for the quarter. Performance fees came in a little bit higher than the first quarter at $3.5 million and that was due to fees earned by our real estate group.
Other revenues increased by $5.1 million to $16.4 million, and as I mentioned, the acquisition contributed $5.5 million related to new UIT issuance in the months of June. It was very good month for UITs.
Third-party distribution, service and advisory spends increased by $24.9 million. The acquisition contributed $19 million to the increase. The remainder of that is largely explained by new product launches and somewhat higher average assets under management in Europe.
Moving on down the slide, you’ll see that adjusted operating expenses of $400.3 million increased quarter-over-quarter by $38.9 million or 10.8%. The acquisition added $29.4 million for the quarter, while foreign exchange reduced operating expenses by $3.9 million when compared to the first quarter.
Employee compensation increased by $26 million or 11.1% versus the first quarter. The acquisition added $16.2 million as 580 new staff joined the company on June 1.
Additionally, the second quarter reflected a full three months worth of expense for share-based and deferred cash compensation that was granted at the end of February of this year. This resulted in a $6 million increase quarter-over-quarter.
Furthermore, we recognized about $5 million of severance cost in Q2, and that was related to the reorganization and continued upgrading of our U.S. institutional sales force.
Marketing expense increased $7.1 million, 25% that was largely due to the acquired business which contribute to about $6 million of this. Property, office and technology increase by 2.3%, again largely driven by the new business. The acquired business added $3 million. G&A expenses came in at $48.3 million in the quarter, up $3.5 million and the acquired business added $4.3 million.
Just going down the page a little bit further, you’ll see equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by $3.8 million from the first quarter to $4.3 million. This is a result of some gains that were taken in some of our private equity partnership equity and equity interest.
The effective tax rates on pre-tax adjusted cash net income for the quarter was 29.3% versus 28.7% in prior quarter. I should note that for the second half of 2010, we expect that our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis or comparable basis, that’s what I have been talking about, will be about 28%, although, it will be somewhat lower in Q3 and somewhat higher in Q4 due to the impact of FIN 48.
So finishing on this page, we saw that adjusted cash EPS came in at $0.27 and the operating margin was 32%. Just to go to next page and talk a little bit about some more deal metrics.
We’ve updated the deal accretion guidance to $0.22 per share in year one and $0.24 per share in year two, and this is due to the net benefit related to the differences and tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles versus accounting amortization. The benefits it creates about $4 million per year or about $0.01 per share.
We are confirming that we have about $5 billion expectations of outflow in year one related to the businesses coming together and we also believe that net cost synergy in year one is still around $80 million to $85 million and $90 to $95 million in year two.
I should point out, however, that these cost synergies are net numbers. We have some planned new investments included within these numbers of about $15 million annually, which is an amount largely tied to additional marketing expenses. Finally on the page, we provide some further detail on our U.S. GAAP intangible amortization for those who want to model it.
Moving to the final slide, I just wanted to provide a reconciliation to you regarding our original set of run rates financials to the acquired business with the actual results that we’ve received from one month of earnings, I disclosed in the press release.
You may remember on September 30 of last year, we provided some high-level information to you that reflected our modeling for the revenues and the expenses of the business that was being carved out and acquired. At that time, the business had $119 million in AUM, a run rate adjusted operating margin of 32%, and a net revenue yield of 40 basis points. Now that’s the column of numbers on the page.
If you fast-forward nine months later, you’ll see that the one month of June actual annualized shows $114.6 billion of AUM with an adjusted operating margin of 39% and a net revenue yield of 50.3 basis points.
So I wanted to make sure we reconcile these two views for you, and the September 30, 2009 run rate P&L we netted at certain operating expenses, specifically related to revenue-sharing and fund accounting against their associated revenues.
However, our accounting standard dictate that these expenses and revenues be grossed up for investors’ income statement, and so that added $80 million to revenues and $80 million to expenses, of course with no impact to net income. This does, however, have an impact of increasing our net revenue yield of the acquired business by 6.7 basis points.
Next introducing the net cost synergies amounts of $80 million to $85 million against the September 30, 2009 P&L. You’ll see a view of the business that operates on an adjusted net operating margin of 42% to 43% and a net revenue yield of 46.7 basis points.
Comparing this to the annualized one-month results I believe confirms that we’re on track to achieve our expected financial results. June seems to be yielding a somewhat higher net revenue yield, about 3.5 basis points or $20 million more per year. That’s a result we believe of the very successful months for the UIT business, which generated as I mentioned about $5.5 million in other revenues, but also somewhat higher B share revenue stream that we had originally modeled.
The annualized June operating expenses were about $30 million greater than what the September 30 P&L after synergies would forecast, and this difference however is in line with our expectations. To state the obvious there’s some noise around one month of data to annualize and it’s tricky, but also some of the synergies have not been fully realized in the first month of operation.
So overall, I hope this shows you that we’re on track. I should point out however that going forward, we’re going to be operating this business as one unit, and as a result we won’t be able to provide meaningful or reliable P&L data on Invesco and the Van Kampen Morgan Stanley business separated from each other.
So, I’m done, and Marty, I’ll turn it over to you before Q&A.

Previously, you go through a diligence process and the like, it will literally in my mind two to three quarters by the time you communicate the depth and breadth of the firm all the way down through the advisor channel, that’s just how long it takes it takes. It’s tens of thousands of advisors that you need to get in front of them and discuss why they are the depth and breadth of the firm. So the noise as you talk about it, the fund flow stuff, we’re trying to put a date out there.
So as soon as the fund mergers are done, which we expect to be nine months to 12 months after the close that will be the noisiest period taken out of the system and reason why we say nine months to 12 months is there’s a shareholder vote, we can’t control that. So, we are very much on track with everything we control, and so it’s just an ongoing process.
But what you’re seeing right now, again it’s very hard to separate market sentiment from parsing sort of a normal course. If you talk to advisors, literally from that May period, it wasn’t such a redemption topic that drove outflows. It was sales just dropped like a rock, people just froze. So, that is really what you’re seeing. Now, it’s really the normal process of people coming back through difficult markets determining when are they going to get back, engage, and take some exposure to the equity market. So, we have two very strong factors happening at the moment.

So we’re just not pulling something out of air, but the channel that it comes from is largely the retail channel, it is mutual funds and it buys or sold channel products, so that’s where you’re going to see it.
As I was mentioning, if history is a guide again, after you announce the mergers which would be probably into maybe the fourth quarter from that period almost till closing is when you see the redemptions.

Again, so it will be performance-based. Is there a chance that we could see some performance fees? Yes, I mean there is. But again, I think that general guidance that we’ve provided right now is, it’s probably that would be a bit of bet that we’re going to get there in time to realize that performance fee.
Longer-term, absolutely, we could see those things come back, but certainly for the near term we’re still on our planning right now. That we’re going to see a large performance in the fourth quarter from the U.K. even though I grant you their near-term performances really come back very strongly. Beyond that, there aren’t there many assets that have performance fees. The emerging class of product that would have performance fees would be some of the Wilbur Ross products, because they have carry associated with them.
Again, in terms of the carry that we would get, it would be on the newer funds and on the funds that were launched after October of 2006, and that’s really Fund 4 and any future funds. We’re not quite at the point where we’re I think seeing realizations on those particular products. The gains that we took weren’t related to those products, they were related to other Wilbur products.
So, again, I just want to make sure you don’t assume that we’re starting to see a lot of carry coming through some of those products yet. It’s too soon. So again, we do think that some of the performance fees you may have seen in the past also came from a quantitative group and so there is a potential there that we could see those come back, but right now given where the performance is, it’s not part of our planning that we’re going to see that come back this year. So again, hopefully, that helps you, again sort of to give you a sense of where they can come from.

If you look at where the bulk of the industry sales have gone with the 25 basis point service fee, I don’t think you’re going to see a tremendous impact.
There are some real operational challenges I think you’re going to see coming out of the comment period, I just don’t know that what’s being suggested can be done on any short period of time. So, that’s one topic, but it will be interesting to see what happens through the comment period, but I don’t see a tremendous shock to the system with this.

This is Marty Flanagan along with Loren Starr, as was just pointed out. Loren and I will be speaking through the presentation that’s available on our website if you’re still inclined to follow along.
What we’ll do today is, I’ll highlight the business results and we’ll spend a few minutes just on the current update on the combination with Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen - the combination that we just closed in June, and then Loren will go into greater detail on the financials, and then finally we will open up to Q&A.
And so those that are inclined to follow on, I’m going to start on page two of the presentation deck. So if you look at the quarter in spite of the continued volatility that we saw in the markets, Invesco’s commitment to investment excellence really did yield a strong quarter with continued strong investment performance across the enterprise. It remained very strong and with some arrays of the exceptional performance. The strong investment performance contributed to a continued trend of positive long-term inflows into the organization.
And as many of you know, not all of you, on June 1, we completed the combination with Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen retail asset management business. And our goal from the day we announced the transaction was to complete the integration work prior to the close. And thanks to the tremendous amount of effort on everybody’s part, we accomplished that goal and we are able to deliver the value of the combined firm on day one as we referred to it.
And now, since we’ve completed it, we’ve now had a full quarter of the combined organization together and we are seeing strong momentum of that combined business. I’d also like to mention, during this third quarter, we resumed our share repurchase program and purchased 6.4 million shares at the value of about $127 million.
Later in this presentation, Loren is going to give some insight into our capital management approach. And also I’d like to note that Standard & Poor’s increased our enterprise risk management rating from adequate to strong. Invesco is now one of four asset managers with a strong rating.
So if you take a look at slide three, assets under management ended the quarter at $604 billion, and that compares to $557 billion at the end of the second quarter, reflecting the improved markets and also strong momentum in our combined business.
Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $245 million, an increase of 30% quarter-over-quarter. And long-term net inflows for the quarter were $4.9 billion, continuing the positive trend we’ve demonstrated over the past several quarters. And consistent with the second quarter, we will provide third quarter dividend of $0.11 per share. And again, Loren will go into much greater detail of the financials in just a moment.
If you take a look at the quarter at flows on page four, you will see the strength in the third quarter gross sales led to continued positive momentum in our long-term net inflows. As I mentioned earlier, the long-term net inflows for the quarter were $4.9 billion. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter of positive inflows for Invesco.
And if you take a look on slide five at the gross sales, gross retail and institutional channels, they continued to contribute positive net flows to Invesco overall. And also, if you look at the private wealth management segment of the business, it continued to experience consistent asset growth quarter-over-quarter, and we’ve seen net inflows for the past three years in the private wealth management business.
And if you take a look at investment performance for the group, it’s just, I’d say, one of the key reasons for the enhanced strength and stability of flows that we’ve seen over the past seven quarters. And if you look at the enterprise, 78% of the assets were ahead of peers on a three-year basis, and that compares to 71% one year ago. So, continued improvement in strength and consistent good long-term performance. And again, the detailed charts of performance are in the appendix, if you’re so inclined.
I would like to take a minute just to highlight some of the pockets of exceptional performance. And starting with the long-term investment performance that Invesco Perpetual remains just outstanding with more than 90% of the assets in the top half of peers over one, three and five years. We continue to see improvement in Invesco Trimark with 81% of the Canadian equity assets in the top half of peer groups on a three-year basis and 65% on a one-year basis.
Our global fixed income capability continues to achieve outstanding performance with 90% of the assets in the top half of peers on a one-year basis and 86% of assets in the top half of five years. Invesco Real Estate maintained a strong competitive position with 99% above benchmark for three years and 92% of benchmark across five years, really just outstanding performance. And Morningstar ratings in the US retail business remain near the highest levels since October 2000, with 58% of the US retail assets rated four or five stars.
So I’d like to take a few minutes in just brief everybody on the momentum we are seeing in the combined business and on page nine, just a couple of the highlights. As I’ve mentioned, we are very pleased to report that we are fully integrated with minimal transaction issues. And from that period, it’s been really supported by an intensive pre-close training effort, which we discussed previously.
Now, retail sales force has been actively engaged with clients and we are seeing steadily increasing momentum in that business, a relevance as a top-10 US fund managers really enhancing Invesco’s profile in the marketplace and it’s helping us gain greater access to top platforms and driving new business. And the Phase II work of rationalizing our product lineup is on schedule.
So if you take a look at page 10, at the time of close last quarter, we told you what we had accomplished at the close. And it would not have happened without the tremendous amount effort on both sides, both Invesco and Morgan Stanley. And that was an important milestone. But really, let’s spend a minute on what’s the progress since the close. And we’ve made steady progress building the combined business across three broad areas; clients, operational excellence, and employee engagement.
And most notably, the US retail asset flows were on target and growing. We continue to enhance our profile on key platforms. We are actively engaging clients with business plans with each client and deeper coverage teams aligned against them. Our product realignment efforts are on track, and we achieved our expense target that we laid out at the beginning of the combination. Loren will discuss that more. And most importantly, we have a strong, engaged, stable investment management team in place, producing strong results for our clients.
So if you take a look at page 11 and give this greater focus in your minds, we’ve highlighted from the initial announcement of the combination with Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen that it was highly complementary to Invesco’s existing capabilities. And if you look at the two organizations pre-close, you can get a sense of the product mix and we know Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen was very complementary in specialized fixed income and equity.
You can see the vehicle mix here. And post the close, you can look at the long-term business in the United States as ETF/UIT has been 31%, mutual funds 44%, and DC and insurance 25%. And the point is, in a really challenging US equity mutual fund environment, the diversity provides real balance and clear benefits, not just for the clients, but also for the business.
And if you look at page 12, you can see what happened post-close. We continued to see solid momentum in this US retail business, I guess, driven by the strong investment performance, the client focus and the engagement. But what you will note is the incremental impact of the combined organization is clearly positive.
And so if you look month-over-month pre-close and post-close, what you will note is the trend month-over-month of increased gross sales. And you will see that, post-close - the punch line is this - average monthly gross sales are up 40% and the average monthly redemption rate has declined 12 percentage points, which is really quite amazing that I’d be kept within the context of the flash crash in May, which was very pronounced here in the United States. So that would be the early results of the combination. I’d still say we are very early in what we expect out of the combination, as we look forward.
The other thing that we’ve seen is we continue to expand our presence on key client platforms. There has been a 240% increase to the platform placements since the month of June so that a number of funds are being put in a preferred rating with the different platforms. And again, we just continue to see growing interest in activity with the business.
So our view is that, right now, we are on track - very, very much on track, and we think more good things to come. And just to bring you up to speed on where we are, slide 13, really Phase II of the integration, it’s really just a very, very sharp focus on the product offering for our clients. We anticipate this process to be done six to nine months after the September 30th close. We are well into the effort of seeking approval from the fund board to ultimately fund shareholders, but that process is on track and moving forward.
So I’m going to stop there and hand it over to Loren.

Basically, during the quarter, our net long-term flows provided $4.9 billion in AUM. Market gains provided $34.4 billion FX added $8.2 billion. And then acquisitions net of disposition added $1.7 billion. These increases in AUM were partially offset by net outflows from money market funds of $2.4 billion, but the increase in AUM quarter-over-quarter was $46.8 billion or 8.4%, resulting in the ending assets of $604.5 billion.
Our average assets under management actually increased more strongly, 21.4% to $583.3 billion. And this was primarily due to three full months of the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen asset management business in Q3 as opposed to only one month in Q2. Our net revenue yield in Q3 was 48.5 basis points, down only slightly quarter-over-quarter.
Now let me turn to the operating results. The quarter-over-quarter variances in P&L that you are going to see are largely due to the two additional months of the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen retail asset management business in Q3 versus Q2. Net revenues increased $118.1 million or 20.1% quarter-over-quarter. The acquired business accounted for approximately $96 million of this increase, while favorable FX rates added about $8.1 million.
Now going down a little more deeply into that, you will see that investment management fees grew by 14.7% or $95.7 million. And again, that was driven mostly by the contribution of the acquired business. FX contributed $11 million while the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen business contributed approximately $74 million. The remaining management fee variance of $10.7 million was due to the positive impact of the markets on AUM relative to the second quarter.
Service and distribution revenues increased by $52.2 million or 37.4%, with the acquisition accounting for about $50 million of this variance. Performance fees declined $1 million to end at $2.5 million. Other revenues improved by $16.9 million relative to Q2, again driven largely by the two months more of the Van Kampen business in Q3. $14 million of the $16.9 million favorable variance was a result of new UIT issuance, which continues to run at a higher level than initially expected. Remaining $2.9 million increase is due to greater retained front-end loads as well as due to transaction commissions from our real estate business.
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, which we net against gross revenues, increased by $45.7 million, with the VK-MS acquisition contributing approximately $42 million of this and FX adding the remaining $3.9 million.
Moving down the slide, you will see that our adjusted operating expenses at $451.3 million, increased by $61 million or 15.2%. FX accounted for $5.4 million of this. The remainder largely being explained by the acquisition.
Employee compensation expenses increased by $37.6 million or 14.5% versus the second quarter. The acquisition contributed to the majority of this variance. So we also had an increase in variable compensation, primarily bonus and sales commissions in line with improving operating results and sales. And furthermore, we recognized $3.4 million of severance costs in Q3, which was $1.4 million less than what we recognized in Q2. And FX increased compensation expense by $3.7 million.
Marketing expense increased by $9.6 million or 27%, again largely due to the acquired business. Property, office and technology increased by $7.8 million or 13.8%, again for the same reason. G&A expenses came in at $54.3 million in the quarter that was up $6.0 million versus the second quarter. FX added about $0.7 million while the remaining $5.3 million in expense variance was explained equally by the impact of the acquisition as well as a variety of other non-acquisition related G&A expenses in the quarter.
Continuing on down the page, you will see that our effective tax rate on pretax adjusted cash net income in Q3 was unusually low relative to the other quarters, 23.1%, and in comparison to 29.3% in Q2. If you remember, however, this is in line with what happened in Q3 of 2009, and it’s a function of our releasing the FIN 48 provisions for uncertain tax position.
What I would tell you is that going forward this pattern of slightly lower tax rates in Q3 should subside, as we don’t expect to be releasing similarly large provisions in the future. For Q4 2010, I’d say that we expect our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis to return to a more normalized ongoing level of about 29% to 30%.
Before I move from the slide, I’ll just point out that our adjusted EPS came in at $0.39 and increased 44.4% versus Q2. And our adjusted net operating margin was 34.8% improvement of 2.8 points versus Q2.
So let me now shift gears. I’d like to provide an update on our progress towards achieving the cost synergy that we discussed. Moving to the next slide, distinct from most other large transactions you’ve seen, we did take on imperative to fully integrate the business essentially day-one at the closing of the deal. While that’s a difficult challenge, it did set up the possibility for us to generate full cost synergies very quickly.
As we mentioned in our Q2 release after we closed the acquisition and simultaneously integrated a business, we’d no longer be able to track the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen business expenses separately from Invesco’s. With that in mind, it is still possible to demonstrate what we - we are delivering the promised expense synergies.
Our original estimated cost synergies of $80 million to $85 million in year one, I’d point out, were net of $15 million of reinvestment in marketing for a US retail business. So excluding the impact of incremental marketing investment, the comparable growth year-one cost synergy expectation is $95 million to $100 million.
And the reason I’m saying this is, given the requisite lead-time and planning, we’ve not yet begun investing the incremental $15 million in marketing. And so we do expect to begin the investing at the end of 2010 or early 2011, with a pace of spend at roughly $3.7 million per quarter. But what that means is that for the Q3 results we discussed with you today, we would want to see growth, annualized run rate synergies in the $95 million to $100 million range and not the $80 million to $85 million range.
So, on this slide, we can demonstrate that we fully achieved the targeted annualized run rate of $95 million to $100 million of gross cost synergies, with the one caveat that it’s not a precise method since post-integration. As I’ve discussed, we’re not able to track the MS-VK expenses separately.
Let me take a moment to explain this table. Column A on this table shows two times the adjusted one month of operating expenses that the VK-MS acquisition contributed in June 2010. And we showed in the second quarter release. You will recall that we provided - Column A, excuse me, represents the expected Q3 versus Q2 expense variance due to the acquired business assuming no further cost synergies were created relative to the June results.
Column B on this table details our activity that contributed to Invesco’s quarter-over-quarter variances, but were unrelated to the VK-MS and US retail business. And that includes foreign exchange and other identifiable variances such as severance, as I discussed, from our re-tooling of the US institutional sales force, increases in variable compensation, another known expense items for Invesco specifically.
Column Company is the sum of A and B, and they represent the hypothetical Q3 versus Q2 expense variances, assuming no additional run rate synergies created during Q3 relative to the run rate imbedded in June. So essentially, it assumes that in Q3 we operated the MS-VK business as in the same way we did in June.
And Column D is the actual quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating expense variances results for the firm. So if you take the difference between D and C, that’s what you will find in Column E. That represents the incremental cost synergies we achieved during the third quarter relative to the second quarter, and Column F is purely the annualization of Column A.
So taking it all that in summary, subject to the caveat I mentioned earlier, this does show that we achieved an incremental $45.6 million in run rate annual cost synergies during Q3. If you add this to the $51 million, which represents the annualized run rate synergies we calculated in June, we delivered a total annualized run rate of $96.6 million in Q3. And this amount is square within a one year target of $95 million to $100 million in gross cost synergies, which of course exclude the impact of the new marketing investments.
So again, a little bit of complicated table, but I hope it gives you comfort that we’re on track to deliver no less than what we projected in year one. And as we discussed, we would expect to deliver at least another $10 million in savings at the end of year-two after the US fund range product rationalization has been completed.
So with that, let me take a moment to turn to the next slide and talk about our capital management. So our priorities remain consistent, no surprise. We will first look to reinvest our cash flow back in our business, followed by making acquisitions that they make strategic and financial strength. Thirdly, we wish to provide and moderately increasing dividend every year, approximately 46% annual growth. And then fourth would be opportunistic stock buybacks.
We’ll continue operating capital priorities against the foundation of maintaining a strong balance sheet. In reality, post financial crisis is that our client and consultants require investment management firms that they work with to have a strong financial profile. In addition, for Invesco a strong balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to take advantage of strategic opportunities that could arise in future. Therefore, as we discussed in the past, our priority is to decrease the incremental leverage we took on at the close of the Morgan Stanley-Van Kampen transaction and pay off the $650 million of borrowing that’s drawn on a credit facility.
So, despite this, we also told you not to assume that our hands are completely tied with respect to buying back stocks. And given where the stock was trading during the quarter coupled with our normal practice of eliminating dilution from deferred equity compensation, we did undertake to buy back 127.7 million stocks equating to 6.4 million shares at an average price of $19.82. And so, as you saw this last quarter, we will continue to maintain an opportunistic stance with respect to stock buyback.
So let me now turn over to Marty.

The wholesaling forces really did not change at all. So we just continue to move forward from that point of view. So it continues to be a very strong relationship. And as we mentioned earlier, there’s a broad - a broader array of products now that Jones has put on their platform and from I'll call the traditional Invesco part of the business. LPL, we are a preferred partner right now, and literally just completed - it is a - as you enter into new relationships like that, there has been a broad effort, and I’d say, earlier days, but one of the highlights is that we completed, what they call, sort of a client engagement plan and they received the top marks within their system. So again, I’d say that’s early days, but we expect that to be a very strong relationship going forward. And Ken, I’m sorry, what was the third - last one?

So the broadening of funds on platforms is, I think, prerequisite for ultimate success. And as I mentioned, that just improved quite dramatically. So Van Kampen on to some of the platforms that were less strong on, that is going very, very well. And if you look at the performance in the key areas, the US value in particular and the broader muni bond platform that we have now, very, very strong. I don’t think you are going to see - I think where you are hopefully going, Ken, you know, what kind of flows you’re going to see, it’s all going to be fully dependent upon really when do investors start to look to that US value equity is an asset class.
And what I do feel when that starts to happen, we’re going to participate very, very nicely because it’s just a very strong track record. And so I personally think, Ken, this is a multiple quarter effort. And the other reality is that if you look at the performance, if you look at the depth and breadth of the organization of platforms that are being accepted and the funds on to the different platforms, that’s very, very good. We still have some work to do. We are a new name in the retail channel. I mean, that’s a fundamental fact. So, as I’ve said, if you put us against a firm that’s been operating with a single name for 15 years in the channel, that will run ahead of us out of the box. But I’d say we’re making very, very good progress, along the way to be a very, very important partner.

And funneling enough, I think the US retail world was uniquely impacted by the flash fashion. I think you saw that across the, which, Robert, you talked to, some of the investment banks with distribution. I mean, it just literally went on strike. And so you saw that. And I’d say, what you’re starting to see right now is, in mutual funds, and I think that was the area that was most impacted, mutual funds in particular, starting to get some confidence coming back a little bit in investors from that point of view and probably ultimately moving up the risk curve a little bit as people preferred to taking on risk. But I'd still say it's early. Where you did see it and what we saw, very much going into UITs, and ETFs and that was a real positive, I'd say for us and you probably saw that across the industry.
But if you go to different parts of the world, whether it be Asia or Europe or the United Kingdom, we had inflows - retail inflows in each of those areas. So it was not as impacted as the United States was. If you look at the institutional pipeline, it just continues to grow. And for us, the mandates tend to continue to be very strong real estate. There's going to be very strong stable value, also some asset allocation capabilities that we have premium plus are really getting high degrees of interest. And so I'd say that's still a little more conservatively positioned than what we are seeing in the retail side of the business. And you do have some consultants that are actually very focused on fixed income and really limiting exposure to the equity market. And we can all pass our judgments whether or not we think that's the right asset allocation, but I suspect we're a lot (inaudible) to have some people moving towards the equity side of the business.

So, at an industry level, I think, we're heading very much in the right direction. With regard to our own money funds, we don't have any - we haven't had any problems with our money funds. They are very well run. We didn't have any downgrades of credit. We didn't have SIVs, none of those types of things. So it's probably those firms that had SIV-type exposure that might be having to look to do some top-ups and we don't have to do that. So from a specific company point of view, we are in a good spot.

But that doesn't mean that you won't see some firms that are fully funded or close to it that would take some risk off the table by immunizing their portfolio. So the reality is, well, I think we're all of us see where we see retirement growth, it's going to be in the DC world, but there is a tremendous amount of assets in the DB world right now. And I still think the merits of a well-balanced portfolio to deliver results are going to make sense.

There is certainly some amount of compensation that gets built up against those revenues. But incremental margins, as we've discussed, are somewhere at 60 - sort of say, 60% and in that range. So you can generate higher margins just through that expansion.
I think the other parts of the business to the extent that we are able to continue the positive trend on sales and organic growth is going to be helpful for profitability, particularly if we are selling higher fee products, which again if equities are sort of coming into light, I think we would benefit from that as well. So there is one more element in the mix, not a major one. We've talked about in the past, as we continue to transition to our enterprise support centers and lower cost locations, there is some element of margin expansion that's going to take place there. And we are looking at taking on our India operation to our books sometime in early part of next year, and there is going to be some cost benefits to that as well.

I think for Fund IV, it did not get invested as quickly as maybe some of the other funds have been, given the market that was prudent to wait and probably smart to have done that. And we have obviously been waiting for it to get to 75% invested because we could not launch another fund until that happens. In terms of the harvesting period, I think it's still going to be several years to be thinking about the timing before we actually see a performance fee. It's above the hurdle too.

Loren and I will be speaking to the presentation that's available on the website, if you're so inclined to follow along. What we'll do today is, I'll highlight the business results, and we'll spend a few minutes just on the current update of the combination with Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen, the combination that we just closed in June. And then Loren will go into greater detail on the financials. And then finally, we'll open up to Q&A.
And so those that are inclined to follow, I'm going to start on Page 2 of the presentation today. So if you look at the quarters, in spite of the continued volatility that we saw in the markets, Invesco's commitment to investment excellence really did yield a strong quarter, with continued strong investment performance across the enterprise. It remained very strong and with some areas of obviously the exceptional performance. The strong investment performance contributed to a continued trend of our long term inflows into the organization. And as many of you know, not all of you -- on June 1, we completed the combination with Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen Retail Asset Management business. And our goal from the day we announced the transaction was to complete the integration work prior to the close and thanks to tremendous amount of effort on everybody's part, we accomplished that goal and we're able to deliver the value of the combined firm on day one as we referred to it. And now since we've completed it, we've now had a full quarter of the combined organization together in received strong momentum of that combined business. 
I'd also like to mention, during this third quarter, we resumed our share repurchase program and purchased 6.4 million shares, with the value of about $127 million. Later in this presentation, Lawrence is going to give some insight into our capital management approach. And also, I'd like to note that Standard & Poor's increased our enterprise risk management rating from adequate to strong. Invesco is now one of the four strong for asset managers with a strong rating.
So if you take a look at Slide 3, assets under management ended the quarter at $604 billion and that compares to $557 billion at the end of the second quarter, reflecting the improved markets and also strong momentum in our combined business. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $245 million, an increase of 30% quarter-over-quarter, and long-term net inflows for the quarter were $4.9 billion, continued the positive trend we've demonstrated over the past several quarters. And consistent with the second quarter, we will provide a third quarter dividend of $0.11 per share. And again, Loren will go into much greater detail of the financials in just a moment.
If you take a look at the quarterly flows on Page 4, you'll see the strength in the third quarter gross sales lead to continued positive momentum in our long-term net inflows. And as I mentioned earlier, the long-term net inflows for the quarter were corporate $4.9 billion. This represents a seven consecutive quarter of positive inflows for Invesco. 
And if you take a look on Slide 5 at the gross sales across retail and institutional channels, we continued to contribute positive net flows to Invesco, overall. And also, if you look at the Private Wealth Management segment of the business, it continued to experience consistent asset growth quarter-over-quarter. And we've seen net inflows for the past three years in the Private Wealth Management business. And if you take a look at investment performance for the group, it's one of the key reasons for the enhanced strength and stability of close that we've seen over the past seven quarters. And if you look at the enterprise, 78% of the assets were ahead of peers on a three-year basis. And that compares to 71% one year ago, so continued improvement and strength and consistent good long-term performance. And again, the detailed charts of performance are in the appendix that you're so inclined. I would like to take a minute just to highlight some of the pockets of exceptional performance.
And starting with the long-term investment performance that Invesco Perpetual remains just outstanding, with more than 90% of the assets from the top half of peers over one, three and five years. We continue to see improvement in Invesco Trimark with 81% of the Canadian equity assets from the top half of the peer groups on a three-year basis from 65% on a one-year basis. Our global fixed income capability continues to achieve outstanding performance with 90% of the assets from the top half of peers on a one year basis, and 86% of assets from the top half of five years. Invesco Real Estate maintained a strong competitive position with 99% above the benchmark for three years, and 92% of the benchmark across five years, really just outstanding performance. And Morningstar ratings in the U.S. Retail business remain near the highest levels since October 2000 with 58% of the U.S. retail assets rated four or five stars.
So, I'd like to take a few minutes and just brief everybody on the momentum we're seeing in the combined business. And on Page 9, just a couple of the highlights, as I mentioned, we're very pleased to report that we are fully integrated with minimal transaction issues. And from that period, it's been really supported by an intensive pre-close training effort, which we discussed previously. Now retail sales force has been actively engaged with clients, and we're seeing steadily increasing momentum in that business. Our relevance as a top 10 U.S. fund manager is really enhancing Invesco's profile in the marketplace, and it's helping us gain greater access to top platforms in driving new business. And the Phase II work of rationalizing our product lineup is on schedule.
As if you take a look at Page 10, at the time of close last quarter, we told you what we had accomplished at the close. And it would not have happened without just tremendous amount of effort on both sides, both Invesco and Morgan Stanley. And that was an important milestone. But really, let's spend a minute on what the progress since the close and we've made steady progress building the Commodity business across three broad areas: clients, operational excellence and employee engagement. And most notably, U.S. retail asset close were on target and growing. We continue to enhance our profile on key platforms. We're actively engaged in clients with business plans for each client and deeper coverage teams aligned against them. Our product realignment efforts are on track, and we achieved our expense targets that we laid out at the beginning of the combination. Loren will discuss that more. And most importantly, we have a strong, engaged, stable investment management team in place, producing strong results for our clients. 
So if you take a look at Page 11, and give this greater focus in your minds, we've highlighted from the initial announcement of the combination with Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen, it was highly complimentary to Invesco's existing capabilities. And if you look at the two organizations, pre-close, you can get a sense of the product mix, and we know how was -- Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen was very complimentary and specialized fixed income and equity, but you can see the vehicle mix here, and post the close, you can look at the long term business in the United States as ETFs. UIT has been 31%; mutual funds, 44%; NBC and insurance, 25%. And the point is, in a really challenging U.S. equity mutual funds environment, the diversity provides real balance and clear benefits, not just for the clients, but also for the business. 
And if you look on Page 12, you can see what's happened. Post to close, we've continued to see solid momentum in this U.S. Retail business. Yes, driven by the strong investment performance, the client focus and the engagement, but what you'll note is, the incremental impact of the combined organization is clearly positive. And so if you look month-over-month, pre-close and post close, what you'll note is the trend, month over month of increased gross sales, and you'll see that post close, the punchline is this, average monthly gross sales are up 40%, and the average monthly redemption rate has declined 12 percentage points, which is really quite amazing. And I think you have to put it in the context so the flash crash in May, which is was very pronounced here in the United States. So that would be the early results of the combination. I'd still say we're very early in what we expect out of the combination as we look forward. 
The other thing that we've seen is, we continue to expand our presence on key client my platforms. There has been a 240% increase for the platform placements since the month of June, so that number of funds being put in a preferred rating with the different platforms. And again, we just continue to see growing interest in activity with the business. So our view is, that right now, we are on track, very, very much on track. And we think more good things to come. Just to bring you up to speed on where we are on Slide 13, really, the Phase II of the integration, it's really just a very, very sharp focus on the product offering for our clients. We anticipate this process to be done six to nine months after the September 30 close. We are well into the effort of seeking approval from the fund boards and ultimately from shareholders. But that process is on track and moving forward. So I'm going to stop there and hand it over to Loren."

Market gains provided $34.4 billion, FX added $8.2 billion and then acquisitions, net of this dispositions added $1.7  billion. These increases",1775,"Thanks, very much, Marty. Basically, during the quarter, our net long term flows provided $4.9 billion in AUM. Market gains provided $34.4 billion, FX added $8.2 billion and then acquisitions, net of this dispositions added $1.7  billion. These increases in AUM were partially offset by net outflows from money market funds of $2.4 billion. But the increase in AUM quarter-over-quarter was $46.8 billion or 8.4%, resulting in the ending assets of $604.5 billion. Our average assets under management actually increased more strongly, 21.4% to $583.3 billion. And this was primarily due to three full months of the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen Asset Management business in Q3 as opposed to only one month in Q2. Our net revenue yield in Q3 was 48.5 basis points, down only slightly quarter-over-quarter. And now let me turn to the operating results.
That quarter-over-quarter variances in P&L that you're going to see are largely due to the two additional months of the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen Retail Asset Management business in Q3 versus Q2. Net revenues increased $118.1 million or 20.1% quarter-over-quarter. The acquired business accounted for approximately $96 million of this increase, while favorable FX rates added about $8.1 million. Going down a little more deeply into that, you'll see that investment management fees grew by 14.7% or $95.7 million. And again, that was driven mostly by the contribution of the acquired business. FX contributed $11 million, while the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen business contributed approximately $74 million. The remaining management fees earnings of $10.7 million was due to the positive impact of the markets on AUM relative to the second quarter.
Service and distribution revenues increased by $52.2 million or 37.4%, with the acquisition accounting for about $50 million of this variance. Performance fees declined $1 million to end at $2.5 million. Other revenues improved by $16.9 million relative to Q2. Again, driven largely by the two months more of the Van Kampen business in Q3. $14 million of the $16.9 million favorable variance was a result of new UIT issuance, which continues to run at a higher level than initially expected. The remaining $2.9 million increase is due to greater retained front-end loads, as well as due to transaction commissions from our Real Estate business.
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased by $45.7 million, with the VK/MS acquisition contributing approximately $42 million of it, and FX adding the remaining $3.9 million. Moving on the Slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $461.3 million increased by $61 million or 15.2%. FX accounted for $5.4 million of this, which remainder largely being explained by the acquisition. Employee compensation expenses increased by $37.6 million or 14.5% versus the second quarter. The acquisition contributed to the majority of this variance, but we also had an increase in variable compensation, primarily bonus and sales commissions, in line with improving operating results in sales. And furthermore, we recognized $3.4 million of severance costs in Q3, which was $1.4 million less than what we recognized in Q2, and FX increased compensation expense by $3.7 million.
Marketing expense increased by $9.6 million or 27%. Again, largely due to the acquired business. Property, office and technology increased by 7.8% or 13.8% again for the same reason. G&A expenses came in at $54.3 million in the quarter, and was up $6 million versus the second quarter. FX added about $0.7 million, while the remaining $5.3 million in expense variance was explained equally by the impact of the acquisition, as well as a variety of other non-acquisition-related G&A expenses in the quarter. 
Continuing on down the page, you'll see that our effective tax rate on pretax adjusted cash net income in Q3 was unusually low relative to the other quarters, 23.1%, and in comparison to 29.3% in Q2. If you'll remember, however, this is in line with what happened in Q3 of 2009, and it's a function of our releasing the FIN 48 provisions for uncertain tax positions. What I would tell you is that going forward, this pattern of sharper lower tax rates in Q3 should subside as we don't expect to be releasing similarly large provisions in the future.
For Q4 2010, I'd say that we expect our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis to return to a more normalized ongoing level of about 29% to 30%. Before I move from this slide, I'll just point out that our adjusted EPS came in at $0.39, an increase of 44.4% versus Q2 and our adjusted net operating margin was 34.8%, improvements of 2.8 points versus Q2. So let me now shift gear. I'd like to provide an update on our progress towards achieving the cost synergy that we've discussed.
And moving to the next Slide, distinct from most other large transactions you've seen, we did take on imperatives to fully integrate the business essentially day one at the closing of the deal. And while this was a difficult challenge, it did set up the possibility for us to generate full cost synergies very quickly. And we mentioned in our Q2 release, after we closed the acquisition and simultaneously integrated the business, we'd no longer be able to track the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen businesses expenses separately from Invesco. And with that in mind, it is still possible though to demonstrate that we're delivering the promised expense synergies
Our original estimated cost synergies of $80 million to $85 million in year one, I'd point out, were net of $50 million of reinvestment and marketing for our U.S. retail business. So excluding the impact of incremental marketing investment, the comparable growth year one costs synergy expectations is $95 million to $100 million. And the reason I'm saying this is, given the requisite lead time and planning, we've not yet begun investing the incremental $50 million in marketing. And so, we do expect to begin the investing at the end of 2010 or early 2011, with the pace of spend at roughly $3.7 million per quarter. What that means is, that for the Q3 results we discussed with you today, we would want to see growth annualized run rate synergies into $95 million to $100 million range and not the $80 million to $85 million range. So on this slide, we can demonstrate that we fully achieved the targeted annualized run rate of $95 million to $100 million of gross cost synergies and Q3, with the one caveat that, it's not a precise method since post integration as I've discussed, we're not able to track the MS/VK expenses separately. Let me take a moment to explain this table.
Column A on this table shows 2x the adjusted one month of operating expenses that the VK/MS acquisition contributed in June 2010, and we've showed that in the second quarter release. You'll recall that we've provided -- actually Column A, excuse me, represents the expected Q3 versus Q2 expense variance due to the acquired business assuming no further cost synergies were created relative to the June results. Column B on this table details out activity that contributed to Invesco's quarter-over-quarter variances, but were unrelated to that VK/MS and U.S. Retail business. And that includes foreign exchange and other identifiable variances such as severance, as I discussed, from our retooling of the U.S. institutional sales force increases in variable compensation, another known expense item from Invesco, specifically. Column C is the sum of A and B. And they represents the hypothetical Q3 versus Q2 expense variances, assuming no additional run rate synergies created during Q3 relative to the run rate embedded in June. But essentially, it assumes that in Q3, we operated the MS/VK business as in the same way we did in June. 
In Column B is the actual quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating expense variances result for the firm. so if you take the difference between D and C, that's what you'll find in Column E. That represents the incremental cost synergies we achieved during the third quarter relative to the second quarter, and Column F is truly the annualization of column A. So taking you through all that, in summary, subject to the caveat I mentioned earlier, this does show that we achieved an incremental $45.6 million in run rate annual cost synergies during Q3. If you add this to the $51 million, which represents the annualized run rate synergies we calculated in June, we've delivered a total annualized run rate of $96.6 million in Q3. And this amounted to squarely within our one year target of $95 million to $100 million in gross cost synergies which, of course, excludes the impact of the new marketing investments.
So again, a little bit of complicated table, but I hope it gives you comfort that we're on tract to deliver no less than what we projected in year one. And as we've discussed, we would expect to deliver at least another $10 million in savings at the end of year two after the U.S. fund range product rationalization has been completed. So with that, let me take a moment, turn to the next slide and talk about our capital management.
So our priorities remain consistent, no surprise. We will first look to reinvest our cash flow back into our business, followed by making acquisitions that would make strategic and financial sense. Thirdly, we wish to provide a moderately increasing dividend every year, approximately 46% annual growth. And then fourth would be opportunistic stock buybacks. We'll continue to operate these capital priorities against the foundation of maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
The new reality, post financial crisis is that our client and consultants require investment management firms that they work with to have a strong financial profile. In addition, for Invesco, a strong balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to take advantage of strategic opportunity that could arise in the future. Therefore, as we've discussed in the past, our priority is to decrease the incremental leverage we took on at the close of the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen transaction and pay off the $650 million of borrowing that's drawing on the credit facility. So despite this, though, we also told you not assume that our hands are completely tied with respect to buying back stocks and given where the stock was trading during the third quarter, coupled with our normal practice of eliminating dilution from deferred equity compensation, we did undertake to buy back $127.7 million of stock, equating to 6.4 million shares, at an average price of $19.82. And so as you saw this last quarter, we will continue to maintain an opportunistic stance with respect to stock buybacks.
So let me now turn it over to Marty."

It's all going to be fully dependent upon, really, when do investors start to look to U.S. value equity is and asset class. And what I do feel when that starts to happen, we're going to participate very, very nicely because it's just a very strong track record. And so I personally think, Ken, this is a multiple quarter effort, and the other reality is, that if you look at the performance, if you look at the depth and breadth of the organization, the platforms that are being accepted and the funds on to the different platforms, that's very, very good. We still have some work to do. We're a new name in the retail channels, I mean, that's a fundamental fact. So as I've said, if you put us against a firm that's been operating with a single name for 15 years in the channel, they'll run ahead of us out of the box.

I'm sure, Robert, as you talked to some of the investment banks with distribution, I mean, they just literally went on strike. And so  you saw that. And I'd say what you're starting to see right now is, with the mutual funds and I think that is the area that was most impacted. Mutual funds, in particular, starting to get some confidence coming back a little bit in investors from that point of view. And probably, also moving up the risk curve a little bit as those people refer to as taking on risks. But I'd still say it's early. Where you did see it and what we saw, very much going into UITs and ETFs and that was a real positive, I'd say for us, and you probably saw that across the industry. But if you go to different parts of the world, whether it be Asia, or Europe or the United Kingdom, we had retail inflows in each of those areas. So it was not as impacted as the United States was. If you look at the institutional pipeline, it just continues to grow. And for us, the mandates tend to be -- continue to be very strong in real estate, continues to be very strong stable value. Also, some asset allocation capabilities that we have, premium thoughts  are really getting high degrees of interest. And so I'd say that's still a little more conservatively positioned than what we're seeing in the retail side of the business. And you do have some consultants that are actually very focused on fixed income and really limiting exposure to the equity market. And you can all pass our judgments whether or not we think that's the right asset allocation. But I suspect we're a lot closer to some people moving towards the equity side of the business."

And so those that are inclined to follow, I'm going to start on Page 2 of the presentation today. So if you look at the quarter, in spite of the continued volatility that we saw in the markets, Invesco's commitment to investment excellence really did yield a strong quarter, with continued strong investment performance across the enterprise. It remained very strong and with some areas of just absolutely exceptional performance. The strong investment performance contributed to a continued trend of our long-term inflows into the organization. And as many of you know, if not all of you -- on June 1, we completed the combination with Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen Retail Asset Management business. And our goal from the day we announced the transaction was to complete the integration work prior to the close and thanks to a tremendous amount of effort on everybody's part, we accomplished that goal and were able to deliver the value of the combined firm on day one as we refer to it. And now since we've completed it, we've now had a full quarter of the combined organization together in received strong momentum of that combined business. 
I'd also like to mention, during this third quarter, we resumed our share repurchase program and purchased 6.4 million shares, with the value of about $127 million. Later in this presentation, Lawrence is going to give some insight into our capital management approach. And also, I'd like to note that Standard & Poor's increased our enterprise risk management rating from adequate to strong. Invesco is now one of the four asset managers with a strong rating.
So if you take a look at Slide 3, assets under management ended the quarter at $604 billion and that compares to $557 billion at the end of the second quarter, reflecting the improved markets and also strong momentum in our combined business. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $245 million, an increase of 30% quarter-over-quarter, and long-term net inflows for the quarter were $4.9 billion, continued the positive trend we've demonstrated over the past several quarters. And consistent with the second quarter, we will provide a third quarter dividend of $0.11 per share. And again, Loren will go into much greater detail of the financials in just a moment.
If you take a look at the quarterly flows on Page 4, you'll see the strength in the third quarter gross sales lead to continued positive momentum in our long-term net inflows. And as I mentioned earlier, the long-term net inflows for the quarter were corporate $4.9 billion. This represents a seventh consecutive quarter of positive inflows for Invesco. 
And if you take a look on Slide 5 at the gross sales across retail and institutional channels, we continued to contribute positive net flows to Invesco, overall. And also, if you look at the Private Wealth Management segment of the business, it continued to experience consistent asset growth quarter-over-quarter. And we've seen net inflows for the past three years in the Private Wealth Management business. And if you take a look at investment performance for the group, it's one of the key reasons for the enhanced strength and stability of flows that we've seen over the past seven quarters. And if you look at the enterprise, 78% of the assets were ahead of peers on a three-year basis. And that compares to 71% one year ago, so continued improvement and strength and consistent good long-term performance. And again, the detailed charts of performance are in the appendix if you're so inclined. I would like to take a minute just to highlight some of the pockets of exceptional performance.
And starting with the long-term investment performance that Invesco Perpetual remains just outstanding, with more than 90% of the assets from the top half of peers over one, three and five years. We continue to see improvement in Invesco Trimark with 81% of the Canadian equity assets from the top half of the peer groups on a three-year basis from 65% on a one-year basis. Our global fixed income capability continues to achieve outstanding performance with 90% of the assets from the top half of peers on a one year basis, and 86% of assets from the top half of five years. Invesco Real Estate maintained a strong competitive position with 99% above the benchmark for three years, and 92% of the benchmark across five years, really just outstanding performance. And Morningstar ratings in the U.S. Retail business remain near the highest levels since October 2000 with 58% of the U.S. retail assets rated four or five stars.
So, I'd like to take a few minutes and just brief everybody on the momentum we're seeing in the combined business. And on Page 9, just a couple of the highlights, as I mentioned, we're very pleased to report that we are fully integrated with minimal transaction issues. And from that period, it's been really supported by an intensive pre-close training effort, which we discussed previously. Now, retail sales force has been actively engaged with clients, and we're seeing steadily increasing momentum in that business. Our relevance as a top 10 U.S. fund manager is really enhancing Invesco's profile in the marketplace, and it's helping us gain greater access to top platforms in driving new business. And the Phase II work of rationalizing our product lineup is on schedule.
As if you take a look at Page 10, at the time of close last quarter, we told you what we had accomplished at the close. And it would not have happened without just tremendous amount of effort on both sides, both Invesco and Morgan Stanley. And that was an important milestone. But really, let's spend a minute on what the progress since the close and we've made steady progress building the Commodity business across three broad areas: clients, operational excellence and employee engagement. And most notably, U.S. retail asset flows were on target and growing. We continue to enhance our profile on key platforms. We're actively engaged in clients with business plans for each client and deeper coverage teams aligned against them. Our product realignment efforts are on track, and we achieved our expense targets that we laid out at the beginning of the combination. Loren will discuss that more. And most importantly, we have a strong, engaged, stable investment management team in place, producing strong results for our clients. 
So if you take a look at Page 11, and give this greater focus in your minds, we've highlighted from the initial announcement of the combination with Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen, it was highly complementary to Invesco's existing capabilities. And if you look at the two organizations, pre-close, you can get a sense of the product mix, and we know how was -- Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen -- was very complementary in specialized fixed-income and equity, but you can see the vehicle mix here, and post the close, you can look at the long-term business in the United States as ETFs. UITs being 31%; mutual funds, 44%; NBC [ph] and insurance, 25%. And the point is, in a really challenging U.S. equity mutual fund environment, the diversity provides real balance and clear benefits, not just for the clients, but also for the business. 
And if you look on Page 12, you can see what's happened. Post-close, we've continued to see solid momentum in this U.S. Retail business. Yes, driven by the strong investment performance, the client focus and the engagement, but what you'll note is, the incremental impact of the combined organization is clearly positive. And so if you look month-over-month, pre-close and post close, what you'll note is the trend, month-over-month of increased gross sales, and you'll see that post close, the punch line is this, average monthly gross sales are up 40%, and the average monthly redemption rate has declined 12 percentage points, which is really quite amazing. And I think you have to put it in the context so the flash crash in May, which was very pronounced here in the United States. So that would be the early results of the combination. I'd still say we're very early in what we expect out of the combination as we look forward. 
The other thing that we've seen is, we continue to expand our presence on key client my platforms. There has been a 240% increase for the platform placements since the month of June, so that number of funds being put in a preferred rating with the different platforms. And again, we just continue to see growing interest in activity with the business. So our view is, that right now, we are on track, very, very much on track. And we think more good things to come. Just to bring you up to speed on where we are on Slide 13, really, for Phase II of the integration, it's really just a very, very sharp focus on the product offering for our clients. We anticipate this process to be done six to nine months after the September 30 close. We are well into the effort of seeking approval from the fund boards and ultimately from shareholders. But that process is on track and moving forward. So I'm going to stop there and hand it over to Loren."

Basically, during the quarter, our net long term flows provided $4.9 billion in AUM. Market gains provided $34.4 billion, FX added $8.2 billion and then acquisitions, net of this dispositions added $1.7  billion. These increases in AUM were partially offset by net outflows from money market funds of $2.4 billion. But the increase in AUM quarter-over-quarter was $46.8 billion or 8.4%, resulting in the ending assets of $604.5 billion. Our average assets under management actually increased more strongly, 21.4% to $583.3 billion. And this was primarily due to three full months of the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen Asset Management business in Q3 as opposed to only one month in Q2. Our net revenue yield in Q3 was 48.5 basis points, down only slightly quarter-over-quarter. And now let me turn to the operating results.
The quarter-over-quarter variances in P&L that you're going to see are largely due to the two additional months of the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen Retail Asset Management business in Q3 versus Q2. Net revenues increased $118.1 million or 20.1% quarter-over-quarter. The acquired business accounted for approximately $96 million of this increase, while favorable FX rates added about $8.1 million. Going down a little more deeply into that, you'll see that investment management fees grew by 14.7% or $95.7 million. And again, that was driven mostly by the contribution of the acquired business. FX contributed $11 million, while the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen business contributed approximately $74 million. The remaining management fees earnings of $10.7 million was due to the positive impact of the markets on AUM relative to the second quarter.
Service and distribution revenues increased by $52.2 million or 37.4%, with the acquisition accounting for about $50 million of this variance. Performance fees declined $1 million to end at $2.5 million. Other revenues improved by $16.9 million relative to Q2. Again, driven largely by the two months more of the Van Kampen business in Q3. $14 million of the $16.9 million favorable variance was a result of new UIT issuance, which continues to run at a higher level than initially expected. The remaining $2.9 million increase is due to greater retained front-end loads, as well as due to transaction commissions from our Real Estate business.
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased by $45.7 million, with the VK/MS acquisition contributing approximately $42 million of it, and FX adding the remaining $3.9 million. Moving on the Slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $461.3 million increased by $61 million or 15.2%. FX accounted for $5.4 million of this, with remainder largely being explained by the acquisition. Employee compensation expenses increased by $37.6 million or 14.5% versus the second quarter. The acquisition contributed to the majority of this variance, but we also had an increase in variable compensation, primarily bonus and sales commissions, in line with improving operating results in sales. And furthermore, we recognized $3.4 million of severance costs in Q3, which was $1.4 million less than what we recognized in Q2, and FX increased compensation expense by $3.7 million.
Marketing expense increased by $9.6 million or 27%. Again, largely due to the acquired business. Property, office and technology increased by $7.8 million or 13.8%, again for the same reason. G&A expenses came in at $54.3 million in the quarter, and was up $6 million versus the second quarter. FX added about $0.7 million, while the remaining $5.3 million in expense variance was explained equally by the impact of the acquisition, as well as a variety of other non-acquisition-related G&A expenses in the quarter. 
Continuing on down the page, you'll see that our effective tax rate on pretax adjusted cash net income in Q3 was unusually low relative to the other quarters, 23.1%, and in comparison to 29.3% in Q2. If you'll remember, however, this is in line with what happened in Q3 of 2009, and it's a function of our releasing the FIN 48 provisions for uncertain tax positions. What I would tell you is that going forward, this pattern of sharper lower tax rates in Q3 should subside as we don't expect to be releasing similarly large provisions in the future.
For Q4 2010, I'd say that we expect our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis to return to a more normalized ongoing level of about 29% to 30%. Before I move from this slide, I'll just point out that our adjusted EPS came in at $0.39, an increase of 44.4% versus Q2 and our adjusted net operating margin was 34.8%, improvement of 2.8 points versus Q2. So let me now shift gears. I'd like to provide an update on our progress towards achieving the cost synergies that we've discussed.
And moving to the next slide, distinct from most other large transactions you've seen, we did take on an imperative to fully integrate the business essentially day one at the closing of the deal. While this was a difficult challenge, it did set up the possibility for us to generate full cost synergies very quickly. As we mentioned in our Q2 release, after we closed the acquisition and simultaneously integrated the business, we'd no longer be able to track the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen businesses expenses separately from Invesco’s. And with that in mind, it is still possible though to demonstrate that we're delivering the promised expense synergies
Our original estimated cost synergies of $80 million to $85 million in year one, I'd point out, were net of $15 million of reinvestment and marketing for our U.S. retail business. So excluding the impact of incremental marketing investment, the comparable growth year one costs synergy expectations is $95 million to $100 million. And the reason I'm saying this is, given the requisite lead time and planning, we've not yet begun investing the incremental $15 million in marketing. And so, we do expect to begin the investing at the end of 2010 or early 2011, with the pace of spend at roughly $3.7 million per quarter. What that means is, that for the Q3 results we discussed with you today, we would want to see growth annualized run rate synergies into $95 million to $100 million range and not the $80 million to $85 million range. So on this slide, we can demonstrate that we fully achieved the targeted annualized run rate of $95 million to $100 million of gross cost synergies and Q3, with the one caveat that, it's not a precise method since post integration as I've discussed, we're not able to track the MS/VK expenses separately. Let me take a moment to explain this table.
Column A on this table shows 2x the adjusted one month of operating expenses that the VK/MS acquisition contributed in June 2010, and we've showed that in the second quarter release. You'll recall that we've provided -- actually Column A, excuse me, represents the expected Q3 versus Q2 expense variance due to the acquired business assuming no further cost synergies were created relative to the June results. Column B on this table details out activity that contributed to Invesco's quarter-over-quarter variances, but were unrelated to that VK/MS and U.S. Retail business. And that includes foreign exchange and other identifiable variances such as severance, as I discussed, from our retooling of the U.S. institutional sales force increases in variable compensation, another known expense item from Invesco, specifically. Column C is the sum of A and B. And they represent the hypothetical Q3 versus Q2 expense variances, assuming no additional run rate synergies created during Q3 relative to the run rate embedded in June. But essentially, it assumes that in Q3, we operated the MS/VK business as in the same way we did in June. 
In Column B is the actual quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating expense variances result for the firm. so if you take the difference between D and C, that's what you'll find in Column E. That represents the incremental cost synergies we achieved during the third quarter relative to the second quarter, and Column F is truly the annualization of column E. So taking you through all that, in summary, subject to the caveat I mentioned earlier, this does show that we achieved an incremental $45.6 million in run rate annual cost synergies during Q3. If you add this to the $51 million, which represents the annualized run rate synergies we calculated in June, we've delivered a total annualized run rate of $96.6 million in Q3. And this amounted to squarely within our one year target of $95 million to $100 million in gross cost synergies which, of course, excludes the impact of the new marketing investments.
So again, a little bit of a complicated table, but I hope it gives you comfort that we're on track to deliver no less than what we projected in year one. And as we've discussed, we would expect to deliver at least another $10 million in savings at the end of year two after the U.S. fund range product rationalization has been completed. So with that, let me take a moment, turn to the next slide and talk about our capital management.
So our priorities remain consistent, no surprise. We will first look to reinvest our cash flow back into our business, followed by making acquisitions that would make strategic and financial sense. Thirdly, we wish to provide a moderately increasing dividend every year, approximately 46% annual growth. And then fourth, would be opportunistic stock buybacks. We'll continue to operate these capital priorities against the foundation of maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
The new reality, post financial crisis, is that our clients and consultants require investment management firms that they work with to have a strong financial profile. In addition, for Invesco, a strong balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to take advantage of strategic opportunities that could arise in the future. Therefore, as we've discussed in the past, our priority is to decrease the incremental leverage we took on at the close of the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen transaction and pay off the $650 million of borrowing that's drawn on the credit facility. So despite this, though, we also told you not assume that our hands are completely tied with respect to buying back stocks and given where the stock was trading during the third quarter, coupled with our normal practice of eliminating dilution from deferred equity compensation, we did undertake to buy back $127.7 million of stock, equating to 6.4 million shares, at an average price of $19.82. And so as you saw this last quarter, we will continue to maintain an opportunistic stance with respect to stock buybacks.
So let me now turn it over to Marty."

I don't think you're going to see -- I think [indiscernible] what kind of closing you're going to see. It's all going to be fully dependent upon, really, when do investors start to look to what U.S. value equity is and asset class. And what I do feel when that starts to happen, we're going to participate very, very nicely because it's just a very strong track record. And so I personally think, Ken, this is a multiple quarter effort, and the other reality is, that if you look at the performance, if you look at the depth and breadth of the organization, the platforms that are being accepted and the funds on to the different platforms, that's very, very good. We still have some work to do. We're a new name in the retail channels, I mean, that's a fundamental fact. So as I've said, if you put us against a firm that's been operating with a single name for 15 years in the channel, they'll run ahead of us out of the box.

So I think you have to look at the world in different ways and funnily enough, I think the U.S. retail world was uniquely impacted by the flash crash. And I think you saw that across. I'm sure, Robert, as you talked to some of the investment banks with distribution, I mean, they just literally went on strike. And so  you saw that. And I'd say what you're starting to see right now is, with the mutual funds and I think that is the area that was most impacted. Mutual funds, in particular, starting to get some confidence coming back a little bit in investors from that point of view. And probably, also moving up the risk curve a little bit as people prefer to taking on risks. But I'd still say it's early. Where you did see it and what we saw, very much going into UITs and ETFs and that was a real positive, I'd say for us, and you probably saw that across the industry. But if you go to different parts of the world, whether it be Asia, or Europe or the United Kingdom, we had retail inflows in each of those areas. So it was not as impacted as the United States was. If you look at the institutional pipeline, it just continues to grow. And for us, the mandates tend to be -- continue to be very strong in real estate, continues to be very strong stable value. Also, some asset allocation capabilities that we have, premium thoughts  are really getting high degrees of interest. And so I'd say that's still a little more conservatively positioned than what we're seeing in the retail side of the business. And you do have some consultants that are actually very focused on fixed-income and really limiting exposure to the equity market. And you can all pass our judgments whether or not we think that's the right asset allocation. But I suspect we're a lot closer to some people moving towards the equity side of the business."

They're very well run. We didn't have any downgrades of credit. We didn't have SIBs. None of those types of things.

And the notion of immunizing your portfolio at the bottom of the market cycle, too me, doesn't seem very wise. So the combination of some firms that are able to get contributions, which we saw just from the last week or two, we saw some of those. I personally believe you're going to see some equity exposure go against that. It's very hard to close that gap by immunizing your portfolio. Just mathematically, you can't do it. But that doesn't mean that you won't see some firms that are fully funded or close to it that would take some risks off the table by immunizing their portfolio. So the reality is -- I think where all of us see road to retirement growth, it's going to be in the DC world. But there is a tremendous amount of assets in the BB world right now. And I still think the merits of a well-balanced portfolio to deliver results are going to make sense. And maybe once funds are fully funded, and they can offset the liability, you'll see a massive immunization trend.

I think for Fund IV, it did not get invested as quickly as maybe some of the other funds have been for, given the market, it was prudent to wait and probably smarter to have done that. And we have, obviously, been waiting for it to get to 75% invested because we could not launch another fund until that happens. In terms of the harvesting period, I think it's still going to be several years to be thinking about the timing before we actually see a performance fee. It's above a hurdle too, so you need to generate, I think, it's 8.5% hurdle rate, generally. So I would guide a couple of years before you begin to think about performance fees for Fund IV."

W",1631,"Good morning and thank you, everybody, for joining us. This is Martin Flanagan, and along with Loren Starr, as was just pointed out. Loren and I will be speaking to the presentation that's available on the website, if you're so inclined to follow along. What we'll do today is, I'll highlight the business results, and we'll spend a few minutes just on a current update of the combination with Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen, the combination that we just closed in June. And then Loren will go into greater detail on the financials. And then finally, we'll open up to Q&A.
And so those that are inclined to follow, I'm going to start on Page 2 of the presentation today. So if you look at the quarter, in spite of the continued volatility that we saw in the markets, Invesco's commitment to investment excellence really did yield a strong quarter, with continued strong investment performance across the enterprise. It remained very strong and there was some areas of just absolutely exceptional performance. The strong investment performance contributed to a continued trend of positive long-term inflows into the organization. And as many of you know, if not all of you, on June 1, we completed the combination with Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen Retail Asset Management business. And our goal from the day we announced the transaction was to complete the integration work prior to the close. And thanks to a tremendous amount of effort on everybody's part, we accomplished that goal and were able to deliver the value of the combined firm on day one as we refer to it. And now since we've completed it, we've now had a full quarter of the combined organization together and we're seeing strong momentum of that combined business. 
I'd also like to mention, during the third quarter, we resumed our share repurchase program and purchased 6.4 million shares, with the value of about $127 million. Later in this presentation, Loren's going to give some insight into our capital management approach. And also, I'd like to note that Standard & Poor's increased our enterprise risk management rating from adequate to strong. Invesco is now one of four asset managers with a strong rating.
So if you take a look at Slide 3, assets under management ended the quarter at $604 billion and that compares to $557 billion at the end of the second quarter, reflecting the improved markets and also strong momentum in our combined business. Adjusted operating income for the third quarter was $245 million, an increase of 30% quarter-over-quarter, and long-term net inflows for the quarter were $4.9 billion, continuing the positive trend we've demonstrated over the past several quarters. And consistent with the second quarter, we will provide a third quarter dividend of $0.11 per share. And again, Loren will go into much greater detail of the financials in just a moment.
If you take a look at the quarterly flows on Page 4, you'll see the strength in the third quarter gross sales led to continued positive momentum in our long-term net inflows. And as I mentioned earlier, the long-term net inflows for the quarter were $4.9 billion. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter of positive inflows for Invesco. 
And if you take a look on Slide 5 at the gross sales across retail and institutional channels, they continue to contribute positive net flows to Invesco, overall. And also, if you look at the Private Wealth Management segment of the business, it continued to experience consistent asset growth quarter-over-quarter. And we've seen net inflows for the past three years in the Private Wealth Management business. And if you take a look at investment performance for the group, it's one of the key reasons for the enhanced strength and stability of flows that we've seen over the past seven quarters. And if you look at the enterprise, 78% of the assets were ahead of peers on a three-year basis. And that compares to 71% one year ago, so continued improvement and strength and consistent good long-term performance. And again, the detailed charts of performance are in the appendix if you're so inclined. I would like to take a minute just to highlight some of the pockets of exceptional performance.
And starting with long-term investment performance at Invesco Perpetual remains just outstanding, with more than 90% of the assets in the top half of peers over one, three and five years. We continue to see improvement in Invesco Trimark with 81% of the Canadian equity assets in the top half of peer groups on a three-year basis with 65% on a one-year basis. Our global fixed income capability continues to achieve outstanding performance with 90% of the assets in the top half of peers on a one-year basis, and 86% of assets in the top half for five-years. Invesco Real Estate maintained a strong competitive position with 99% above benchmark for three years, and 92% of the benchmark across five years, really just outstanding performance. And Morningstar ratings in the U.S. Retail business remain near the highest levels since October 2000 with 58% of the U.S. Retail assets rated four or five stars.
So, I'd like to take a few minutes and just brief everybody on the momentum we're seeing in the combined business. And on Page 9, just a couple of the highlights. As I mentioned, we're very pleased to report that we are fully integrated with minimal transaction issues. And from that period, it's been really supported by an intensive pre-close training effort, which we discussed previously. And our retail sales force has been actively engaged with clients, and we're seeing steadily increasing momentum in that business. Our relevance as a top 10 U.S. fund manager is really enhancing Invesco's profile in the marketplace, and it's helping us gain greater access to top platforms in driving new business. And the Phase II work of rationalizing our product lineup is on schedule.
So if you take a look at Page 10, at the time of close last quarter, we told you what we had accomplished at the close. And it would not have happened without just tremendous amount of effort on both sides, both Invesco and Morgan Stanley. And that was an important milestone. But really, let's spend a minute on what's the progress since the close, and we've made steady progress building the combined business across three broad areas: clients, operational excellence and employee engagement. And most notably, U.S. retail asset flows were on target and growing. We continue to enhance our profile on key platforms. We're actively engaging clients with business plans for each client and deeper coverage teams aligned against them. Our product realignment efforts are on track, and we achieved our expense targets that we laid out at the beginning of the combination. Loren will discuss that more. And most importantly, we have a strong, engaged, stable investment management team in place, producing strong results for our clients. 
So if you take a look at Page 11, and give this greater focus in your minds, we've highlighted from the initial announcement of the combination with Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen, it was highly complementary to Invesco's existing capabilities. And if you look at the two organizations, pre-close, you can get a sense of the product mix, and we know Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen was very complementary in specialized fixed-income and equity, but you can see the vehicle mix here, and post the close, you can look at the long-term business in the United States as ETFs: UITs being 31%; mutual funds, 44%; and DC and insurance, 25%. And the point is, in a really challenging U.S. equity mutual fund environment, the diversity provides real balance and clear benefits, not just for the clients, but also for the business. 
And if you look on Page 12, you can see what's happened. Post-close, we've continued to see solid momentum in this U.S. Retail business. Yes, driven by the strong investment performance, the client focus and the engagement, but what you'll note is, the incremental impact of the combined organization is clearly positive. And so if you look month-over-month, pre-close and post close, what you'll note is the trend, month-over-month of increased gross sales. And you'll see that post close, the punchline is this: average monthly gross sales are up 40%, and the average monthly redemption rate has declined 12 percentage points, which is really quite amazing. And I think you have to put that in the context of the flash crash in May, which was very pronounced here in the United States. So that would be the early results of the combination. I'd still say we're very early in what we expect out of the combination as we look forward. 
The other thing that we've seen is, we continue to expand our presence on key client platforms. There has been a 240% increase of the platform placements since the month of June, so that number of funds being put in a preferred rating with the different platforms. And again, we just continue to see growing interest in activity with the business. So our view is that right now, we are on track, very, very much on track. And we think more good things to come. 
And just to bring you up to speed on where we are on Slide 13, really, for Phase II of the integration, it's really just a very, very sharp focus on the product offering for our clients. We anticipate this process to be done six to nine months after the September 30 close. We are well into the effort of seeking approval from the fund boards and ultimately from shareholders. But that process is on track and moving forward. So I'm going to stop there and hand it over to Loren."

Market gains provided $34.4 billion, FX added $8.2 billion and then acquisitions, net of dispositions added $1.7  billion. These increases in AUM",1781,"Thanks very much, Marty. Basically, during the quarter, our net long-term flows provided $4.9 billion in AUM. Market gains provided $34.4 billion, FX added $8.2 billion and then acquisitions, net of dispositions added $1.7  billion. These increases in AUM were partially offset by net outflows from money market funds of $2.4 billion. But the increase in AUM quarter-over-quarter was $46.8 billion or 8.4%, resulting in the ending assets of $604.5 billion. Our average assets under management actually increased more strongly, 21.4% to $583.3 billion. And this was primarily due to three full months of the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen Asset Management business in Q3 as opposed to only one month in Q2. Our net revenue yield in Q3 was 48.5 basis points, down only slightly quarter-over-quarter. And now let me turn to the operating results.
The quarter-over-quarter variances in P&L that you're going to see are largely due to the two additional months of the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen Retail Asset Management business in Q3 versus Q2. Net revenues increased $118.1 million or 20.1% quarter-over-quarter. The acquired business accounted for approximately $96 million of this increase, while favorable FX rates added about $8.1 million. Going down a little more deeply into that, you'll see that investment management fees grew by 14.7% or $95.7 million. And again, that was driven mostly by the contribution of the acquired business. FX contributed $11 million, while the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen business contributed approximately $74 million. The remaining management fee variance of $10.7 million was due to the positive impact of markets on AUM relative to the second quarter.
Service and distribution revenues increased by $52.2 million or 37.4%, with the acquisition accounting for about $50 million of this variance. Performance fees declined $1 million to end at $2.5 million. Other revenues improved by $16.9 million relative to Q2. Again, driven largely by the two months more of the Van Kampen business in Q3. $14 million of the $16.9 million favorable variance was a result of new UIT issuance, which continues to run at a higher level than initially expected. The remaining $2.9 million increase is due to greater retained front-end loads, as well as due to transaction commissions from our Real Estate business.
Third-party distribution, service and advisory expense, which we net against gross revenues, increased by $45.7 million, with the VK/MS acquisition contributing approximately $42 million of this, and FX adding the remaining $3.9 million. Moving on the slide, you'll see that our adjusted operating expenses at $461.3 million increased by $61 million or 15.2%. FX accounted for $5.4 million of this, with the remainder largely being explained by the acquisition. Employee compensation expenses increased by $37.6 million or 14.5% versus the second quarter. The acquisition contributed to the majority of this variance, but we also had an increase in variable compensation, primarily bonus and sales commissions, in line with improving operating results in sales. And furthermore, we recognized $3.4 million of severance costs in Q3, which was $1.4 million less than what we recognized in Q2, and FX increased compensation expense by $3.7 million.
Marketing expense increased by $9.6 million or 27%, again, largely due to the acquired business. Property, office and technology increased by $7.8 million or 13.8%, again for the same reason. G&A expenses came in at $54.3 million in the quarter, that was up $6 million versus the second quarter. FX added about $0.7 million, while the remaining $5.3 million in the expense variance was explained equally by the impact of the acquisition, as well as a variety of other non-acquisition-related G&A expenses in the quarter. 
Continuing on down the page, you'll see that our effective tax rate on pretax adjusted cash net income in Q3 was unusually low relative to the other quarters, 23.1%, and in comparison to 29.3% in Q2. You'll remember, however, that this is in line with what happened in Q3 of 2009, and it's a function of our releasing the FIN 48 provisions for uncertain tax positions. What I would tell you is that going forward, this pattern of sharply lower tax rates in Q3 should subside as we don't expect to be releasing similarly large provisions in the future.
For Q4 2010, I'd say that we expect our effective tax rate on an adjusted basis to return to a more normalized ongoing level of about 29% to 30%. Before I move from this slide, I'll just point out that our adjusted EPS came in at $0.39, an increase of 44.4% versus Q2 and our adjusted net operating margin was 34.8%, improvement of 2.8 points versus Q2. So let me now shift gears. I'd like to provide an update on our progress towards achieving the cost synergies that we've discussed.
And moving to the next slide, distinct from most other large transactions you've seen, we did take on an imperative to fully integrate the business essentially day one at the closing of the deal. And while this was a difficult challenge, it did set up the possibility for us to generate full cost synergies very quickly. As we mentioned in our Q2 release, after we closed the acquisition and simultaneously integrated the business, we'd no longer be able to track the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen business expenses separately from Invesco’s. And with that in mind, it is still possible though to demonstrate that we're delivering the promised expense synergies
Our original estimated cost synergies of $80 million to $85 million in year one, I'd point out, were net of $15 million of reinvestment in marketing for our U.S. retail business. So excluding the impact of incremental marketing investment, the comparable gross year one cost synergy expectation is $95 million to $100 million. And the reason I'm saying this is, given the requisite lead time and planning, we've not yet begun investing the incremental $15 million in marketing. And so, we do expect to begin the investing at the end of 2010 or early 2011, with a pace of spend at roughly $3.7 million per quarter. But what that means is that for the Q3 results we're discussing today, we would want to see gross annualized run rate synergies in the $95 million to $100 million range and not the $80 million to $85 million range. So on this slide, we can demonstrate that we fully achieved the targeted annualized run rate of $95 million to $100 million of gross cost synergies in Q3, with the one caveat that, it's not a precise method since post integration as I've discussed, we're not able to track the MS/VK expenses separately. Let me take a moment to explain this table.
Column A on this table shows 2x the adjusted one month of operating expenses that the VK/MS acquisition contributed in June 2010, and we showed that in the second quarter release. You'll recall that we've provided -- actually Column A, excuse me, represents the expected Q3 versus Q2 expense variance due to the acquired business assuming no further cost synergies were created relative to the June results. Column B on this table details out activity that contributed to Invesco's quarter-over-quarter variances, but were unrelated to the VK/MS and U.S. Retail business. And that includes foreign exchange and other identifiable variances such as severance, as I discussed, from our retooling of the U.S. institutional sales force increases in variable compensation, another known expense items from Invesco, specifically. Column C is the sum of A and B. And they represent the hypothetical Q3 versus Q2 expense variances, assuming no additional run rate synergies created during Q3 relative to the run rate embedded in June. So essentially, it assumes that in Q3, we operated the MS/VK business as in the same way we did in June. 
In Column B is the actual quarter-over-quarter adjusted operating expense variances result for the firm. So if you take the difference between D and C, that's what you'll find in Column E. That represents the incremental cost synergies we achieved during the third quarter relative to the second quarter, and Column F is truly the annualization of Column E. So taking you through all that, in summary, subject to the caveat I mentioned earlier, this does show that we achieved an incremental $45.6 million in run rate annual cost synergies during Q3. And if you add this to the $51 million, which represents the annualized run rate synergies we calculated in June, we've delivered a total annualized run rate of $96.6 million in Q3. And this amount is squarely within our one year target of $95 million to $100 million in gross cost synergies which, of course, excludes the impact of the new marketing investments.
So again, a little bit of a complicated table, but I hope it gives you comfort that we're on track to deliver no less than what we projected in year one. And as we've discussed, we would expect to deliver at least another $10 million in savings at the end of year two after the U.S. fund range product rationalization has been completed. So with that, let me take a moment, turn to the next slide and talk about our capital management.
So our priorities remain consistent, no surprise. We will first look to reinvest our cash flow back in our business, followed by making acquisitions if they make strategic and financial sense. Thirdly, we wish to provide a moderately increasing dividend every year, approximately 4% to 6% annual growth. And then fourth, would be opportunistic stock buybacks. We'll continue to operate these capital priorities against the foundation of maintaining a strong balance sheet. 
The new reality, post financial crisis, is that our clients and consultants require investment management firms that they work with to have a strong financial profile. In addition, for Invesco, a strong balance sheet provides us with the flexibility to take advantage of strategic opportunities that could arise in the future. Therefore, as we've discussed in the past, our priority is to decrease the incremental leverage we took on at the close of the Morgan Stanley/Van Kampen transaction and pay off the $650 million of borrowing that's drawn on the credit facility. So despite this, though, we also told you not to assume that our hands were completely tied with respect to buying back stock. And given where the stock was trading during the third quarter, coupled with our normal practice of eliminating dilution from deferred equity compensation, we did undertake to buy back $127.7 million of stock, equating to 6.4 million shares, at an average price of $19.82. And so as you saw this last quarter, we will continue to maintain an opportunistic stance with respect to stock buybacks.
So let me now turn it over to Marty."

So Van Kampen on to some of the platforms they were less strong on that has gone very, very well. And if you look at their performance in the key areas, the U.S. value in particular, and the broader muni bond platform that we have now, very, very strong. I don't think you're going to see -- I think what you're ultimately going -- again what kind of flows are you going to see. It's all going to be fully dependent upon, really, when do investors start to look to U.S. value equity as an asset class. And what I do feel when that starts to happen, we're going to participate very, very nicely because it's just a very strong track record. And so I personally think, Ken, this is a multiple quarter effort, and the other reality is that if you look at the performance, if you look at the depth and breadth of the organization, the platforms that are being accepted and the funds on to the different platforms, that's very, very good. We still have some work to do. We're a new name in the retail channels, I mean, that's a fundamental fact. So as I've said, if you put us against a firm that's been operating with a single name for 15 years in the channel, they'll run ahead of us out of the box. But I'd say we're making very, very good progress along the way to be a very, very important partner."

And I think you saw that across -- I'm sure, Robert, as you talked to some of the investment banks with distribution, I mean, they just literally went on strike. And so you saw that. And I'd say what you're starting to see right now is, the mutual funds, and I think that was the area that was most impacted. Mutual funds, in particular, starting to get some confidence coming back a little bit in investors from that point of view. And probably, ultimately moving out the risk curve a little bit, as people refer to taking on risk. But I'd still say it's early. Where you did see it and what we saw, very much growing into UITs and ETFs and that was a real positive, I'd say for us, and you probably saw that across the industry. But if you go to different parts of the world, whether it be Asia or Europe or the United Kingdom, we had retail inflows in each of those areas. So it was not as impacted as the United States was. If you look at the institutional pipeline, it just continues to grow. And for us, the mandates tend to be -- continue to be very strong in real estate, continue to be very strong stable value. Also, some asset allocation capabilities that we have, Premia Plus are really getting high degrees of interest. And so I'd say that's still a little more conservatively positioned than what we're seeing in the retail side of the business. And you do have some consultants that are actually very focused on fixed income and really limiting exposure to the equity market. And we can all pass our judgments whether or not we think that's the right asset allocation. But I suspect we're a lot closer to some people moving towards the equity side of the business."
