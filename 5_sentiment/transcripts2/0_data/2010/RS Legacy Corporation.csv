As we said in our earnings release today, we're pleased with our fourth quarter and 2009 performance. The results, I think, points to solid progress on the strategies we set for our company, particularly to our capabilities in the area of mobility in all of these products and our skill in providing an unparalleled customer experience. That said, of course, we have work yet to do in some areas of our business.As some of you who followed us for a while may know, our focus began by strengthening the financial position of the company. Secondly, improving the quality of our operations and most recently, and largely because we've achieved the level of financial and operational success. We're focused on revitalizing and contemporizing our brand. I'll spend a few minutes on these three points and then I'll let Jim, Bryan and Lee speak to each of their areas in more detail. Firstly, many of you know that we've made significant progress in improving the financial strength and flexibility of our company. This is being accomplished through a highly disciplined approach, cost control focused on profitable sales and a strong focus on the strength of the balance sheet. In 2009, we were able to increase operating margin by 100 basis points to 8.6%. We further improved our net debt, which stands at cash in excess of debt of over $200 million.Operation, we've invested to make improvements to our store physical plan to raise the quality and expertise of our sales teams. Physically, we've worked to make our stores easier to shop through the store layout, displays, packaging, products and so on. And you'll continue to see improvements as we move through 2010. We believe that our scale with over 6,000 stores and dealer outlets, combined with our store involvement, comfortable store size with carefully thought out product assortment and helpful, collaborative sales experts creates a unique competitive advantage for our company. Brian is going to talk more about store operations in a moment.Lastly, our brand. We've begun to make interim aligning our brand perception with the progress we've made at the business. In our case, the brand conception was lagging the business progress improvement. The launch of our new brand-creative platform, THE SHACK, in the third quarter has captured the attention of consumers, signaled that a change has occurred and ultimately is beginning to change the way consumers see it, particularly in the area of mobile technology. We've carefully balanced brand building with product and service offerings in the advertising mix and had some exciting plans for this year, which Lee will speak to in a moment.So a few words on mobility. Several key events in the fourth quarter helped us to reinforce our leadership in the areas of mobility and innovative technology. First, with the addition of T-Mobile as the third national wireless carrier to our stores. Now, with a combination of AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile, we have a strong diverse selection of carrier offering. Importantly, since adding T-Mobile, we have been able to realize growth from all three of our carriers. Additionally, gaining national distribution for Apple's iPhones further solidified our strong position in mobility. The iPhone we're launching [ph] (17:26) is nearly complete. We're currently implementing several hundred stores per week, with a plan to have the product available in about 3,000 stores by the end of March. We've been methodical in our road lags [ph](17:38)so that we could focus on training our team to make sure that our customers receive the high-quality service experience that they come to expect from THE SHACK.  The iPhone product launch is a great example to the traction we're seeing with our mobility strategy, an acknowledgment that our financial and operational strength as well as our brand evolution is being recognized by key vendor partners. Finally in October, we launched a pilot mobility kiosk program with Target Corp. The pilot covers about 100 stores, and we're pleased to say that we believe the project is going well. Target is clearly one of the most important and respected retailers in America. And we're hopeful we can continue to work together with them in the future.These successes have, of course, been achieved through tremendous teamwork, dedication and hard work on the part of RadioShack employees. I'm immensely proud of them and thankful for their dedication. Our business success and strength has also improved our workplace culture, creating new challenges and new opportunities for our team. I'm pleased with our progress towards becoming a truly terrific place to work.Looking forward to 2010, we've set two key priorities. First, to build on our success in the wireless mobility business and to ensure that we have all the right elements in place to sustain and capitalize on a competitive advantage and to provide growth in the future. And second, of course, is to improve the trends in business platform that are currently underperforming. I'm going to speak to each of these priorities in a little bit more detail.First, with regard to sustaining growth in our Wireless Mobility business. We're focused on maintaining our position as the destination that offers genuine choice for customers who want friendly expert help in getting this complex decision right the very first time. We see several opportunities with continued growth on this category. First of the inherent strength in competitive advantages that we bring, which we think is fairly well understood. Our convenient locations or easy shopping experience are award-winning customer service. Additionally, there are advantages we bring that we believe are not yet well understood and therefore opportunities to raise awareness and understanding of our value proposition with our customers and potential customers.What I mean by this is the fact is that our mobility assortment has been and will continue to price aggressively and is fully competitive with any alternative retailer or carrier. Also we offered a full confidence [ph](20:24) to raise plans that are offered by carriers. And we offer the best-selling handset from each carrier. Our focus on integration and growth in the wireless mobility area required significant team resources and bandwidth from our own division.With this success, unfortunately, came some loss of focus in some other business platforms. Candidly, we took our eye off the ball [indiscernible](20:51). We've rebalanced our resources today and have plans in place to improve these businesses. But the part of that improvement, as many of you may be aware, our Chief Merchant position became vacant late last year. And we are actively working to fill that important role today.Now to those improvement plans. One area in transition has been our Power platform, which we completely restructured during 2009. Earlier this month, we completed the transition to our new Power category in all our stores. The display is now 12 to 18 feet of wall space fully assorted with new emphasis on our NFL private brand option, available in all Power products, rechargeable and alkaline batteries, innovative power strips, another power-related products. The visually distinctive green and black NFL brand replaces the previous RadioShack brand we used and present a much more coherent merchandising approach. Our brand message on NFL is ""Life and Power."" These products offer great performance at a great value for the customer. We're pleased with the power planogram and optimistic that a comprehensive, consistent value-focused offering will help us to return the growth in this platform. One, of course, that has traditionally been a core strength of our brand.During 2009, we also spent a significant amount of time creating and developing our new private brand assortments. Our product selections strikes a balance between leading national brands with exclusive private brands. Each of our private brand carries a specific brand value proposition and is responding to customer demand. In addition to NFL, we've included AUVIO for audio and video components and accessories, Point Mobl for mobility accessories. And of course, Gigaware, for personal computing hardware or accessories. Parts have begun to roll out to stores and will continue throughout the year. You'll see significant new offerings in the Accessory category along with the technical platform of modern home. We think you'll see a new shopping experience, new brands and new trademarks during 2010 at THE SHACK. So before I hand over to Jim, let me close with a few broad comments on the use of capital. As I mentioned earlier, we have been and will continue to be highly disciplined in how we allocate capital. We're pleased with the capital structure and financial flexibility we have in place today. And we'll continue to watch the economic environment closely to evaluate our liquidity. With that, let me turn the call over to Jim for his comments."

Our results showed seller top-line growth, showed improvements in gross profit dollars and gross profit rate. Our SG&A reflects investments in both people with compensation and training. But also in advertising through our brand repositioning with the new SHACK campaign. The result of all of this was our ability to deliver stern bottom-line growth. We generated a positive cash flow. We continued to bolster our financial strength of our company and through continued improvement of inventory productivity at the end of the year. We're pleased with both the quality and the quantity of inventory.Overall the year, I'd characterize as showing strong results from many improvements, the direct result of all the hard work of our team members, but still many opportunities ahead in 2010. Now I'll cover some of the numbers. Today as Julian mentioned, we reported net income for the fourth quarter of $76 million. That's $0.60 per share, up from $60 million or $0.48 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. For the year, we earned $205 million in net income. That's $1.63 per share and that compares to $189 million or $1.47 per share last year. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.32 billion. That's an increase of $60 million or 5% over the same quarter from last year.For the full year, total revenues were $4.28 billion. That's an increase of $52 million or 1%. These numbers include our comp store sales increases of 6.1% for the quarter and 1.3% for the year. Quickly take a look at the Kiosk business. Revenues there were down $12 million for the quarter and down $34 million for the year. I think many of you are aware but we ended the Sprint-brand kiosk arrangement late last August. And this kiosk reduction was a result of these closures partially offset by the continued improvements that you see in the Sam's Club business. And we showed strong double-digit comp store increases for both the quarter and the year in the Sam's Club kiosks. We've now extended that agreement, and a new agreement will now run through June of 2011.Within the kiosk revenues, we also benefited from what Julian mentioned earlier, which is our Julian mentioned earlier, which is our ongoing kiosk test in approximately 100 Target stores. Through both the new Target agreement as well as the extended Sam's Club agreements, we've also re-established our working relationship with Verizon Wireless, and we believe that having partnerships with now all four of the major post-paid wireless carriers only continues to support our position as being the leading advocate for consumer's wireless and mobility needs.I'm going to briefly discuss some of the details of the sales performance when you look at it from a product perspective, where wireless was clearly the key component of growth. We increased 56% for the fourth quarter and 25% for the year. During the quarter, we saw improvements in our Post-paid business, not only from Sprint AT&T but also from the addition of T-Mobile as an additional national post-paid provider. We began carrying the T-Mobile in all of our stores nationwide in August of 2009. In addition to the strong Post-paid business, our No-contract business also continued with its strong trend increasing more than 70% for the quarter. These increases in the Wireless business were partially offset by declines in the stand-alone GPS products. And this trend in the GPS product that I think was experienced industry-wide where most retailers not only saw a softness in unit demand, but also decreases in ASP.Turn over now to the accessory platform where the declines for both the quarter and the year were primarily due to the sales of the digital converter boxes. In the quarter, sales of for the converter boxes were $13 million. That's down from $54 million a year ago. And for the year, the sales of the converter box was for $170 million, which is down from $205 million in 2008. If you take out those converter box sales, excluding the converter box sales accessory platform, sales were down mid to high single digits for both the quarter and for the year. For the year, the decrease was a result of wireless accessories, media storage and music accessories. However when you take a look at the quarter performance, we're pleased to see an increase in sales of the wireless accessories, which directly points to our improved ability to provide a full solution for our mobility consumers.In modern home, revenues were down 9% in the quarter, but up 2% for the year. Netbooks were the big story here. However, the games we realized in the netbooks in the fourth quarter were offset by declines in the portable DVD players and in our Television business. We were far less promotional in the fourth quarter with our TV business. For the year, netbooks who had the same sales gains again, followed by increases in the VoIP products, but for the year, we saw positive trends in the Television business.Within the Power platform, we experienced declines in revenues for the quarter of 11% and 10% for the year. This performance reflects a couple of things, not only industry trends in some of the Power categories, but also a negative impact during our transition to our new inter-sell [ph](29:15) private brand. Julian mentioned this earlier, we recently completed the transition to our new intersell [ph] private brand and as a result, we're anticipating an improved trend in the Power platform during 2010. Growth in the service platform was solid in the fourth quarter of 13%. We were up 17% for the year. Growth was primarily due to sales of prepaid wireless airtime but also includes the launch of our new ConnecTech service program. While still in a start-up mode, the program offers customers a fast full service solution for help with such products as TVs, computers, home theater systems. Bryan's going to expand on this a little bit later and he'll discuss how the service is integrated within our Store Operations group.Final point in sales when you look at store count, we ended the year with 4,476 company-owned stores in the U.S. That's an increase of 23. Kiosk end of the year at 562 units. That's down 126. I talked earlier about the closures of Sprint and also the new Target stores. And then in Mexico, we ended with 204 locations. On the Dealer side, we ended with 1,318 locations, which was down 90 from last year.Move on now to gross profit. We increased $53 million or 10% in the fourth quarter. Our margin rate was 43.9%. That's up 210 basis points from last year. For the year, the gross profit increased $40 million to $1.96 billion with a margin rate of 45.9%, which is up 40 basis points. Positively impacting the gross profit was an improved product mix combined with fewer markdowns, especially in the fourth quarter where as a result of our more production inventory management, we realized the higher sell through on seasonal products that require fewer clearance markdowns and over-all producing an improved bottom line.I'll take a look at SG&A expense in the fourth quarter was $426 million or 32.3% of revenues. That compared to $402 million or 31.9% of revenues in Q4 of 2008. For the year, SG&A expenses were essentially flat, about $1.51 billion. The SG&A rate was 35.3% in 2009, and that's down 90 basis points when compared to 2008. In the fourth quarter, the SG&A expense primarily relates to the investment in couple of areas: employee compensation and an increase in spending related to the new creative platform of THE SHACK. The higher compensation reflects both our increased focus on store training, as well as an increase in incentive-based compensation. And that's directly related to our strong performance in the wireless platform.These couple of increases were partially offset by the reduction of less productive advertising programs, as both our marketing and finance teams, I think, continue to do an excellent job of optimizing our medium mix and maximizing our returns. When you look at the full year, the factors impacting SG&A expense are similar. However, where you see a similar increase in performance-based incentive comp, for the full you actually see a reduction in advertising expense. Despite the increased brand spend during the fourth quarter that I talked about, through the first half of spending reductions, our advertising expense for the full year was reduced by $22 million. The majority of the spending reduction came in the second quarter of 2009 when reduced advertising, especially the brand spend in preparation for the relaunching of our brand in the third quarter, we obviously don't expect the second quarter reduction in advertising expense to be repeated in 2010.For the full year 2010, we expect advertising expense to be consistent with prior years as a percent of sales in the 4.5% to 5% range. We've discussed this in the past but we've made significant progress in the area of cost control within our company. And we continue to realize significant benefits from what I would call the heavy lifting associated with the reductions, especially the reductions that you've seen over the last few years. We've now established a culture of disciplined SG&A management, one that's far more about day-to-day management than it is about large-scale, major event-driven cost cutting. I think importantly, this achievement allows us to focus on other opportunities within our business. And going forward, I'd characterize our cost opportunity, again, as less about looking for the large cost-cutting opportunities and more about continuing to look for opportunities to improve our business through improved operational productivity.Now I want to conclude with a couple of comments on the balance sheet and working capital. Then I'll turn over to Brian for a few comments on store operations. During 2009 as I mentioned, we continue to build financial strength of our company. And it's clearly evidenced by the balance sheet. I mentioned earlier, our continued improvement in our inventory management. We're pleased with both our level and quality of inventory at year-end. We also ended the year with a cash balance of $908 million. That's an increase of $93 million compared to year-end 2008. A decrease in both the cash and the debt balances, we repurchased $43 million of bonds during the year. All of this combined with our strong performance has allowed us to further improve our net debt to a negative $239 million at year end. Our balance sheet does reflect a shift in our sales mix towards the Wireless business and I thought I'd spend a couple of seconds helping you understand the impact. When you look at the wireless transaction, it's not a typical retail. It's not a typical consumer electronics transaction. And really as a result of this, it has impact on the balance sheet, which is different than what the typical CE transaction would.Specifically, you'll see an increase in inventories and you'll see an increase in accounts receivable at year end. Because of which our first, the inventory unit cost, which for the most of the postpaid devices tends to be a higher dollar value than our typical transaction, especially when that transaction includes the smartphone, which obviously an increasing percentage of our transactions include smartphones. During 2009, we also added T-Mobile to our offerings. And I think, both the T-Mobile addition as well as the inventory unit cost, both of these together not only add to our inventories assortment, but also added to our overall inventory carrying costs. Also as a result of the commission and residual models that are inherent within the Wireless business, more dollars tend to remain on the balance sheet and accounts receivable, which if there were more typical retail transactions, they'd be converted to cash earlier.As a result, our cash balance tends to slightly trail the strong performance you're seeing in the income statement. However, even with the shifts in the balance sheet and the shift in our overall business, we still remain very, very pleased with the quality of balance sheet at year end. Briefly in CapEx, we spent $81 million for the year. Their spending was focused on stores and technology improvements. And for 2010, we anticipate a similar focus, but we're looking for capital spending to increase in the range of $100 million to $120 million. Finally a couple of comments on the use of cash and use of capital. Obviously, over the last year and a half, not unlike all retailers, we've experienced a challenging and uncertain economic conditions to operate in. Through the improved performance of our company, we've been successful in accumulating our strong cash position, which we believe was prudent to maintain during those uncertain economic times.As we now become more and more comfortable with how our business performs, even in very adverse economic circumstances, we're continuing to analyze alternative uses of this cash. And possible uses could be in addition to the internal projects you've seen us deploy cash to acquire full ownership of our Mexico operations. We've also repurchased shares and reduced capital or retire debt. And I would say that any in all of these represent types of investment opportunities we'll continue to consider. We'll continue to evaluate, we'll continue to opportunistically take advantage of them.With that, that concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss Store Ops."

I'm going to focus my comments today on what we've accomplished in Store Operations over the past year. And where we see ourselves headed. The Store Operations team is accountable for the sales and service components of the brand promise, a promise which is embodied in THE SHACK positioning. In 2009, our focus was on maximizing our store productivity by making our stores easier to shop, increasing employee training and by integrating the brand messaging into our store environment. And I have to say that I believe throughout the year, the store teams demonstrated to their capacity to adapt and manage multiple new business opportunities. Not least of which included the addition of T-Mobile, the Apple iPhone and the continuous innovation in technology in the mobile and wireless categories all whilst delivering a high touch, high-service experience for our customers. And as we continue to move our store experience throughout a best-in-class service level, we really work to solidify our disciplines and practices around the store operations and employee training.Now once this disciplines, which we fully institutionalized in 2009, is a program that we refer to as our non-negotiable standards. And that's our promise to our customers and our employees about how our stores will look, how our merchandise will be assorted and how we deliver that customer service. This program really does set the foundation for a consistent store experience. Now additional focus on employee training will also serve as that foundation for store experience. And last March, we added training directors and training managers in each of our field operations areas to help deliver and execute training programs and initiatives to our sales teams. Further training initiatives include new employee orientation programs, further refinement of mobility training, plus new products that we introduced to our stores, and redefined career pathing for our high potential employees.Let me just say further to what Julian's earlier comments about the workplace culture, I'm delighted to be able tell you that we've seen staff turnover trends improve for each of the past 13 months, even while we still continue to upgrade the talent. And that improvement really does enhance our ability to deliver on our sales and service promises. Now Jim already referenced this, but let me talk a little bit about the detail on ConnecTech program, which is another duly example of the steps we've taken to our services to our assortment. And this will further enable our store teams to respond to customer needs. We've partnered with AT&T on a program that helped with in-home installation and technical support service. And our customer can get the systems with as little as 24 hours advance notice on a wide variety of products. With ConnecTech, we offer many solutions at different price points all aimed to making the RadioShack experience more meaningful and complete to our customers.Now our plans for the second half of the year also include the implementation of an updated and improved labor planning system. Now the new system will be faster and easier to use at the store level. It will take into account the different transaction types, whether it's self-select, to assisted self-select, all full-service transactions and it will allocate label according to that transaction mix. To also integrate traffic counter information as well and we do expect this more refined system will improve the customer shopping experience, store productivity, in addition to driving conversion and lowering the work out rate. And further adding to Julian's comments about the new power platform assortment, I mentioned that the new power wall is clearly a very positive move towards making our stores easier to shop. Our batteries are now clear, consistent and comprehensive, making it easier to navigate for both the customer and our sales associates.Let me now spend a minute on our Mexico operation. As Jim mentioned, we ended the year with 204 stores in Mexico. We also plan to add an additional 12 net new stores this year and since our full acquisition of the Mexico business, we put in place many of the operational discipline and practices used across our U.S. store base, and this year we'll move very quickly to drive training and certification programs, improve virtual merchandising and the consistency of the store experience and appearance. We'll also grow the Mobility business in Mexico this year and we would be as excited about the opportunities that this important market has to offer. And finally, a few comments on our network of more than 1,300 dealer locations.The dealer performance in 2009 largely thus reflect the impact of the economy and in some cases, limitations on their access to credit. And this year, we'll put in place a more focused support system for our dealers, both at the central office and in the field. We aim to helping them do business with RadioShack on an easier level. We'll provide you with information on novelty sale [ph] (42:33) that make data-driven decisions to really assisting things like inventory management, ordering, all of that kind of stuff around that business. Not only we do expect to support to our dealers to benefit sales trends in the very near term and to benefit our dealer relationship and business structure over the long term. And just before I hand off to Lee Applbaum, our Chief Marketing Officer, the rebranding efforts led by the marketing team have generated a tremendous amount of enthusiasm and excitement amongst our store associates. To say that everyone is rallied around the brands enhanced visual presence and it's certainly been a powerful conversation starter with our customer. And with that said, I'll now turn the call over to Lee."

After nearly eight year of exhausted brand research and analysis of consumer insights, as well as the selection of a new creative agency of record, we relaunched our brand with a new creative platform, THE SHACK. The rebranding impacted virtually every associate and customer facing touch point from national media including TV, print, digital and web access to all in-store signage, giving our stores an immediate facelift with a brighter color palette, as well as color conventions for each category making the store easier to shop. Each asset was updated with THE SHACK DNA, giving our brand a more contemporary look and feel in calling out were clearly our leadership and mobility and innovative technology as well as enhancing the prominence of leading national brands and their respective equities. Ultimately, I believe our creative approach cuts to the massive advertising clutter with its distinctive Shack aesthetic and our consumer research supports the fact that the simplicity of the messaging, which is conveyed in television to the exclusive use of 15 second spots is easily recognized and understood.Transforming the brand is a journey though and not a discrete event, but we remained very pleased with our early results and insights and we'll continue to build on the Shack platform in 2010 and beyond. As Bryan said, our associates have not only supported the rebranding but have embraced it creating a legion of brand evangelist who are passionate about our vision and who are committed to the customer experience. In a strategic move to accelerate the conversation around our brand transformation, we announced our partnership with seven-time Tour de France winner, Lance Armstrong, the formation of team RadioShack, as well as a critical relationship with Lance Armstrong's Foundation lives strong. Together with Lance, we've made a very focused commitment with LIVESTRONG in the global fight against cancer. With our over 35,000 associates and approximately 31 million unique customers every year. RadioShack gives LIVESTRONG a grassroots platform with which to attack this terrible disease. Over time, we expect our partnership to extend well beyond traditional point of purchase collections, which I should note incidentally, amounted to more than $1.3 million, collected $1 at a time last holiday season to include such statements as exclusive LIVESTRONG branded merchandise and even the creation of a LIVESTRONG resource center in our stores. From a brand standpoint, Lance Armstrong continues to have massive consumer appeal with the popularity rating that tops legendary figures like Bono and Paul McCartney. Lance's intense passion, focus and winning spirit are all inspiring attributes that are associates, consumers and our brand can rally around. We also want to further who embodies the mobile lifestyle with more than 2.4 million Twitter followers, Lance is a pioneer in activation through social media and is passionate about the latest mobile technologies. our approach to our cycling team, all rely on mobile and innovative technology on and off the bike as they compete around the globe. This very real and organic connection our brand will serve as the foundation for advertising concepts including television, centered on Lance and the team that you will see a market beginning in late March. The buzz surrounding THE SHACK relaunch in the partnership with Lance and the team has been tremendous. Generating already nearly 1.3 billion media impressions for RadioShack since July, which is a fourfold increase over the prior year. Moreover, the tow in the buzz has been very encouraging moving from what I described as cautiously skeptical during our lunch to energetic and strongly enthusiastic this past holiday. These sentiments have been shared by our vendor partners who will play a vital role in supporting our advertising initiatives.As I said earlier, brand transformation does not happen overnight, but today we find ourselves in a unique position to have a company with a robust balance sheet and a brand that's moving in a very positive direction, supported by a new creative platform and aligned with an inspiring iconic figure like Lance Armstrong. We will continue to evolve and build our brand for the long-term, balanced with compelling short-term reasons for consumers to interact with our brand day-to-day. This is the same challenge that all retail marketers faced, and one which we take very seriously. Moreover, we'll continue to evaluate and refine our advertising investment. And as Jim said in his comments, we'll continuously work to optimize our media mix and maximize our return on investment. Thanks for your time, and let me turn the call back to Julian."

And I think I mentioned earlier, that the balance sheet showed and there was clearly an impact there with the receivable balance and with inventory balance and maybe a timing impact that you see from what you might anticipate being in a cash balance. Now as it relates to the mix of the business and the impact on gross margin, fortunately, the Wireless business is a very strong gross margin rate and a very strong gross margin dollar business. And so it is NSL [ph] (59:15) where we're shifting to a lower rate business like televisions or like laptops. So where there could be some mix impact there, it might not in all instances be as high as our average. We believe that the strong Wireless business is still going to provide us with a very nice platform to drive gross margin dollar growth. The other point that you made as far as how it might impact the other businesses, I was pleased to say, and that's the reason I put in the comment in my prepared remarks is that in the fourth quarter, we did see a growth in the Wireless Accessory business. We need to improve our ability to attach those products to that end product to the postpaid and to the prepaid products.

As we said in our earnings release today, we're pleased with our fourth quarter and 2009 performance. The results, I think, points to solid progress on the strategies we set for our company, particularly to our capabilities in the area of mobility in all of these products and our skill in providing an unparalleled customer experience. That said, of course, we have work yet to do in some areas of our business.As some of you who followed us for a while may know, our focus began by strengthening the financial position of the company. Secondly, improving the quality of our operations and most recently, and largely because we've achieved the level of financial and operational success. We're focused on revitalizing and contemporizing our brand. I'll spend a few minutes on these three points and then I'll let Jim, Bryan and Lee speak to each of their areas in more detail. Firstly, many of you know that we've made significant progress in improving the financial strength and flexibility of our company. This is being accomplished through a highly disciplined approach, cost control focused on profitable sales and a strong focus on the strength of the balance sheet. In 2009, we were able to increase operating margin by 100 basis points to 8.6%. We further improved our net debt, which stands at cash in excess of debt of over $200 million.Operation, we've invested to make improvements to our store physical plan to raise the quality and expertise of our sales teams. Physically, we've worked to make our stores easier to shop through the store layout, displays, packaging, products and so on. And you'll continue to see improvements as we move through 2010. We believe that our scale with over 6,000 stores and dealer outlets, combined with our store involvement, comfortable store size with carefully thought out product assortment and helpful, collaborative sales experts creates a unique competitive advantage for our company. Brian is going to talk more about store operations in a moment.Lastly, our brand. We've begun to make interim aligning our brand perception with the progress we've made at the business. In our case, the brand conception was lagging the business progress improvement. The launch of our new brand-creative platform, THE SHACK, in the third quarter has captured the attention of consumers, signaled that a change has occurred and ultimately is beginning to change the way consumers see it, particularly in the area of mobile technology. We've carefully balanced brand building with product and service offerings in the advertising mix and had some exciting plans for this year, which Lee will speak to in a moment.So a few words on mobility. Several key events in the fourth quarter helped us to reinforce our leadership in the areas of mobility and innovative technology. First, with the addition of T-Mobile as the third national wireless carrier to our stores. Now, with a combination of AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile, we have a strong diverse selection of carrier offering. Importantly, since adding T-Mobile, we have been able to realize growth from all three of our carriers. Additionally, gaining national distribution for Apple's iPhones further solidified our strong position in mobility. The iPhone rollout is nearly complete. We're currently implementing several hundred stores per week, with a plan to have the product available in about 3,000 stores by the end of March. We've been methodical in our rollouts, so that we could focus on training our team to make sure that our customers receive the high-quality service experience that they come to expect from THE SHACK.  The iPhone product launch is a great example to the traction we're seeing with our mobility strategy, an acknowledgment that our financial and operational strength as well as our brand evolution is being recognized by key vendor partners. Finally in October, we launched a pilot mobility kiosk program with Target Corp. The pilot covers about 100 stores, and we're pleased to say that we believe the project is going well. Target is clearly one of the most important and respected retailers in America. And we're hopeful we can continue to work together with them in the future.These successes have, of course, been achieved through tremendous teamwork, dedication and hard work on the part of RadioShack employees. I'm immensely proud of them and thankful for their dedication. Our business success and strength has also improved our workplace culture, creating new challenges and new opportunities for our team. I'm pleased with our progress towards becoming a truly terrific place to work.Looking forward to 2010, we've set two key priorities. First, to build on our success in the wireless mobility business and to ensure that we have all the right elements in place to sustain and capitalize on a competitive advantage and to provide growth in the future. And second, of course, is to improve the trends in business platform that are currently underperforming. I'm going to speak to each of these priorities in a little bit more detail.First, with regard to sustaining growth in our Wireless Mobility business. We're focused on maintaining our position as the destination that offers genuine choice for customers who want friendly expert help in getting this complex decision right the very first time. We see several opportunities with continued growth on this category. First of the inherent strength in competitive advantages that we bring, which we think is fairly well understood. Our convenient locations or easy shopping experience are award-winning customer service. Additionally, there are advantages we bring that we believe are not yet well understood and therefore opportunities to raise awareness and understanding of our value proposition with our customers and potential customers.What I mean by this is the fact is that our mobility assortment has been and will continue to price aggressively and is fully competitive with any alternative retailer or carrier. Also we've got a full confidence to raise plans that are offered by carriers. And we offer the best-selling handset from each carrier. Our focus on integration and growth in the wireless mobility area required significant team resources and bandwidth from our own division.With this success, unfortunately, came some loss of focus in some other business platforms. Candidly, we took our eye off the ball. We've rebalanced our resources today and have plans in place to improve these businesses. But the part of that improvement, as many of you may be aware, our Chief Merchant position became vacant late last year. And we are actively working to fill that important role today.Now to those improvement plans. One area in transition has been our Power platform, which we completely restructured during 2009. Earlier this month, we completed the transition to our new Power category in all our stores. The display is now 12 to 18 feet of wall space fully assorted with new emphasis on our NFL private brand option, available in all Power products, rechargeable and alkaline batteries, innovative power strips, another power-related products. The visually distinctive green and black NFL brand replaces the previous RadioShack brand we used and present a much more coherent merchandising approach. Our brand message on NFL is ""Life and Power."" These products offer great performance at a great value for the customer. We're pleased with the power planogram and optimistic that a comprehensive, consistent value-focused offering will help us to return the growth in this platform. One, of course, that has traditionally been a core strength of our brand.During 2009, we also spent a significant amount of time creating and developing our new private brand assortments. Our product selections strikes a balance between leading national brands with exclusive private brands. Each of our private brand carries a specific brand value proposition and is responding to customer demand. In addition to NFL, we've included AUVIO for audio and video components and accessories, Point Mobl for mobility accessories. And of course, Gigaware, for personal computing hardware or accessories. Parts have begun to roll out to stores and will continue throughout the year. You'll see significant new offerings in the Accessory category along with the technical platform of modern home. We think you'll see a new shopping experience, new brands and new trademarks during 2010 at THE SHACK. So before I hand over to Jim, let me close with a few broad comments on the use of capital. As I mentioned earlier, we have been and will continue to be highly disciplined in how we allocate capital. We're pleased with the capital structure and financial flexibility we have in place today. And we'll continue to watch the economic environment closely to evaluate our liquidity. With that, let me turn the call over to Jim for his comments."

Our results showed seller top-line growth, showed improvements in gross profit dollars and gross profit rate. Our SG&A reflects investments in both people with compensation and training. But also in advertising through our brand repositioning with the new SHACK campaign. The result of all of this was our ability to deliver strong bottom-line growth. We generated a positive cash flow. We continued to bolster our financial strength of our company and through continued improvement of inventory productivity at the end of the year. We're pleased with both the quality and the quantity of inventory.Overall the year, I'd characterize as showing strong results from many improvements, the direct result of all the hard work of our team members, but still many opportunities ahead in 2010. Now I'll cover some of the numbers. Today as Julian mentioned, we reported net income for the fourth quarter of $76 million. That's $0.60 per share, up from $60 million or $0.48 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. For the year, we earned $205 million in net income. That's $1.63 per share and that compares to $189 million or $1.47 per share last year. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.32 billion. That's an increase of $60 million or 5% over the same quarter from last year.For the full year, total revenues were $4.28 billion. That's an increase of $52 million or 1%. These numbers include our comp store sales increases of 6.1% for the quarter and 1.3% for the year. Quickly take a look at the Kiosk business. Revenues there were down $12 million for the quarter and down $34 million for the year. I think many of you are aware but we ended the Sprint-brand kiosk arrangement late last August. And this kiosk reduction was a result of these closures, partially offset by the continued improvements that you see in the Sam's Club business. And we showed strong double-digit comp store increases for both the quarter and the year in the Sam's Club kiosks. We've now extended that agreement, and a new agreement will now run through June of 2011.Within the kiosk revenues, we also benefited from what Julian mentioned earlier, which is our ongoing kiosk test in approximately 100 Target stores. Through both the new Target agreement, as well as the extended Sam's Club agreements, we've also re-established our working relationship with Verizon Wireless, and we believe that having partnerships with now all four of the major post-paid wireless carriers only continues to support our position as being the leading advocate for consumer's wireless and mobility needs.I'm going to briefly discuss some of the details of the sales performance when you look at it from a product perspective, where wireless was clearly the key component of growth. We increased 56% for the fourth quarter and 25% for the year. During the quarter, we saw improvements in our Post-paid business, not only from Sprint AT&T but also from the addition of T-Mobile as an additional national post-paid provider. We began carrying the T-Mobile in all of our stores nationwide in August of 2009. In addition to the strong Post-paid business, our No-contract business also continued with its strong trends, increasing more than 70% for the quarter. These increases in the Wireless business were partially offset by declines in the stand-alone GPS products. And this trend in the GPS product that I think was experienced industry-wide where most retailers not only saw a softness in unit demand, but also decreases in ASP.Turn over now to the accessory platform where the declines for both the quarter and the year were primarily due to the sales of the digital converter boxes. In the quarter, sales of the converter boxes were $13 million. That's down from $54 million a year ago. And for the year, the sales of the converter box was for $170 million, which is down from $205 million in 2008. If you take out those converter box sales, excluding the converter box sales accessory platform, sales were down mid to high single digits for both the quarter and for the year. For the year, the decrease was a result of wireless accessories, media storage and music accessories. However when you take a look at the quarter performance, we're pleased to see an increase in the sales of the wireless accessories, which directly points to our improved ability to provide a full solution for our mobility consumers.In modern home, revenues were down 9% in the quarter, but up 2% for the year. Netbooks were the big story here. However, the games we realized in the netbooks in the fourth quarter were offset by declines in the portable DVD players and in our Television business. We were far less promotional in the fourth quarter with our TV business. For the year, netbooks who had the same sales gains again, followed by increases in the VoIP products, but for the year, we saw positive trends in the Television business.Within the Power platform, we experienced declines in revenues for the quarter of 11% and 10% for the year. This performance reflects a couple of things, not only industry trends in some of the Power categories, but also a negative impact during our transition to our new intersell [ph](29:15) private brand. Julian mentioned this earlier, we recently completed the transition to our new intersell [ph] private brand and as a result, we're anticipating an improved trend in the Power platform during 2010. Growth in the service platform was solid in the fourth quarte,r, up 13%. We were up 17% for the year. Growth was primarily due to sales of prepaid wireless airtime but also includes the launch of our new ConnecTech service program. While still in a start-up mode, the program offers customers a fast full service solution for help with such products as TVs, computers, home theater systems. Bryan's going to expand on this a little bit later and he'll discuss how the service is integrated within our Store Operations group.Final point in sales when you look at store count, we ended the year with 4,476 company-owned stores in the U.S. That's an increase of 23. Kiosk ended the year at 562 units. That's down 126. I talked earlier about the closures of Sprint and also the new Target stores. And then in Mexico, we ended with 204 locations. On the Dealer side, we ended with 1,318 locations, which was down 90 from last year.Move on now to gross profit. We increased $53 million or 10% in the fourth quarter. Our margin rate was 43.9%. That's up 210 basis points from last year. For the year, the gross profit increased $40 million to $1.96 billion with a margin rate of 45.9%, which is up 40 basis points. Positively impacting the gross profit was an improved product mix combined with fewer markdowns, especially in the fourth quarter where as a result of our more production inventory management, we realized the higher sell through on seasonal products that required fewer clearance markdowns and over-all producing an improved bottom line.I'll take a look at SG&A expense in the fourth quarter was $426 million or 32.3% of revenues. That compared to $402 million or 31.9% of revenues in Q4 of 2008. For the year, SG&A expenses, they were essentially flat, about $1.51 billion. The SG&A rate was 35.3% in 2009, and that's down 90 basis points when compared to 2008. In the fourth quarter, the growth in SG&A expense primarily relates to the investment in a couple of areas: employee compensation and an increase in spending related to the new creative platform of THE SHACK. The higher compensation reflects both our increased focus on store training, as well as an increase in incentive-based compensation. And that's directly related to our strong performance in the wireless platform.These couple of increases were partially offset by the reduction of less productive advertising programs, as both our marketing and finance teams, I think, continue to do an excellent job of optimizing our medium mix and maximizing our returns. When you look at the full year, the factors impacting SG&A expense are similar. However, where you see a similar increase in performance-based incentive comp, for the full you actually see a reduction in advertising expense. Despite the increased brand spend during the fourth quarter that I talked about, through the first half of spending reductions, our advertising expense for the full year was reduced by $22 million. The majority of the spending reduction came in the second quarter of 2009 when reduced advertising, especially the brand spend in preparation for the relaunching of our brand in the third quarter, we obviously don't expect the second quarter reduction in advertising expense to be repeated in 2010.For the full year 2010, we expect advertising expense to be consistent with prior years as a percent of sales in the 4.5% to 5% range. We've discussed this in the past but we've made significant progress in the area of cost control within our company. And we continue to realize significant benefits from what I would call the heavy lifting associated with the reductions, especially the reductions that you've seen over the last few years. We've now established a culture of disciplined SG&A management, one that's far more about day-to-day management than it is about large-scale, major event-driven cost cutting. I think importantly, this achievement allows us to focus on other opportunities within our business. And going forward, I'd characterize our cost opportunity, again, as less about looking for the large cost-cutting opportunities and more about continuing to look for opportunities to improve our business through improved operational productivity.Now I want to conclude with a couple of comments on the balance sheet and working capital. Then I'll turn over to Brian for a few comments on store operations. During 2009 as I mentioned, we continue to build financial strength of our company. And it's clearly evidenced by the balance sheet. I mentioned earlier, our continued improvement in our inventory management. We're pleased with both our level and quality of inventory at year-end. We also ended the year with a cash balance of $908 million. That's an increase of $93 million compared to year-end 2008. A decrease in both the cash and the debt balances, we repurchased $43 million of bonds during the year. All of this combined with our strong performance has allowed us to further improve our net debt to a negative $239 million at year end. Our balance sheet does reflect a shift in our sales mix towards the Wireless business and I thought I'd spend a couple of seconds helping you understand the impact. When you look at the wireless transaction, it's not a typical retail. It's not a typical consumer electronics transaction. And really as a result of this, it has impact on the balance sheet, which is different than what the typical CE transaction would.Specifically, you'll see an increase in inventories and you'll see an increase in accounts receivable at year end. Because of which our first, the inventory unit cost, which for the most of the postpaid devices tends to be a higher dollar value than our typical transaction, especially when that transaction includes the smartphone, which obviously an increasing percentage of our transactions include smartphones. During 2009, we also added T-Mobile to our offerings. And I think, both the T-Mobile addition as well as the inventory unit cost, both of these together not only add to our inventories assortment, but also added to our overall inventory carrying costs. Also as a result of the commission and residual models that are inherent within the Wireless business, more dollars tend to remain on the balance sheet and accounts receivable, which if there were more typical retail transactions, they'd be converted to cash earlier.As a result, our cash balance tends to slightly trail the strong performance you're seeing in the income statement. However, even with the shifts in the balance sheet and the shift in our overall business, we still remain very, very pleased with the quality of balance sheet at year end. Briefly in CapEx, we spent $81 million for the year. Their spending was focused on stores and technology improvements. And for 2010, we anticipate a similar focus, but we're looking for capital spending to increase in the range of $100 million to $120 million. Finally a couple of comments on the use of cash and use of capital. Obviously, over the last year and a half, not unlike all retailers, we've experienced a challenging and uncertain economic conditions to operate in. Through the improved performance of our company, we've been successful in accumulating our strong cash position, which we believe was prudent to maintain during those uncertain economic times.As we now become more and more comfortable with how our business performs, even in very adverse economic circumstances, we're continuing to analyze alternative uses of this cash. And possible uses could be in addition to the internal projects you've seen us deploy cash to acquire full ownership of our Mexico operations. We've also repurchased shares and reduced capital or retire debt. And I would say that any in all of these represent types of investment opportunities we'll continue to consider. We'll continue to evaluate, we'll continue to opportunistically take advantage of them.With that, that concludes my prepared remarks and I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss Store Ops."

I'm going to focus my comments today on what we've accomplished in Store Operations over the past year. And where we see ourselves headed. The Store Operations team is accountable for the sales and service components of the brand promise, a promise which is embodied in THE SHACK positioning. In 2009, our focus was on maximizing our store productivity by making our stores easier to shop, increasing employee training and by integrating the brand messaging into our store environment. And I have to say that I believe throughout the year, the store teams demonstrated to their capacity to adapt and manage multiple new business opportunities. Not least of which included the addition of T-Mobile, the Apple iPhone and the continuous innovation in technology in the mobile and wireless categories all whilst delivering a high touch, high-service experience for our customers. And as we continue to move our store experience throughout a best-in-class service level, we really work to solidify our disciplines and practices around the store operations and employee training.Now once this disciplines, which we fully institutionalized in 2009, is a program that we refer to as our non-negotiable standards. And that's our promise to our customers and our employees about how our stores will look, how our merchandise will be assorted and how we deliver that customer service. This program really does set the foundation for a consistent store experience. Now additional focus on employee training will also serve as that foundation for store experience. And last March, we added training directors and training managers in each of our field operations areas to help deliver and execute training programs and initiatives to our sales teams. Further training initiatives include new employee orientation programs, further refinement of mobility training, plus new products that we introduced to our stores, and redefined career pathing for our high potential employees.Let me just say further to what Julian's earlier comments about the workplace culture, I'm delighted to be able tell you that we've seen staff turnover trends improve for each of the past 13 months, even while we still continue to upgrade the talent. And that improvement really does enhance our ability to deliver on our sales and service promises. Now Jim already referenced this, but let me talk a little bit about the detail on ConnecTech program, which is another duly example of the steps we've taken to our services to our assortment. And this will further enable our store teams to respond to customer needs. We've partnered with AT&T on a program that helped with in-home installation and technical support service. And our customer can get the systems with as little as 24 hours advance notice on a wide variety of products. With ConnecTech, we offer many solutions at different price points all aimed to making the RadioShack experience more meaningful and complete to our customers.Now our plans for the second half of the year also include the implementation of an updated and improved labor planning system. Now the new system will be faster and easier to use at the store level. It will take into account the different transaction types, whether it's self-select, to assisted self-select, all full-service transactions and it will allocate label according to that transaction mix. To also integrate traffic counter information as well and we do expect this more refined system will improve the customer shopping experience, store productivity, in addition to driving conversion and lowering the work out rate. And further adding to Julian's comments about the new power platform assortment, I mentioned that the new power wall is clearly a very positive move towards making our stores easier to shop. Our batteries are now clear, consistent and comprehensive, making it easier to navigate for both the customer and our sales associates.Let me now spend a minute on our Mexico operation. As Jim mentioned, we ended the year with 204 stores in Mexico. We also plan to add an additional 12 net new stores this year and since our full acquisition of the Mexico business, we put in place many of the operational discipline and practices used across our U.S. store base, and this year we'll move very quickly to drive training and certification programs, improve virtual merchandising and the consistency of the store experience and appearance. We'll also grow the Mobility business in Mexico this year and we would be as excited about the opportunities that this important market has to offer. And finally, a few comments on our network of more than 1,300 dealer locations.The dealer performance in 2009 largely thus reflect the impact of the economy and in some cases, limitations on their access to credit. And this year, we'll put in place a more focused support system for our dealers, both at the central office and in the field. We aim to helping them do business with RadioShack on an easier level. We'll provide you with information on all of these sales that make data-driven decisions to really assisting things like inventory management, ordering, all of that kind of stuff around that business. Not only we do expect to support to our dealers to benefit sales trends in the very near term and to benefit our dealer relationship and business structure over the long term. And just before I hand off to Lee Applbaum, our Chief Marketing Officer, the rebranding efforts led by the marketing team have generated a tremendous amount of enthusiasm and excitement amongst our store associates. To say that everyone is rallied around the brands enhanced visual presence and it's certainly been a powerful conversation starter with our customer. And with that said, I'll now turn the call over to Lee."

After nearly eight year of exhausted brand research and analysis of consumer insights, as well as the selection of a new creative agency of record, we relaunched our brand with a new creative platform, THE SHACK. The rebranding impacted virtually every associate and customer facing touch point from national media including TV, print, digital and web access to all in-store signage, giving our stores an immediate facelift with a brighter color palette, as well as color conventions for each category making the store easier to shop. Each asset was updated with THE SHACK DNA, giving our brand a more contemporary look and feel in calling out were clearly our leadership and mobility and innovative technology as well as enhancing the prominence of leading national brands and their respective equities. Ultimately, I believe our creative approach cuts to the massive advertising clutter with its distinctive Shack aesthetic and our consumer research supports the fact that the simplicity of the messaging, which is conveyed in television to the exclusive use of 15 second spots is easily recognized and understood.Transforming the brand is a journey though and not a discrete event, but we remained very pleased with our early results and insights and we'll continue to build on the Shack platform in 2010 and beyond. As Bryan said, our associates have not only supported the rebranding but have embraced it creating a legion of brand evangelist who are passionate about our vision and who are committed to the customer experience. In a strategic move to accelerate the conversation around our brand transformation, we announced our partnership with seven-time Tour de France winner, Lance Armstrong, the formation of team RadioShack, as well as a critical relationship with Lance Armstrong's Foundation lives strong. Together with Lance, we've made a very focused commitment with LIVESTRONG in the global fight against cancer. With our over 35,000 associates and approximately 31 million unique customers every year. RadioShack gives LIVESTRONG a grassroots platform with which to attack this terrible disease. Over time, we expect our partnership to extend well beyond traditional point of purchase collections, which I should note incidentally, amounted to more than $1.3 million, collected $1 at a time last holiday season to include such statements as exclusive LIVESTRONG branded merchandise and even the creation of a LIVESTRONG resource center in our stores. From a brand standpoint, Lance Armstrong continues to have massive consumer appeal with the popularity rating that tops legendary figures like Bono and Paul McCartney. Lance's intense passion, focus and winning spirit are all inspiring attributes that are associates, consumers and our brand can rally around. We also want to further who embodies the mobile lifestyle with more than 2.4 million Twitter followers, Lance is a pioneer in activation through social media and is passionate about the latest mobile technologies. our approach to our cycling team, all rely on mobile and innovative technology on and off the bike as they compete around the globe. This very real and organic connection our brand will serve as the foundation for advertising concepts including television, centered on Lance and the team that you will see a market beginning in late March. The buzz surrounding THE SHACK relaunch in the partnership with Lance and the team has been tremendous. Generating already nearly 1.3 billion media impressions for RadioShack since July, which is a fourfold increase over the prior year. Moreover, the tow in the buzz has been very encouraging moving from what I described as cautiously skeptical during our lunch to energetic and strongly enthusiastic this past holiday. These sentiments have been shared by our vendor partners who will play a vital role in supporting our advertising initiatives.As I said earlier, brand transformation does not happen overnight, but today we find ourselves in a unique position to have a company with a robust balance sheet and a brand that's moving in a very positive direction, supported by a new creative platform and aligned with an inspiring iconic figure like Lance Armstrong. We will continue to evolve and build our brand for the long-term, balanced with compelling short-term reasons for consumers to interact with our brand day-to-day. This is the same challenge that all retail marketers faced, and one which we take very seriously. Moreover, we'll continue to evaluate and refine our advertising investment. And as Jim said in his comments, we'll continuously work to optimize our media mix and maximize our return on investment. Thanks for your time, and let me turn the call back to Julian."

And I think I mentioned earlier, that the balance sheet showed and there was clearly an impact there with the receivable balance and with inventory balance and maybe a timing impact that you see from what you might anticipate being in a cash balance. Now as it relates to the mix of the business and the impact on gross margin, fortunately, the Wireless business is a very strong gross margin rate and a very strong gross margin dollar business. And so it is NSL [ph] (59:15) where we're shifting to a lower rate business like televisions or like laptops. So where there could be some mix impact there, it might not in all instances be as high as our average. We believe that the strong Wireless business is still going to provide us with a very nice platform to drive gross margin dollar growth. The other point that you made as far as how it might impact the other businesses, I was pleased to say, and that's the reason I put in the comment in my prepared remarks is that in the fourth quarter, we did see a growth in the Wireless Accessory business. We need to improve our ability to attach those products to that end product to the postpaid and to the prepaid products.

Can you speak to whether -- as I recall the announcement was pretty small in early November and I wanted to clarify whether that helped wireless sales for the quarter. And then I think second related to that, as we get further into 2010 here, Apple I think normally comes out with a newer version in the summer, call it June or July, August and now that you're indirect seller here, can we kind of have comfort that you'll be viewed head-to-head with other indirect sellers if and when they elect to announce further versions? Will you be in a better spot say next to a best buyer, other competitors to get your allocation of the new 1% in the market?"

The first is that in terms of total wireless sales for the last quarter, I would say that the you are correct that we had rolled out only a few stores during the quarter. We just wanted to make sure we have absolutely everything right. It turned out we did, and we're now, as we said earlier, going full ball rolling that device out to our stores. But I confirmed that in the last quarter, iPhone volumes did not have a significant effect on our overall outcome from mobility. Secondly, to move to your second question on the putative iPhone update device or whatever, I don't have any knowledge, obviously, of such an update on a device made. I wish that I could, but in all honestly really I can't provide you with any particular color on who might or might not end up selling that device, obviously. Having gotten iPhone in our lineup, we think we're doing a good job and we would want to represent any hypothetical new device for that point, naturally, all I can say."

First, you noted that all three carriers contributed to growth during the quarter, but it sounds as if AT&T lagged Sprint and T-Mobile and that's a reversal from the impact from a year ago, so I want to see if you can give us some background on that? And then second, given the consequences of the rapid Wireless growth of the balance sheet, are you considering changing the economic model moving away from a residual model maybe to a larger net present value of the residuals upfront?"

There's certainly nothing in place that would have us walking completely away from the residual model as I mentioned it with the impact of the balance sheet that's very inherent in the Wireless business. And certainly at least in the near-term, if not in the long-term, I see us continuing to operate within some form of a residual model. Certainly, we talked to the carriers all time with how we're bringing new devices and new plans to market, but right now, I wouldn't call in the short-term for any significant changes from the model that you've seen historically."
