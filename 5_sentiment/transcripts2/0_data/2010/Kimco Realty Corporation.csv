A week ago Saturday, I read a Wall Street Journal article that contained a forecast that the U.S. population would grow by an additional 100 million people by 2050. Let's think about that. The 100 million population increase is more than three times the population of Canada and more than three times the population of Australia this has to mean an increase in retail demand over the long term, and it also helps that there is very little new supply as development has stopped. It made me reflect on our company and our future. Our shopping centers have a higher proportion of land to total value than other asset classes. Thank goodness for required parking ratios. Our tenant rent streams permit us to land bank at the same time provide a current cash flow, while awaiting the growth of value. Fortunately for us, our tenants are primarily discounters, warehouse clubs, supermarkets, drugstores and off-price retailers that sell non-discretionary essential items or cater to the growing consensus of service [ph] (54:18) that are trading down. We are in an interesting cycle in retailing. Conspicuous consumption is out, value and price are in.

Off-price retailers, T.J. Maxx and Ross, sales are up double digits. And if you look at the list of our top tenants, you will see the reason for some comfort level on our part. Now Kimco has developed shopping centers for over 50 years, but what is most gratifying is the team of leadership that we have developed. My three partners, Dave, Mike and David, work together effectively to enhance our value. So without further ado, let us hear from them.

And I'm also very pleased about continuing our nine-year partnership. It is an honor to work with you, the Board of Directors and other members of our senior management team. It is truly wonderful to be part of carrying on a 50-year tradition of retail real estate excellence. Given the challenges for all of us in the Real Estate business over the past year and the numerous questions from a host of analysts, shareholders and institutional partners, I would like to take a minute to clarify our business strategy and address some of the concerns expressed over the past several months. We believe our business strategy is now simple and very clear. We are going to stay true to our retail roots and our core retail operating expertise. We are second to none in relationships with retailers, retail leasing experience, property management and retail redevelopment skills. We have the largest and most diversified portfolio of community and neighborhood shopping centers, with more than 13,000 individual leases. This size and scale gives us many advantages and provides our company with a reliable and steady cash flow to support dividends and capital investments. Overall and in summary, we are committed to equity ownership of quality retail real estate, which will provide long-term recurring income. In addition to our focus and emphasis on increasing the cash flow of our retail property portfolio, there are three other elements of our business strategy, which we feel differentiate us and enhance our future growth in shareholder value. First, we remain dedicated to building an institutional management business by forming programmatic joint ventures and co-mingled funds with first-class domestic and foreign institutional partners. Joint venturing with strong institutions help us be competitive in acquiring high-quality retail properties, and the recurring fee income improves our returns on invested capital. Second, we continue to believe in the long-term benefits of our international investments in both Canada and Mexico. In addition to diversification and synergies with many of our strongest U.S. retailers, both Mexico and Canada are significantly under retailed when compared to the U.S. Our largest tenants, such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot have recognized the advantages inherent in both of these markets and continue to expand aggressively. Last week, Target joined others in announcing that Mexico and Canada will be part of their long-term expansion plans. As a third element of our retail strategy, we will definitely remain opportunistic in purchasing real estate owned by retailers. Kimco has a long tradition of profitable and opportunistic acquisitions of both vacant and occupied real estate portfolios owned by retailers. Examples include Albertsons, Montgomery Ward, Venture Stores, Hechinger stores, Frank's Nursery, Clover stores and Gold Circle. Kimco has the relationships, underwriting expertise and leasing skills to make these investments an important part of creating shareholder value. Thus, as a summary, our strategy is simple, recurring income from quality retail real estate, enhanced by institutional management, international real estate investments and opportunistic retail real estate acquisitions from retailers. On the other side of presenting in simple terms our strategic vision, I'd like to spend some time addressing four concerns mentioned in many of our analyst and investor reviews. First, there remains a question of our explicit or implicit guarantees of debt in our retail joint ventures with institutions. At the beginning of 2009, Kimco had guaranteed debt on behalf of retail institutional joint ventures totaling approximately $685 million, primarily in our Prudential joint ventures. Today, through property sales and equity investments by the joint venture partners, this amount has been reduced to $331 million. By September 2010 this year, we are very confident that the guaranteed loan balances for the retail joint ventures will be completely repaid. With respect to implicit guarantees, all other retail institutional joint venture debt is in the form of non-recourse, property-specific mortgages, and there are absolutely no partnership obligations of any kind to repay non-recourse mortgage debt. Second, the amount and timing of deleveraging our balance sheet has been a popular topic. Mike Pappagallo has repeatedly defined our leverage objectives in terms of a net debt to EBITDA ratio. And as a management team, we are committed to reducing the net debt to EBITDA ratio to 6x by the end of 2012 and to 5x by the end of 2014. These are firm goals and should clarify the timing for everyone. Third, the disposition of our non-retail portfolio real estate investments of approximately $875 million has also been much discussed. It is important to understand that non-retail does not mean not earning or not good. Our non-retail investments vary wildly, generally produce FFO and will be sold on a disciplined but accelerated basis over the next two to four years. Since the beginning of 2009, the non-retail portfolio has been reduced by $150 million to date, and we anticipate a minimum of $200 million of additional disposition from 2010. The fourth concern frequently mentioned is the price  paid for the PL Retail portfolio and the apparent lack of institutional partners participating in the purchase. As we said last quarter, the transaction came about very quickly. And we strongly believe that the price paid was attractive in relation to the high-quality properties involved. We are actively working with several institutions with respect to various properties in the portfolio. And we hope to be able to finalize one or more new joint ventures in the first quarter. As we place the PL Retail properties in new, lower leveraged, long-term institutional joint ventures, we hope investors will have less concerns. And we remain very pleased to have acquired the portfolio, when we did and with the price we paid. Now I'd like to turn it over to my esteemed partner and CFO, Mike Pappagallo."

Comparing the results against last year's fourth quarter and excludin",1113,"Thank you, Dave, and good morning all. As reported last evening, we closed out the year with a fourth quarter FFO per share of $0.31. This was $0.02 higher than the consensus estimates. Comparing the results against last year's fourth quarter and excluding impairment charges in both periods, FFO per share declined by $0.15 from $0.46 in the prior year. Substantially all of the decrease reflects the dilution caused by the re-equitization of the balance sheet earlier in 2009. On a full year basis, FFO per share was $0.82 including impairments and $1.33 excluding impairments. The latter number compares to $2.49 per share in 2008. The overall reduction can be attributed to lower transaction activity of $0.53, the dilution from the equity offering of $0.48 and lower income from our structured investments and non-shopping center assets of $0.13. The decline in contribution from our Shopping Center business was modest at only $0.02. I offer that blizzard of numbers to underscore that the foundation of the business strategy that Dave just articulated, our North American shopping center portfolio, had demonstrated its resiliency and stability during a very tough year. The move away from reliance on transactions for merchant building, preferred equity kickers and securities, the shutdown of our Non-Shopping Center businesses, the mark-to-market on the assets acquired at the top of the cycle, as well as the large recapitalization of the company last spring has certainly been painful in terms of short-term financial results. But as we move into 2010, focusing our efforts on the four elements of the strategy Dave talked about and dissipating the four clouds that concern investors, I believe the consequence will be much more visibility and clarity of our financial results and operating drivers, which in turn will reveal the strength and stability of our shopping center assets. To that point, the portfolio vital signs of those shopping centers were solid this past quarter, following through on the positive turns started in the third quarter. Overall occupancy increased by 40 basis points from September to 92.8%. This increase was driven by lease up in certain of the former Linen and Circuit City boxes. Same-store net operating income declined 1.1%, within our expectations and previous guidance offered to investors, and while spreads on 467,000 square feet on new leases held by 6.9%, recognizing about 229,000 square feet related to the re-leasing of 10 of those Linens and Circuit boxes at a negative spread of about 25%, a level of decline which we expected.  Excluding those leases, the balance of the new signings showed a 2.1% increase. And as our earnings release indicated, the tremendous increase in the GLA of new leases signed over the last year in face of the very tough environment says a lot about our leasing organization and our asset quality. One other point about the reported leasing spreads. Our population of leases reflect new leases signed on spaces vacated over the past 12 months. We limit the comparable time period to a year in order to capture what the effect of rollover will be for the upcoming year for a specified amount of square footage. If a space has been vacant for over a year, the new lease income is pure upside in the projected estimate of NOI. Others might compute leasing spreads on a different basis, and there is no single right answer. But the spreads quoted on leases for shorter-cycle businesses, such as apartments or self storage may mean something different than spreads recorded on long-term leases rolling in the Shopping Center business. So we just report those rollovers over the past year to help focus on the immediate forward financial statement impact. All that said, we will continue to provide you with information with regard to the re-leasing activity on the junior box vacancies from Linen, Circuit and a few others, regardless of the time period as we suspect that's the information you'd like to gain insight on. Our fourth quarter results did include additional impairment charges amounting to $34 million. However, this charge was almost completely offset by associated tax benefits recognized against those impairments and against the impairment charges taken earlier in the year, in which tax benefits were not recognized at that time. Primary reason why we are now able to accrue the tax benefits is twofold: First, the recent change in carryback rules that extended the carryback period by an additional two years; and in addition, the establishment of certain tax planning strategies for our taxable REIT subsidiary going forward, which will generate additional income and will allow us to utilize these tax benefits in light of changes in our strategy including holding our development assets longer term and reducing leverage.With respect to the balance sheet, Dave mentioned our long-term targets to resize the debt levels relative to our EBITDA and along with that, a gradual improvement in fixed charge coverage. We have also mentioned that it will not be a straight line at each three-month measurement period. We cut the overall net debt to EBITDA levels from 8.1x to 6.8x over the past 12 months. The uptick from the prior quarter reflects the remaining debt assumed from the PL Retail acquisition after we cleaned up the January 2010 maturities prior to this year end. And we continue to be comforted by the very manageable and well-staggered debt maturities on the corporate balance sheet and the joint ventures. We all recognize we will have to wait until August or September for the cloud of the guaranteed debt on Prudential-Kimco joint venture to lift, but we're very confident that it will.Finally, we've provided initial FFO per share guidance for 2010 in the range of $1.07 to $1.15. Underscoring these estimates is a cautious view of the retail environment. We expect occupancy to move up somewhat, as we move through 2010, up to 50 basis points. As in the past, we will most likely see some fallout in the early part of the year but build back as we move through 2010. Same-store NOI is targeted to be flat to a slight rollback of minus 2%, driven by what we expect to see in further short-term pressure in leasing spreads. Also, our estimates include limited gains from transaction activity or on the flipside, any impairment charges. One research analyst suggests that, that company either take the position of being cautious or optimistic but not both. We prefer to start cautious. That's the right mindset to have, along with the disciplined focus on the key elements of the strategy that Dave articulated. I'd now like to turn it over to David Lukes to give you his report on the shopping center portfolio."

The short story on operations for the four",1098,"Good morning. With the close of 2009, I'd like to give you some thoughts on a tumultuous year, results for the fourth quarter and what we're doing in 2010 to focus to our operating staff and execute our strategy. The short story on operations for the fourth quarter is encouraging. New leasing is up, vacates are down, operating expenses are down, renewals are strong and the risk of co-tenancy violations has been considerably mitigated. As Mike mentioned, our total occupancy rose to 92.8%. When we look at the U.S. portfolio, we executed 204 leases, representing 1.1 million square feet. The vacating tenants decreased substantially from the prior quarter to 780,000 square feet, therefore achieving a meaningful positive absorption of 50 basis points in the U.S. and settling our occupancy at 92.4%. Although vacates continues to be a heavy weight on our shoulders, strong new leasing has continued now for two quarters. And I'd like to comment on how we're achieving these results and what we're doing to work hard at keeping our shopping centers vibrant. In this light, I think it's best to describe the current state of our operations staff with two strategic viewpoints, that as a tenant and that as a landlord. Over the course of 2009, we strategically moved staff into a tenant relations department, who supported our regional leaders in marketing our portfolio to national and regional retail chains. This team framework now has a year under its belt and successfully worked through 97 portfolio reviews with national tenants last year. During our time with these tenants, we learned some valuable insights as to their temperament during a period of tough sales and came away with a few guideposts as to why we saw such positive absorption late last year. Firstly, tenants today, whether large format or shop users are following the consumer. The simple fact is that sales follow foot traffic, and the sites with the best line up of tenants are tending to draw more leasing activity. This is particularly apparent in markets like Florida and the Northeast, where abundant, unanchored centers simply can not keep pace with our anchor centers that show full parking lots and recognizable retailers bringing in the sales volumes.Secondly, tenants are shying away from risk. Risk had a very hot light shut eye today for many businesses, and the primary risk is whether people will be in the trade area to drive unit sales. When we look through our portfolio, where 92% of the GLA is in the trade area bound by the first ring highways, it's no surprise in retrospect that leases are getting signed at centers in older, mature neighborhoods, where the demographics department at a national retailer can measure and count on existing households to be active in the site.During my travels over the past quarter, I became reminded again that the closer the property is to the people, the better the occupancy and sales volume with the shopping center. To this end, it's one of our top goals this year to bring our large portfolio of mature properties to national retailers and show the strength of the trade area, as they make choices about where they want to grow their businesses. From the landlord perspective, we've been heavily focused on the fact that 2009 and surely 2010 have a large qualitative component to our deal making. When supply is tight and demand is high, the last phases to get leased at a shopping center are all about the rent. This is not the market today. Instead, we're competing heavily with other centers in the trade areas. And what we're doing now is setting the table for growth by actively selecting the right tenants so that the line up in foot traffic is the first choice for future leasing. In the fourth quarter, we signed an enormous number of anchor and junior anchor leases, 29 in total. In most cases, the rent spreads on these deals was negative, anywhere from 10% to 30% less than the prior tenant. On the other hand, the tenants who were strong, Lowe's, Target, H.H. Gregg, Bed Bath & Beyond, Nordstrom Rack and Marshalls are among those executed. In several cases this quarter, we added a grocery component to a former power center, thereby adding consumer traffic with more frequency and the seeds for future rent growth in the shops.When cycle sets at the [ph] (1:12:54) last year present an unusual number of junior anchor spaces, the choice from the landlord is simple, wait for a better day, sign the highest rent payer or sign the best tenant. We've been choosing the latter, as the shopper always follows quality tenants. And the faster we can secure the best tenant lineup, the better the prospects for growth on the remaining vacancies. Merchandising is often a subject reserved simply for retail conversation, but it also applies to the landlord. And we will remain acutely focused on correctly merchandising our properties. Our portfolio review process has taught us that this is a strategy that tenants want. And we'll continue this year to selectively lease to the best tenants. Lastly, I'd like to comment on how our strategy is producing results for shop leasing, as it's been a very popular subject throughout late last year. Although demand is still tepid in many markets, we're seeing that this category is again searching for the best tenant lineup to use as a customer drawer and reduce their risk. We saw a large uptick in shop leasing in the fourth quarter, a total of 175 new leases that account for almost a half a million square feet. Rents for these spaces are wildly divergent by market. But in aggregate, they're still 8% higher than the previous tenant was paying. Tenants follow traffic, and rent goes up with sales. As we look forward to 2010, we believe that the current trend for our first ring properties will continue, a stable but not exuberant leasing market, high but not growing vacates, high renewal rates, and a significant pressures on junior anchor leasing spreads, while maintaining shop spreads to the positive. Our operating staff worked very hard in 2009, and half of our leasing agents completed more than 40 new deals per person. Most of our property managers squeezed recurring CAM [common area maintenance] rates down, and our redevelopment and ancillary income departments added new programs every quarter. We'll continue in 2010 to be very focused on our fundamentals on our Shopping Center business and creating value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back to Barbara."

What Mike's been mentioning is how we're doing on specifically the Linens and Circuit City bankruptcies. If you look at Linens and Circuit together, we started with 58 total vacancies. We've re-leased and fully executed 29 of those. Eight more have a guarantor, and sort of darkened [ph] (1:18:40) paying. Five are under of letter of intent today. So we've got 16 left, as we go forward throughout the year, so we're making good progress. I would say that the rent spread trends, when you look in aggregate, anywhere from a 10% to a 30% roll down is just purely depending on which space it is you leased. And as you can imagine, the better spaces lease first, and the spaces that are tougher take a little bit more time. So I certainly wouldn't expect the rent spreads now on the junior anchors to improve. Having said that, demand has improved substantially from what it was three or four months ago. And a lot of retailers are now submitting LOIs on junior anchor spaces that four or five months ago had no activity. So those two might start to cancel each other out.

So when you're going to see shorter-term leases as if you're trying to do temporary tenants or pop-up stores or something just to keep activity in a site. But in general, we have not gone down that strategy simply because when you look at the tenants that we're securing, we're happy with the credit. Of the 10 Florida cities held at Linen's and Circuit City's, we've got virtually all of them with good credit. And they're good strong retailers that I mentioned during my remarks.

As we have announced, we have bought a number of the assets at 85% interest at what we think are opportunistic prices. The balance of what we formerly call, the sale bucket, does not have interest to us at this time. And they're out on the market and beginning to get some traction in selling those assets. So it's difficult to project exactly how much equity will be needed to clean up that unsecured debt in August. But Prudential assures us they are prepared to write their check. And the different funds that are in the ventures with us have plenty of liquidity. So we really, honestly, are not concerned about that. In the other ventures and some Prudential debt, I think there are some mortgages but we've done a good job. And we continue to be attractive owner of property for life companies.

And the number of people that would also like to take advantage of those opportunities had increased. And this is very lumpy. I mean Albertson's was a huge deal. 600 some grocery stores acquired all at one time, a very lumpy deal. Montgomery Ward, which was a signature deal for Kimco was always very lumpy. So this is very difficult to predict, so we're just trying to tell you that we're committed as part of our strategy to enhance value.

So the ones that we chose to buy late in the game last quarter were primarily because we got to a stability of occupancy and a price per square foot that made it very positive for us to make the investment in a specific market, specifically, it was Portland where we bought six properties. We spent a lot of time in the market. I believe we’re the largest institutional owner of shopping centers in Portland. We’ve got an office there and we’ve got a pretty good handle on where the market is going.So when you look at the occupancy level and the price per square foot, which is I believe was around $69 a square foot, it was a very positive investment for us to stay in that market. It’s fairly supply-constrained. They have a specific way of not having a suburban sprawl by an urban growth boundary. Retailers seem to do well there and those properties for us are a good long-term way to create value because we’ve got vacancy that came for free that we can lease up. The second reason that you’ll see those assets being positive for us is that some of them have shorter-term leases and therefore, a private investor, even though they like the center and they like the tenants, had a hard time, six months ago, financing those properties. But from our perspective, they had a very good set of grocery stores and junior anchors. So for instance, it's Safeway in Canby, we’re going to have maybe six years left on their base term, not very financeable, but since we had a huge portfolio with Safeway, they convinced us that they’ve made investments in that store and they’re going to stay. So those are reasons why an order to combine all cash can do a lot better or did last year when a buyer, looking for a finance property, couldn’t quite make the acquisition."

As an example of the potential upside, we opened seven new shopping centers in the fourth quarter in Mexico. These are situations where I think nine different anchor stores opened up in Mexico more so than the United States. Opening the anchor stores triggers the rest of the leasing. So until you get the Wal-Mart and the theater and others actually opened, it is very difficult to lease the small local stores in Mexico, with the exception of our large project in Hermosillo, which will come on in April of 2010. Almost everything else, the construction is now done, so we do see upside. Now with respect to leasing spreads and rents, Mexico's, just like the U.S., stopped dead early in 2009. The retailers, even the most successful retailers like Liverpool in Mexico just suspended all new leasing, as they held their breath about the world economic crisis and what was happening in the U.S. As you know, remittances from Mexicans in the U.S. were way down. So a lot of retailers just simply stopped. There was a fear that was pervasive similar to the U.S. As David explained, in the U.S., starting in the third and now the fourth quarter, leasing is picking in Mexico. So we expect rents to resume their growth upwards and I think you’ll see some much more positive numbers coming out of Mexico. The sales are good. We’re starting to get some nice percentage rents, both the theaters and many of our grocery stores pay percentage rents, which is different than the U.S. So we remain -- we feel good. Every time I go down there, honestly, the quality of the centers we have down there is first class and I would encourage all of you on the phone to just go take a look at one or two of ours down there. So we just do -- we feel very good."

For example, even if you’ve got a pretty good space right now in Las Vegas or Phoenix, you’ve got virtually no activity in those markets, very difficult for the retailers, a lot of product on the market. So even though the dirt may be an A, you probably have demand of a C, and that will just have to work itself out over time. There are other markets where the box is an A, but the market itself is maybe secondary or tertiary and I would suspect, as we go through this year, we’ll start to see that the junior anchors, where they were six months ago,  only focused on the top 20 MSAs, they’re going to start to move into the next 20 or 30 MSAs because those sub-markets still have a lot of population.They’ve got stability in the population and the spending, and when you need footprint growth, you’re going to be looking at secondary markets, and we’ve already seen that, where we’ve been leasing junior anchor spaces outside of the top largest cities.

And we have seen in our portfolio, which is primarily the InTown Suites portfolio, that it has bottomed out at it's beginning it's way back. If you recall, this is a portfolio of lower and extended stay hotels primarily in the Southeast and Southwest. So it looks like it's getting healthier but until it gets back to former NOI levels and until the hospitability market, overall, is perceived to be healthy and that’s probably tied to the economy, I don’t see an IPO as a reasonable exit. Since we own the platform, as well as the assets, it would be attractive, we believe at some point, for a hospitality owner to pick up our brand, if you will, and our 130 some hotels as part of that. So I think it’s more likely to be a private exit to a larger hotel group to round out their offerings in connection with or not in connection with their own IPO. The preferred equity, it’s really two baskets. We have our non-retail preferred equity, which we're committed to disposing of and liquidating over time and there’s a variety of techniques we are using asset-by-asset and partner-by-partner to dispose of those. Some of these assets are on the market and they will be sold and the proceeds deviate up, others will be refinanced. In some cases, the partner is buying out our interest as a way to keep the asset, and so we’re going to unwind these. If you recall, our preferred equity portfolio had lots and lots of small investments. These averaged a $2 million, so they’re not very big and they’re not big deals. And we do have people assigned to each individual one.  The retail preferred equity portfolio is somewhat different. In general, it is very high quality shopping centers that we have a good basis in. 1/3 of the retail is in Canada and there's substantial unrealized gains. Some of those ventures or some of those preferred equity investments, we may convert to parry pursue joint ventures and hold for the long term because they’re really first class assets. Others will also be sold. Cap rates, as you know in Canada, are very attractive right now and we have some substantial unrealized gains that we may use to offset possible impairments on some of the non-retail stuff as a way to exit non-retail over time on an accelerated basis. But there’s various techniques we’re going to use on the retail side. But in general, we feel very good about the retail side of the preferred equity.

It pays us 9.5% on a gross basis. It’s been current from day one. Valad, as a company, is getting its legs underneath it. Its got a three year maturity worst case. But this is a company that needs to raise equity, needs to pay down debt. We’re a company that would like to go home. So there may be something to be done with this over time. But we can’t predict it. Secondly, the hotel portfolio. That’s probably more problematic in terms of the short term. We still feel good about it long term. It is producing 8.5-ish, something like that FFO return on our equity investment, so that’s not so bad. The third piece, as Mike referred to, is the urban portfolio. We have $250 million-ish of assets scattered in four different cities. We are beginning to see activity, both in New York and in Boston, individual investors buying these building from us. In general, they are very good quality buildings, but they were bought as redevelopments. But we’re beginning to see interest in those and I believe in, at least in the second quarter if not in the first quarter, that we will make some things happen in that urban portfolio. The fourth piece is just a huge eclectic range of assets, generally small assets of all kinds of non-retail assets and all kinds of asset classes. And again, we have a business plan by asset and to dispose of these assets and we’re doing everything we can to move it along. And the market seems to be going a little bit our way now as investors are returning with a vengeance and looking for opportunistic acquisitions. So we think we’ll make things happen. We’re committed to at least $200 million. If we can do more, we will do more, and we’re hoping some of the investor community concern about the non-retail will go away as we chip away."

It made me reflect on our company and our future. Our shopping centers have a higher proportion of land to total value than other asset classes. Thank goodness for required parking ratios. Our tenant rent streams permit us to land bank at the same time provide a current cash flow, while awaiting the growth of value.

And I'm also very pleased about continuing our nine-year partnership. It is an honor to work with you, the Board of Directors and other members of our senior management team. It is truly wonderful to be part of carrying on a 50-year tradition of retail real estate excellence. Given the challenges for all of us in the Real Estate business over the past year and the numerous questions from a host of analysts, shareholders and institutional partners, I would like to take a minute to clarify our business strategy and address some of the concerns expressed over the past several months. We believe our business strategy is now simple and very clear. We are going to stay true to our retail roots and our core retail operating expertise. We are second to none in relationships with retailers, retail leasing experience, property management and retail redevelopment skills. We have the largest and most diversified portfolio of community and neighborhood shopping centers, with more than 13,000 individual leases. This size and scale gives us many advantages and provides our company with a reliable and steady cash flow to support dividends and capital investments. Overall and in summary, we are committed to equity ownership of quality retail real estate, which will provide long-term recurring income. In addition to our focus and emphasis on increasing the cash flow of our retail property portfolio, there are three other elements of our business strategy, which we feel differentiate us and enhance our future growth in shareholder value. First, we remain dedicated to building an institutional management business by forming programmatic joint ventures and co-mingled funds with first-class domestic and foreign institutional partners. Joint venturing with strong institutions help us be competitive in acquiring high-quality retail properties, and the recurring fee income improves our returns on invested capital. Second, we continue to believe in the long-term benefits of our international investments in both Canada and Mexico. In addition to diversification and synergies with many of our strongest U.S. retailers, both Mexico and Canada are significantly under retailed when compared to the U.S. Our largest tenants, such as Wal-Mart and Home Depot have recognized the advantages inherent in both of these markets and continue to expand aggressively. Last week, Target joined others in announcing that Mexico and Canada will be part of their long-term expansion plans. As a third element of our retail strategy, we will definitely remain opportunistic in purchasing real estate owned by retailers. Kimco has a long tradition of profitable and opportunistic acquisitions of both vacant and occupied real estate portfolios owned by retailers. Examples include Albertsons, Montgomery Ward, Venture Stores, Hechinger stores, Frank's Nursery, Clover stores and Gold Circle. Kimco has the relationships, underwriting expertise and leasing skills to make these investments an important part of creating shareholder value. Thus, as a summary, our strategy is simple, recurring income from quality retail real estate, enhanced by institutional management, international real estate investments and opportunistic retail real estate acquisitions from retailers. On the other side of presenting in simple terms our strategic vision, I'd like to spend some time addressing four concerns mentioned in many of our analyst and investor reviews. First, there remains a question of our explicit or implicit guarantees of debt in our retail joint ventures with institutions. At the beginning of 2009, Kimco had guaranteed debt on behalf of retail institutional joint ventures totaling approximately $685 million, primarily in our Prudential joint ventures. Today, through property sales and equity investments by the joint venture partners, this amount has been reduced to $331 million. By September 2010 this year, we are very confident that the guaranteed loan balances for the retail joint ventures will be completely repaid. With respect to implicit guarantees, all other retail institutional joint venture debt is in the form of non-recourse, property-specific mortgages, and there are absolutely no partnership obligations of any kind to repay non-recourse mortgage debt. Second, the amount and timing of deleveraging our balance sheet has been a popular topic. Mike Pappagallo has repeatedly defined our leverage objectives in terms of a net debt to EBITDA ratio. And as a management team, we are committed to reducing the net debt to EBITDA ratio to 6x by the end of 2012 and to 5x by the end of 2014. These are firm goals and should clarify the timing for everyone. Third, the disposition of our non-retail portfolio real estate investments of approximately $875 million has also been much discussed. It is important to understand that non-retail does not mean not earning or not good. Our non-retail investments vary wildly, generally produce FFO and will be sold on a disciplined but accelerated basis over the next two to four years. Since the beginning of 2009, the non-retail portfolio has been reduced by $150 million to date, and we anticipate a minimum of $200 million of additional disposition from 2010. The fourth concern frequently mentioned is the price  paid for the PL Retail portfolio and the apparent lack of institutional partners participating in the purchase. As we said last quarter, the transaction came about very quickly. And we strongly believe that the price paid was attractive in relation to the high-quality properties involved. We are actively working with several institutions with respect to various properties in the portfolio. And we hope to be able to finalize one or more new joint ventures in the first quarter. As we place the PL Retail properties in new, lower leveraged, long-term institutional joint ventures, we hope investors will have less concerns. And we remain very pleased to have acquired the portfolio, when we did and with the price we paid. Now I'd like to turn it over to my esteemed partner and CFO, Mike Pappagallo."

As reported last evening, we closed out the year with a fourth quarter FFO per share of $0.31. This was $0.02 higher than the consensus estimates. Comparing the results against last year's fourth quarter and excluding impairment charges in both periods, FFO per share declined by $0.15 from $0.46 in the prior year. Substantially all of the decrease reflects the dilution caused by the re-equitization of the balance sheet earlier in 2009. On a full year basis, FFO per share was $0.82 including impairments and $1.33 excluding impairments. The latter number compares to $2.49 per share in 2008. The overall reduction can be attributed to lower transaction activity of $0.53, the dilution from the equity offering of $0.48 and lower income from our structured investments and non-shopping center assets of $0.13. The decline in contribution from our Shopping Center business was modest at only $0.02. I offer that blizzard of numbers to underscore that the foundation of the business strategy that Dave just articulated, our North American shopping center portfolio, had demonstrated its resiliency and stability during a very tough year. The move away from reliance on transactions for merchant building, preferred equity kickers and securities, the shutdown of our Non-Shopping Center businesses, the mark-to-market on the assets acquired at the top of the cycle, as well as the large recapitalization of the company last spring has certainly been painful in terms of short-term financial results. But as we move into 2010, focusing our efforts on the four elements of the strategy Dave talked about and dissipating the four clouds that concern investors, I believe the consequence will be much more visibility and clarity of our financial results and operating drivers, which in turn will reveal the strength and stability of our shopping center assets. To that point, the portfolio vital signs of those shopping centers were solid this past quarter, following through on the positive turns started in the third quarter. Overall occupancy increased by 40 basis points from September to 92.8%. This increase was driven by lease up in certain of the former Linen and Circuit City boxes. Same-store net operating income declined 1.1%, within our expectations and previous guidance offered to investors, and while spreads on 467,000 square feet on new leases held by 6.9%, recognizing about 229,000 square feet related to the re-leasing of 10 of those Linens and Circuit boxes at a negative spread of about 25%, a level of decline which we expected.  Excluding those leases, the balance of the new signings showed a 2.1% increase. And as our earnings release indicated, the tremendous increase in the GLA of new leases signed over the last year in face of the very tough environment says a lot about our leasing organization and our asset quality. One other point about the reported leasing spreads. Our population of leases reflect new leases signed on spaces vacated over the past 12 months. We limit the comparable time period to a year in order to capture what the effect of rollover will be for the upcoming year for a specified amount of square footage. If a space has been vacant for over a year, the new lease income is pure upside in the projected estimate of NOI. Others might compute leasing spreads on a different basis, and there is no single right answer. But the spreads quoted on leases for shorter-cycle businesses, such as apartments or self storage may mean something different than spreads recorded on long-term leases rolling in the Shopping Center business. So we just report those rollovers over the past year to help focus on the immediate forward financial statement impact. All that said, we will continue to provide you with information with regard to the re-leasing activity on the junior box vacancies from Linen, Circuit and a few others, regardless of the time period as we suspect that's the information you'd like to gain insight on. Our fourth quarter results did include additional impairment charges amounting to $34 million. However, this charge was almost completely offset by associated tax benefits recognized against those impairments and against the impairment charges taken earlier in the year, in which tax benefits were not recognized at that time. Primary reason why we are now able to accrue the tax benefits is twofold: First, the recent change in carryback rules that extended the carryback period by an additional two years; and in addition, the establishment of certain tax planning strategies for our taxable REIT subsidiary going forward, which will generate additional income and will allow us to utilize these tax benefits in light of changes in our strategy including holding our development assets longer term and reducing leverage.With respect to the balance sheet, Dave mentioned our long-term targets to resize the debt levels relative to our EBITDA and along with that, a gradual improvement in fixed charge coverage. We have also mentioned that it will not be a straight line at each three-month measurement period. We cut the overall net debt to EBITDA levels from 8.1x to 6.8x over the past 12 months. The uptick from the prior quarter reflects the remaining debt assumed from the PL Retail acquisition after we cleaned up the January 2010 maturities prior to this year end. And we continue to be comforted by the very manageable and well-staggered debt maturities on the corporate balance sheet and the joint ventures. We all recognize we will have to wait until August or September for the cloud of the guaranteed debt on Prudential-Kimco joint venture to lift, but we're very confident that it will.Finally, we've provided initial FFO per share guidance for 2010 in the range of $1.07 to $1.15. Underscoring these estimates is a cautious view of the retail environment. We expect occupancy to move up somewhat, as we move through 2010, up to 50 basis points. As in the past, we will most likely see some fallout in the early part of the year but build back as we move through 2010. Same-store NOI is targeted to be flat to a slight rollback of minus 2%, driven by what we expect to see in further short-term pressure in leasing spreads. Also, our estimates include limited gains from transaction activity or on the flipside, any impairment charges. One research analyst suggests that, that company either take the position of being cautious or optimistic but not both. We prefer to start cautious. That's the right mindset to have, along with the disciplined focus on the key elements of the strategy that Dave articulated. I'd now like to turn it over to David Lukes to give you his report on the shopping center portfolio."

The short story on operations for the four",1098,"Good morning. With the close of 2009, I'd like to give you some thoughts on a tumultuous year, results for the fourth quarter and what we're doing in 2010 to focus to our operating staff and execute our strategy. The short story on operations for the fourth quarter is encouraging. New leasing is up, vacates are down, operating expenses are down, renewals are strong and the risk of co-tenancy violations has been considerably mitigated. As Mike mentioned, our total occupancy rose to 92.8%. When we look at the U.S. portfolio, we executed 204 leases, representing 1.1 million square feet. The vacating tenants decreased substantially from the prior quarter to 780,000 square feet, therefore achieving a meaningful positive absorption of 50 basis points in the U.S. and settling our occupancy at 92.4%. Although vacates continues to be a heavy weight on our shoulders, strong new leasing has continued now for two quarters. And I'd like to comment on how we're achieving these results and what we're doing to work hard at keeping our shopping centers vibrant. In this light, I think it's best to describe the current state of our operations staff with two strategic viewpoints, that as a tenant and that as a landlord. Over the course of 2009, we strategically moved staff into a tenant relations department, who supported our regional leaders in marketing our portfolio to national and regional retail chains. This team framework now has a year under its belt and successfully worked through 97 portfolio reviews with national tenants last year. During our time with these tenants, we learned some valuable insights as to their temperament during a period of tough sales and came away with a few guideposts as to why we saw such positive absorption late last year. Firstly, tenants today, whether large format or shop users are following the consumer. The simple fact is that sales follow foot traffic, and the sites with the best line up of tenants are tending to draw more leasing activity. This is particularly apparent in markets like Florida and the Northeast, where abundant, unanchored centers simply can not keep pace with our anchor centers that show full parking lots and recognizable retailers bringing in the sales volumes.Secondly, tenants are shying away from risk. Risk had a very hot light shut eye today for many businesses, and the primary risk is whether people will be in the trade area to drive unit sales. When we look through our portfolio, where 92% of the GLA is in the trade area bound by the first ring highways, it's no surprise in retrospect that leases are getting signed at centers in older, mature neighborhoods, where the demographics department at a national retailer can measure and count on existing households to be active in the site.During my travels over the past quarter, I became reminded again that the closer the property is to the people, the better the occupancy and sales volume with the shopping center. To this end, it's one of our top goals this year to bring our large portfolio of mature properties to national retailers and show the strength of the trade area, as they make choices about where they want to grow their businesses. From the landlord perspective, we've been heavily focused on the fact that 2009 and surely 2010 have a large qualitative component to our deal making. When supply is tight and demand is high, the last phases to get leased at a shopping center are all about the rent. This is not the market today. Instead, we're competing heavily with other centers in the trade areas. And what we're doing now is setting the table for growth by actively selecting the right tenants so that the line up in foot traffic is the first choice for future leasing. In the fourth quarter, we signed an enormous number of anchor and junior anchor leases, 29 in total. In most cases, the rent spreads on these deals was negative, anywhere from 10% to 30% less than the prior tenant. On the other hand, the tenants who were strong, Lowe's, Target, H.H. Gregg, Bed Bath & Beyond, Nordstrom Rack and Marshalls are among those executed. In several cases this quarter, we added a grocery component to a former power center, thereby adding consumer traffic with more frequency and the seeds for future rent growth in the shops.When cycle sets at the [ph] (1:12:54) last year present an unusual number of junior anchor spaces, the choice from the landlord is simple, wait for a better day, sign the highest rent payer or sign the best tenant. We've been choosing the latter, as the shopper always follows quality tenants. And the faster we can secure the best tenant lineup, the better the prospects for growth on the remaining vacancies. Merchandising is often a subject reserved simply for retail conversation, but it also applies to the landlord. And we will remain acutely focused on correctly merchandising our properties. Our portfolio review process has taught us that this is a strategy that tenants want. And we'll continue this year to selectively lease to the best tenants. Lastly, I'd like to comment on how our strategy is producing results for shop leasing, as it's been a very popular subject throughout late last year. Although demand is still tepid in many markets, we're seeing that this category is again searching for the best tenant lineup to use as a customer drawer and reduce their risk. We saw a large uptick in shop leasing in the fourth quarter, a total of 175 new leases that account for almost a half a million square feet. Rents for these spaces are wildly divergent by market. But in aggregate, they're still 8% higher than the previous tenant was paying. Tenants follow traffic, and rent goes up with sales. As we look forward to 2010, we believe that the current trend for our first ring properties will continue, a stable but not exuberant leasing market, high but not growing vacates, high renewal rates, and a significant pressures on junior anchor leasing spreads, while maintaining shop spreads to the positive. Our operating staff worked very hard in 2009, and half of our leasing agents completed more than 40 new deals per person. Most of our property managers squeezed recurring CAM [common area maintenance] rates down, and our redevelopment and ancillary income departments added new programs every quarter. We'll continue in 2010 to be very focused on our fundamentals on our Shopping Center business and creating value for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back to Barbara."

One is the total junior anchors in the portfolio, which I will categorize anywhere between 10 and 60,000 square feet is traditionally a junior depending on the site. What Mike's been mentioning is how we're doing on specifically the Linens and Circuit City bankruptcies. If you look at Linens and Circuit together, we started with 58 total vacancies. We've re-leased and fully executed 29 of those. Eight more have a guarantor, and sort of darkened [ph] (1:18:40) paying. Five are under of letter of intent today. So we've got 16 left, as we go forward throughout the year, so we're making good progress. I would say that the rent spread trends, when you look in aggregate, anywhere from a 10% to a 30% roll down is just purely depending on which space it is you leased. And as you can imagine, the better spaces lease first, and the spaces that are tougher take a little bit more time. So I certainly wouldn't expect the rent spreads now on the junior anchors to improve. Having said that, demand has improved substantially from what it was three or four months ago. And a lot of retailers are now submitting LOIs on junior anchor spaces that four or five months ago had no activity. So those two might start to cancel each other out. And we might start to see a little bit of stabilization from the junior anchor rents."

But in general, we have not gone down that strategy simply because when you look at the tenants that we're securing, we're happy with the credit.

And we've made -- that process is accelerating. I'd say they were -- the sale assets are beginning to accelerate a little bit. As we have announced, we have bought a number of the assets at 85% interest at what we think are opportunistic prices. The balance of what we formerly call, the sale bucket, does not have interest to us at this time. And they're out on the market and beginning to get some traction in selling those assets. So it's difficult to project exactly how much equity will be needed to clean up that unsecured debt in August. But Prudential assures us they are prepared to write their check. And the different funds that are in the ventures with us have plenty of liquidity. So we really, honestly, are not concerned about that. In the other ventures and some Prudential debt, I think there are some mortgages but we've done a good job. And we continue to be attractive owner of property for life companies.

And the history of Kimco is we have the relationships with the retailers. And we have done a lot of work over the years to try to identify opportunities where the retailers' own outright, a lot of their own real estate. Now the number of retailers that own a lot of their own real estate has been declining somewhat. So I'd say the universe of opportunities has gone down somewhat. And the number of people that would also like to take advantage of those opportunities had increased. And this is very lumpy. I mean Albertson's was a huge deal. 600 some grocery stores acquired all at one time, a very lumpy deal. Montgomery Ward, which was a signature deal for Kimco was always very lumpy. So this is very difficult to predict, so we're just trying to tell you that we're committed as part of our strategy to enhance value. We will continue to mind those opportunities, those relationships. And we'd like to structure a win-win with these retailers. For instance, the struggling retailer needs capital. We would do a sale lease back with them at a very high rent. So if they make it, it's very profitable to us. If they don't make it, we've backed into some very good real estate at a low basis."

That has a true footprint growth from a number of chains, Nordstrom Rack, Marshalls, Ross, H.H. Gregg, a lot of them are actually growing their footprint. And the only way to do it right now is to fill vacant space in existing shopping centers because there's no development pipeline. So that's been a very positive force right now. And if that continues even at a modest pace, then it's going to help us a lot on occupancy. Shop spaces has been fairly stable as well. And that's an encouraging sign given where the economy is with small shop tenant. All of those things, you're right, are adding up to some fairly positive momentum. We just have to remember that every year you've got junior anchors also rolling and expiring. And given the fact that our centers were developed 10 years ago, you do have some roll over of tenants and that's a risk that we have to be aware of, of trying to get these tenants to stay in their current format and their current location."

So the ones that we chose to buy late in the game last quarter were primarily because we got to a stability of occupancy and a price per square foot that made it very positive for us to make the investment in a specific market, specifically, it was Portland where we bought six properties. We spent a lot of time in the market. I believe we’re the largest institutional owner of shopping centers in Portland. We’ve got an office there and we’ve got a pretty good handle on where the market is going.So when you look at the occupancy level and the price per square foot, which is I believe was around $69 a square foot, it was a very positive investment for us to stay in that market. It’s fairly supply-constrained. They have a specific way of not having a suburban sprawl by an urban growth boundary. Retailers seem to do well there and those properties for us are a good long-term way to create value because we’ve got vacancy that came for free that we can lease up. The second reason that you’ll see those assets being positive for us is that some of them have shorter-term leases and therefore, a private investor, even though they like the center and they like the tenants, had a hard time, six months ago, financing those properties. But from our perspective, they had a very good set of grocery stores and junior anchors. So for instance, it's Safeway in Canby, we’re going to have maybe six years left on their base term, not very financeable, but since we had a huge portfolio with Safeway, they convinced us that they’ve made investments in that store and they’re going to stay. So those are reasons why an order to combine all cash can do a lot better or did last year when a buyer, looking for a finance property, couldn’t quite make the acquisition."

As an example of the potential upside, we opened seven new shopping centers in the fourth quarter in Mexico. These are situations where I think nine different anchor stores opened up in Mexico more so than the United States. Opening the anchor stores triggers the rest of the leasing. So until you get the Wal-Mart and the theater and others actually opened, it is very difficult to lease the small local stores in Mexico, with the exception of our large project in Hermosillo, which will come on in April of 2010. Almost everything else, the construction is now done, so we do see upside. Now with respect to leasing spreads and rents, Mexico's, just like the U.S., stopped dead early in 2009. The retailers, even the most successful retailers like Liverpool in Mexico just suspended all new leasing, as they held their breath about the world economic crisis and what was happening in the U.S. As you know, remittances from Mexicans in the U.S. were way down. So a lot of retailers just simply stopped. There was a fear that was pervasive similar to the U.S. As David explained, in the U.S., starting in the third and now the fourth quarter, leasing is picking in Mexico. So we expect rents to resume their growth upwards and I think you’ll see some much more positive numbers coming out of Mexico. The sales are good. We’re starting to get some nice percentage rents, both the theaters and many of our grocery stores pay percentage rents, which is different than the U.S. So we remain -- we feel good. Every time I go down there, honestly, the quality of the centers we have down there is first class and I would encourage all of you on the phone to just go take a look at one or two of ours down there.

There are other markets where the box is an A, but the market itself is maybe secondary or tertiary and I would suspect, as we go through this year, we’ll start to see that the junior anchors, where they were six months ago,  only focused on the top 20 MSAs, they’re going to start to move into the next 20 or 30 MSAs because those sub-markets still have a lot of population.They’ve got stability in the population and the spending, and when you need footprint growth, you’re going to be looking at secondary markets, and we’ve already seen that, where we’ve been leasing junior anchor spaces outside of the top largest cities.

And we have seen in our portfolio, which is primarily the InTown Suites portfolio, that it has bottomed out at it's beginning it's way back. If you recall, this is a portfolio of lower and extended stay hotels primarily in the Southeast and Southwest. So it looks like it's getting healthier but until it gets back to former NOI levels and until the hospitability market, overall, is perceived to be healthy and that’s probably tied to the economy, I don’t see an IPO as a reasonable exit. Since we own the platform, as well as the assets, it would be attractive, we believe at some point, for a hospitality owner to pick up our brand, if you will, and our 130 some hotels as part of that. So I think it’s more likely to be a private exit to a larger hotel group to round out their offerings in connection with or not in connection with their own IPO. The preferred equity, it’s really two baskets. We have our non-retail preferred equity, which we're committed to disposing of and liquidating over time and there’s a variety of techniques we are using asset-by-asset and partner-by-partner to dispose of those. Some of these assets are on the market and they will be sold and the proceeds deviate up, others will be refinanced. In some cases, the partner is buying out our interest as a way to keep the asset, and so we’re going to unwind these. If you recall, our preferred equity portfolio had lots and lots of small investments. These averaged a $2 million, so they’re not very big and they’re not big deals. And we do have people assigned to each individual one.  The retail preferred equity portfolio is somewhat different. In general, it is very high quality shopping centers that we have a good basis in. 1/3 of the retail is in Canada and there's substantial unrealized gains. Some of those ventures or some of those preferred equity investments, we may convert to parry pursue joint ventures and hold for the long term because they’re really first class assets. Others will also be sold. Cap rates, as you know in Canada, are very attractive right now and we have some substantial unrealized gains that we may use to offset possible impairments on some of the non-retail stuff as a way to exit non-retail over time on an accelerated basis. But there’s various techniques we’re going to use on the retail side. But in general, we feel very good about the retail side of the preferred equity. But we’re committed over time to basically reduce both parts of the preferred equity portfolio."

We are committed to disposing of the non-retail portfolio on an accelerated basis, but a disciplined basis. We are not going to give these assets away just to get this number down. As you probably know, and just to piggy back on some of Mike’s comments, the non-retail portfolio really has four components: We have the Valad note, which is a large note. It pays us 9.5% on a gross basis. It’s been current from day one. Valad, as a company, is getting its legs underneath it. Its got a three year maturity worst case. But this is a company that needs to raise equity, needs to pay down debt. We’re a company that would like to go home. So there may be something to be done with this over time. But we can’t predict it. Secondly, the hotel portfolio. That’s probably more problematic in terms of the short term. We still feel good about it long term. It is producing 8.5-ish, something like that FFO return on our equity investment, so that’s not so bad. The third piece, as Mike referred to, is the urban portfolio. We have $250 million-ish of assets scattered in four different cities. We are beginning to see activity, both in New York and in Boston, individual investors buying these building from us. In general, they are very good quality buildings, but they were bought as redevelopments. But we’re beginning to see interest in those and I believe in, at least in the second quarter if not in the first quarter, that we will make some things happen in that urban portfolio. The fourth piece is just a huge eclectic range of assets, generally small assets of all kinds of non-retail assets and all kinds of asset classes. And again, we have a business plan by asset and to dispose of these assets and we’re doing everything we can to move it along. And the market seems to be going a little bit our way now as investors are returning with a vengeance and looking for opportunistic acquisitions. So we think we’ll make things happen. We’re committed to at least $200 million. If we can do more, we will do more, and we’re hoping some of the investor community concern about the non-retail will go away as we chip away."

First, I'd like to begin by formally thanking David Lukes for his hard work and contributions to our company over the past seven years. David is a talented real estate executive and we wish him the very best in his new role as CEO of Mall Properties, Inc. At the same time, we are very pleased that Mike Pappagallo has become our new Chief Operating Officer.
For an interim period, Mike will also retain his CFO responsibilities. With his senior finance staff and our region Presidents adding additional duties to ensure a smooth transition across the board. While I have promised Mike that I would keep the superlative to a minimum, so I would like to note Mike's industry recognized accomplishments over 13 years as our CFO and our strong belief that Mike is well qualified to assume the key operating role in our firm. Congratulations and well deserved, Mike.
In terms of our first quarter, we are happy to report solid financial and operating results. Mike will provide the details. But it is clear that leasing activity in aggregate is increasing and our portfolio key metrics, such as occupancy, leasing spreads and same store NOI are improving after a very rough 2009. Our tenants, which in general are necessity based or discount oriented retailers, are showing much improved comparable sales and are again looking to expand selectively.
I encourage all of our shareholders and the analyst community to review page 29 of our supplemental financial report which lists our 50 largest tenants. The financial strength and prospect of almost all of these tenants gives us great confidence in the stability and reliability of our future rental revenues.
During the quarter, we also made good progress on each of the four key objectives we discussed in detail in our last earnings call, company leverage level, retail joint venture debt guarantees, placement of the PL retail assets in institutional joint ventures and the disposition of our non-retail portfolio.
With respect to leverage, our debt to EBITDA ratio declined from 6.8 to 6.3 during the first quarter and we are well advanced towards our 2012 goal of a 6.0 ratio. On the retail joint venture debt guarantees, the amount has been further reduced from $331 million to $311 million during the quarter. And as mentioned on our last call, we expect that the remaining amount will be fully repaid by the maturity date of August 15 with Kimco and Prudential each paying their respective share of the debt, 15% and 85% respectively.
As a point of reference, the total amount of retail joint venture debt guaranteed by Kimco was originally $1.2 billion, which has been reduced to the current level, $311 million through property sales and partnership contributions. With respect to the PL retail portfolio, we are very pleased that five of the largest assets totaling 370 million have been transferred to a new institutional joint venture with CPPIB, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. We are proud to have been selected by CPPIB to be an operating partner for neighborhood and community shopping centers in the U.S. and we anticipate substantially increasing the number of assets in the venture.
We also expect to close this week an additional new joint venture worth two more PL retail properties totaling $67 million. Together these ventures will represent more than 50% of the PL retail assets in terms of net income. On the last of our four objectives, the disposition of properties and investments in our non-retail portfolio, debt repayments and security sales since our last call total approximately 10 million, however, we do have an additional 27 million of properties under firm contracts, a further 25 million of properties under conditional sales contracts and $11 million in scheduled debt repayments, all expected to close in the second quarter. We believe our goal of reducing the non-retail portfolio by a minimal of $200 million by year-end remains fully on schedule.
Overall, the market outlook has greatly improved in terms of both property values and underlying fundamentals. There continues to be increasing amounts of capital reentering the commercial real estate sector and cap rates have declined materially over the past six months. In our case, it is encouraging to have an increasing number of first class institutional partners which are actively seeking to invest with us in high quality neighborhood and community shopping centers.
At the property level, as mentioned, we are seeing increasing signs of stability with rent levels firming and retailers once again looking at expansion opportunities. In our two primary international markets, Canada and Mexico, both countries are showing significant increases in GDP, positive job growth, stronger currencies and retailer expansion, all of which bode well for our portfolio.
I would like to complete my comments by once again restating our corporate strategy in very simple terms. We are committed to the equity ownership of neighborhood and community shopping centers, which provide long-term recurring rental revenues. We will enhance our earnings through recurring fee income from institutional joint ventures, international retail property investments and opportunistic retail real estate purchases from retailers.
We believe this formula will provide very reliable and dependent above average income and dividend growth for our shareholders.
Now I'd like to turn it over to our new COO, Mike Pappagallo.

Before I review the operating activity for the quarter, I want to spend the moment on the recent change in my responsibility. I'm certainly honored that Milton, Dave from Board has placed their confidence in my ability to assume the direction of our operation portfolio. I will provide a different perspective and approach to the role.
Everybody knows me, as finance and operations guy. And I won't pretend to have 30 years of on-the-ground real estate experience with deep retailer relationships, but the good news is that Kimco has plenty of them, as well as the seasoned experts in leasing, property management, development and construction and operation. Many of you in the investment community have met these operating leaders and through our schedule of property tours, industry events and the upcoming Investor Day, you will have further opportunity to get to know them better.
The Bob and I as a President of our Central Region is now charged with the additional responsibility of ensuring that our leasing strategies, tenant activities nationwide are executed seamlessly and ensuring that we continue to cultivate and expand our retail relationships through an already top notch national program.
Rob will also be helping me establishing those new relationships and on the nuances of executing deals. But ultimately my focus on the COO role will be the execution of our overall business strategy by simply sizing the real estate, financed and business support operations together to meet our goals.
The related raise is the stability and advisability of continuing in the CFO role. Recognizing the strong financial leaders that I have in operations, finance, accounting and treasury, my role over the past couple of years has very much been strategic in terms of directional changes in balance sheet management, external communication and sponsoring the ongoing upgrade of our system's processes and organization.
This gives us a bit of breathing room in assessing how we want us to address the COO role, but I don't see us missing a beat on any finance execution, in the meantime while we sort through the final organizational structure. We were quite pleased with the operating results for the quarter. While headline FFO per share was $0.31 it includes both impairment charges on a few smaller assets, as well as some transactional income.
Should our - both of those items and it results in FFO per share from recurring sources of $0.28 per share, which exceeded this estimates by a penny. More importantly, our shopping center vital signs continue to show progress, reflecting the improved leasing activity over the past six months. Portfolio occupancy ended the quarter at 92.8%, equal to the year-end level.
Certainly the absence of Big Bob's or junior anchor bankruptcies relieved a lot of pressure that usually occurs post holiday, but we're still happy with the momentum gains since late last year, this year is also reflected in our same site in operating levels, which is only negative 0.2% for the quarter at the better end of our expectation. While I always caution into reading into quarterly figures on NOI, this level when viewed in relation to the past five or six quarters underscores the improved operating climate and shifts to more stable metrics.
As I have quickly learned from our operating team and what is apparent from our own portfolio activity and substantial number of tenant portfolio reviews that we conduct is that the focus of retailers is on repositioning existing stores and/or in filling new stores in existing markets. The shutdown in virtually all new development is starting to have an effect on the supply and demand balance. While the retailer community is focusing more on existing markets and less on speculative areas, that is not necessarily translated into much pricing power for landlords as there is still too much available space in too many markets.
Nonetheless, a positive new leasing spread of 1.1%, excluding the effect of new deals on two former linens and circuit boxes was a healthy sign as it relates to the Kimco portfolio and once again demonstrates that the overall lower average rent is having a moderate effect on leasing rollover pressure.
We spent part of last week with our regional leaders, a recurring theme that came up that one of the keep advantages of our size is access and response, simply defined, having the benefit of access to virtually all of the retailers, having insight into their current performance in our location as well as their plans and strategies and how we can help them and therefore being able to respond with alternatives and deal terms to benefit both sides.
It may not mean getting the extra dollar of rent, but it certainly can mean and has meant retaining a tenant at a location or packaging solutions for them across the portfolio. I feel this will be a primary driver in maintaining and ultimately increasing occupancy over time.
In addition to pursuing occupancy improvements, we will need to take a closer look at potential dispositions of properties with long-term risks. The markets may still be a bit too thin for significant transactional activity now, but we must get ready. Shifting gears, in terms of balance sheet management, the program of further enhancing liquidity and strengthening key health ratios continues forward.
Our fixed charge ratio improved by one tick to 2.5 times and net debt EBITDA dropped to 6.5 times as Dave mentioned. However, I will note that that number was helped by the higher than anticipated transaction income in the quarter. If you pull out the number related to the unbudgeted transaction, the ratio was closer to 6.6 times, still representing an improvement from last quarter.
Subsequent to quarter end, we hit the Canadian markets with a $150 million eight year note at a rate of 5.99%, thereby successfully refinancing the maturing Canadian Bond of the same amount. The corporate debt maturity schedule looks as sound as ever with about 10% to 15% of the total debt stack of $4.5 million maturing each year from 2011 through 2018 and for this year the remaining maturities are less than $60 million.
With a much better environment and a low risk corporate debt structure, translation, the balance sheet ain't a problem. We remain focused on extracting ourselves from non-productive and non-strategic assets. And with a rapid improvement of those capital markets and stabilizing fundamentals, there has been a market increase in activity surrounding certain of our non-retail assets.
As Dave mentioned, we have over $50 million of contracts out on a variety of our urban mixed use assets, as well as a pay off of a loan from a healthcare facility of $11 million. Our New York assets have seen an increase in leasing activity which will position us for additional marketing later in the year. Add to that the 10 million sold since the beginning of the year and we are feeling better about the rate and pace of these dispositions.
That said, we recognize that there's two single large positions in the non-retail portfolio remain of the lot now the in town suites investment which will take longer to monetize. With the FFO yield on these two positions together are about 8% and with the prospect of improvement of rep for the rebuild in town, we think conditions will get better for us to dispose of that asset.
So we look to the balance of the year, we've tightened the range of our guidance by increasing the low end by $0.3, resulting in a range of 1.10 to 1.15 per share excluding impairments. These reflect mostly the asking for major Bankruptcy occurring in the first quarter. That said, for now, we are leaving our expectations on occupancy and same store NOI the same and we'll have much more clarity once we hit the six month mark.
With that I'll turn it over to Milton.

As Dave has outlined our strategy for Kimco, it's simply back to basics and being the premier shopping center company with a footprint in North America. We will monetize our non-shopping centers as expeditiously as practical and as Mike and Dave have pointed out, progress has already been made in this connection.
Our existing shopping center portfolio is geographically and tenant diverse. The only tenants whose rent exceed 1.5% of our total revenue are home depot, TJX, Kmart, Wal-Mart, Kohl's, Costco best by real our hold and Bed Bath & Beyond, all retailers with strong balance sheets selling everyday essentials to the consumer. Home Depot, the tenant with the highest percent of revenues has 44 locations with us. On approximately 40 of these locations, we own the ground, lease it to Home Depot and Home Depot has constructed the buildings at their own expense.
Now, our institutional management program enables us to compete aggressively to acquire high quality shopping centers at low cap rates, a combination of the low yield for the best properties and our profit on the various management fees, promotes, et cetera, provides us with a return in the double digits. We will grow this business and there refuse to be no shortage of investor's desire us of the solid year.
Our development to exposure is the minimus. So we should have safe, growing cash flows in both stormy and sunny times. What I love about our portfolio is the fact that the land is such a high proportion of total value. The improvements which have modest one-story buildings set on land that because of parking requirements is usually five times as large as the footprint of the building.
Overtime, our tenant streams will enable us to profitably hold the land for higher and better retail uses in the future. Now, we've been through many cycles and we've watched the manic depressive mood swings of the American consumer and we can never predict consumer's appetite to save or spend, but as I have pointed out many times, the population of the U.S. will grow by about 3 million people a year and at the end of ten years, we will add the present population of Canada, Australia, so as night follows day, land values, commercially zoned land, will substantially increase.
Last week, I spent some time in Canada to celebrate our joint venture with Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board. We have a fabulous platform in Canada and a great leader in our Kelly Smith. A 50% interest in RioCan our joint venture has grown in value and has a wonderful base of future growth, Kudos to Dave Henry, who brought us to Canada, when the Canadian dollar was $0.65 and cap rates were in the high nines.
Now, permit me to say a few words about Mike Pappagallo. This month we celebrate Mike's permits at Kimco since it will be 13 years since he joined us, we met for the first time when he was the CFO at GE Capital Real Estate. It didn't take more than 40 seconds to know that Mike was perfect for us. His energy is contagious, not only to me, but the entire team. Our team is thrilled with his new role and so am I. We have wonderful bench with invigorated energized outlook and we're confident we can deliver positive results for all of our constituencies.
And now we'd be delighted to answer any questions.

It's been particularly encouraging to us to watch the flood of investors step back into the commercial real estate markets. This time a year ago - this time a year ago, most investors were very gun shy and whether it was core investments or what they call value investments or core plus, there just wasn't - there just weren't many institutions that were interested.
Now with a whiff of inflation in the air and alternative investments providing such low, low income, real estate has regained its favored status and we have existing institutional investors that we have assets with that have asked us to source and find new assets and we have new institutional partners, such as CPP and Cisterra, which we announced today, actively looking to grow their venture assets with us.
So we believe we have plenty of sources of capital. Our mission as the operating partner is to find product for these institutions. To date, at least over the past six, seven months, the source of the product has been in our existing joint ventures. We have institutions such as DRA and Pru and UBS wealth management all desiring to reduce the number of assets that they have with us to meet other needs that they have.
So that's been the primary source of assets for our institutional partners. But as time goes on, we are certainly in the hunt for new assets and because of our size and scope; we believe we will be successful in finding new assets. On the operation side, specifically with Pru Kim, as you know, we are at the tail end of the sale bucket assets that we are selling. We're down to probably a handful and now we have on the market some of what we call the whole assets and some of those assets we have bought, as you know and some are in the market for sale to third parties.

In terms of what we're seeing on the ground in Latin America just like the U.S., we're seeing the economy pick up in some cases dramatically and retailers, once again expanding. Mexico, obviously is particularly interesting to us. They have strong GDP growth. They added - I'm trying to read my number here, 296,000 jobs in the first quarter. So unlike the U.S., they're actually adding new jobs in Mexico.
Wal-Mart, as an example, hopes to open 300 new stores in Mexico in 2010 alone. So you're seeing lots of good signs in Mexico. As we've said many times, our job is to provide the credibility by finishing what we have in Mexico and getting it leased and we are now proud to say that construction is essentially completed. All of our projects are now open for business with anchor tenants in place. We have some second phases to finish and a total construction budget of only about $20 million to complete what we're doing in Mexico.
We do have two larger projects in South America that are commencing now. But in terms of Mexico, we are largely complete and we have what we think is significant upside as we get that space leased. Time will tell whether new development makes economic sense. I think rents will have to go up materially and returns will have to be material. And I think we've had some lessons learned in our own mind about building smaller rather than larger projects in Mexico. But we are certainly open to looking at opportunities from our valued anchor tenants like HEB and Wal-Mart and Home Depot over time.
Part of those Home Depots that Milton talked about earlier, a significant number of them are in Mexico and every single one of these ground leases has a full cost of living increase as opposed to our Home Depot leases in the U.S. So it continues to be intriguing to us to invest in Mexico.
Like everybody else, and I'm sorry to be long winded, we have a little bit of concern about the drug violence headlines and so forth. But the truth is underneath those headlines is a strong economy. Industrial production has picked up substantially, jobs are increasing the auto sector in particular is growing again in Mexico. So there's some good things happening there, coupled with the fact that it's so understored, less than a 1000 shopping centers for a population of 100 million people.

I think we are seeing and some of our - some of our peers are seeing for instance, several grocery stores want to anchor and build new stores in the U.S. So you're already seeing a little bit of development happening, driven by strong anchors that want to have new stores and they're willing to pay higher rents to have that done, particularly in markets like the northeast.
So I'd say you're seeing the beginnings of it already in the U.S. Most developers though, can't get financing, most developers can't make the numbers work, so to Milton's point, it's going to be very limited probably for an extended period of time in terms of adding new supply to the U.S.
Places like Mexico, you still have concerns. We saw the currency as an example, decrease by about 40% at the height of the crisis. That is a huge factor in considering what yield you should be willing to invest in new developments in Mexico. So I would say for us, there has to be a 300 or 400 basis points difference in unleveraged yield to be attractive again because you are taking currency risk as you move into a market like Mexico.
In terms of the small stores, I think you asked a question about that, we are seeing increasing demand from the small stores rents are lower than they were in the beginning. But the leasing activity is accelerating and those rents will accelerate or are beginning to accelerate again. So I think there's a lot of green lights in Mexico for us right now and we're determined to get our centers up to a stabilized occupancy and prove the case. And then we'll take a look at new opportunities.

What we've talked about in terms of those projects, which are recently completed construction and now we're focusing on stabilization. It's going to be a two year period before we reach stabilization. Different projects have different time lines, but I think that's a rough order of justice.
The U.S. is a very different situation where we have been out of the development business now, the KBI business for quite a period of time. We do have a series of remaining projects which do require some further lease up. That's more assets specific, so I think in that situation that - of those remaining projects, I believe there are somewhere in the neighborhood of five projects that are in operating, but are still pending stabilization. I think it will be at least another year plus before we get those stabilized.
And that again, reflective of the market, reflective of the areas that they are in and what was a very severe lack of demand a year plus ago, so it will take some time.

I have been anxiously waiting, as you know, March was very, very good fueled by, I think a lot of pent up demand as well as a Easter falling in the first week of April and a lot of the sales hitting in March.
Recent meetings that I had in fact as recently as yesterday and the day before with several national retailers, there continues to be just cautious optimism on these guys' behalf, that the consumer is not - the consumer is still buying mostly out of need today and mostly looking to buy necessity goods, which fits well for our particular portfolio. So they're not coming back in herds, but they are coming back. They have pent up demand. The economy seems to be stabilizing and growing again, confidence is increasing, although unemployment figures are still not where people would like to be with the housing sector, but the retailers I talk to are cautiously optimistic.
It's very interesting, again, the lack of new product, the guys that have survived this great recession, the solid retailers with good financial statements are sitting on very healthy earnings today. They've done an excellent job of downsizing their overhead and their costs and watching their margins and inventory control. They're in very good position today and some are very actually frustrated, not being able to find as many locations as they would like to fill.
I was with Shoe Carnival yesterday who was looking for 30 to 35 and only has 10 to 12 spots right now that they'd like to fill, again, sitting on a lot of cash and in position to grow. So I'm optimistic, cautiously so, but I think there will be good, steady growth this year and I've not - again, I've not studied April but I'm anxious to take a look at it.

We had originally 76 boxes to fill with our per rata share generally about 2 million square feet. We have successfully released over half of them. There were also eight or nine or so that were sold. We have seven under letter of intent. That leaves you with about 20 some odd that we are still working in the process and we've had various degrees of interest. But certainly this is the more difficult - the most difficult space in the portfolio. So there will - there will continue to be efforts on it but it may be longer term, more difficult to lease.
That said, to echo Rob's earlier point, there is an increasing amount of activity by retailers and some pent up frustration in terms of utilizing their cash and increasing their footprint, so over time if the economy continues to improve and their expansion plans can be met, these boxes can be filled. It will most likely result in lower leasing spreads, so there may be some headline continuation of lower - negative leasing spreads because - driven by these releases, but we recognize that's going to be part of the environment and would be more than happy to accept it and fill these but could be chronic vacancy.
But again, putting it all in context, Chris, I mean the 20 some odd boxes that are left represent for Kimco about - on a pro rata basis about 700,000 square feet. You put that in context of our overall portfolio, it's just not very impactful.

David, following back on your observations regarding Mexico, I think you know I've had a chance to see some of those assets very recently and clearly it's accurate to say there's a lot of population that's underserved but it's very different in its characteristics. I'm just wondering if you were to take, say, an asset like your Reynosa HEB anchored center and compare it to a similar center across the border in McAllen, what type of risk premiums are appropriate given that there are many fewer investors who might someday be willing to take you out of that asset and given the political and now crime related risk?

Now you're seeing that starting to reverse itself again. You're seeing investors begin to express interest in Latin America, both Mexico and Brazil being high on the - high on the charts. Myself, I believe given that every single lease has a full cost of living factor in it, including our anchors, including the fact that, for instance, every single one of our theaters has a substantial percentage rent provision on top of the CPIs, that that will begin to be very interesting for institutions to acquire these assets that are a much better inflation hedge than retail assets in the U.S.
The credit quality of what we have, as you know, our anchor tenant, our income from anchor tenants, I think it's 36%, something like that in Mexico, which is far higher than others. We have over 30 Wal-Mart leases in Mexico as an example, so I believe that as the market recovers, these centers will be in great demand. At the peak, they traded at cap rates of 8%. If you remember, there was several very large transactions in Monterey that traded at an 8. I am not sure I could give you a guess today what the cap rate would be, but it would be above that but I believe it's rapidly going to come back down.

I would like to begin by warmly congratulating both Glenn Cohen, our new Chief Financial Officer, and Barbara Pooley, our new Chief Administrative Officer. Both Glenn and Barb are key members of our senior management team and all of us at Kimco are proud to see them assume more responsibility under their new roles. Congratulations and well deserved Glenn and Barb.
I do believe it's worth noting and hopefully comforting to our shareholders that almost all of the senior leaderships have been with the company for many years. Glenn Cohen, 15 years; Mike Pappagallo, 13 years; Rob Nadler, 12 years; Bruce Rubenstein, 12 years, Scott Onufrey, 11 years; me, almost 10; and of course Milton, for awhile. I believe this shows stability and a very good working relationship among the senior team, which has continued during and despite the challenging times the past two years.
With respect to the quarter, our portfolio produced solid financial and operating results, with strengthening metrics and vital signs. Our national retailers, in particular, are cautiously optimistic, and have selectively resumed their expansion strategies.
In late May, at the ICSC convention, the environment was dramatically different than that of last year’s meeting. Many retailers were again seeking new store locations and beginning to be concerned about a decreasing supply of available location and virtually no new development projects.
While still a tenant market, the position of retail landlords is improving which should be reflected over time in our leasing spreads, same-store NOI, renewals and occupancy. Mike Pappagallo will give some additional insight on portfolio performance, but I would note there are still geographic differences in leasing activity and occupancy.
The New York metro area, our mid-Atlantic region, Puerto Rico and Canada continued to be very strong offsetting softness in Southern California, Florida, Arizona and Nevada. That said we've seen the pickup in activity even in these markets over the past few months. Overall, we feel very good about the signs of improvement in our portfolio and the underlying trends.
We also had a busy quarter in terms of our institutional and joint ventures. We have now closed three separate transactions in two separate joint ventures with BIG Shopping Centres, an Israeli public company, which owns and develops shopping centers in Israel. As part of their diversification strategy, we are pleased that they have selected Kimco as a primary operating partner to source, manage and lease US shopping center properties.
During the quarter, we also officially closed our joint venture with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, with an initial portfolio of five properties. We plan to add one additional property to the venture in the third quarter. We also added one property earlier in the quarter to our existing joint venture with Cisterra, an opportunity fund based in California.
As we have previously discussed, we remain committed to the institutional joint venture model as a source of capital and as a way to enhance earnings, compete for high quality retail assets, and achieve scale in terms of both operating costs and relationships with the retailers. We believe that the long-term recurring fees embedded in the joint ventures will provide a portion of our future earnings growth.
I would also like to provide the usual quarterly update on the four focus issues, company leverage, retail joint venture debt guarantees, placement of the PL Retail Assets in institutional joint ventures, and the disposition of the non-retail portfolio. Glenn will give more specifics, but our debt to EBITDA ratio stands at 6.4, well on our way to the 6.0 level promised by 2012.
On the retail joint venture guarantees, we are all very happy to report that the original $1.2 billion of retail institutional joint venture debt guaranteed by Kimco has now been reduced to zero. We continue to pledge that we will not provide Kimco parent bad debt guarantees as part of any future institutional joint venture.
With respect to the PL Retail portfolio, we have now placed seven assets representing approximately 60% of the portfolio NOI, in joint ventures with CPPIB and BIG. There are several other PL assets which may be part of a larger joint venture placement in the future.
On the fourth issue, the non-retail dispositions, we made modest progress during the quarter with the portfolio reduced by $44 million. There are approximately $50 million of other transactions pending which we hope to close in the third quarter. The promised timeframe remains 2 years to 4 years, but we will do everything prudent to accelerate this and the environment has become more favorable as investors become more aggressive buying all types of real estate assets.
At the end of the day, our future financial results will be determined by our retail portfolio of more than 900 properties and related retail investments, which together represent 92% of our balance sheet assets. The diversity, granularity and stability of our retail portfolio is second to none and we believe that the income from our 14,000 leases provides a very solid platform for reliable dividend payments, cash flow and opportunistic retail acquisitions.
To that end and to reinforce Kimco's strategic focus, we are hosting an Investor Day on September 23 on Long Island, at which time we will provide a deeper perspective on our strategy, our asset base and our management bench strength.
Now I would like to turn it over to our new Chief Financial Officer, Glenn Cohen.

Before I review the second quarter operating results I want to take a moment to thank Milton, Dave, the rest of the Board, and Mike Pappagallo for the opportunity to serve as Kimco’s CFO. I am honored by the confidence they have placed in my ability to assume guidance of our financial strategy, as Mike focuses on the operating strategy. It's an incredible team to be a part of and I am enthusiastic about our prospects ahead.
Over my 15 years at Kimco, 13 of which have been as Treasurer and most recently Chief Accounting Officer, I have established many wonderful relationships in the banking and capital markets arena. I look forward to meeting with many of you on the call today, in the analyst and investment community in the coming weeks. I also want to congratulate Barbara Pooley on her appointment to Chief Administrative Officer.
And now to the quarterly results; the second quarter results can best be characterized as further signs of stability and positive momentum. While headline FFO per share was $0.26, this includes $19.9 million or $0.05 of non-cash impairment charges, primarily related to the transfer of assets from our existing joint venture programs to newly formed joint ventures.
There was nonrecurring income as well, totaling $10.5 million, or roughly $0.03, primarily attributable to the monetization of non-retail assets, as well as acquisition fees in connection with the formation of the new joint ventures. Excluding both impairments and transactions, FFO per share from recurring sources is $0.28, which exceeds consensus by $0.01.
We are encouraged by the improvements shown in US same property net operating income, which was positive this quarter at 2.1% year-over-year, and continued success on the occupancy and leasing fronts. June occupancy for Kimco’s combined portfolios was 92.7%, which is calculated based on Kimco’s pro rata interest in our properties and represents a 40 basis point increase from June 2009, while 10 basis points down from last quarter.
However, in looking at occupancy of Kimco’s combined portfolios without regard to percentage ownership, occupancy increased by 20 basis points from March. The difference between the gross occupancy and pro rata occupancies reflect the change in percentage ownerships on certain assets that were put into new joint ventures with the Canadian pension plan and BIG Shopping Centre joint ventures that Dave mentioned earlier. Mike will provide further insight on the performance of our operating properties momentarily.
With regard to balance sheet management, we continue our focus on coverage metrics and liquidity position. Our fixed charge coverage stands at 2.4 times, and net debt to EBITDA has improved to 6.4 times from 6.8 times at year end. We are on track to achieve our stated goal of 6.5 times by the end of 2010 and six times by the end of 2012.
Our absolute debt level is lower by $265 million as compared to March 31, resulting from the transfer of three former encumbered PL Retail Assets to the new CPP joint venture, and the repayment of $62 million of other maturing debt.
During the quarter, we completed the refinancing of our 150 million Canadian denominated bond, which matured in April, with a new Canadian denominated 150 million eight-year bond at 5.99%. We have approximately $50 million of consolidated debt maturing for the balance of the year and less than $400 million for 2011.
Our debt maturity profile is well staggered through 2019, and with approximately $1.6 billion of immediate liquidity, we are in excellent shape. We are pleased with the success of our refinancing objectives in the joint venture programs as well. Year-to-date, we have closed on over 95 million of nonrecourse mortgages and have signed term sheets for another $65 million, which we are in the process of closing.
The largest portion of the joint venture debt maturing in 2010 was the guaranteed PK sale facility. The remaining $287.5 million was repaid in full yesterday with our partner providing 85% of the requirement. Joint venture debt maturities remaining for the balance of the 2010 are approximately $120 million. As I just stated, we have term sheets for more than half already.
We continued to make progress on disposition of nonretail assets with $44 million disposed of since the end of the first quarter and $52 million year-to-date. We are actively marketing certain of the urban mixed use assets and have signed leases with prominent retailers at three of the New York City assets, which will enhance their marketability.
As a result of the positive performance for the first six months, we are increasing our FFO guidance before impairments to a range $1.14 to $1.18 per diluted share, an increase of $0.04 from the low end.
And with that I will turn it back over to Mike.

See, that part was easy, but now you're going to have to answer the questions as well. I would like to mention that Glenn has successfully raised over $12 billion of capital for Kimco and our joint venture programs over the past 15 years, while also directing the company's accounting and public reporting requirements. That has been no small task.
Along with Glenn, kudos are in order for Barbara Pooley who, in three short years at Kimco has assumed the leadership of a wide gamut of corporate responsibilities, as well as all property-level planning and administration activity capitalizing on her deep background in public accounting and human resources, in addition to IR. They both have been particularly supportive of me over the years, and I look forward to even better things from them.
So, now that I'm batting third in the speaking order, I can't help but analogize the characteristics of a number three batter to what the operating side of the shopping center business must possess, the best balance of contact and power hitting skills. And I'm very fortunate that my real estate operating team has continued to hit for both average and power, continuing to fill space in an uncertain economic climate, while seeking new business opportunities in their territories.
Focusing first on the US portfolio; our gross occupancy, that’s without regard to ownership percentage, increased by 30 basis points to 92.4% from March and by 50 basis points from one year ago on the strength of net absorption. The positive trend was reflected in the increase in US same-site net operating income of 2.1% for the quarter. That increase was driven by good old fashion revenue growth, including the impact from rents from new leases, including a Ross stores at our Westlake property, a new giant supermarket in Timonuim, Maryland, and a Harris Teeter at the Saint Andrews Center in Charleston, South Carolina.
Leasing velocity has also been a bright spot. New lease signings totaled 215 deals for over 1.3 million square feet. That's the sixth consecutive quarterly increase in both number of deals and square footage. New lease square footage exceeded vacated square footage for the fourth consecutive quarter. Deals are being made with junior and big box demand leading the way, including new signs with TJ Maxx, HomeGoods and Ross.
But price points have changed that’s evident by where leasing spreads have trended over the past year. New leases signed on comparable space for the past 12 months have dropped by 4.5%. Excluding the former Linens and Circuit boxes and the number is slightly positive at 1.1%.
On renewals, rollover pricing in our portfolio over the past 12 months has averaged about 7% down, which has effectively countered a similar percentage increase from option exercises, thereby resulting in an overall flat impact in spreads on retention.
During the last quarter, two-thirds of the renewal spreads were positive, but the overall statistic was skewed by a few leases in the junior box category, including a couple of deals in which we agreed to a one-year extension at a lower rate as we have positioned a space for potential redevelopment or new tenants.
While leasing spread data gets a lot of airtime when it is used as a lens into the current pricing for space we also like to focus on the opportunity from the vacant space. By one measure, vacant space in the US portfolio alone represents about $70 million in lost space rent. No one is predicting the day of 100% occupancy, but it does underscore the potential upside that remains within the confines of the existing asset base.
Moving beyond the numbers and onto the ground; despite a very fickle and ambivalent consumer, as evidenced by May and June comp store sales figures, retailers are generating solid profits. Our national and regional retailers are producing strong earnings in an economic environment of higher unemployment and uncertainty. The larger retailers’ balance sheets and liquidity positions are in good shape.
Our conversations and meetings with retailers at ICSC in May were focused on growth opportunities and expansion plans. A common theme was concern from retailers on how their pipeline for future growth will be still without new construction and development. Also, national chains such as Ross are entering new markets, including Chicago, St. Louis and Kansas City.
Regional chains such as hhgregg are expanding their geographic reach to areas such as the mid-Atlantic, Pennsylvania and Chicago. With virtually no new development we are seeing an increase in flexibility and format, and prototypes to take advantage of the available second generation space. For example, Kohl's has unveiled a 60,000 square foot format, and Sports Authority has introduced a 12,000 square foot concept named SA Elite to focus on high-end, higher margin products.
Petco has developed and is expanding their Petco Unleashed concept, a 4,000 square foot store merchandising higher margin pet supplies. Dollar Tree is rolling out their Dollar Stop concept, a 4,000 square foot Dollar concept aimed at filling gaps in densely populated markets.
Outside of the US, our Canadian portfolio remains as strong as ever with high occupancy first-class tenancies and stable income. We are also excited about the recent announcement of Marshall's plans into Canada, reinforcing the attractiveness of the Canadian marketplace to first class retailers. Inside the Kimco portfolio, we converted a preferred equity position into a pari passu interest on a 12 property portfolio, currently owned with Anthem properties, our largest preferred equity partner.
The result is now a two-thirds ownership interest in this grocery-anchored portfolio and whose operating results can now be reported similar to our other straight joint venture holdings such as RioCan, meaning an improved and more visible FFO profile.
In Mexico, leasing continues to pick up across the portfolio with over 300 new leases signed during the first half of 2010. We continue to focus on the lease-up of the Mexico development projects, on which construction is virtually complete. At our largest project, La Ciudadela in Guadalajara, the Best Buy is scheduled to open in August, which will also trigger the opening of 30 additional tenants that have already undersigned leases.
Our Latin America business leader, Mike Melson, is in Mexico this week, currently meeting with Liverpool, Cinepolis, which is Mexico's largest theater chain, and several other retailers to finalize anchor leases at projects in Nuevo Laredo, Cuautla, and Guadalajara. While drug violence in the border cities continues to have an impact, the US and Mexican retailers are still focused on growth opportunity. Most recently, Bed Bath & Beyond, Lowe's, Target, and Best Buy have announced future expansion plans.
We continue to believe in the long-term value proposition for shopping center investment in Mexico. As important for us to operate effectively with the realities of today, we are also focusing on a strategy to address the realities of the future.
At our Investor Day, we will give you a more in-depth perspective of the asset base and strategies, but allow me to offer a few basic observations. Over 50% of the net operating income generated from the 453 consolidated shopping center assets in the US comes from about 90 properties. Add the next 50 properties and the proportion of NOI jumps to two-thirds of the total. This has precipitated a closer look at the smaller, less impactful assets focusing on size, location, growth potential, economies of scale and so on.
With our regional leaders, we are actively formulating a recycling strategy of assets, both shorter and longer term to generate capital for redevelopment and new shopping center opportunities. We define our core business as the ownership of shopping center assets either for our own account or jointly with our investment partners. It is a primary goal to maintain and increase that portfolio value.
We can’t control interest rates. We can pursue an asset by asset strategy that focuses on retaining the best tenants, investing capital to attract new tenants, positioning for future redevelopment opportunities, and pursuing all forms of ancillary income and expense reduction, all focused on increasing operating cash flow.
And now for some final thoughts, I will turn it over to Milton.

I, too, would like to add my congratulations and thanks to Barbara and Glenn. They have been terrific. Now, this is not an easy time for the consumer with double-digit unemployment that is forecasted to continue for several times.
On a relative basis, our tenant base is well positioned to meet the challenges facing the economy. Our tenants consist predominantly of stores selling essential items or catering to the consumer who is tending to trade down, and these stores are increasing their share of retail sales.
In general, retailers have had excellent earnings results, and their balance sheets are strong. In addition, the demographics of our portfolio are strong and very, very much underestimated. I would suggest everyone to visit our Web site to review the statistics of demography.
In the current environment of relatively low interest rates, it is my view that hard assets with safe, stable cash flows will increase in value, sending cap rates lower.
Our entire management team is in harmony to be the premiere owner and operator of shopping centers and to dispose, as expeditiously as possible, our non-retail assets. Simply put, our strategy is to deliver a stable, safe, and growing cash flow and continue to enhance the value of our shopping center portfolio.
And with that, we are all delighted to answer any questions you may have.

But as we’ve said before, development generally is going to follow the rooftops. And retailers, I think at this point are still very focused on surer bets, and surer bets are going to be for the most part the more infiller established markets, which in turn is going to mean that they are going more focused on existing space than brand new development.

Most of the under development assets, as we have talked about, is Mexico and we have seen a gradual pickup in the leasing pace there. I mentioned earlier in my prepared remarks about certain anchor activity that is happening, and what will naturally follow that will be the small stores. So that pickup is continuing and we feel comfortable about the stabilization dates that we have put forth in the supplemental report.
On the US side, there are still handful of properties that are completed but are still approaching stabilization, and there leasing continues to be relatively slow and gradual pickup, at least within the short term I don't expect a material pickup in occupancy in those centers.

So our discussions with both our existing tenants and potential tenants are much more favorable than this time last year in these stronger markets. As the economy continues to recover even in the softer markets, we hope to follow that same pattern.
So as we have these portfolio reviews, particularly with the national retailers, I think one thing that didn’t come out is while our national retailers are definitely playing more offense, the mom and pops in general continue to have a difficult time, and we see that across all geographic regions. So we are hoping that the positive trends continue that our different regions have more success growing rents and growing occupancy. And clearly, the stronger regions are where we would like to add properties, if we can buy them right. By the same token, we don't want to overpay just because something is in a strong market.

One if you go back to April of last year when we really focused on the - and bucketized, if you will, the non-retail assets, we have sold about $163 million. Granted, we disposed of the easiest ones first, which were some of our securities and marketable securities and things like that, but we've always said from the very beginning, three years to five years, then two years to four years as time has gone on. So there's a disciplined approach to this.
And as most people know this non-retail portfolio has four components. It has the Valad note, which is fully current at 9.5%. It’s a big receivable, it has a stated maturity. So you can figure out exactly when that will need to be paid back. We have our InTown Suite assets, which is a joint venture with a Canadian pension fund. It has some debt attached to it. It is fully earning and earning a double digit FFO return to us at this point as RevPAR increases. That's a little more difficult to market when you have a joint venture partner.
The third piece is a very large number of small preferred equity investments. Each of those investments we have a partner and in many cases, we have a lender, very difficult to unwind those things except over time. Fourth, we have, what we call our, urban portfolio. That is where we are having some success and we will have more success over the balance sheet of this year. This quarter, I believe we sold two large assets in Boston and we have targeted others. As I said in my remarks, we’ve identified a good $50 million of transactions that should happen over the next 90 days to 120 days.
The measured pace will definitely continue. We do have plans for each asset. We are trying to accelerate those plans. We are committed to accelerating those plans. But again, we are not going to do anything dumb either.

As a management team, we are very pleased with our third quarter results and we believe that they represent solid and steady progress on our strategic goals and financial objectives. At the risk of repeating some of",909,"Good morning. Thank you for calling in. As a management team, we are very pleased with our third quarter results and we believe that they represent solid and steady progress on our strategic goals and financial objectives. At the risk of repeating some of the highlights from our recent Investor Day, I’d like to provide an update on key issues we have repeatedly identified and discussed on previous earnings call.
Overall, and most importantly, we are very pleased with the improving metrics of our large portfolio of neighborhood and community shopping centers. Mike will provide a detailed discussion, but we continue to be encouraged by the increasing leasing activity of national retailers of all types.
With virtually no new retail development activity, national retailers with significant expansion plans are beginning to be concerned about achieving targeted store counts in 2011 and 2012. This is helping to absorb vacant space and obtain improved lease terms for us.
While the economy remains fragile and uncertain, we are seeing many tangible signs of improvement in most markets. In addition, prices for quality retail properties continued to increase with the favorable corresponding impact on our net asset value.
Next, we are significantly ahead of schedule on achieving our targeted leverage levels and strengthening our balance sheet. Glenn will provide further details, but our net debt to EBITDA ratio has now declined from 8.1 at the beginning of 2009 to 6.2 today. We’ve remained committed to a further reduction to 6.0 or below by the end of 2012.
Third, we have completely eliminated the corporate debt guarantees related to our U.S. institutional retail joint ventures. These guarantees totaled $694 million at the beginning of 2009 and were a significant concern to the analyst community at the time.
Fourth, we have successfully placed many of the retail assets purchased from two of our joint venture partners over the past 18 months into new institutional joint ventures at prices equal to or exceeding the purchase prices we paid for the properties.
We believe we accomplished a win-win situation by matching institutions that needed to reduce their retail real estate investments with institutions seeking to make new investments in our sector. These new institutional joint venture partners such as CPP, BIG and Cisterra have proven to be good partners and are looking to grow aggressively in the U.S.
With respect to our non-retail portfolio, which now represents less than 8% of our total assets, dispositions will continue to be measured but accelerated where possible over the next several years. Since the beginning of 2009, our non-retail portfolio has been reduced from $1 billion to $848 million to-date. An additional $70 million of non-retail properties and securities are scheduled to be sold or repaid in the fourth quarter.
In addition, our joint venture partners in our largest non-retail investment, the InTown Suites extended state portfolio, have now collectively agreed to formally market the portfolio. With year-over-year significant RevPAR increases and increasing interest by investors for hotel properties, we are cautiously optimistic about the sales process.
On the international front, Canada continues to be a bright star. We fully agree with all of the recent analyst accolades about the Canadian economy and the Canadian retail market.
We respectfully note that Kimco now has ownership interest including preferred equity investments in 115 Canadian retail properties aggregating 6.3 million square feet, all in various partnerships with highly regarded public or private Canadian companies including RioCan, Anthem Properties, Plazacorp and (inaudible).
During the quarter, we converted our largest retail development project in Canada, (inaudible) into a long-term joint venture with Sun Life and our local development partner Center Corp. [ph]. The project is a recently completed high-quality grocery-anchored power center in Montreal, with Sobey’s, Zellers, Toys R’Us, Future Shop and other big box anchors.
A second phase of 400,000 square feet of this signature project will be developed over time. Looking at Mexico, despite the headline of drug violence, the Mexican economy is growing sharply again, with GDP growth of 4.5% estimated for 2010, 630 new jobs added this year and a 5.7% unemployment rate.
One of the key drivers of our expected FFO growth in 2011 and 2012 remains the lease up of many of our recently completed development projects in Mexico. Since the beginning of this year, Mexico team has signed 352 leases, aggregating 540,000 square feet.
Signature leases in 2010 include
Best Buy, Cinepolis, Cinemex and Copell. As the 12th largest economy in the world, retail space per capita are less than 10% of the U.S. Strong expansion plans by Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Best Buy and Lowe’s and a full cost of living escalation on all leases, we remain confident that Mexico will deliver strong returns.
Overall, Kimco is well poised as we enter 2011. Our increased fourth quarter earnings guidance together with our initial 2011 estimates and increased dividend show the underlying strength of the Kimco retail portfolio.
Expected growth in our U.S. shopping centers from occupancy increases, re-tenanting below-market leases and redevelopment programs combined with the incremental earnings from our strong Canadian portfolio, Mexico development lease-up and long-term recurring investment management fees, altogether place us in a good position to deliver solid future results.
Now, I’d like to turn it over Glen for a detailed review of our quarterly financial results and later, Mike Pappagallo will talk in-depth on our property operations and strategic initiatives. Milton will close with his perspective on retail rents and tenant profiles.

At our Investor Day in late September, we described Kimco’s key objectives as we move forward. Objectives that are focused on the ownership and operation of shopping centers, primarily in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico; the continued lease up and value creation at the centers and the growth of their associated recurring clubs; the disposition of our nonretail assets as expeditious as practical; the recycling of retail properties which do not meet our strategic objectives and all while continuing to focus on balance sheet strength and leverage reduction.
Embedded in our third quarter results on many of the components I have just described, let me give you some specifics. First, let’s start with headline FFO. Reported third quarter FFO per share was $0.27, a penny above consensus, which includes a $0.03 charge or approximately $11 million associated with the early extinguishment of approximately $400 million of debt, which was scheduled to mature during 2011 through 2013.
Also included was nonrecurring income of approximately $7 million, primarily related to equity kickers received from the monetization of several Canadian preferred equity investments. Excluding the early extinguishment of debt charges and the nonrecurring other transactions FFO per share from the current sources is $0.28.
Our U.S. shopping center portfolio continues to be resilient. September occupancy for Kimco’s combined portfolio calculated on Kimco’s pro rata interest on our properties was 92.7%, the 30 basis point increase from September ‘09 and flat the last quarter.
Without regard to percentage ownership, occupancy increased by 50 basis points from last year and 10 basis points from June. Mike will provide further insight on the performance of our operating properties in just a moment.
Dispositions of nonretail assets included two nonretail preferred equity investments and our interest in the Hyatt Cancun to our partner Westmont. In addition, we have signed contracts with five urban assets totaling over $45 million which we anticipate closing by year end and we also expect to monetize another $35 million of other nonretail assets in the near term. We are committed to the disposition of these assets.
During the third quarter, we sold five nonstrategic retail assets for $98 million and recycled that capital with our investment in the Riverplace Shopping Center in Jacksonville, Florida. We will continue to evaluate the appropriate timing for the marketing of each nonstrategic asset and continue our prudent pursuit of acquisition opportunities.
As for balance sheet management, we have further strengthened the balance sheet and reduced debt levels for the successful issuance of $175 million perpetual preferred stock offering at 6.9%. We used the proceeds to repay $166 million of mortgage debt was scheduled to mature over the next several years.
In addition, we exercised our make-whole provision and retired $275 million of unsecured bonds with proceeds from the new 4.37% $300 million, seven and a half year bond which describes the treasury plus 240. Although we incurred a onetime charge of approximately $11 million, we have reduced our recurring interest expense by over $6 million annually and further enhanced our maturity profile.
Since the beginning of the year we have reduced our absolute consolidated debt level by almost $400 million and just over $4 billion. We have improved our net debt-to-EBITDA at the 6.2 times, by way of reference it was 6.8 times at the beginning of the year and we are clearly ahead of schedule to meet our stated objective about six times net debt to EBITDA by the end of 2012.
Our liquidity position is in excellent shape with over $1.5 billion of availability on our lines and only $110 million of maturities due in 2011. We remain focused on continuing to strengthen our balance sheet.
In light of our improved metrics, strong access to capital and solid liquidity position, Moody’s revised its outlook to stable and Fitch initiated coverage of our unsecured debt at BBB+ with a stable outlook. We now have high BBB ratings from each of the rating agencies.
We’ve had continued success in refinancing and maturing debt in the joint venture programs. We have closed on over $165 million of non-recourse mortgages this year and have term sheets another $30 million. The largest portion of joint venture debt maturing in 2010 was the guaranteed $287.5 million PK Sale facility which was repaid in full in July with our partners providing 85% of the funding requirement.
Based on the solid performance so far this year, we are increasing our 2010 FFO guidance before impairments to a range of $1.17 to $1.19 for the full year from a range of $1.14 to $1.18 previously. The recurrent component of this guidance range is $1.11 to $1.13.
Now, although we have not finalized the bottom of property-by-property budget process, we want to provide some insight into our view for 2011. We’re providing preliminary FFO per share guidance of $1.17 to $1.21. This guidance range does not include impairments or any transactional activity. This guidance range is based strictly on recurring flows.
Using the midpoint for the recurring guidance for 2010 and the midpoint for 2011, gives a forecasted increase of recurring FFO per share of over 6%. This forecast, along with our projected capital plan requires no new applicant.
Last but certainly not least, as a result of the 2010 improved performance and continued progress expected during 2011, our Board of Directors has approved an increase in the quarterly dividend of $0.02, at $0.18 per quarter, with the first payment of the increased level to be paid January 2011.
This increase is in line with our forecasted FFO per share growth while leaving the FFO payout ratio at a conservative level of just over 60%.
With that, I will turn is over to Mike.

As we head towards the important holiday season, we see a continuation of the leasing and operating environment that has characterized much of the past year, one of slowly improving fundamentals, improving financial results and liquidity for many retailers and the pursuit of second and third generation space by those retailers driven by the lack of new supply.
Now, in regards to Kimco’s recent portfolio performance, as Glenn mentioned, our overall occupancy levels increased by 10 basis points to 92.9% from June and by 50 basis points from last September on a gross basis, and on pro rata basis, occupancy was flat from June at 92.7 and up 30 basis points from last September.
In the U.S. portfolio, the story was similar. We experienced a 10 basis point improvement in net absorptions since June and those gains were offset by the inclusion of three former development projects still in the lease-up phase in the numbers resulting in a flat occupancy at 92.3%.
Our quarterly occupancy numbers have had a little noise in them now for a past couple of quarters since we’re converting former development properties to long-term hold properties once construction is complete and a year has passed regardless of whether they reach a stabilized occupancy of 90% or more.
In the U.S., we still have two former development projects which are about 70% leased, which are not yet included in occupancy. These properties will be included in occupancy by year end 2010.
The drivers of the positive net absorption of 10 basis points this quarter was once again driven by the healthy growing retailers in the junior box side, such as our first Ross lease in the Chicago market in Nashville [ph], Illinois, new deals with both the AJ Wright, a division of TJX Companies in Southern California and in Tampa, a 50,000 square foot Hobby Lobby deal to take over a theater path that’s been vacant for over three years.
The story on leasing velocity and spreads also underlines a gradual improvement in conditions in our market as the overall combined spreads increased by 1.5%. This increase was importantly driven by the positive spread on lease renewals of 2.9%. The best result in that category little over a year.
The second quarter of positive same-store operating income of 2.2% is another good sign. As in the prior quarter, the primary driver of this increase was net new leasing in rental revenues.
We also saw lower charges for bad debt, which accounted by about 40 basis points of the increase.
Of note, much of the vacancy fallout from the Linens, Circuit City and Value City bankruptcies have been substantially addressed. Only six of the original 67 boxes from those retailers have not been spoken for. To-date, we’ve seen virtually no impact on Blockbuster bankruptcy filing on our portfolio, and only three of the roughly 40 somewhat leases in the U.S. portfolio have been rejected so far.
Later on top of that is a very solid sales increases and profit reports from many of our primary tenant, particularly the discounters and there’s legitimate reason for optimism, and you probably saw some of the sales comps this morning with Target up 1.7%, Costco up 3%, (inaudible) Gas sales, and also Ross up 4% and TJX up 1% with the latter two having very tough comps from last year.
All that said, we remain cautious; the economic recovery is still not at a level to reduce unemployment and small business growth is still tough sledding. While less than 15% of our portfolio is comprised of moms and pops, most of the activity in that segment has been a push in terms of new leases in decade. Certainly, better than the severe fallout from the recession, but in my view, an area that will take more time to recover.
I fully appreciate the markets interest in the quarterly results and the standard portfolio metrics and we are certainly all encouraged by the change in trend lines from the dull base of 2009.
That said the shopping center business more than most sectors is better suited for marathon runners not sprinters. That leads to asking what portfolio strategies we must embrace to improve occupancy, grow rental revenue, improve operating margins and position Kimco from value creation opportunities while managing risk.
As we assess last quarter and again at our Investor Day our first step is to delineate those assets that support that strategy, primarily based on their market position, demographic traits, tenant base and rental profile. We have provided a detailed analysis of over 650 U.S. properties that fit into this strategic profile and have continued with disclosure of our quarterly supplement.
There are roughly 150 assets in the portfolio that do not meet that profile or targeted for disposition. It represent only about 11% of the pro rata share of our annual rent, these nonstrategic assets have markedly different characteristics in our strategic core.
For example, they have an occupancy rate of 86% versus 93%, a third lower average population and 10% lower medium household income. The strategic portfolio generates about two-thirds of its rent from the top 20 MSAs in Puerto Rico with demos generally higher than the local market average.
In addition to the five non-strategic assets Kimco sold this quarter, we’ve disposed of two additional small positions in October and have six more sites under contract for a total price of about $38 million. Further, we have about 15 additional sites in the market and are targeting to take another 30 sites out before the year end. So while we’re aggressively pursuing those actions in the U.S. portfolio, our Latin American team is focused on a more specific content, that being leasing.
Dave mentioned a few of the larger deals recently completed and the business plan requires success for both box and small store tenants and we have full core press on it.
In addition to the 70 Kimco asset relationship managers overseeing the process, there are over 70 leasing resources from both our local operating partners and external brokers focused on the leasing effort in Mexico. We have also brought together our key leasing associates in the U.S. with our Kimco Latin America team to share best practices.
Leasing and asset recycling will be an important part of the 2011 portfolio strategy. We will also remain focused on redevelopment and complex re-tenanting strategies for which we’ve provided some additional disclosure in the financial supplement.
We also expect to capture some upside from rollover of below-market rent. In the perfect world, these opportunities for organic growth and the significant proportion of existing cash flow is coming from centers in better markets, would be reflected in the implied cap rate underlying our market valuation, but it doesn’t appear to be the case on a relative basis. It will be our job to deliver the results that shine the light on that imbalance.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Milton.

I yearn Kimco to get back the magic of our healthy young days when we enjoyed the highest multiple and our mantra was under-promise and over-perform, and I believe we’re on our way back. Our strategy is simple and our entire team is focused and passionate to execute it. We must monetize expeditiously as possible on non-retail assets and also monetize single shopping centers that are not within our core markets.
My sense of the markets is that our timing is good and pricing will be favorable. We will apply the proceeds to further lowering leverage and growing our shopping center business. Now, our portfolio has the advantage of contract rents that are below market. The safest return is from rents that are below market. Safety is also enhanced when a retailer has a large investment in the space and not the landlord with it. Wherever possible we prefer the retailer to fund improvements in the space.
By the way illustration, the retail with the largest amount of square footage in our portfolio is Home Depot. Of the 41 leases with Home Depot, all but three ground leases. Home Depot leases our land and built the building with its own funds. We preferred to lease space as is and have the tenant fund its own improvements. I believe as is rent deserves the lower cap rate compared to a higher rent resulting from the landlord financing tenant improvements to the retailer.
The investment to tenant improvement money on behalf of the retailer is tented out to a mezzanine loan to the retailer. Now, shopping centers with cash flows from long-term strong credit lease are in my opinion a mispriced asset. The cap rates Wal-Mart, Target, Costco, TJX etc., have a spread that is too large compared to the yield on their long-term bonds.
In the long range, inflation protection and tax shelter from the real estate should partially offset the advantage of the liquidity in the bonds. Our portfolio has opportunities to create substantial additional value and to grow our per share cash flow. Now, next November, we are going to celebrate the 20th anniversary of our initial public offering. We must say the magic is back and my yearnings will be satisfied.
With that, I’ll turn it over to Dave Bujnicki.

So as I mentioned, we are cautiously optimistic that this will be met with good demand. It has taken us a while to get all the partners to agree to put this out on the market. There was a debate particularly last year that the timing was not right, but we believe the timing is right now.

Note that there is significant number of below-market leases and we are going to have on a quarter-by-quarter basis a variety of reported result because they are going to be leases that are going to come on stream or turnover that are going to have significant upside.
If you refer back to the Investor Day you will see some examples of leases that are burning off over the next two or three years that are going to have a significant upside to them. Putting aside those, the rent market relatively speaking is still tepid and it’s still going to be a tough stretch over the next few years. So you are going to see ups and downs relative to leasing spreads and that’s why I suggested that for 2011 on a net basis we will probably be up but on a relatively low single-digit basis.

Consumer spending is choppy as we’ve all talked about and there’s uncertainty. But when you look at the earnings, they are very solid and sales comps are positive. They are not illustrating a robust recovery, but the list of retailers today looking to open locations is much greater than the list that’s not expanding. In fact, interestingly, CoStar; I saw a report that they had five straight quarters of positive absorption in the top 60 markets. So, we’re clearly heading in the right direction as an industry.

Rob actually just got back from Chicago ICSC. So, Rob, maybe you could provide some very current perspective on the dialogue.

The Chicago show was held last week and we had numerous, of course, one-on-one meetings with most of the national retailers that were in attendance. As I said before, the news really is positive. I mean there is very little to almost none. I would say, there was no conversations about rent reductions or health. In fact, as stated earlier, a lot of these guys are concerned with the lack of development as to how they’re going to fill their pipelines going forward 2012 and beyond without new development, which is really music to our ears. It really gives us a great opportunity to backfill existing space and well located shopping centers.
In terms of a few things that are new, JCPenney is opening up 5,000 square foot big and tall menswear stores, we’re in lease on a location in Dallas that should get signed and Home Depot is experimenting with a 12,000 square foot to 15,000 square foot concept of designer goods, sort of the bestsellers out of their former Expo concept. What you’re seeing is a lot of national change that are expanding into new markets. Ross is opening up in Chicago, Dick’s is going to Oklahoma City, DD’s who are under a lease in Houston which will be a new market for DD’s which is a Ross concept.
Additionally, you’re seeing regional chains expanding into new areas, H.H. Gregg also coming to Chicago, which is a new area for them, expanding into Pennsylvania which is new for them; Gordman’s out of Omaha is coming into Chicago with 50,000 square foot stores and you’re also seeing quite a few chains making deals in smaller markets today, TJ Maxx informs us that they’re looking at several small markets in the Southeast as is Jo-Ann and Kohl’s is doing a smaller concept in smaller markets.
So, even Home Furnishings, in meeting one of the leading consultants for Home Furnishings, they are also starting to look at new opportunities. That’s being driven by both less competition as well as the available space and economic that are in the market today. There is a 30,000 square foot tenant, I can’t name right now, but looking at Cincinnati that come in with five or six stores. So we’re even starting to see home furnishings starting to peak around now for expansion opportunities.

So, all of those factors combined to indicate to us that development is still of long, long thought.

The first mortgage piece is an assumable with (inaudible), the second is not in general.

You can probably guess where some of the interest is already coming from, other hotel operators and some of them again owned by private equity or opportunity funds. Extended stay as a statement is doing very well right now and people are looking at buying something like InTown at way below replacement cost and you have an existing organization structure. So, if you want to bet on the economy recovering strongly, it’s a wonderful inflation hedge, we set our rates weekly and so forth. So, we think the timing may be good and the demand may be good, but we’ll know more next quarter.

So, of course, the inventory is less that they have to look at.
Secondly, they are going to have to be a little more aggressive in the rents that they are going to pay which is good for us. All of us landlords got clobbered 12 months ago, and now there is a little more leverage, and they can’t get quite a bargain. So, if I was a retail analyst, I would build in the fact that they are not going to get as much the concessions out of the landlord as they did a year ago.

So, we factored that into the mix as well, it’s not a clearly old enough area for retail expansion. But you just look at how much the world has changed. A year and a half ago, all these retailers were having their acquisition people read their leases and looking for ways to get out of leases or get more concession. Now, it’s completely reverse, where am I going to get my store count for 2011? I can’t quite get the same bargain I was getting 12 months ago.

As a management team, we had a strong consensus. What we have to do is prove the case for Mexico, and the best way we can prove the case is to get all these new properties that have come on stream within the last six months lease, deliver the projected returns, deliver those cost of living increases that I keep bragging about that are embedded in all our leases. We still feel very good that 40% or so of the income is coming from these anchor tenants, all of which have cost of living. We have many, many ground leases with Wal-Mart and Home Depot and other in Mexico. It should do well, and we are now seeing some increasing demand from retailers. So, we hope to fill in those spaces, and then perhaps would be a little more aggrieve.
To answer your second question, we would definitely build to a much higher unleveraged return today than we did a couple years ago, to account for things that we’ve experienced. One, the currency volatility, I mean, we were very depressed this time last year when the peso went to 16, we’re little happier now that it’s 12.5. It’s certainly the currency volatility in Mexico is so rich. The drug violence remains an open issue to some extent. So, you want to build in a higher return to the extent we increase our bet. But long-term we still feel very, very good is for 100 million people there is less than 1,000 quality centers in that country. There is a reason Wal-Mart wants to open up 300 more stores in Mexico.
