In add",316,"Thank you, Christian, and good afternoon, everybody. I would like to welcome you to our Q4 and Full Year 2009 Results Conference Call. The objective of this call is to review our solid earnings performance in '09, and focus on our outlook for 2010. In addition to growing earnings last year, we generated a record amount of operating cash flow and made meaningful progress towards advancing our pipeline. We, amongst our peer group of companies are in a unique position of having several regulatory and clinical catalysts ahead of us in the new year. To discuss each of these topics in detail, I'm joined today by Kevin Sharer, our Chairman and CEO; Kevin will provide a strategic outlook for our business followed by our CFO, Robert Bradway; who will discuss our results for 2009 and provide expected growth outlook for 2010. George Morrow, who as you know is our Head of Global Commercial Operations; will then discuss our product performance during the last quarter and offer some thoughts on launching Prolia™. And then our head of R&D, Roger Perlmutter; will provide a regulatory update, including progress on denosumab registrational programs, as well as a pipeline update on our Phase III products in particular.We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website and a link was sent to you separately by e-mail. I would like to remind you that our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement. What that means in summary is that through the course of our presentation today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results could vary materially. We will use non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. These non-GAAP figures have been reconciled with GAAP figures and the press release that we sent earlier. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Kevin."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we reflect on 2009, I'd like to make a few comments. First, the macroeconomic environment was the most challenging we have seen in our 30-year history. While no one can be fully-satisfied with the revenue decline, even a modest one, coming within a percent of the low end of our original revenue guidance in this environment was admirable.We once again meaningfully grew earnings per share and over the most recent five-year period, which includes the ESA business reset, we've grown earnings per share at a 15% compound annual growth rate, a very solid performance. We advanced the pipeline meaningfully in 2009, highlighted by a recommendation for Prolia™ approval in Europe, and a 15 to zero FDA advisory panel vote to recommend approval in the United States.We also managed the expenses and cash effectively as Arvind mentioned, and generated over $6 billion in operating cash flow to invest in growing the business and returning cash to shareholders. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues at Amgen for their tireless efforts in 2009 on behalf of patients and shareholders.Let's now turn to the current year 2010. 2010 is an important year. First, we will learn the course of healthcare reform. Today, it is impossible to confidently predict its course, so we have not included estimates about its possible financial consequences in our guidance. However, it is hard to imagine that what we saw a month ago will come to pass.Second, we predict for Amgen a return to topline growth and another solid year of earnings per share growth, with strong cash generation. We expect and are ready to launch Prolia™ worldwide. Predicting the exact timing of the approvals is challenging, however, we are not aware of any major issues. That said, predicting within a few months the exact timing is not possible. The most important points are that we expect approval and we are ready.I'd like to announce today that we have now submitted the information requested by the FDA in a Prolia™ complete response letter for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Also important, clinical results are forthcoming this year particularly the prostate SRE [skeletal-related event] Phase III Trial. Roger will comment on the expected 2010 pipeline key events.We also expect the number of ESA-related important events this year, including REMs, MEDCAC and CARDEC, [ph] (20:55) on which George will comment. We will continue to be efficient and look to deploy our strong balance sheet and cash flow to serve more patients, and over time, increase our top line growth rate.A few final thoughts before I turn it over to Bob. We have a shot over the next three to five years to deliver top-quartile industry growth performance. We are ready to launch Prolia™. We have the financial resources and will to advance and then grow our pipeline based on a combination of internal innovation, collaboration and acquisition from outside. We have a clear understanding of our challenges and the ability to constructively manage them. Our team is aligned, committed and ready to move Amgen forward. Bob, over to you."

If I can direct your attention to Slide 5, I'll walk you through the adjusted P&L for the quarter. As you can see, year-over-year revenues were up about 2% in the fourth quarter to $3.8 billion, and let me just quickly note that excluding Aranesp®, revenues were up 4% in the quarter.Shifting to a review of our business by geography, U.S. sales were down 1% to $2.9 billion for the quarter and again excluding Aranesp®, U.S. sales were up 2% on a year-over-year basis. And George will have more to say about wholesaler inventory in a moment but I want to note here that we exited the year with overall wholesaler inventory at the low end of our normal range. So what this means is that sales growth was adversely impacted by about $65 million in the year-over-year inventory changes, which represent about one day of sales for us in the U.S.Internationally, we posted a strong quarter with sales of $861 million, which represents an increase of 11% versus the prior year. Changes in foreign exchange positively impacted fourth quarter sales by $35 million. Now recall that foreign exchange negatively impacted us in the first, second and third quarters, so this is the only quarter of the year in which we were helped by foreign exchange.Turning now to operating expenses, as you can see on an adjusted basis, our total operating expenses were up 7% this quarter versus last year. Turning to the components of that, cost of sales for the quarter decreased by 3%, as efficiencies more than offset a less favorable product mix and higher sales volume.R&D expenses were up 12% year-over-year, and that's primarily driven by higher licensing fees of some $60 million associated with the Array BioPharma agreement, as well as higher staff-related costs and some costs associated with ongoing collaborations in our early and mid-stage pipeline. It's worth noting that sequentially, R&D expenses were higher in the fourth quarter versus the third, and I would point out that while we have typically seen an increase in our fourth quarter R&D expenses, this year that increase is more pronounced, again as a result of the Array transaction and certain investments in the early and mid-stage pipeline.Turning to SG&A expenses, see they were increased 9% versus the same quarter last year and this increase includes the cost of hiring the Prolia™ primary care sales force. It's perhaps also worth noting that the fourth quarter represents the first full quarter in which the Prolia™ sales force was on board in the P&L. Once Prolia™ is launched, we expect Prolia™-related expenses to increase as we begin promotional expenditures as well.In addition, SG&A expenses were higher in the quarter due to higher staff-related costs away from the Prolia™ sales force, which were offset to some extent by recoveries associated with the GlaxoSmithKline collaboration for Prolia™. Excluding expenses associated with the Enbrel® profit share, adjusted SG&A in the fourth quarter 2009 was up 13 % versus the same quarter last year. And sequentially, SG&A expenses were up and the increases in the fourth quarter this year were consistent with the historical spending patterns that we've seen in prior years.Shifting now to the tax rate for the quarter, as you can see, our adjusted rate for the quarter was 15.9% compared to 19% in the prior year. The reduction in 2009 was primarily due to increased manufacturing in Puerto Rico and the favorable tax impact of changes in revenue and expense mix, partially offset by the benefit of the extension of the federal R&D tax credit in the fourth quarter of 2008.Shifting now to EPS for the quarter, again, you can see that our fourth quarter 2009 adjusted EPS were $1.05, which is down 1% versus the prior year as the benefit of a lower tax rate and decreased share count were more than offset by increased R&D and SG&A expenses, which again primarily relate to Prolia™ and the Array Biopharma agreement in the fourth quarter. Our GAAP basis earnings per share were $0.92, which represents an increase of 6% over the prior year.Now shifting to the full-year of 2009 results on Slide 6, you can see for the full year, we reported earnings per share growth, as Kevin said earlier, of about 8%. Now let make a few comments about revenues. Year-over-year revenues were down 2% to $14.6 billion and when looking at the full year results, recall that the Aranesp® label changed last year in the third quarter and that's reflected in these results. In addition, our results were negatively affected by a stronger dollar in the first three quarters of the year.Recall that last quarter, we indicated revenues were trending to the upper end of our guidance range of $14.4 billion to $14.8 billion. However, as a result of the decline in wholesaler inventory levels versus our expectations over the last few days of the year, full-year revenues ended just about the middle of our guidance range.Shifting to a review of our business by geography, U.S. sales were down 3% to $11.1 billion. Internationally, we posted sales of $3.2 billion in 2009, unchanged from last year. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, which was some $213 million, total product sales decreased 1% and international sales increased 6%. And we achieved this in the face of increased competition from biosimilars in Europe.Turning now to operating expenses, again on an adjusted basis, our total operating expenses were down 3% versus last year, and we ended the year with an operating margin of 42.4%, which is an improvement over where we were in 2008. Efficiencies were key to enabling us to drive down across the sales by 5%, even though we were selling a less favorable product mix. R&D expenses decreased 6% year-over-year due to lower clinical trial costs, primarily for denosumab and Vectibix®, as well as lower staff-related costs for the full year. As a percent of sales in 2009, R&D expenses were 19.1%.Turning again to SG&A, you can see that the expenses increased by 1% versus 2008 due to increased spending for activities associated with the anticipated launch of Prolia™ and increased promotional expenses for our marketed products. These full-year increases were partially offset by lower G&A expenses and expense recoveries associated with the GSK [GlaxoSmithKline] collaboration for Prolia™. Enbrel® profit shares were down $32 million year-over-year and excluding the Enbrel® profit share, SG&A expenses increased 2% versus 2008.Turning now to the tax rate for the full year, let me just spend a few moments discussing our adjusted tax rate, which was 16.9% for the full year compared to 21.7% in 2008. And there are three main drivers for the lower rate in 2009: The first, recall that in the third quarter, we reached settlements with both the IRS and the State of California on certain prior year tax audits, the impact of which were specific for 2009; second, we had increased manufacturing and profits in Puerto Rico in 2009; and third, the tax rate benefited from some favorable change in our revenue and expense mix during the course of the year.Turning now to earnings per share, 2009 adjusted earnings per share were $4.91, up 8%. And as you can see, earnings per share benefited from lower OpEx, as well as a decreased tax rate and decreased share count, following our buybacks this year. We ended the year with earnings at the low end of the guidance range, primarily due to the impact of the declines in U.S. wholesaler inventory levels and the Array BioPharma agreement, which we closed at the end of December. Our GAAP EPS for the full year were $4.51, up 20% on the prior year.Turning to Slide 7, you can see we ended the year with a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Let me talk about a few of the key balance sheet items. Our year-end global cash balance was $13.4 billion. You see, we ended the year with $11.2 billion of debt and our adjusted-stockholders equity increased by $2 billion over the year to $22.4 billion. With respect to our cash flow, we generated approximately $6.3 billion of cash flow from operations in 2009, which represents an increase of 6% over the prior year. Capital expenditures for 2009 were approximately $500 million, which is down again for the second year in a row, thanks to improved productivity and efficiency in our capital programs.During year we repurchased 59 million shares, and with the additional $5 billion that our board authorized in December, we currently have $6 billion remaining under our authorized share repurchase programs.Turning now to Slide 8, I'll just walk you through 2010 guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $15.1 billion to $15.5 billion. This guidance range for 2010 accommodates growth in our base business, as well as the relevant range of timing for global Prolia™ launches, and excludes any impact from healthcare reform.As we prepare for the launch of Prolia™, I've already noted that we expect to see associated increases in sales and marketing expenses. It is perhaps also worth noting that we would expect to see some increase in R&D staff-related costs associated with the launch of Prolia™ and to an extent, we may see a slight impact on across the sales once we've launched Prolia™ as well. But taking that into account, we do expect that both the cost of sales and the R&D margins to be roughly similar in 2010 as a percent of sales to what they were in 2009. That leads us to adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.05 to $5.25, and then finally, let me say a word about tax and capital expenditures. On tax, we expect our 2009 adjusted rate to be up to 16.9%, it's not reflective of what we will see in 2010. In 2010, we would expect the adjusted tax rate to be in the 20% to 21% range, which is clearly an improvement over where we were in 2008, when our adjusted rate was 21.7%. I would note also that this guidance assumes that the R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended for 2010. And finally, for capital expenditures, we expect those to be in the range of $600 million in 2010 as well.Now I'll turn to George."

For the fourth quarter 2009, product sales increased 2% year-over-year, with U.S. declining 1%, primarily due to Aranesp® that Bob mentioned, and international growing 11% with growth across all products. The U.S. Aranesp® decline of 20% was due to the 2008 label change, and was largely offset by gains at EPOGEN®, which saw a record quarter. Internationally, our European business continued its strong performance with 7% growth, with new product launches and new territories both contributing.For the full year of 2009, global product sales declined 2% year-over-year, driven mainly by Aranesp® in the U.S., wholesaler inventories and foreign exchange. U.S. sales declined 3% year-over-year with an Aranesp® sales decline of 24%, offset by the remainder of the sales portfolio which grew 1%.In addition, U.S. wholesaler inventories declined during 2009, accounting for $70 million reduction in sales. This compares with an inventory growth of $130 million in 2008, resulting from the introduction of Enbrel® into this channel. The difference contributed approximately $200 million to the year-over-year sales decline.International sales grew 6%, driven largely by Neulasta® and Vectibix®. An unfavorable foreign exchange comparison with 2008 reduced our international full-year results by $213 million, leading to flat sales.The next slide graphically illustrates the components of year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, excluding the foreign exchange gain. U.S. Aranesp® was the only major component of our product portfolio to decline in the fourth quarter and was offset by 2% growth in our other products. I'll discuss each of the product results in more details in a moment.But first, Slide 12 shows the effect of changes in inventory we've had on our quarterly sales. As you can see, a buildup of inventory in the second half of 2008 depressed sales in the first quarter of 2009. This slide also illustrates the difference in inventory build by the wholesalers in the fourth quarter of each of the past three years, with 2009 showing very little year-end buildup. We expect that this will reduce the depressing effect of inventory burn off which we saw in quarter one 2009.From a full-year perspective as I mentioned, U.S. wholesaler inventory was a significant negative factor in year-over-year performance at a approximately $200 million down. Quarter-end wholesaler inventories are affected by many factors including the day, the week that a quarter ends, wholesaler shipping schedules, end user buying patterns, wholesaler working capital decisions and credit availability and cost. Over time, of course, demand drives average wholesale inventory levels.Turning to Aranesp®, worldwide Aranesp® sales decreased 8% in the fourth quarter versus last year. In the U.S., Aranesp® sales were down 20% year over year. ESA labels changes made in August, 2008 were the primary reason for this decline. Wholesaler inventory fluctuations also contributed to the year-over-year decline, accounting for roughly 7% of the total. Internationally, Aranesp® sales were flat, excluding foreign exchange and grew 4% including foreign exchange.Slide 14 displayed actual weekly U.S. Aranesp® sales going back to quarter four 2007. As a reminder, the sharp peaks and troughs seen in the blue weekly sales line are largely a result of inventory build ups and depletions, not fluctuations in actual patient utilization. At the end of the third quarter 2009, Aranesp® inventory was above the high end of the normal range. In the fourth quarter, inventory return to the midpoint of the normal range. The decline in the blue weekly sales line you see in the fourth quarter is due to this downward inventory move, as well us business adjustments that occurred late in the quarter.The red trend lines reflect average weekly sales for each quarter. Wholesaler inventory fluctuations and business adjustments are excluded from the averages, in order to provide a true quarter-on-quarter comparison more reflective of patient utilization. As you can see, average weekly sales have only slightly declined in the fourth quarter 2009 versus the third quarter.While we believe the ESA labeling changes made in 2008 are fully reflective in clinical practices, several events will occur in 2010 that could further impact Aranesp® sales.We expect the REMS to be finalized in the first quarter of this year and cannot rule out an additional step down in Aranesp® sales as a result. In response to the TREAT data, we have already updated the U.S. labeling for ESAs, and further labeling changes may be undertaking as further analysis and review of the data occur. Our analysis of the Aranesp® weekly sales in the U.S. is that when adjusted for inventory levels and one-time accrual adjustments, we have not seen any material impact from TREAT data availability.And CMS has scheduled MEDCAC meeting in March to gather information on the use of ESAs in a nephrology setting. The meeting will determine any further action and coverage repayment policy, and we'll update you on subsequent quarters, as more information becomes available as a result of these events.Next is EPOGEN®. EPOGEN® grew by 9% in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus the fourth quarter of 2008, driven by patient growth, increased dose utilization and an increase in net price. For the full year, net sales increased 5%, driven by patient growth, increased dose utilization and a net price increase. For 2010, dose fluctuations may continue as healthcare practitioners continue to refine the treatment practices in order to maintain hemoglobin levels in the 10g/dL to 12g/dL range. We will comment on the final CMS bundling rules once released in the next few months.Next slide, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® combined grew 2% in the fourth quarter '09 versus the fourth quarter '08. In the U.S., sales were flat with units in price combined, up 5% and inventory and business adjustments down 5%. Neulasta® and  NEUPOGEN® wholesaler inventory levels exited fourth quarter '09 at the low end of normal range. Internationally, the Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® increased 9% year-on-year, including foreign exchange.Enbrel® is next on Slide 17. Net sales were essentially flat versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Demand was also flat with price growth offset by unit decline. The unit decline was primarily in Dermatology, where we lost some share year-over-year to new competition. During the fourth quarter, U.S. Enbrel® maintains its leadership position in both Rheumatology and Dermatology. In Rheumatology, Enbrel® captured around a 35% dollar share during the quarter, a slight increase versus the prior quarter. And in Dermatology, despite the launch of new competition early in the fourth quarter, Enbrel® continued to get the majority of the first-line biologic use for psoriasis, capturing 57% of the dollar share in this segment during the quarter.On prior calls, we've discussed that both Rheumatology and Dermatology segments have historically been impacted by seasonality, with softness typically seen in the first quarter as some patients choose to forgo filling prescriptions when they face resetting deductibles, higher co-pays and other insurance changes. This year, we have stepped up our efforts to assist patients working through these challenges via specific new offerings in our existing Enbrel® support program. We also continue to enhance our co-pay program, which offers support for co-pays, coinsurance and prescription deductibles. It's too early to make a call on the success of these new programs at this point, but the early data we've seen is encouraging.Again, full-year comparisons between 2008 and 2009 were impacted by a combination of modest 2009 inventory drawdown and a large 2008 inventory buildup. For an Enbrel®, the combined year-on-year effect was approximately $120 million and without the same impact, Enbrel® would have grown slightly in 2009.On to Sensipar® in Slide 18. For the fourth quarter, worldwide Sensipar® sales grew 12% versus the fourth quarter of 2008, comprised of an 8% increase in demand, a 2% increase in foreign exchange and a 2% increase in inventory and business adjustments. Again, as we learn more about how oral drug such as Sensipar® will be handled in 2011 ESRD bundle, we'll be in a better position to communicate on the potential impact.Next slide, Vectibix sales grew 43% in the fourth quarter '09 versus the fourth quarter '08. And during the quarter, we saw a growth in the U.S. EGFR colorectal cancer segment for the first time since the second quarter 2008. As I mentioned on our third quarter call, Vectibix's future growth is dependent upon label expansion into second- and first-line metastatic colorectal cancer. International sales continue to be strong for Vectibix representing 61% of fourth quarter sales.The next slide summarizes our international sales performance. Internationally, sales grew 8% excluding divested products and the effects of foreign exchange versus the prior year. Growth was driven by Neulasta conversion, new product launches and expansion into new territories. On the next slide, we'll look at the international segment share for Aranesp in nephrology followed by Filgrastim.As in recent quarters, Aranesp nephrology share remains steady as biosimilars continue to take share from Epo alfa and Epo beta. MIRCERA® group continues arrive largely from NeoRecormon. My last Slide provides comparable for the G-CSF market. To date, biosimilar uptake is only slightly faster than what we saw with ESA. So as Arvind mentioned, I thought I'd finish up with a few thoughts on the Prolia launch. Roger will provide a regulatory update in a moment, but I wanted to revisit some points we made during our Analyst Day in late 2008. First, we believe Prolia addresses a significant unmet need in postmenopausal osteoporosis, especially among high-risk and non-compliant patients. For reimbursement and fulfillment reasons, we expect early trial in the highest risk in most unsatisfied patients before a more widespread adoption. And in Europe, EMEA approval may proceed reimbursement authority proof of pricing by many months, particularly in larger markets such as France, Spain and Italy.One final comment regarding U.S. Prolia sales force, in advance of the Prolia launch, the sales force are currently being trained on Enbrel, and will soon start detailing primary care doctors to generate referrals to dermatologists for psoriasis and rheumatologists for rheumatoid arthritis.

As noted on Slide 24, we completed five phase III metatrials, all of which delivered data on schedule and within a six-week period. Including among these were two studies demonstrating the ability of denosumab to delay bony complications in patients with metastatic bone disease. Two studies of Vectibix used in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of colorectal cancer and to treat outcome study exploring the benefits and risks of anemia treatment in patients with chronic kidney disease who do not yet require analysis.Also in 2009, we advanced three drug candidates into formal dose ranging studies. AMG 785, our Sclerostin antibody that we are developing in partnership with UCB, is being evaluated in postmenopausal osteoporosis and as a means for improving fracture healing. AMG 827 and anti-IL 17 receptor antibody is being evaluated in psoriasis and in other inflammatory diseases, and AMG 853, a small molecule prostanoid receptor antagonist is being evaluated in asthma. We added eight new molecules to our development roster, including a Phase II glucokinase activator that we license from Array BioPharma in the fourth quarter. And we exercise our option for AMG 423, a very exciting potential treatment for heart failure that was originally discovered by Cytokinetics. We also received quite a bit of external recognition last year, including the Scrip Awards for Best Overall Pipeline and for Best New Drug in Nplate, and TIME magazine cited denosumab is one of 2009's Top 10 Medical Breakthroughs. As we announced in December on Slide 25, we received a positive opinion from the CHMP with the approval of Prolia to reduce fracture risk in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis and high-risk for fracture and in men undergoing treatment for prostate cancer with androgen deprivation therapy. Formal EU adoption of the market authorization is expected in the relatively near future. Here in the United States, in mid-December, we received detailed comments on our Prolia file from the FDA related to the complete response letters that were sent in mid-October. The questions posed by the FDA related principally to the conduct of post-marketing surveillance. We completed a very comprehensive response to the agency at the end of last week. And as Kevin mentioned, we've submitted our complete response dossier for their review. Discussions with regulatory agencies in Australia, Canada and Switzerland are also progressing.In 2009, we obtained very impressive results using denosumab to reduce the risk of skeletal-related events meaning fractures, the need for surgery or radio therapy to treat bone pathology or spinal cord compression in patients with metastatic bone disease. Our two phase III studies, one in patients with breast cancer and the second in patients with a variety of other solid tumors or multiple myeloma will be complemented by a third study in patients with prostate cancer. We expect results from this third study during the first quarter of 2010.As I mentioned previously, we obtained positive data with respect to progression-free survival for Vectibix when used in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Our studies provided the first prospective data demonstrating that patients whose tumors contain a mutated version of the KRAS gene derive no benefit from Vectibix therapy. This finding is in accord with our previous studies and those of other groups. To support the view that the EGF receptor, the target of Vectibix therapy, delivers signals to the KRAS signaling pathway. Illegitimate activation of this pathway through acquired somatic mutations in cancer cells in essence to short circuits EGF receptor drive signals, hence obviating any therapeutic effect of EGF receptor blockade.As noted on the slide, we continue to derive important information from the treat outcome study, which address the benefits and risks associated with Aranesp therapy to a hemoglobin target of 13 grams per deciliter in patients with chronic kidney disease who are not yet on dialysis. I wish to reiterate as we made plain in our publication in the fourth quarter that although Aranesp treatment of this higher hemoglobin target reduce the risk of blood transfusions, there was no statistically significant effect on all-cause mortality or cardiovascular morbidity which was the primary endpoint of the study. Moreover, we saw that this treatment, which is more aggressive than that which is recommended in our label was associated with a very significant increase in the frequency of cerebrovascular events. We concluded that for many patients in this population, the risks of therapy will exceed the benefit that could be derived in terms of transfusion reduction. Much additional work remains to be completed using the very comprehensive treat database and there's much still to learn about ESA therapy in patients with renal insufficiency. I'll have more to say about this in a few minutes.Turning then to Slide 26, our pipeline continues to advance. Data from the prostate cancer skeletal-related events study comparing denosumab with zoledronic acid will as I said become available during the first quarter of 2010 and we will have data from our metastasis prevention study in prostate cancer in the second half of the year. Keep in mind that these and other studies are event driven and hence, it is not possible for me to define precisely when the endpoint will be reached. They're also initiating a metastasis prevention study in women with breast cancer having reviewed the protocol in some detail with the FDA.I should also note that we have initiated a male osteoporosis study with the goal of providing data that will complement those already obtained in postmenopausal women treated with Prolia. As noted on the slide, the EVOLVE study, which assesses all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in dialysis patients treated with Sensipar/Mimpara®, is now expected to complete in 2011 based on our event rate tracking metrics and the predictive algorithms that we use. Similarly, though enrollment in the phase III study of Motesanib in non-small cell lung cancer is nearly complete. The current event rate data suggest that the study will complete in 2011 rather than at the end of 2010 as we have previously thought. And both of these cases, I must again add the caveat that the completion of the event-driven studies is often difficult to estimate with confidence.Finally our Phase II study of AMG 386, a peptibody that antagonizes both Angiopoietin 1 and Angiopoietin 2, yielded strong evidence for a therapeutic benefit. And hence, we are proceeding with a Phase III trial is ovarian cancer. I remind you that this is the very first clinical program directed at the angiopoietin axis, an angiogenesis target that we believe could be real useful in multi-tumor types. Data from the AMG 386 program will be presented at upcoming scientific meetings.Moving forward in 2010, there will be numerous opportunities to review our current understanding of anemia management. Slide 27 notes that we have made good progress working with the FDA on our REMS program, a follow-up from the most recent Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting on this topic. We expect that the REMS will be completed in the first quarter of 2010 and will be implemented thereafter. Two important forums for discussion, the Medicare Evidence and Coverage Advisory Committee which provides advise to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Cardio-Renal Advisory Committee which advises the FDA. We'll consider the implications of new data with respect to any anemia therapy in patients with renal insufficiency. Not surprisingly, there is a great deal to be learned from TREAT, the only large placebo-controlled study of patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis. We're looking forward to reviewing these data with the Advisory Committees and with their sponsoring agencies. Finally, the brisk pace of data released that we have established during the past 12 months will continue during the next month. As I show on my last slide, I'd mentioned the two denosumab Phase III studies that we'll provide data this year. In addition, we will also see the data from a study evaluating the use of Vectibix in combination with standard regimens in the treatment of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Additional data from numerous Phase II studies in oncology using AMG 386, AMG 479, AMG 655 and AMG 102 will also become available. Naturally, given the broad potential applicability of AMG 386 and the positive results that we have seen with this agent in patients with ovarian cancer, we are hopeful that many of the other tumor types understudy will also prove amenable to AMG 386-based therapy. We will also receive data from the Phase II study of AMG 827 in psoriasis, which we expect to be very exciting. So 2010 will be an extremely busy year, I have much more to say about each of these programs in the coming months. Kevin?"

And so as a result, we think that the results of these are quite relevant, and we are hopeful that with that information in mind and given the demonstrated efficacy of Prolia in particular in men with androgen deprivation therapy, that there will be a way forward to make this drug available to patients in the United States."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we reflect on 2009, I'd like to make a few comments. First, the macroeconomic environment was the most challenging we have seen in our 30-year history. While no one can be fully-satisfied with the revenue decline, even a modest one, coming within a percent of the low end of our original revenue guidance in this environment was admirable.We once again meaningfully grew earnings per share and over the most recent five-year period, which includes the ESA business reset, we've grown earnings per share at a 15% compound annual growth rate, a very solid performance. We advanced the pipeline meaningfully in 2009, highlighted by a recommendation for Prolia™ approval in Europe, and a 15 to zero FDA advisory panel vote to recommend approval in the United States.We also managed the expenses and cash effectively as Arvind mentioned, and generated over $6 billion in operating cash flow to invest in growing the business and returning cash to shareholders. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues at Amgen for their tireless efforts in 2009 on behalf of patients and shareholders.Let's now turn to the current year 2010. 2010 is an important year. First, we will learn the course of healthcare reform. Today, it is impossible to confidently predict its course, so we have not included estimates about its possible financial consequences in our guidance. However, it is hard to imagine that what we saw a month ago will come to pass.Second, we predict for Amgen a return to topline growth and another solid year of earnings per share growth, with strong cash generation. We expect and are ready to launch Prolia™ worldwide. Predicting the exact timing of the approvals is challenging, however, we are not aware of any major issues. That said, predicting within a few months the exact timing is not possible. The most important points are that we expect approval and we are ready.I'd like to announce today that we have now submitted the information requested by the FDA in a Prolia™ complete response letter for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Also important, clinical results are forthcoming this year particularly the prostate SRE [skeletal-related event] Phase III Trial. Roger will comment on the expected 2010 pipeline key events.We also expect the number of ESA-related important events this year, including REMs, MEDCAC and CARDEC, [ph] (20:55) on which George will comment. We will continue to be efficient and look to deploy our strong balance sheet and cash flow to serve more patients, and over time, increase our top line growth rate.A few final thoughts before I turn it over to Bob. We have a shot over the next three to five years to deliver top-quartile industry growth performance. We are ready to launch Prolia™. We have the financial resources and will to advance and then grow our pipeline based on a combination of internal innovation, collaboration and acquisition from outside. We have a clear understanding of our challenges and the ability to constructively manage them. Our team is aligned, committed and ready to move Amgen forward. Bob, over to you."

If I can direct your attention to Slide 5, I'll walk you through the adjusted P&L for the quarter. As you can see, year-over-year revenues were up about 2% in the fourth quarter to $3.8 billion, and let me just quickly note that excluding Aranesp®, revenues were up 4% in the quarter.Shifting to a review of our business by geography, U.S. sales were down 1% to $2.9 billion for the quarter and again excluding Aranesp®, U.S. sales were up 2% on a year-over-year basis. And George will have more to say about wholesaler inventory in a moment but I want to note here that we exited the year with overall wholesaler inventory at the low end of our normal range. So what this means is that sales growth was adversely impacted by about $65 million in the year-over-year inventory changes, which represent about one day of sales for us in the U.S.Internationally, we posted a strong quarter with sales of $861 million, which represents an increase of 11% versus the prior year. Changes in foreign exchange positively impacted fourth quarter sales by $35 million. Now recall that foreign exchange negatively impacted us in the first, second and third quarters, so this is the only quarter of the year in which we were helped by foreign exchange.Turning now to operating expenses, as you can see on an adjusted basis, our total operating expenses were up 7% this quarter versus last year. Turning to the components of that, cost of sales for the quarter decreased by 3%, as efficiencies more than offset a less favorable product mix and higher sales volume.R&D expenses were up 12% year-over-year, and that's primarily driven by higher licensing fees of some $60 million associated with the Array BioPharma agreement, as well as higher staff-related costs and some costs associated with ongoing collaborations in our early and mid-stage pipeline. It's worth noting that sequentially, R&D expenses were higher in the fourth quarter versus the third, and I would point out that while we have typically seen an increase in our fourth quarter R&D expenses, this year that increase is more pronounced, again as a result of the Array transaction and certain investments in the early and mid-stage pipeline.Turning to SG&A expenses, see they were increased 9% versus the same quarter last year and this increase includes the cost of hiring the Prolia™ primary care sales force. It's perhaps also worth noting that the fourth quarter represents the first full quarter in which the Prolia™ sales force was on board in the P&L. Once Prolia™ is launched, we expect Prolia™-related expenses to increase as we begin promotional expenditures as well.In addition, SG&A expenses were higher in the quarter due to higher staff-related costs away from the Prolia™ sales force, which were offset to some extent by recoveries associated with the GlaxoSmithKline collaboration for Prolia™. Excluding expenses associated with the Enbrel® profit share, adjusted SG&A in the fourth quarter 2009 was up 13 % versus the same quarter last year. And sequentially, SG&A expenses were up and the increases in the fourth quarter this year were consistent with the historical spending patterns that we've seen in prior years.Shifting now to the tax rate for the quarter, as you can see, our adjusted rate for the quarter was 15.9% compared to 19% in the prior year. The reduction in 2009 was primarily due to increased manufacturing in Puerto Rico and the favorable tax impact of changes in revenue and expense mix, partially offset by the benefit of the extension of the federal R&D tax credit in the fourth quarter of 2008.Shifting now to EPS for the quarter, again, you can see that our fourth quarter 2009 adjusted EPS were $1.05, which is down 1% versus the prior year as the benefit of a lower tax rate and decreased share count were more than offset by increased R&D and SG&A expenses, which again primarily relate to Prolia™ and the Array Biopharma agreement in the fourth quarter. Our GAAP basis earnings per share were $0.92, which represents an increase of 6% over the prior year.Now shifting to the full-year of 2009 results on Slide 6, you can see for the full year, we reported earnings per share growth, as Kevin said earlier, of about 8%. Now let make a few comments about revenues. Year-over-year revenues were down 2% to $14.6 billion and when looking at the full year results, recall that the Aranesp® label changed last year in the third quarter and that's reflected in these results. In addition, our results were negatively affected by a stronger dollar in the first three quarters of the year.Recall that last quarter, we indicated revenues were trending to the upper end of our guidance range of $14.4 billion to $14.8 billion. However, as a result of the decline in wholesaler inventory levels versus our expectations over the last few days of the year, full-year revenues ended just about the middle of our guidance range.Shifting to a review of our business by geography, U.S. sales were down 3% to $11.1 billion. Internationally, we posted sales of $3.2 billion in 2009, unchanged from last year. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, which was some $213 million, total product sales decreased 1% and international sales increased 6%. And we achieved this in the face of increased competition from biosimilars in Europe.Turning now to operating expenses, again on an adjusted basis, our total operating expenses were down 3% versus last year, and we ended the year with an operating margin of 42.4%, which is an improvement over where we were in 2008. Efficiencies were key to enabling us to drive down across the sales by 5%, even though we were selling a less favorable product mix. R&D expenses decreased 6% year-over-year due to lower clinical trial costs, primarily for denosumab and Vectibix®, as well as lower staff-related costs for the full year. As a percent of sales in 2009, R&D expenses were 19.1%.Turning again to SG&A, you can see that the expenses increased by 1% versus 2008 due to increased spending for activities associated with the anticipated launch of Prolia™ and increased promotional expenses for our marketed products. These full-year increases were partially offset by lower G&A expenses and expense recoveries associated with the GSK [GlaxoSmithKline] collaboration for Prolia™. Enbrel® profit shares were down $32 million year-over-year and excluding the Enbrel® profit share, SG&A expenses increased 2% versus 2008.Turning now to the tax rate for the full year, let me just spend a few moments discussing our adjusted tax rate, which was 16.9% for the full year compared to 21.7% in 2008. And there are three main drivers for the lower rate in 2009: The first, recall that in the third quarter, we reached settlements with both the IRS and the State of California on certain prior year tax audits, the impact of which were specific for 2009; second, we had increased manufacturing and profits in Puerto Rico in 2009; and third, the tax rate benefited from some favorable change in our revenue and expense mix during the course of the year.Turning now to earnings per share, 2009 adjusted earnings per share were $4.91, up 8%. And as you can see, earnings per share benefited from lower OpEx, as well as a decreased tax rate and decreased share count, following our buybacks this year. We ended the year with earnings at the low end of the guidance range, primarily due to the impact of the declines in U.S. wholesaler inventory levels and the Array BioPharma agreement, which we closed at the end of December. Our GAAP EPS for the full year were $4.51, up 20% on the prior year.Turning to Slide 7, you can see we ended the year with a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Let me talk about a few of the key balance sheet items. Our year-end global cash balance was $13.4 billion. You see, we ended the year with $11.2 billion of debt and our adjusted-stockholders equity increased by $2 billion over the year to $22.4 billion. With respect to our cash flow, we generated approximately $6.3 billion of cash flow from operations in 2009, which represents an increase of 6% over the prior year. Capital expenditures for 2009 were approximately $500 million, which is down again for the second year in a row, thanks to improved productivity and efficiency in our capital programs.During year we repurchased 59 million shares, and with the additional $5 billion that our board authorized in December, we currently have $6 billion remaining under our authorized share repurchase programs.Turning now to Slide 8, I'll just walk you through 2010 guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $15.1 billion to $15.5 billion. This guidance range for 2010 accommodates growth in our base business, as well as the relevant range of timing for global Prolia™ launches, and excludes any impact from healthcare reform.As we prepare for the launch of Prolia™, I've already noted that we expect to see associated increases in sales and marketing expenses. It is perhaps also worth noting that we would expect to see some increase in R&D staff-related costs associated with the launch of Prolia™ and to an extent, we may see a slight impact on across the sales once we've launched Prolia™ as well. But taking that into account, we do expect that both the cost of sales and the R&D margins to be roughly similar in 2010 as a percent of sales to what they were in 2009. That leads us to adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.05 to $5.25, and then finally, let me say a word about tax and capital expenditures. On tax, we expect our 2009 adjusted rate to be up to 16.9%, it's not reflective of what we will see in 2010. In 2010, we would expect the adjusted tax rate to be in the 20% to 21% range, which is clearly an improvement over where we were in 2008, when our adjusted rate was 21.7%. I would note also that this guidance assumes that the R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended for 2010. And finally, for capital expenditures, we expect those to be in the range of $600 million in 2010 as well.Now I'll turn to George."

For the fourth quarter 2009, product sales increased 2% year-over-year, with U.S. declining 1%, primarily due to Aranesp® that Bob mentioned, and international growing 11% with growth across all products. The U.S. Aranesp® decline of 20% was due to the 2008 label change, and was largely offset by gains at EPOGEN®, which saw a record quarter. Internationally, our European business continued its strong performance with 7% growth, with new product launches and new territories both contributing.For the full year of 2009, global product sales declined 2% year-over-year, driven mainly by Aranesp® in the U.S., wholesaler inventories and foreign exchange. U.S. sales declined 3% year-over-year with an Aranesp® sales decline of 24%, offset by the remainder of the sales portfolio which grew 1%.In addition, U.S. wholesaler inventories declined during 2009, accounting for $70 million reduction in sales. This compares with an inventory growth of $130 million in 2008, resulting from the introduction of Enbrel® into this channel. The difference contributed approximately $200 million to the year-over-year sales decline.International sales grew 6%, driven largely by Neulasta® and Vectibix®. An unfavorable foreign exchange comparison with 2008 reduced our international full-year results by $213 million, leading to flat sales.The next slide graphically illustrates the components of year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, excluding the foreign exchange gain. U.S. Aranesp® was the only major component of our product portfolio to decline in the fourth quarter and was offset by 2% growth in our other products. I'll discuss each of the product results in more details in a moment.But first, Slide 12 shows the effect of changes in inventory we've had on our quarterly sales. As you can see, a buildup of inventory in the second half of 2008 depressed sales in the first quarter of 2009. This slide also illustrates the difference in inventory build by the wholesalers in the fourth quarter of each of the past three years, with 2009 showing very little year-end buildup. We expect that this will reduce the depressing effect of inventory burn off which we saw in quarter one 2009.From a full-year perspective as I mentioned, U.S. wholesaler inventory was a significant negative factor in year-over-year performance at a approximately $200 million down. Quarter-end wholesaler inventories are affected by many factors including the day, the week that a quarter ends, wholesaler shipping schedules, end user buying patterns, wholesaler working capital decisions and credit availability and cost. Over time, of course, demand drives average wholesale inventory levels.Turning to Aranesp®, worldwide Aranesp® sales decreased 8% in the fourth quarter versus last year. In the U.S., Aranesp® sales were down 20% year over year. ESA labels changes made in August, 2008 were the primary reason for this decline. Wholesaler inventory fluctuations also contributed to the year-over-year decline, accounting for roughly 7% of the total. Internationally, Aranesp® sales were flat, excluding foreign exchange and grew 4% including foreign exchange.Slide 14 displayed actual weekly U.S. Aranesp® sales going back to quarter four 2007. As a reminder, the sharp peaks and troughs seen in the blue weekly sales line are largely a result of inventory build ups and depletions, not fluctuations in actual patient utilization. At the end of the third quarter 2009, Aranesp® inventory was above the high end of the normal range. In the fourth quarter, inventory return to the midpoint of the normal range. The decline in the blue weekly sales line you see in the fourth quarter is due to this downward inventory move, as well us business adjustments that occurred late in the quarter.The red trend lines reflect average weekly sales for each quarter. Wholesaler inventory fluctuations and business adjustments are excluded from the averages, in order to provide a true quarter-on-quarter comparison more reflective of patient utilization. As you can see, average weekly sales have only slightly declined in the fourth quarter 2009 versus the third quarter.While we believe the ESA labeling changes made in 2008 are fully reflective in clinical practices, several events will occur in 2010 that could further impact Aranesp® sales.We expect the REMS to be finalized in the first quarter of this year and cannot rule out an additional step down in Aranesp® sales as a result. In response to the TREAT data, we have already updated the U.S. labeling for ESAs, and further labeling changes may be undertaking as further analysis and review of the data occur. Our analysis of the Aranesp® weekly sales in the U.S. is that when adjusted for inventory levels and one-time accrual adjustments, we have not seen any material impact from TREAT data availability.And CMS has scheduled MEDCAC meeting in March to gather information on the use of ESAs in a nephrology setting. The meeting will determine any further action and coverage repayment policy, and we'll update you on subsequent quarters, as more information becomes available as a result of these events.Next is EPOGEN®. EPOGEN® grew by 9% in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus the fourth quarter of 2008, driven by patient growth, increased dose utilization and an increase in net price. For the full year, net sales increased 5%, driven by patient growth, increased dose utilization and a net price increase. For 2010, dose fluctuations may continue as healthcare practitioners continue to refine the treatment practices in order to maintain hemoglobin levels in the 10g/dL to 12g/dL range. We will comment on the final CMS bundling rules once released in the next few months.Next slide, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® combined grew 2% in the fourth quarter '09 versus the fourth quarter '08. In the U.S., sales were flat with units in price combined, up 5% and inventory and business adjustments down 5%. Neulasta® and  NEUPOGEN® wholesaler inventory levels exited fourth quarter '09 at the low end of normal range. Internationally, the Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® increased 9% year-on-year, including foreign exchange.Enbrel® is next on Slide 17. Net sales were essentially flat versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Demand was also flat with price growth offset by unit decline. The unit decline was primarily in Dermatology, where we lost some share year-over-year to new competition. During the fourth quarter, U.S. Enbrel® maintains its leadership position in both Rheumatology and Dermatology. In Rheumatology, Enbrel® captured around a 35% dollar share during the quarter, a slight increase versus the prior quarter. And in Dermatology, despite the launch of new competition early in the fourth quarter, Enbrel® continued to get the majority of the first-line biologic use for psoriasis, capturing 57% of the dollar share in this segment during the quarter.On prior calls, we've discussed that both Rheumatology and Dermatology segments have historically been impacted by seasonality, with softness typically seen in the first quarter as some patients choose to forgo filling prescriptions when they face resetting deductibles, higher co-pays and other insurance changes. This year, we have stepped up our efforts to assist patients working through these challenges via specific new offerings in our existing Enbrel® support program. We also continue to enhance our co-pay program, which offers support for co-pays, coinsurance and prescription deductibles. It's too early to make a call on the success of these new programs at this point, but the early data we've seen is encouraging.Again, full-year comparisons between 2008 and 2009 were impacted by a combination of modest 2009 inventory drawdown and a large 2008 inventory buildup. For an Enbrel®, the combined year-on-year effect was approximately $120 million and without the same impact, Enbrel® would have grown slightly in 2009.On to Sensipar® in Slide 18. For the fourth quarter, worldwide Sensipar® sales grew 12% versus the fourth quarter of 2008, comprised of an 8% increase in demand, a 2% increase in foreign exchange and a 2% increase in inventory and business adjustments. Again, as we learn more about how oral drug such as Sensipar® will be handled in 2011 ESRD bundle, we'll be in a better position to communicate on the potential impact.Next slide, Vectibix sales grew 43% in the fourth quarter '09 versus the fourth quarter '08. And during the quarter, we saw a growth in the U.S. EGFR colorectal cancer segment for the first time since the second quarter 2008. As I mentioned on our third quarter call, Vectibix's future growth is dependent upon label expansion into second- and first-line metastatic colorectal cancer. International sales continue to be strong for Vectibix representing 61% of fourth quarter sales.The next slide summarizes our international sales performance. Internationally, sales grew 8% excluding divested products and the effects of foreign exchange versus the prior year. Growth was driven by Neulasta conversion, new product launches and expansion into new territories. On the next slide, we'll look at the international segment share for Aranesp in nephrology followed by Filgrastim.As in recent quarters, Aranesp nephrology share remains steady as biosimilars continue to take share from Epo alfa and Epo beta. MIRCERA® group continues arrive largely from NeoRecormon. My last Slide provides comparable for the G-CSF market. To date, biosimilar uptake is only slightly faster than what we saw with ESA. So as Arvind mentioned, I thought I'd finish up with a few thoughts on the Prolia launch. Roger will provide a regulatory update in a moment, but I wanted to revisit some points we made during our Analyst Day in late 2008. First, we believe Prolia addresses a significant unmet need in postmenopausal osteoporosis, especially among high-risk and non-compliant patients. For reimbursement and fulfillment reasons, we expect early trial in the highest risk in most unsatisfied patients before a more widespread adoption. And in Europe, EMEA approval may proceed reimbursement authority proof of pricing by many months, particularly in larger markets such as France, Spain and Italy.One final comment regarding U.S. Prolia sales force, in advance of the Prolia launch, the sales force are currently being trained on Enbrel, and will soon start detailing primary care doctors to generate referrals to dermatologists for psoriasis and rheumatologists for rheumatoid arthritis.

As noted on Slide 24, we completed five phase III metatrials, all of which delivered data on schedule and within a six-week period. Including among these were two studies demonstrating the ability of denosumab to delay bony complications in patients with metastatic bone disease. Two studies of Vectibix used in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of colorectal cancer and to treat outcome study exploring the benefits and risks of anemia treatment in patients with chronic kidney disease who do not yet require analysis.Also in 2009, we advanced three drug candidates into formal dose ranging studies. AMG 785, our Sclerostin antibody that we are developing in partnership with UCB, is being evaluated in postmenopausal osteoporosis and as a means for improving fracture healing. AMG 827 and anti-IL 17 receptor antibody is being evaluated in psoriasis and in other inflammatory diseases, and AMG 853, a small molecule prostanoid receptor antagonist is being evaluated in asthma. We added eight new molecules to our development roster, including a Phase II glucokinase activator that we license from Array BioPharma in the fourth quarter. And we exercise our option for AMG 423, a very exciting potential treatment for heart failure that was originally discovered by Cytokinetics. We also received quite a bit of external recognition last year, including the Scrip Awards for Best Overall Pipeline and for Best New Drug in Nplate, and TIME magazine cited denosumab is one of 2009's Top 10 Medical Breakthroughs. As we announced in December on Slide 25, we received a positive opinion from the CHMP with the approval of Prolia to reduce fracture risk in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis and high-risk for fracture and in men undergoing treatment for prostate cancer with androgen deprivation therapy. Formal EU adoption of the market authorization is expected in the relatively near future. Here in the United States, in mid-December, we received detailed comments on our Prolia file from the FDA related to the complete response letters that were sent in mid-October. The questions posed by the FDA related principally to the conduct of post-marketing surveillance. We completed a very comprehensive response to the agency at the end of last week. And as Kevin mentioned, we've submitted our complete response dossier for their review. Discussions with regulatory agencies in Australia, Canada and Switzerland are also progressing.In 2009, we obtained very impressive results using denosumab to reduce the risk of skeletal-related events meaning fractures, the need for surgery or radio therapy to treat bone pathology or spinal cord compression in patients with metastatic bone disease. Our two phase III studies, one in patients with breast cancer and the second in patients with a variety of other solid tumors or multiple myeloma will be complemented by a third study in patients with prostate cancer. We expect results from this third study during the first quarter of 2010.As I mentioned previously, we obtained positive data with respect to progression-free survival for Vectibix when used in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Our studies provided the first prospective data demonstrating that patients whose tumors contain a mutated version of the KRAS gene derive no benefit from Vectibix therapy. This finding is in accord with our previous studies and those of other groups. To support the view that the EGF receptor, the target of Vectibix therapy, delivers signals to the KRAS signaling pathway. Illegitimate activation of this pathway through acquired somatic mutations in cancer cells in essence to short circuits EGF receptor drive signals, hence obviating any therapeutic effect of EGF receptor blockade.As noted on the slide, we continue to derive important information from the treat outcome study, which address the benefits and risks associated with Aranesp therapy to a hemoglobin target of 13 grams per deciliter in patients with chronic kidney disease who are not yet on dialysis. I wish to reiterate as we made plain in our publication in the fourth quarter that although Aranesp treatment of this higher hemoglobin target reduce the risk of blood transfusions, there was no statistically significant effect on all-cause mortality or cardiovascular morbidity which was the primary endpoint of the study. Moreover, we saw that this treatment, which is more aggressive than that which is recommended in our label was associated with a very significant increase in the frequency of cerebrovascular events. We concluded that for many patients in this population, the risks of therapy will exceed the benefit that could be derived in terms of transfusion reduction. Much additional work remains to be completed using the very comprehensive treat database and there's much still to learn about ESA therapy in patients with renal insufficiency. I'll have more to say about this in a few minutes.Turning then to Slide 26, our pipeline continues to advance. Data from the prostate cancer skeletal-related events study comparing denosumab with zoledronic acid will as I said become available during the first quarter of 2010 and we will have data from our metastasis prevention study in prostate cancer in the second half of the year. Keep in mind that these and other studies are event driven and hence, it is not possible for me to define precisely when the endpoint will be reached. They're also initiating a metastasis prevention study in women with breast cancer having reviewed the protocol in some detail with the FDA.I should also note that we have initiated a male osteoporosis study with the goal of providing data that will complement those already obtained in postmenopausal women treated with Prolia. As noted on the slide, the EVOLVE study, which assesses all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in dialysis patients treated with Sensipar/Mimpara®, is now expected to complete in 2011 based on our event rate tracking metrics and the predictive algorithms that we use. Similarly, though enrollment in the phase III study of Motesanib in non-small cell lung cancer is nearly complete. The current event rate data suggest that the study will complete in 2011 rather than at the end of 2010 as we have previously thought. And both of these cases, I must again add the caveat that the completion of the event-driven studies is often difficult to estimate with confidence.Finally our Phase II study of AMG 386, a peptibody that antagonizes both Angiopoietin 1 and Angiopoietin 2, yielded strong evidence for a therapeutic benefit. And hence, we are proceeding with a Phase III trial is ovarian cancer. I remind you that this is the very first clinical program directed at the angiopoietin axis, an angiogenesis target that we believe could be real useful in multi-tumor types. Data from the AMG 386 program will be presented at upcoming scientific meetings.Moving forward in 2010, there will be numerous opportunities to review our current understanding of anemia management. Slide 27 notes that we have made good progress working with the FDA on our REMS program, a follow-up from the most recent Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting on this topic. We expect that the REMS will be completed in the first quarter of 2010 and will be implemented thereafter. Two important forums for discussion, the Medicare Evidence and Coverage Advisory Committee which provides advise to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Cardio-Renal Advisory Committee which advises the FDA. We'll consider the implications of new data with respect to any anemia therapy in patients with renal insufficiency. Not surprisingly, there is a great deal to be learned from TREAT, the only large placebo-controlled study of patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis. We're looking forward to reviewing these data with the Advisory Committees and with their sponsoring agencies. Finally, the brisk pace of data released that we have established during the past 12 months will continue during the next month. As I show on my last slide, I'd mentioned the two denosumab Phase III studies that we'll provide data this year. In addition, we will also see the data from a study evaluating the use of Vectibix in combination with standard regimens in the treatment of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Additional data from numerous Phase II studies in oncology using AMG 386, AMG 479, AMG 655 and AMG 102 will also become available. Naturally, given the broad potential applicability of AMG 386 and the positive results that we have seen with this agent in patients with ovarian cancer, we are hopeful that many of the other tumor types understudy will also prove amenable to AMG 386-based therapy. We will also receive data from the Phase II study of AMG 827 in psoriasis, which we expect to be very exciting. So 2010 will be an extremely busy year, I have much more to say about each of these programs in the coming months. Kevin?"

It's really very impressive. As I've said many times, RANK Ligand inhibition by denosumab in the human clinical setting or using OPG-Fc, is the most potent anti-resorptive method that's ever been introduced into clinical practice, whether in small rodents or in humans, and it has a very dramatic effect on the ability of tumors to gain access to bone in the preclinical setting. Now whether we'll see that in humans or not, I don't know that's why we're doing the study. But frankly, the preclinical data are extremely supportive. There's no other way to look at it."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we reflect on 2009, I'd like to make a few comments. First, the macroeconomic environment was the most challenging we have seen in our 30-year history. While no one can be fully-satisfied with the revenue decline, even a modest one, coming within a percent of the low end of our original revenue guidance in this environment was admirable.We once again meaningfully grew earnings per share and over the most recent five-year period, which includes the ESA business reset, we've grown earnings per share at a 15% compound annual growth rate, a very solid performance. We advanced the pipeline meaningfully in 2009, highlighted by a recommendation for Prolia™ approval in Europe, and a 15 to zero FDA advisory panel vote to recommend approval in the United States.We also managed the expenses and cash effectively as Arvind mentioned, and generated over $6 billion in operating cash flow to invest in growing the business and returning cash to shareholders. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues at Amgen for their tireless efforts in 2009 on behalf of patients and shareholders.Let's now turn to the current year 2010. 2010 is an important year. First, we will learn the course of healthcare reform. Today, it is impossible to confidently predict its course, so we have not included estimates about its possible financial consequences in our guidance. However, it is hard to imagine that what we saw a month ago will come to pass.Second, we predict for Amgen a return to topline growth and another solid year of earnings per share growth, with strong cash generation. We expect and are ready to launch Prolia™ worldwide. Predicting the exact timing of the approvals is challenging, however, we are not aware of any major issues. That said, predicting within a few months the exact timing is not possible. The most important points are that we expect approval and we are ready.I'd like to announce today that we have now submitted the information requested by the FDA in a Prolia™ complete response letter for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Also important, clinical results are forthcoming this year particularly the prostate SRE [skeletal-related event] Phase III trial. Roger will comment on the expected 2010 pipeline key events.We also expect the number of ESA-related important events this year, including REMs, MEDCAC and CARDEC, [ph] (20:55) on which George will comment. We will continue to be efficient and look to deploy our strong balance sheet and cash flow to serve more patients, and over time, increase our top line growth rate.A few final thoughts before I turn it over to Bob. We have a shot over the next three to five years to deliver top-quartile industry growth performance. We are ready to launch Prolia™. We have the financial resources and will to advance and then grow our pipeline based on a combination of internal innovation, collaboration and acquisition from outside. We have a clear understanding of our challenges and the ability to constructively manage them. Our team is aligned, committed and ready to move Amgen forward. Bob, over to you."

If I can direct your attention to Slide 5, I'll walk you through the adjusted P&L for the quarter.

If I can direct your attention to Slide 5, I'll walk you through the adjusted P&L for the quarter. As you can see, year-over-year revenues were up about 2% in the fourth quarter to $3.8 billion, and let me just quickly note that excluding Aranesp®, revenues were up 4% in the quarter.Shifting to a review of our business by geography, U.S. sales were down 1% to $2.9 billion for the quarter and again excluding Aranesp®, U.S. sales were up 2% on a year-over-year basis. And George will have more to say about wholesaler inventory in a moment, but I want to note here that we exited the year with overall wholesaler inventory at the low end of our normal range. So what this means is that sales growth was adversely impacted by about $65 million in the year-over-year inventory changes, which represent about one day of sales for us in the U.S.Internationally, we posted a strong quarter with sales of $861 million, which represents an increase of 11% versus the prior year. Changes in foreign exchange positively impacted fourth quarter sales by $35 million. Now recall that foreign exchange negatively impacted us in the first, second and third quarters, so this is the only quarter of the year in which we were helped by foreign exchange.Turning now to operating expenses, as you can see on an adjusted basis, our total operating expenses were up 7% this quarter versus last year. Turning to the components of that, cost of sales for the quarter decreased by 3%, as efficiencies more than offset a less favorable product mix and higher sales volume.R&D expenses were up 12% year-over-year, and that's primarily driven by higher licensing fees of some $60 million associated with the Array BioPharma agreement, as well as higher staff-related costs and some costs associated with ongoing collaborations in our early and mid-stage pipeline. It's worth noting that sequentially, R&D expenses were higher in the fourth quarter versus the third, and I would point out that while we have typically seen an increase in our fourth quarter R&D expenses, this year that increase is more pronounced, again as a result of the Array transaction and certain investments in the early and mid-stage pipeline.Turning to SG&A expenses, SG&A increased 9% versus the same quarter last year and this increase includes the cost of hiring the Prolia™ primary care sales force. It's perhaps also worth noting that the fourth quarter represents the first full quarter in which the Prolia™ sales force was on board in the P&L. Once Prolia™ is launched, we expect Prolia™-related expenses to increase as we begin promotional expenditures as well.In addition, SG&A expenses were higher in the quarter due to higher staff-related costs away from the Prolia™ sales force, which were offset to some extent by recoveries associated with the GlaxoSmithKline collaboration for Prolia™. Excluding expenses associated with the Enbrel® profit share, adjusted SG&A in the fourth quarter 2009 was up 13 % versus the same quarter last year. And sequentially, SG&A expenses were up and the increases in the fourth quarter this year were consistent with the historical spending patterns that we've seen in prior years.Shifting now to the tax rate for the quarter, as you can see, our adjusted rate for the quarter was 15.9% compared to 19% in the prior year. The reduction in 2009 was primarily due to increased manufacturing in Puerto Rico and the favorable tax impact of changes in revenue and expense mix, partially offset by the benefit of the extension of the federal R&D tax credit in the fourth quarter of 2008.Shifting now to EPS for the quarter, again, you can see that our fourth quarter 2009 adjusted EPS were $1.05, which is down 1% versus the prior year as the benefit of a lower tax rate and decreased share count were more than offset by increased R&D and SG&A expenses, which again primarily relate to Prolia™ and the Array Biopharma agreement in the fourth quarter. Our GAAP basis earnings per share were $0.92, which represents an increase of 6% over the prior year.Now shifting to the full-year of 2009 results on Slide 6, you can see for the full year, we reported earnings per share growth, as Kevin said earlier, of about 8%. Now let make a few comments about revenues. Year-over-year revenues were down 2% to $14.6 billion and when looking at the full year results, recall that the Aranesp® label changed last year in the third quarter and that's reflected in these results. In addition, our results were negatively affected by a stronger dollar in the first three quarters of the year.Recall that last quarter, we indicated revenues were trending to the upper end of our guidance range of $14.4 billion to $14.8 billion. However, as a result of the decline in wholesaler inventory levels versus our expectations over the last few days of the year, full-year revenues ended just about the middle of our guidance range.Shifting to a review of our business by geography, U.S. sales were down 3% to $11.1 billion. Internationally, we posted sales of $3.2 billion in 2009, unchanged from last year. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, which was some $213 million, total product sales decreased 1% and international sales increased 6%. And we achieved this in the face of increased competition from biosimilars in Europe.Turning now to operating expenses, again on an adjusted basis, our total operating expenses were down 3% versus last year, and we ended the year with an operating margin of 42.4%, which is an improvement over where we were in 2008. Efficiencies were key to enabling us to drive down across the sales by 5%, even though we were selling a less favorable product mix. R&D expenses decreased 6% year-over-year due to lower clinical trial costs, primarily for denosumab and Vectibix®, as well as lower staff-related costs for the full year. As a percent of sales in 2009, R&D expenses were 19.1%.Turning again to SG&A, you can see that the expenses increased by 1% versus 2008 due to increased spending for activities associated with the anticipated launch of Prolia™ and increased promotional expenses for our marketed products. These full-year increases were partially offset by lower G&A expenses and expense recoveries associated with the GSK [GlaxoSmithKline] collaboration for Prolia™. Enbrel® profit shares were down $32 million year-over-year and excluding the Enbrel® profit share, SG&A expenses increased 2% versus 2008.Turning now to the tax rate for the full year, let me just spend a few moments discussing our adjusted tax rate, which was 16.9% for the full year compared to 21.7% in 2008. And there are three main drivers for the lower rate in 2009: The first, recall that in the third quarter, we reached settlements with both the IRS and the State of California on certain prior year tax audits, the impact of which were specific for 2009; second, we had increased manufacturing and profits in Puerto Rico in 2009; and third, the tax rate benefited from some favorable changes in our revenue and expense mix during the course of the year.Turning now to earnings per share, 2009 adjusted earnings per share were $4.91, up 8%. And as you can see, earnings per share benefited from lower OpEx, as well as a decreased tax rate and decreased share count, following our buybacks this year. We ended the year with earnings at the low end of the guidance range, primarily due to the impact of the declines in U.S. wholesaler inventory levels and the Array BioPharma agreement, which we closed at the end of December. Our GAAP EPS for the full year were $4.51, up 20% on the prior year.Turning to Slide 7, you can see we ended the year with a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Let me talk about a few of the key balance sheet items. Our year-end global cash balance was $13.4 billion. You see, we ended the year with $11.2 billion of debt and our adjusted-stockholders equity increased by $2 billion over the year to $22.4 billion. With respect to our cash flow, we generated approximately $6.3 billion of cash flow from operations in 2009, which represents an increase of 6% over the prior year. Capital expenditures for 2009 were approximately $500 million, which is down again for the second year in a row, thanks to improved productivity and efficiency in our capital programs.During year we repurchased 59 million shares, and with the additional $5 billion that our board authorized in December, we currently have $6 billion remaining under our authorized share repurchase programs.Turning now to Slide 8, I'll just walk you through 2010 guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $15.1 billion to $15.5 billion. This guidance range for 2010 accommodates growth in our base business, as well as the relevant range of timing for global Prolia™ launches, and excludes any impact from healthcare reform.As we prepare for the launch of Prolia™, I've already noted that we expect to see associated increases in sales and marketing expenses. It is perhaps also worth noting that we would expect to see some increase in R&D staff-related costs associated with the launch of Prolia™ and to an extent, we may see a slight impact on across the sales once we've launched Prolia™ as well. But taking that into account, we do expect that both the cost of sales and the R&D margins to be roughly similar in 2010 as a percent of sales to what they were in 2009. That leads us to adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.05 to $5.25, and then finally, let me say a word about tax and capital expenditures. On tax, we expect our 2009 adjusted rate to be up to 16.9%, it's not reflective of what we will see in 2010. In 2010, we would expect the adjusted tax rate to be in the 20% to 21% range, which is clearly an improvement over where we were in 2008, when our adjusted rate was 21.7%. I would note also that this guidance assumes that the R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended for 2010. And finally, for capital expenditures, we expect those to be in the range of $600 million in 2010 as well.Now I'll turn to George."

For the fourth quarter 2009, product sales increased 2% year-over-year, with U.S. declining 1%, primarily due to Aranesp® that Bob mentioned, and international growing 11% with g",1651,"Okay, Thanks, Bob. let's go right to the commercial highlights on Slide 10. For the fourth quarter 2009, product sales increased 2% year-over-year, with U.S. declining 1%, primarily due to Aranesp® that Bob mentioned, and international growing 11% with growth across all products. The U.S. Aranesp® decline of 20% was due to the 2008 label change, and was largely offset by gains at EPOGEN®, which saw a record quarter. Internationally, our European business continued its strong performance with 7% growth, with new product launches and new territories both contributing.For the full year of 2009, global product sales declined 2% year-over-year, driven mainly by Aranesp® in the U.S., wholesaler inventories and foreign exchange. U.S. sales declined 3% year-over-year with an Aranesp® sales decline of 24%, offset by the remainder of the sales portfolio which grew 1%.In addition, U.S. wholesaler inventories declined during 2009, accounting for $70 million reduction in sales. This compares with an inventory growth of $130 million in 2008, resulting from the introduction of Enbrel® into this channel. The difference contributed approximately $200 million to the year-over-year sales decline.International sales grew 6%, driven largely by Neulasta® and Vectibix®. An unfavorable foreign exchange comparison with 2008 reduced our international full-year results by $213 million, leading to flat sales.The next slide graphically illustrates the components of year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, excluding the foreign exchange gain. U.S. Aranesp® was the only major component of our product portfolio to decline in the fourth quarter and was offset by 2% growth in our other products. I'll discuss each of the product results in more details in a moment.But first, Slide 12 shows the effect of changes in inventory we've had on our quarterly sales. As you can see, a buildup of inventory in the second half of 2008 depressed sales in the first quarter of 2009. This slide also illustrates the difference in inventory build by the wholesalers in the fourth quarter of each of the past three years, with 2009 showing very little year-end buildup. We expect that this will reduce the depressing effect of inventory burn off which we saw in quarter one 2009.From a full-year perspective as I mentioned, U.S. wholesaler inventory was a significant negative factor in year-over-year performance at a approximately $200 million down. Quarter-end wholesaler inventories are affected by many factors including the day, the week that a quarter ends, wholesaler shipping schedules, end user buying patterns, wholesaler working capital decisions and credit availability and cost. Over time, of course, demand drives average wholesale inventory levels.Turning to Aranesp®, worldwide Aranesp® sales decreased 8% in the fourth quarter versus last year. In the U.S., Aranesp® sales were down 20% year over year. ESA labels changes made in August, 2008 were the primary reason for this decline. Wholesaler inventory fluctuations also contributed to the year-over-year decline, accounting for roughly 7% of the total. Internationally, Aranesp® sales were flat, excluding foreign exchange and grew 4% including foreign exchange.Slide 14 displayed actual weekly U.S. Aranesp® sales going back to quarter four 2007. As a reminder, the sharp peaks and troughs seen in the blue weekly sales line are largely a result of inventory build ups and depletions, not fluctuations in actual patient utilization. At the end of the third quarter 2009, Aranesp® inventory was above the high end of the normal range. In the fourth quarter, inventory return to the midpoint of the normal range. The decline in the blue weekly sales line you see in the fourth quarter is due to this downward inventory move, as well us business adjustments that occurred late in the quarter.The red trend lines reflect average weekly sales for each quarter. Wholesaler inventory fluctuations and business adjustments are excluded from the averages, in order to provide a true quarter-on-quarter comparison more reflective of patient utilization. As you can see, average weekly sales have only slightly declined in the fourth quarter 2009 versus the third quarter.While we believe the ESA labeling changes made in 2008 are fully reflective in clinical practices, several events will occur in 2010 that could further impact Aranesp® sales.We expect the REMS to be finalized in the first quarter of this year and cannot rule out an additional step down in Aranesp® sales as a result. In response to the TREAT data, we have already updated the U.S. labeling for ESAs, and further labeling changes may be undertaking as further analysis and review of the data occur. Our analysis of the Aranesp® weekly sales in the U.S. is that when adjusted for inventory levels and one-time accrual adjustments, we have not seen any material impact from TREAT data availability.And CMS has scheduled MEDCAC meeting in March to gather information on the use of ESAs in a nephrology setting. The meeting will determine any further action and coverage repayment policy, and we'll update you on subsequent quarters, as more information becomes available as a result of these events.Next is EPOGEN®. EPOGEN® grew by 9% in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus the fourth quarter of 2008, driven by patient growth, increased dose utilization and an increase in net price. For the full year, net sales increased 5%, driven by patient growth, increased dose utilization and a net price increase. For 2010, dose fluctuations may continue as healthcare practitioners continue to refine the treatment practices in order to maintain hemoglobin levels in the 10g/dL to 12g/dL range. We will comment on the final CMS bundling rules once released in the next few months.Next slide, Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® combined grew 2% in the fourth quarter '09 versus the fourth quarter '08. In the U.S., sales were flat with units in price combined, up 5% and inventory and business adjustments down 5%. Neulasta® and  NEUPOGEN® wholesaler inventory levels exited fourth quarter '09 at the low end of normal range. Internationally, the Neulasta® and NEUPOGEN® increased 9% year-on-year, including foreign exchange.Enbrel® is next on Slide 17. Net sales were essentially flat versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Demand was also flat with price growth offset by unit decline. The unit decline was primarily in Dermatology, where we lost some share year-over-year to new competition. During the fourth quarter, U.S. Enbrel® maintains its leadership position in both Rheumatology and Dermatology. In Rheumatology, Enbrel® captured around a 35% dollar share during the quarter, a slight increase versus the prior quarter. And in Dermatology, despite the launch of new competition early in the fourth quarter, Enbrel® continued to get the majority of the first-line biologic use for psoriasis, capturing 57% of the dollar share in this segment during the quarter.On prior calls, we've discussed that both Rheumatology and Dermatology segments have historically been impacted by seasonality, with softness typically seen in the first quarter as some patients choose to forgo filling prescriptions when they face resetting deductibles, higher co-pays and other insurance changes. This year, we have stepped up our efforts to assist patients working through these challenges via specific new offerings in our existing Enbrel® support program. We also continue to enhance our co-pay program, which offers support for co-pays, coinsurance and prescription deductibles. It's too early to make a call on the success of these new programs at this point, but the early data we've seen is encouraging.Again, full-year comparisons between 2008 and 2009 were impacted by a combination of modest 2009 inventory drawdown and a large 2008 inventory buildup. For an Enbrel®, the combined year-on-year effect was approximately $120 million and without the same impact, Enbrel® would have grown slightly in 2009.On to Sensipar® in Slide 18. For the fourth quarter, worldwide Sensipar® sales grew 12% versus the fourth quarter of 2008, comprised of an 8% increase in demand, a 2% increase in foreign exchange and a 2% increase in inventory and business adjustments. Again, as we learn more about how oral drug such as Sensipar® will be handled in 2011 ESRD bundle, we'll be in a better position to communicate on the potential impact.Next slide, Vectibix sales grew 43% in the fourth quarter '09 versus the fourth quarter '08. And during the quarter, we saw a growth in the U.S. EGFR colorectal cancer segment for the first time since the second quarter 2008. As I mentioned on our third quarter call, Vectibix's future growth is dependent upon label expansion into second- and first-line metastatic colorectal cancer. International sales continue to be strong for Vectibix representing 61% of fourth quarter sales.The next slide summarizes our international sales performance. Internationally, sales grew 8% excluding divested products and the effects of foreign exchange versus the prior year. Growth was driven by Neulasta conversion, new product launches and expansion into new territories. On the next slide, we'll look at the international segment share for Aranesp in nephrology followed by Filgrastim.As in recent quarters, Aranesp nephrology share remains steady as biosimilars continue to take share from Epo alfa and Epo beta. MIRCERA® group continues arrive largely from NeoRecormon. My last Slide provides comparable for the G-CSF market. To date, biosimilar uptake is only slightly faster than what we saw with ESA. So as Arvind mentioned, I thought I'd finish up with a few thoughts on the Prolia launch. Roger will provide a regulatory update in a moment, but I wanted to revisit some points we made during our Analyst Day in late 2008. First, we believe Prolia addresses a significant unmet need in postmenopausal osteoporosis, especially among high-risk and non-compliant patients. For reimbursement and fulfillment reasons, we expect early trial in the highest risk in most unsatisfied patients before a more widespread adoption. And in Europe, EMEA approval may proceed reimbursement authority proof of pricing by many months, particularly in larger markets such as France, Spain and Italy.One final comment regarding U.S. Prolia sales force, in advance of the Prolia launch, the sales force are currently being trained on Enbrel, and will soon start detailing primary care doctors to generate referrals to dermatologists for psoriasis and rheumatologists for rheumatoid arthritis.

As noted on Slide 24, we completed five phase III metatrials, all of which delivered data on schedule and within a six-week period. Including among these were two studies demonstrating the ability of denosumab to delay bony complications in patients with metastatic bone disease. Two studies of Vectibix used in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of colorectal cancer and to treat outcome study exploring the benefits and risks of anemia treatment in patients with chronic kidney disease who do not yet require analysis.Also in 2009, we advanced three drug candidates into formal dose ranging studies. AMG 785, our Sclerostin antibody that we are developing in partnership with UCB, is being evaluated in postmenopausal osteoporosis and as a means for improving fracture healing. AMG 827 and anti-IL 17 receptor antibody is being evaluated in psoriasis and in other inflammatory diseases, and AMG 853, a small molecule prostanoid receptor antagonist is being evaluated in asthma. We added eight new molecules to our development roster, including a Phase II glucokinase activator that we license from Array BioPharma in the fourth quarter. And we exercise our option for AMG 423, a very exciting potential treatment for heart failure that was originally discovered by Cytokinetics. We also received quite a bit of external recognition last year, including the Scrip Awards for Best Overall Pipeline and for Best New Drug in Nplate, and TIME magazine cited denosumab is one of 2009's Top 10 Medical Breakthroughs. As we announced in December on Slide 25, we received a positive opinion from the CHMP with the approval of Prolia to reduce fracture risk in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis and high-risk for fracture and in men undergoing treatment for prostate cancer with androgen deprivation therapy. Formal EU adoption of the market authorization is expected in the relatively near future. Here in the United States, in mid-December, we received detailed comments on our Prolia file from the FDA related to the complete response letters that were sent in mid-October. The questions posed by the FDA related principally to the conduct of post-marketing surveillance. We completed a very comprehensive response to the agency at the end of last week. And as Kevin mentioned, we've submitted our complete response dossier for their review. Discussions with regulatory agencies in Australia, Canada and Switzerland are also progressing.In 2009, we obtained very impressive results using denosumab to reduce the risk of skeletal-related events meaning fractures, the need for surgery or radio therapy to treat bone pathology or spinal cord compression in patients with metastatic bone disease. Our two phase III studies, one in patients with breast cancer and the second in patients with a variety of other solid tumors or multiple myeloma will be complemented by a third study in patients with prostate cancer. We expect results from this third study during the first quarter of 2010.As I mentioned previously, we obtained positive data with respect to progression-free survival for Vectibix when used in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Our studies provided the first prospective data demonstrating that patients whose tumors contain a mutated version of the KRAS gene derive no benefit from Vectibix therapy. This finding is in accord with our previous studies and those of other groups. To support the view that the EGF receptor, the target of Vectibix therapy, delivers signals to the KRAS signaling pathway. Illegitimate activation of this pathway through acquired somatic mutations in cancer cells in essence to short circuits EGF receptor drive signals, hence obviating any therapeutic effect of EGF receptor blockade.As noted on the slide, we continue to derive important information from the treat outcome study, which address the benefits and risks associated with Aranesp therapy to a hemoglobin target of 13 grams per deciliter in patients with chronic kidney disease who are not yet on dialysis. I wish to reiterate as we made plain in our publication in the fourth quarter that although Aranesp treatment of this higher hemoglobin target reduce the risk of blood transfusions, there was no statistically significant effect on all-cause mortality or cardiovascular morbidity which was the primary endpoint of the study. Moreover, we saw that this treatment, which is more aggressive than that which is recommended in our label was associated with a very significant increase in the frequency of cerebrovascular events. We concluded that for many patients in this population, the risks of therapy will exceed the benefit that could be derived in terms of transfusion reduction. Much additional work remains to be completed using the very comprehensive treat database and there's much still to learn about ESA therapy in patients with renal insufficiency. I'll have more to say about this in a few minutes.Turning then to Slide 26, our pipeline continues to advance. Data from the prostate cancer skeletal-related events study comparing denosumab with zoledronic acid will as I said become available during the first quarter of 2010 and we will have data from our metastasis prevention study in prostate cancer in the second half of the year. Keep in mind that these and other studies are event driven and hence, it is not possible for me to define precisely when the endpoint will be reached. They're also initiating a metastasis prevention study in women with breast cancer having reviewed the protocol in some detail with the FDA.I should also note that we have initiated a male osteoporosis study with the goal of providing data that will complement those already obtained in postmenopausal women treated with Prolia. As noted on the slide, the EVOLVE study, which assesses all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in dialysis patients treated with Sensipar/Mimpara®, is now expected to complete in 2011 based on our event rate tracking metrics and the predictive algorithms that we use. Similarly, though enrollment in the phase III study of Motesanib in non-small cell lung cancer is nearly complete. The current event rate data suggests that the study will complete in 2011 rather than at the end of 2010 as we have previously thought. And both of these cases, I must again add the caveat that the completion of the event-driven studies is often difficult to estimate with confidence.Finally our Phase II study of AMG 386, a peptibody that antagonizes both Angiopoietin 1 and Angiopoietin 2, yielded strong evidence for a therapeutic benefit. And hence, we are proceeding with a Phase III trial is ovarian cancer. I remind you that this is the very first clinical program directed at the angiopoietin axis, an angiogenesis target that we believe could be real useful in multi-tumor types. Data from the AMG 386 program will be presented at upcoming scientific meetings.Moving forward in 2010, there will be numerous opportunities to review our current understanding of anemia management. Slide 27 notes that we have made good progress working with the FDA on our REMS program, a follow-up from the most recent Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting on this topic. We expect that the REMS will be completed in the first quarter of 2010 and will be implemented thereafter. Two important forums for discussion, the Medicare Evidence and Coverage Advisory Committee which provides advise to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Cardio-Renal Advisory Committee which advises the FDA. We'll consider the implications of new data with respect to enema therapy in patients with renal insufficiency. Not surprisingly, there is a great deal to be learned from TREAT, the only large placebo-controlled study of patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis. We're looking forward to reviewing these data with the Advisory Committees and with their sponsoring agencies. Finally, the brisk pace of data released that we have established during the past 12 months will continue during the next month. As I show on my last slide, I'd mentioned the two denosumab Phase III studies that will provide data this year. In addition, we will also see the data from a study evaluating the use of Vectibix in combination with standard regimens in the treatment of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Additional data from numerous Phase II studies in oncology using AMG 386, AMG 479, AMG 655 and AMG 102 will also become available. Naturally, given the broad potential applicability of AMG 386 and the positive results that we have seen with this agent in patients with ovarian cancer, we are hopeful that many of the other tumor types understudy will also prove amenable to AMG 386-based therapy. We will also see data from the Phase II study of AMG 827 in psoriasis, which we expect to be very exciting. So 2010 will be an extremely busy year, I have much more to say about each of these programs in the coming months. Kevin?"

There's more work to be done there. I think that the information that we're getting from our SRE studies will be very relevant in terms of reinforcing the safety profile of denosumab in that setting, obviously, a 12x the dose of Prolia. And as we have that data to make available to FDA, I think that will catalyze some discussions about what can be done to gain the indication in treatment-induced bone loss."

When to do which studies? The thing that I was really -- in many ways most encouraging for the breast study were the results of the 136 SRE study. The superiority result that we observed versus zoledronic acid in that study gave us great confidence that we're having a pretty profound effect in the way on which breast cancer cells behave when they are in bone. And that encouraged us to think even more seriously about the breast cancer prevention study. So I think, if anything, that was more a go than certainly anything else. We have no results from the prostate study and won't until the second half of the year. So we're just waiting to see what happens. But you can expect that there will be differences in the way the metastasis progresses for these different tumor types and it's important I think to looking in both prostate and breast cancer cells, tumor cells, that they were metastasis to bone."

As I've said many times, RANK Ligand inhibition by denosumab in the human clinical setting or using OPG-Fc, is the most potent anti-resorptive method that's ever been introduced into clinical practice, whether in small rodents or in humans, and it has a very dramatic effect on the ability of tumors to gain access to bone in the preclinical setting.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we reflect on 2009, I'd like to make a few comments. First, the macroeconomic environment was the most challenging we have seen in our 30-year history. While no one can be fully-satisfied with the revenue decline, even a modest one, coming within a percent of the low end of our original revenue guidance in this environment was admirable.We once again meaningfully grew earnings per share and over the most recent five-year period, which includes the ESA business reset, we've grown earnings per share at a 15% compound annual growth rate, a very solid performance. We advanced the pipeline meaningfully in 2009, highlighted by a recommendation for Prolia approval in Europe, and a 15 to zero FDA advisory panel vote to recommend approval in the United States.We also managed the expenses and cash effectively as Arvind mentioned, and generated over $6 billion in operating cash flow to invest in growing the business and returning cash to shareholders. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues at Amgen for their tireless efforts in 2009 on behalf of patients and shareholders.Let's now turn to the current year 2010. 2010 is an important year. First, we will learn the course of healthcare reform. Today, it is impossible to confidently predict its course, so we have not included estimates about its possible financial consequences in our guidance. However, it is hard to imagine that what we saw a month ago will come to pass.Second, we predict for Amgen a return to top line growth and another solid year of earnings per share growth, with strong cash generation. We expect and are ready to launch Prolia worldwide. Predicting the exact timing of the approvals is challenging, however, we are not aware of any major issues. That said, predicting within a few months the exact timing is not possible. The most important points are that we expect approval and we are ready.I'd like to announce today that we have now submitted the information requested by the FDA in a Prolia complete response letter for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Also important, clinical results are forthcoming this year particularly the prostate SRE [skeletal-related event] Phase III trial. Roger will comment on the expected 2010 pipeline key events.We also expect the number of ESA-related important events this year, including REMs, MEDCAC and CardRAC [Cardio-Renal Advisory Committee] on which George will comment. We will continue to be efficient and look to deploy our strong balance sheet and cash flow to serve more patients, and over time, increase our top line growth rate.A few final thoughts before I turn it over to Bob. We have a shot over the next three to five years to deliver top-quartile industry growth performance. We are ready to launch Prolia. We have the financial resources and will to advance and then grow our pipeline based on a combination of internal innovation, collaboration and acquisition from outside. We have a clear understanding of our challenges and the ability to constructively manage them. Our team is aligned, committed and ready to move Amgen forward. Bob, over to you."

If I can direct your attention to Slide 5, I'll walk you through the adjusted P&L for the quarter. As you can see, year-over-year revenues were up about 2% in the fourth quarter to $3.8 billion, and let me just quickly note that excluding Aranesp, revenues were up 4% in the quarter.Shifting to a review of our business by geography, U.S. sales were down 1% to $2.9 billion for the quarter and again excluding Aranesp, U.S. sales were up 2% on a year-over-year basis. And George will have more to say about wholesaler inventory in a moment, but I want to note here that we exited the year with overall wholesaler inventory at the low end of our normal range. So what this means is that sales growth was adversely impacted by about $65 million in the year-over-year inventory changes, which represent about one day of sales for us in the U.S.Internationally, we posted a strong quarter with sales of $861 million, which represents an increase of 11% versus the prior year. Changes in foreign exchange positively impacted fourth quarter sales by $35 million. Now recall that foreign exchange negatively impacted us in the first, second and third quarters, so this is the only quarter of the year in which we were helped by foreign exchange.Turning now to operating expenses, as you can see on an adjusted basis, our total operating expenses were up 7% this quarter versus last year. Turning to the components of that, cost of sales for the quarter decreased by 3%, as efficiencies more than offset a less favorable product mix and higher sales volume.R&D expenses were up 12% year-over-year, and that's primarily driven by higher licensing fees of some $60 million associated with the Array BioPharma agreement, as well as higher staff-related costs and some costs associated with ongoing collaborations in our early and mid-stage pipeline. It's worth noting that sequentially, R&D expenses were higher in the fourth quarter versus the third, and I would point out that while we have typically seen an increase in our fourth quarter R&D expenses, this year that increase is more pronounced, again as a result of the Array transaction and certain investments in the early and mid-stage pipeline.Turning to SG&A expenses, SG&A increased 9% versus the same quarter last year and this increase includes the cost of hiring the Prolia primary care sales force. It's perhaps also worth noting that the fourth quarter represents the first full quarter in which the Prolia sales force was on board in the P&L. Once Prolia is launched, we expect Prolia-related expenses to increase as we begin promotional expenditures as well.In addition, SG&A expenses were higher in the quarter due to higher staff-related costs away from the Prolia sales force, which were offset to some extent by recoveries associated with the GlaxoSmithKline collaboration for Prolia. Excluding expenses associated with the Enbrel profit share, adjusted SG&A in the fourth quarter 2009 was up 13 % versus the same quarter last year. And sequentially, SG&A expenses were up and the increases in the fourth quarter this year were consistent with the historical spending patterns that we've seen in prior years.Shifting now to the tax rate for the quarter, as you can see, our adjusted rate for the quarter was 15.9% compared to 19% in the prior year. The reduction in 2009 was primarily due to increased manufacturing in Puerto Rico and the favorable tax impact of changes in revenue and expense mix, partially offset by the benefit of the extension of the federal R&D tax credit in the fourth quarter of 2008.Shifting now to EPS for the quarter, again, you can see that our fourth quarter 2009 adjusted EPS were $1.05, which is down 1% versus the prior year as the benefit of a lower tax rate and decreased share count were more than offset by increased R&D and SG&A expenses, which again primarily relate to Prolia and the Array BioPharma agreement in the fourth quarter. Our GAAP basis earnings per share were $0.92, which represents an increase of 6% over the prior year.Now shifting to the full-year of 2009 results on Slide 6, you can see for the full year, we reported earnings per share growth, as Kevin said earlier, of about 8%. Now let make a few comments about revenues. Year-over-year revenues were down 2% to $14.6 billion and when looking at the full year results, recall that the Aranesp label changed last year in the third quarter and that's reflected in these results. In addition, our results were negatively affected by a stronger dollar in the first three quarters of the year.Recall that last quarter, we indicated revenues were trending to the upper end of our guidance range of $14.4 billion to $14.8 billion. However, as a result of the decline in wholesaler inventory levels versus our expectations over the last few days of the year, full-year revenues ended just about the middle of our guidance range.Shifting to a review of our business by geography, U.S. sales were down 3% to $11.1 billion. Internationally, we posted sales of $3.2 billion in 2009, unchanged from last year. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange, which was some $213 million, total product sales decreased 1% and international sales increased 6%. And we achieved this in the face of increased competition from biosimilars in Europe.Turning now to operating expenses, again on an adjusted basis, our total operating expenses were down 3% versus last year, and we ended the year with an operating margin of 42.4%, which is an improvement over where we were in 2008. Efficiencies were key to enabling us to drive down across the sales by 5%, even though we were selling a less favorable product mix. R&D expenses decreased 6% year-over-year due to lower clinical trial costs, primarily for denosumab and Vectibix, as well as lower staff-related costs for the full year. As a percent of sales in 2009, R&D expenses were 19.1%.Turning again to SG&A, you can see that the expenses increased by 1% versus 2008 due to increased spending for activities associated with the anticipated launch of Prolia and increased promotional expenses for our marketed products. These full-year increases were partially offset by lower G&A expenses and expense recoveries associated with the GSK [GlaxoSmithKline] collaboration for Prolia. Enbrel profit shares were down $32 million year-over-year and excluding the Enbrel profit share, SG&A expenses increased 2% versus 2008.Turning now to the tax rate for the full year, let me just spend a few moments discussing our adjusted tax rate, which was 16.9% for the full year compared to 21.7% in 2008. And there are three main drivers for the lower rate in 2009: The first, recall that in the third quarter, we reached settlements with both the IRS and the State of California on certain prior year tax audits, the impact of which were specific for 2009; second, we had increased manufacturing and profits in Puerto Rico in 2009; and third, the tax rate benefited from some favorable changes in our revenue and expense mix during the course of the year.Turning now to earnings per share, 2009 adjusted earnings per share were $4.91, up 8%. And as you can see, earnings per share benefited from lower OpEx, as well as a decreased tax rate and decreased share count, following our buybacks this year. We ended the year with earnings at the low end of the guidance range, primarily due to the impact of the declines in U.S. wholesaler inventory levels and the Array BioPharma agreement, which we closed at the end of December. Our GAAP EPS for the full year were $4.51, up 20% on the prior year.Turning to Slide 7, you can see we ended the year with a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. Let me talk about a few of the key balance sheet items. Our year-end global cash balance was $13.4 billion. You see, we ended the year with $11.2 billion of debt and our adjusted-stockholders equity increased by $2 billion over the year to $22.4 billion. With respect to our cash flow, we generated approximately $6.3 billion of cash flow from operations in 2009, which represents an increase of 6% over the prior year. Capital expenditures for 2009 were approximately $500 million, which is down again for the second year in a row, thanks to improved productivity and efficiency in our capital programs.During year we repurchased 59 million shares, and with the additional $5 billion that our board authorized in December, we currently have $6 billion remaining under our authorized share repurchase programs.Turning now to Slide 8, I'll just walk you through 2010 guidance. We expect revenue to be in the range of $15.1 billion to $15.5 billion. This guidance range for 2010 accommodates growth in our base business, as well as the relevant range of timing for global Prolia launches, and excludes any impact from healthcare reform.As we prepare for the launch of Prolia, I've already noted that we expect to see associated increases in sales and marketing expenses. It is perhaps also worth noting that we would expect to see some increase in R&D staff-related costs associated with the launch of Prolia and to an extent, we may see a slight impact on across the sales once we've launched Prolia as well. But taking that into account, we do expect that both the cost of sales and the R&D margins to be roughly similar in 2010 as a percent of sales to what they were in 2009. That leads us to adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.05 to $5.25, and then finally, let me say a word about tax and capital expenditures. On tax, we expect our 2009 adjusted rate to be up to 16.9%, it's not reflective of what we will see in 2010. In 2010, we would expect the adjusted tax rate to be in the 20% to 21% range, which is clearly an improvement over where we were in 2008, when our adjusted rate was 21.7%. I would note also that this guidance assumes that the R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended for 2010. And finally, for capital expenditures, we expect those to be in the range of $600 million in 2010 as well. Now I'll turn to George."

For the fourth quarter 2009, product sales increased 2% year-over-year, with U.S. declining 1%, primarily due to Aranesp that Bob mentioned, and international growing 11% with growth across all products. The U.S. Aranesp decline of 20% was due to the 2008 label change, and was largely offset by gains at EPOGEN, which saw a record quarter. Internationally, our European business continued its strong performance with 7% growth, with new product launches and new territories both contributing.For the full year of 2009, global product sales declined 2% year-over-year, driven mainly by Aranesp in the U.S., wholesaler inventories and foreign exchange. U.S. sales declined 3% year-over-year with an Aranesp sales decline of 24%, offset by the remainder of the sales portfolio which grew 1%.In addition, U.S. wholesaler inventories declined during 2009, accounting for $70 million reduction in sales. This compares with an inventory growth of $130 million in 2008, resulting from the introduction of Enbrel into this channel. The difference contributed approximately $200 million to the year-over-year sales decline.International sales grew 6%, driven largely by Neulasta and Vectibix. An unfavorable foreign exchange comparison with 2008 reduced our international full-year results by $213 million, leading to flat sales.The next slide graphically illustrates the components of year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, excluding the foreign exchange gain. U.S. Aranesp was the only major component of our product portfolio to decline in the fourth quarter and was offset by 2% growth in our other products. I'll discuss each of the product results in more details in a moment.But first, Slide 12 shows the effect of changes in inventory we've had on our quarterly sales. As you can see, a buildup of inventory in the second half of 2008 depressed sales in the first quarter of 2009. This slide also illustrates the difference in inventory build by the wholesalers in the fourth quarter of each of the past three years, with 2009 showing very little year-end buildup. We expect that this will reduce the depressing effect of inventory burn off which we saw in quarter one 2009.From a full-year perspective as I mentioned, U.S. wholesaler inventory was a significant negative factor in year-over-year performance at an approximately $200 million down. Quarter-end wholesaler inventories are affected by many factors including the day, the week that a quarter ends, wholesaler shipping schedules, end user buying patterns, wholesaler working capital decisions and credit availability and cost. Over time, of course, demand drives average wholesale inventory levels.Turning to Aranesp, worldwide Aranesp sales decreased 8% in the fourth quarter versus last year. In the U.S., Aranesp sales were down 20% year over year. ESA labels changes made in August, 2008 were the primary reason for this decline. Wholesaler inventory fluctuations also contributed to the year-over-year decline, accounting for roughly 7% of the total. Internationally, Aranesp sales were flat, excluding foreign exchange and grew 4% including foreign exchange.Slide 14 displayed actual weekly U.S. Aranesp sales going back to quarter four 2007. As a reminder, the sharp peaks and troughs seen in the blue weekly sales line are largely a result of inventory build ups and depletions, not fluctuations in actual patient utilization. At the end of the third quarter 2009, Aranesp inventory was above the high end of the normal range. In the fourth quarter, inventory return to the midpoint of the normal range. The decline in the blue weekly sales line you see in the fourth quarter is due to this downward inventory move, as well us business adjustments that occurred late in the quarter.The red trend lines reflect average weekly sales for each quarter. Wholesaler inventory fluctuations and business adjustments are excluded from the averages, in order to provide a true quarter-on-quarter comparison more reflective of patient utilization. As you can see, average weekly sales have only slightly declined in the fourth quarter 2009 versus the third quarter. While we believe the ESA labeling changes made in 2008 are fully reflective in clinical practices, several events will occur in 2010 that could further impact Aranesp sales.We expect the REMS to be finalized in the first quarter of this year and cannot rule out an additional step down in Aranesp sales as a result. In response to the TREAT data, we have already updated the U.S. labeling for ESAs, and further labeling changes may be undertaking as further analysis and review of the data occur. Our analysis of the Aranesp weekly sales in the U.S. is that when adjusted for inventory levels and one-time accrual adjustments, we have not seen any material impact from TREAT data availability.And CMS has scheduled MEDCAC meeting in March to gather information on the use of ESAs in a nephrology setting. The meeting will determine any further action and coverage repayment policy, and we'll update you on subsequent quarters, as more information becomes available as a result of these events.Next is EPOGEN®. EPOGEN® grew by 9% in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus the fourth quarter of 2008, driven by patient growth, increased dose utilization and an increase in net price. For the full year, net sales increased 5%, driven by patient growth, increased dose utilization and a net price increase. For 2010, dose fluctuations may continue as healthcare practitioners continue to refine the treatment practices in order to maintain hemoglobin levels in the 10g/dL to 12g/dL range. We will comment on the final CMS bundling rules once released in the next few months.Next slide, Neulasta and NEUPOGEN combined grew 2% in the fourth quarter '09 versus the fourth quarter '08. In the U.S., sales were flat with units in price combined, up 5% and inventory and business adjustments down 5%. Neulasta and  NEUPOGEN wholesaler inventory levels exited fourth quarter '09 at the low end of normal range. Internationally, the Neulasta and NEUPOGEN increased 9% year-on-year, including foreign exchange.Enbrel is next on Slide 17. Net sales were essentially flat versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Demand was also flat with price growth offset by unit decline. The unit decline was primarily in Dermatology, where we lost some share year-over-year to new competition. During the fourth quarter, U.S. Enbrel maintains its leadership position in both Rheumatology and Dermatology. In Rheumatology, Enbrel captured around a 35% dollar share during the quarter, a slight increase versus the prior quarter. And in Dermatology, despite the launch of new competition early in the fourth quarter, Enbrel continued to get the majority of the first-line biologic use for psoriasis, capturing 57% of the dollar share in this segment during the quarter.On prior calls, we've discussed that both Rheumatology and Dermatology segments have historically been impacted by seasonality, with softness typically seen in the first quarter as some patients choose to forgo filling prescriptions when they face resetting deductibles, higher co-pays and other insurance changes. This year, we have stepped up our efforts to assist patients working through these challenges via specific new offerings in our existing Enbrel support program. We also continue to enhance our co-pay program, which offers support for co-pays, coinsurance and prescription deductibles. It's too early to make a call on the success of these new programs at this point, but the early data we've seen is encouraging.Again, full year comparisons between 2008 and 2009 were impacted by a combination of modest 2009 inventory drawdown and a large 2008 inventory buildup. For an Enbrel, the combined year-on-year effect was approximately $120 million and without the same impact, Enbrel would have grown slightly in 2009.On to Sensipar in Slide 18. For the fourth quarter, worldwide Sensipar sales grew 12% versus the fourth quarter of 2008, comprised of an 8% increase in demand, a 2% increase in foreign exchange and a 2% increase in inventory and business adjustments. Again, as we learn more about how oral drug such as Sensipar will be handled in 2011 ESRD [end stage renal disease] bundle, we'll be in a better position to communicate on its potential impact.Next slide, Vectibix sales grew 43% in the fourth quarter '09 versus the fourth quarter '08. And during the quarter, we saw a growth in the U.S. EGFr [epidermal growth factor receptor] Colorectal Cancer segment for the first time since the second quarter 2008. As I mentioned on our third quarter call, Vectibix's future growth is dependent upon label expansion into second- and first-line metastatic colorectal cancer. International sales continue to be strong for Vectibix, representing 61% of fourth quarter sales.The next slide summarizes our International sales performance. Internationally, sales grew 8% excluding divested products and the effects of foreign exchange versus the prior year. Growth was driven by Neulasta conversion, new product launches and expansion into new territories. On the next slide, we'll look at the International segment share for Aranesp in nephrology followed by Filgrastim. As in recent quarters, Aranesp nephrology share remains steady as biosimilars continue to take share from Epo alfa and Epo beta. And Mircera growth continues to arrive largely from NeoRecormon. My last slide provides comparable data for the G-CSF market. To date, biosimilar uptake is only slightly faster than what we saw with ESA. So as Arvind mentioned, I thought I'd finish up with a few thoughts on the Prolia launch. Roger will provide a regulatory update in a moment but I wanted to revisit some points we made during our Analyst Day in late 2008. First, we believe Prolia addresses a significant unmet need in postmenopausal osteoporosis, especially among high-risk and non-compliant patients. For reimbursement and fulfillment reasons, we expect early trial in the highest-risk and most unsatisfied patients before a more widespread adoption. And in Europe, EMEA approval may precede reimbursement authority approval of pricing by many months, particularly in larger markets such as France, Spain and Italy.One final comment regarding U.S. Prolia sales force, in advance of the Prolia launch, the sales force are currently being trained on Enbrel and will soon start detailing primary care doctors to generate referrals to dermatologists for psoriasis and rheumatologists for rheumatoid arthritis. Roger?"

As noted on Slide 24, we completed five Phase III mega-trials, all of which delivered data on schedule and within a six-week period. Including among these were two studies demonstrating the ability of denosumab to delay bony complications in patients with metastatic bone disease, two studies of Vectibix used in combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of colorectal cancer and the TREAT [Trial to Reduce Cardiovascular Events with Aranesp Therapy] outcome study exploring the benefits and risks of anemia treatment in patients with chronic kidney disease, who do not yet require dialysis.Also in 2009, we advanced three drug candidates into formal dose-ranging studies. AMG 785, our sclerostin antibody that we are developing in partnership with UCB, is being evaluated in postmenopausal osteoporosis and as a means for improving fracture healing. AMG 827, an anti-IL-17 receptor antibody, is being evaluated in psoriasis and in other inflammatory diseases. And AMG 853, a small molecule prostanoid receptor antagonist, is being evaluated in asthma. We added eight new molecules to our development roster, including a Phase II glucokinase activator that we licensed from Array BioPharma in the fourth quarter. And we exercised our option for AMG 423, a very exciting potential treatment for heart failure that was originally discovered by Cytokinetics. We also received quite a bit of external recognition last year, including the Scrip Awards for Best Overall Pipeline and for Best New Drug in Nplate, and TIME magazine cited denosumab as one of 2009's Top 10 Medical Breakthroughs. As we announced in December, on Slide 25, we received a positive opinion from the CHMP [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use] with the approval of Prolia to reduce fracture risk in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis and high-risk for fracture, and in men undergoing treatment for prostate cancer with androgen deprivation therapy. Formal EU adoption of the market authorization is expected in the relatively near future. Here in the United States, in mid-December, we received detailed comments on our Prolia file from the FDA related to the complete response letters that were sent in mid-October. The questions posed by the FDA related principally to the conduct of post-marketing surveillance. We completed a very comprehensive response to the agency at the end of last week. And as Kevin mentioned, we have submitted our complete response dossier for their review. Discussions with regulatory agencies in Australia, Canada and Switzerland are also progressing.In 2009, we obtained very impressive results using denosumab to reduce the risk of skeletal-related events, meaning fractures, the need for surgery or radiotherapy to treat bone pathology or spinal cord compression in patients with metastatic bone disease. Our two Phase III studies, one in patients with breast cancer and the second in patients with a variety of other solid tumors or multiple myeloma, will be complemented by a third study in patients with prostate cancer. We expect results from this third study during the first quarter of 2010.As I mentioned previously, we obtained positive data with respect to progression-free survival for Vectibix when used in combination with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Our studies provided the first prospective data demonstrating that patients whose tumors contain a mutated version of the KRAS gene derive no benefit from Vectibix therapy. This finding is in accord with our previous studies and those of other groups to support the view that the EGF receptor, the target of Vectibix therapy, delivers signals through the KRAS signaling pathway, illegitimate activation of this pathway through acquired somatic mutations in cancer cells, in essence, to short circuits EGF receptor drive signals, hence obviating any therapeutic effect of EGF receptor blockade.As noted on the slide, we continue to derive important information from the TREAT outcome study, which address the benefits and risks associated with Aranesp therapy to a hemoglobin target of 13 grams per deciliter in patients with chronic kidney disease who are not yet on dialysis. I wish to reiterate, as we made plain in our publication in the fourth quarter, that although Aranesp treatment of this higher hemoglobin target reduce the risk of blood transfusions, there was no statistically significant effect on all-cause mortality or cardiovascular morbidity, which was the primary endpoint of the study. Moreover, we saw that this treatment, which is more aggressive than that which is recommended in our label, was associated with a very significant increase in the frequency of cerebrovascular events. We concluded that for many patients in this population, the risks of therapy will exceed the benefit that could be derived in terms of transfusion reduction. Much additional work remains to be completed using the very comprehensive TREAT database. And there's much still to learn about ESA therapy in patients with renal insufficiency. I'll have more to say about this in a few minutes.Turning then to Slide 26, our pipeline continues to advance. Data from the prostate cancer skeletal-related events study comparing denosumab with zoledronic acid will, as I said, become available during the first quarter of 2010. And we will have data from our metastasis prevention study in prostate cancer in the second half of the year. Keep in mind that these and other studies are event driven and hence, it is not possible for me to define precisely when the endpoint will be reached. We are also initiating a metastasis prevention study in women with breast cancer, having reviewed the protocol in some detail with the FDA.I should also note that we have initiated a male osteoporosis study with the goal of providing data that will complement those already obtained in postmenopausal women treated with Prolia. As noted on the slide, the EVOLVE [Evaluation of Cinacalcet Therapy to Lower Cardiovascular Events] study, which assesses all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in dialysis patients treated with Sensipar/Mimpara, is now expected to complete in 2011 based on our event rate tracking metrics and the predictive algorithms that we use. Similarly, though enrollment in the Phase III study of motesanib in non-small cell lung cancer is nearly complete. The current event rate data suggests that the study will complete in 2011 rather than at the end of 2010 as we have previously thought. In both of these cases, I must again add the caveat that the completion of the event-driven studies is often difficult to estimate with confidence.Finally our Phase II study of AMG 386, a peptibody that antagonizes both Angiopoietin 1 and Angiopoietin 2, yielded strong evidence for a therapeutic benefit. And hence, we are proceeding with a Phase III trial is ovarian cancer. I remind you that this is the very first clinical program directed at the angiopoietin axis, an angiogenesis target that we believe could be real useful in multi-tumor types. Data from the AMG 386 program will be presented at upcoming scientific meetings.Moving forward in 2010, there will be numerous opportunities to review our current understanding of anemia management. Slide 27 notes that we have made good progress working with the FDA on our REMS program, a follow-up from the most recent Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting on this topic. We expect that the REMS will be completed in the first quarter of 2010 and will be implemented thereafter. Two important forums for discussion, the Medicare Evidence and Coverage Advisory Committee which provides advise to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Cardio-Renal Advisory Committee which advises the FDA. We'll consider the implications of new data with respect to enema therapy in patients with renal insufficiency. Not surprisingly, there is a great deal to be learned from TREAT, the only large placebo-controlled study of patients with chronic kidney disease not on dialysis. We're looking forward to reviewing these data with the Advisory Committees and with their sponsoring agencies. Finally, the brisk pace of data released that we have established during the past 12 months will continue during the next month. As I show on my last slide, I'd mentioned the two denosumab Phase III studies that will provide data this year. In addition, we will also see the data from a study evaluating the use of Vectibix in combination with standard regimens in the treatment of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Additional data from numerous Phase II studies in oncology using AMG 386, AMG 479, AMG 655 and AMG 102 will also become available. Naturally, given the broad potential applicability of AMG 386 and the positive results that we have seen with this agent in patients with ovarian cancer, we are hopeful that many of the other tumor types understudy will also prove amenable to AMG 386-based therapy. We will also see data from the Phase II study of AMG 827 in psoriasis, which we expect to be very exciting. So 2010 will be an extremely busy year, I have much more to say about each of these programs in the coming months. Kevin?"

And then the question is when to do which things, when to do which studies. The thing that I was really -- in many ways, most encouraging for the breasts study were the results of the 136 SRE study. The superiority result that we observed versus zoledronic acid in that study gave us great confidence that we're having a pretty profound effect in the way in which breast cancer cells behave when they are in bone. And that encouraged us to think even more seriously about the breast cancer prevention study. So I think, if anything, that was more a go certainly than anything else. We have no results from the prostate study and won't until the second half of the year. So we're just waiting to see what happens.

As Arvind mentioned, we're pleased with our first quarter results, and I want to thank all of Amgen staff who worked so hard to deliver them on behalf of patients and shareholders. As you'll see, when George talks, our base business of marketed products in the U.S. is performing well. And we note the continued strong growth from our International business. Arvind talked about Healthcare Reform, and we will provide you with granularity today about how Healthcare Reform will affect us, George will, with Bob's help, will talk about that, but I'd like to give you some perspective.
Healthcare Reform will come at us in basically three ways: One is cost to our marketed products that George will outline; another will be a fee later, almost a tax-like thing; and the third thing is the preservation of the framework for innovation, and importantly, the new follow-on biologics framework, which we believe is fair to innovators, it lets new entrants come in and it gives patients and doctors the right framework. We think that's particularly important development and good for our industry and good for patients.
When we provided our guidance for 2010 in January, as you recall, we did not include the impact of Healthcare Reform. And now that we can see the details, we've got a better sense of the probable impact. And I'm pleased to note that we will be able to stay within the previous guidance range, although at the low end, but I consider that a prudent move. As I also said in my quote, we will take steps over time to address some of the new costs in Healthcare Reform, and we'll have more details on that as time goes on. 
Obviously, this year, we're all keenly anticipating the launch of Prolia in the United States and in Europe. Roger will give you more color on that. I'm sure it will be part of our conversation, but I must say, I am in a very optimistic place right now. We're not going to predict any timing but I feel very, very good about where we are around the world. We have in the U.S. a world-class sales force. We've retained the people we hired, they're busy working. And in markets outside the U.S. and Japan, we have a collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline that we are increasingly pleased with. We're also enthusiastic about denosumab's potential to help people with cancer, and we'll file for that indication, Roger will talk about that.
So when I think about what we're trying to do here, it's a fairly enduring set of objectives. We want to deliver financially, I'm confident we will. We want to advance the pipeline that features, of course, right now, most prominently Prolia and denosumab, but there are many other things in the pipeline we're interested in. Expanding internationally has been a priority for us over the years, and we continue to do that, I'm pleased with the progress. And as always, we want to create value for shareholders as we try to advance the business and serve patients.
With these introductory comments, I'll turn it over to Bob, who can begin to talk more about the detailed financial dimensions of this quarter. Bob?"

On Page 5, I'll walk you thorough the adjusted P&L for the quarter. And as you can see, year-over-year revenues were up 9% in the first quarter to $3.6 billion.

And as you can see, year-over-year revenues were up 9% in the first quarter to $3.6 billion. And in terms of the geographic mix of our revenues, let me point out a few things about our U.S. sales, which were up 7% to $2.7 billion for the quarter. First, note that excluding Aranesp, which was down for the quarter, U.S. sales were otherwise up 9% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting the strength of our core franchises. Second, with respect to wholesale inventories, note that we exited the quarter in the U.S. with overall wholesaler inventories at the mid to low end of our normal ranges. And finally, in the first quarter, U.S. revenues include a $33 million accrual for Healthcare Reform. We expect the full year 2010 impact of Healthcare Reform to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million. And George will speak in some detail in a moment about Healthcare Reform and its impact on our business.
Shifting out to international revenues, we posted a strong quarter, with sales of $851 million, which represents an increase of 16% versus the prior year. Changes in foreign exchange positively impacted the first quarter sales by $39 million. Without that benefit, international sales were still up a strong 10% year-over-year. 
Turning now to operating expenses, on an adjusted basis, our total operating expenses were up 8% this quarter versus last year. And in terms of the components, let me walk you through them. Our cost of sales margin decreased 0.3% this quarter, primarily driven by efficiencies and lower royalties. That, together with the higher average net selling prices and favorable foreign exchange, largely offset the impact of the less-favorable product mix for us in the quarter, enabling us to drive up our gross margin.
R&D expenses were up about 2%, primarily driven by higher staff-related costs and lower partnership expense recoveries, which in turn were partially offset by the lower clinical trial costs for the quarter following the completion of our denosumab's skeletal-related event studies.
Shifting to SG&A, you can see our SG&A expenses were up 13% versus the same quarter last year. This increase includes higher staff-related costs and spending for activities in anticipation of the launch of Prolia. Once Prolia is approved, we expect Prolia-related expenses to further increase, as we begin promotional expenditures as well. And recall,  when looking to these numbers within the first quarter of 2009, we have not yet hire the U.S. Prolia sales force, and that explains part the difference you're seeing this year.
In addition, SG&A expenses were higher due to the higher expenses associated with our Enbrel profit share, as well as higher litigation expenses, which in turn were somewhat offset by expense recoveries associated with our new collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline in connection with Prolia. Excluding expenses associated with the Enbrel profit share, adjusted SG&A in the first quarter increased 15% versus the same quarter last year. 
Moving now to the tax rate, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20% compared to 21.5% for the prior year. This reduction was primarily due to increased manufacturing and profits in Puerto Rico and the favorable tax impact of changes in our revenue and expense mix, which were partially offset by the lack of benefit from the federal R&D tax credit in the first quarter of this year. In terms of earnings per share, our first quarter adjusted EPS were $1.30, which is an increase of 20% versus the prior year. And on a GAAP basis, we earned $1.18, which is up 20% versus the prior year.
As you can see on Page 6, we once again ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and strong cash flows. Our global first quarter ending cash balance was $14.1 billion and we ended the quarter with $12.2 billion of debt. And to remind you, during the quarter, we issued $1 billion of debt, which will in part help us retire our next debt maturity of $2.5 billion in February of 2011. 
With respect to our cash flows, we generated about $900 million of cash flow from operations in the first quarter, which was an improvement of about 6% versus last year. Our cash flow from operations for the last 12 months was about $6.4 billion. 
CapEx for the first quarter was $94 million. And on a weighted average, fully diluted shares outstanding basis for the quarter, we had 988 million shares after repurchasing approximately 29 million shares during the first quarter at a cost of about $1.7 billion. We have $4.3 billion remaining under our board authorized stock repurchase programs as of the end of the quarter.
Shifting now to guidance on Slide 7. Taking into account our first quarter performance and the impact of Healthcare Reform, we now expect, as Kevin said earlier, revenue to be towards the low end of our current guidance range of $15.1 billion to $15.5 billion. And the guidance range for 2010 now includes the expected impact from Healthcare Reform of some $200 million to $250 million. 
Before I turn to EPS, I'll address operating expenses. And let me remind you that our typical spending patterns are weighted towards the second half of the year, and that will be particularly true in 2010 as we make additional investments to support the launch of Prolia globally. Compared to the first quarter, you should expect operating expenses to ramp up for the remainder of the year. And on a full year basis, we expect an increase of operating expenses in the mid-single-digit range for 2010 versus 2009 due to the anticipated global Prolia launch. 
In light of Healthcare Reform, as Kevin also noted, we're looking at the appropriate changes to the growth in our expenses, and we'll have more to say about that later in the year. We now expect adjusted EPS to be towards the low end of our current guidance range of $5.05 to $5.25 for 2010. And with respect to the tax rate, we continue to expect our 2010 adjusted rate to be in the range of 20% to 21%.  And just as a reminder, this assumes that the R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended for 2010. And finally, we expect capital expenditures to approximate $600 million in 2010. With that, I'll turn it over to George."

And let's go right to the commercial highlights in Slide 9. Product sales grew by $290 million or 9% year-on-year, aided by several factors: Global demand increases for all products except Aranesp, with particular strength in Filgrastim and EPOGEN franchises; our more recently-launched products contributed $79 million on year-on-year growth, with more than half of that coming from our International business; $99 million favorable year-on-year inventory benefit, as wholesalers moderated their quarter four to quarter one drawdown versus last year; $39 million in favorable foreign exchange effect; and finally, we booked $33 million in accruals for government rebate increases due to the recently-enacted Healthcare Reform Legislation. And I'll have much more to say about that in a few minutes.
Sequentially, global sales declined 6% or $215 million, influenced significantly by a lower sequential sales for our EPOGEN and Enbrel franchises. As we've seen in the past, this quarter four to quarter one comparisons generally reflect a seasonal effect, particularly in the U.S. market.
The next slide graphically illustrates the components of year-over-year growth in the first quarter excluding foreign exchange gain. As Bob mentioned, U.S. Aranesp was the only component of our product portfolio to decline in the first quarter that was offset by 9% growth in our other products. I'll discuss each of the product results in more detail in a few moments.
Slide 11 shows the effect of inventory changes on our quarterly sales. In the fourth quarter 2009, we experienced an inventory drawdown versus the inventory build seen in prior years. As expected, this reduced the depressing effect of inventory burn-off in the first quarter of 2010 that we experienced in the prior year. The result was a contribution of $99 million in growth year-over-year for the quarter. Having said that, end of first quarter inventory position was at the low to mid point of the normal range.
Next slide. Can I take a few minutes now to provide some insights on how Healthcare Reform will impact Amgen. This is intended along with the comments on guidance to give you a way to assess the overall impact Healthcare Reform might have as we move forward.
First, it's important to recognize that although the new law begins to impose costs in the pharmaceutical sector in 2010, it does not begin providing appreciable increases in coverage until 2014. As a result, cost of the industry will be recognized for several years before appreciable revenue is recognize from coverage expansion. Aside from a potential revenue lift from the insurance mandate within the legislation, there are seven additional components of Healthcare Legislation that may have a meaningful impact on the financial performance over time, and I'll briefly touch on each one of these. Note that there are wide range of affected dates with these elements and that must be considered in estimating the evolution of financial impact to Amgen.
The first item shown here is the increase in the statutory base Medicaid rebate from 15.1% to 23.1% on the current Medicaid book of business. This rate is applied to the statutorily-defined average manufacturers price, or AMP, to establish a minimum dollar value of rebates that Amgen pays to the state. Note that an increase in Medicaid rebates also reduces public health service, or PHS, pricing. The effective date for this item is January 1, 2010 also. So we have already booked a quarter one accrual for the estimated cost of this item.
The second item on the list is a definitional change in the calculation of average manufacturer price. In the Healthcare Reform Bill, this price definition was refined to exclude clinics and hospitals, effectively making it a measure of retail pricing, historically our lowest discount segment. The effect of this is to raise AMP, thus raising the dollar value of Medicaid rebates and reducing PHS pricing to certain products. This item has an effective date of October 1, 2010. So it did not impact our quarter one accrual.
The third item here is the extension of rebates to Medicaid reimbursed business and managed care organizations. The Medicaid rebates will be extended to $15 million to $20 million additional Medicaid beneficiaries now in managed care organization that do not receive statutory rebates. This one is effective as of March 23, 2010. So it had a small incremental Healthcare Reform accrual for quarter one. The annualized impact of this item may be double that of the increase noted in Item 1.
The fourth item on the list is the expansion of Medicaid eligibility to include those below 133% of the federal poverty level from the prior cut-off that in general was about 100% of FPL or lower. When effective, this will increase the Medicaid beneficiary base by an estimated 60 million people. Because this provision is not effective until 2014, there is no 2010 financial impact.
The fifth item on the list is the mandate for manufacturers to provide a 50% discount to Medicare patients who reached the Part D share coverage limit and enter the so-called donut hole. For Amgen, this impact is limited to our two current products that are reimbursed in pharmacies, that would be Enbrel and Sensipar, and eventually will have some impact on Prolia. There should be some benefit offsetting the costs due to more patients successfully getting through the donut hole into catastrophic coverage, but this is very difficult to project at this time.
It has a January 1, 2011 effective date, so no accrual will be taken this year.
Item 6 is an expansion of the public health service, or PHS, eligible hospitals. Additional children's hospitals, freestanding cancer centers, critical access hospitals and rural referral centers will now be eligible for PHS pricing for their outpatient purchases. The PHS price approximates the Medicaid Price. This item is one of the more modest factors on the list and the effective date for this item is January 1, 2010. So our quarter one accrual will contain a full quarter impact of this one.
Finally, the last item is the annual pharmaceutical industry fee. This is one of the more straightforward items conceptually. There is in the legislation an annual dollar amount that must be assessed across large companies in our industry. This amount is apportioned to each individual company based upon the calculation of that entity's share of total public planned sales. This item is also one of the largest on the list, and additionally, is not tax-deductible. It has an effective date of January 1, 2011, so we will not be accruing for this in 2010.
On an individual product basis, it's important to consider the highly-variable difference in exposure to these seven items. The key driver of these differences is each product's exposure to the effective public program.
So in summary, we have seven important elements of Healthcare Reform that will impact Amgen meaningfully. Two of these items have a full first quarter impact in quarter one and one has a very small quarter one impact, thus the $33 million quarter one accrual represents largely the impact of the base rebate increase and the PHS program expansion. 
On a full year basis, we expect the impact from Healthcare Reform to be in the, as Bob mentioned, $200 million to $250 million range for 2010 or roughly 2% of domestic sales. As of the beginning of 2011, two more elements will begin to effect our sales line. We expect to provide additional information on the ramp up of the sales effects of Healthcare Reform in future calls.
Next slide. Worldwide Aranesp sales was flat in the first quarter versus last year. In the U.S., Aranesp sales were down 8% year-over-year while internationally, Aranesp sales were up 7%. 
Slide 14 displays actual weekly U.S. Aranesp sales going back to 2008. As a reminder, the sharp peaks and troughs are largely a result of inventory build-ups and depletions, not fluctuations in actual patient utilization. The red trend line indicate average weekly sales over the past five quarters. These lines exclude returns and discount accrual true-ups, as well as the effects of wholesale and inventory fluctuations, which serve to distort the quarter-on-quarter comparisons shown on the previous slide. 
As you can see, average weekly sales for Aranesp have declined slightly in the first quarter of 2010, reflecting a trend towards a more conservative use of ESAs. In late March, we launched the REMS and CMS held a MEDCAC Meeting to gather information on the use of ESAs in the nephrology setting. We cannot rely to further decline in Aranesp sales as a result of these events.
Next slide. EPOGEN grew by 10% in the first quarter of 2010 versus the first quarter of 2009, driven by patient growth, higher doses and wholesaler inventory. During the year, those fluctuations may continue as healthcare practitioners refine their treatment practices in order to maintain hemoglobin level in the 10 to 12 range. And we still expect to receive the final bundling rules in the first half of the year.
Next to Slide 16. Neulasta and NEUPOGEN combined grew 10% in the first quarter of 2010 versus the first quarter of 2009. In the U.S., sales grew 8% year-over-year, driven by inventory and price, offset by a slight decrease in units. Neulasta wholesaler inventory levels exited the first quarter below the normal range, while NEUPOGEN exited at the low end of the normal range. Internationally, Neulasta and NEUPOGEN grew 14% year-on-year with 9% growth excluding foreign exchange effects.
Enbrel is next on Slide 17. Net sales were up 6% versus the first quarter of 2009. Half of the growth was driven by wholesaler inventory with the remainder coming from demand. Within demand, price growth was offset by a slight unit decline. The unit decline was primarily in dermatology where we lost some share year-over-year to new competition. On a sequential quarter basis, Enbrel net sales were down 12%. 
As we've highlighted on prior calls, both Rheumatology and Dermatology segments have historically been impacted by seasonality, with softness typically seen in the first quarter. On our last call, we described our stepped-up efforts to assist patients working through financial hardships with specific new offerings in our Enbrel support program and enhancements to our co-pay program. During the first quarter, these programs had solid uptake and give us confidence that we're in fact helping appropriate patients start and stay on therapy.
So at the Sensipar on Slide 18, for the first quarter, worldwide Sensipar sales grew 21% versus the first quarter of 2009 primarily driven by global demand in U.S. wholesaler inventory. Once we learn more about how oral drug such as Sensipar will be handled in the 2011 ESRD bundle, we'll be in a better position to comment on any potential effects on demand.
Next, is Vectibix on Slide 19. U.S. Vectibix sales remained flat versus the prior year, while international sales grew 50% in the first quarter.
Slide 20 summarizes our international sales performance. Internationally, sales grew 10% excluding the effects of foreign exchange versus the prior year. Growth was driven by Neulasta conversion, new product launches and expansion into new territories. On the next slide, we'll look at share data for Aranesp Nephrology.
Consistent with previous commentary, Aranesp Nephrology share remained steady as biosimilars continue to take share from Epo alfa [Epoetin alfa] and Epo Beta [Epoetin beta], and then Mircera group continues to drive largely from new requirement.
My last slide provides comparable data for the G-CSF market. Again, very consistent trends as Neulasta share grew slightly in the phase of biosimilars in our major markets. Roger?"

Slide 24 outlines the topics that I will address this afternoon. During the first quarter, we obtained an important new data regarding the use of denosumab to delay skeletal-related events in patients with advanced cancer. I'll provide an update on these results. I'll also describe the progress that we're making in discussions with regulatory agencies regarding the use of denosumab in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.
The first quarter has been an extremely busy period for our development and regulatory affairs groups. I'm going to highlight some of their activities, as well as providing a preview of our presentations at the American Society for Clinical Oncology meeting in June. And finally, I will recap the state of clinical trials that will yield data later this year.
Turning to Slide 25, during this quarter, we obtained results from our head-to-head study of the denosumab, administered under dose of 120 milligram subcutaneously every month, compared with Zometa, administered through monthly intravenous infusion according to the label instructions in patients with advanced prostate cancer and bony metastases.
Denosumab was superior to Zometa in delaying the time to the first on-study skeletal-related event, which is a composite fractures, the need for surgery development, the need for radiation therapy to control bony tumors and spinal cord compression, and the first and subsequent skeletal-related events. Hence, denosumab in this patient population proved superior to the best available therapy, the standard of care.
The hazard ratio from the time to the first SRE was 0.82, which is very much in accordance with what we have seen in our two previous Phase III trials. Adverse event rates were generally similar between the two treatment arms. I should note that in this study, there were 22 cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw in the denosumab arm and 12 cases in the Zometa arm, a numerical balance that did not reach the clinical significance. Something over our entire advance Oncology program, we've had 52 syndicated cases of ONJ and denosumab-treated patients, compared with 37 in Zometa-treated patients. 
The 103 study is the third major Phase III study that we performed with denosumab in advanced cancer patients. As shown on Slide 26, together these studies involved nearly 6,000 patients. These studies, along with our Phase III dose-ranging studies form the basis for filing for denosumab in the advanced cancer indication. We have now completed pre-filling interactions with regulatory agencies around the world, and we are well along in assembling all of the data for submission. We expect to complete U.S. and European filings in the second quarter of this year.
Denosumab is employed in the advanced cancer indication as administered at 12 times the dose used to reduce the risk of fracture in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, or in men receiving hormone ablation therapy for prostate cancer. We continue to make progress in gaining approval of denosumab as Prolia, administered in this setting as a 60 milligram subcutaneous injection once every six months.
On Slide 27, you'll see that in the United States, we submitted our complete response document to the FDA in January of this year, and have had several productive discussions with FDA reviewers since then. I'll remind you that the PDUFA date for our Prolia submission is July 25. 
In the EU, because new data became available, including those related to the occurrence of osteonecrosis of the jaw and advanced cancer patients receiving denosumab and in one case, in a women with postmenopausal osteoporosis receiving denosumab in our long-term extension study, we decided to update our statement of product characteristics, which is the European label. 
The Committee on Human Medicinal Products [Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use] reviewed this information and issued a revised assessment report on March 18 that was again supportive of the Prolia marketing application in both postmenopausal osteoporosis, to reduce the risk of fractured nose that increase risk and to reduce the risk of fracture in men with prostate cancer receiving hormone ablation therapy, who are at a high risk of sustaining a fracture event. 
We still expect approval of Prolia by the European Commission in the second quarter of this year. Reviews and other jurisdictions are ongoing with advanced discussions being held in Australia, Switzerland and Canada.
Turning now to Slide 28. The first quarter has been an especially busy one for our regulatory affairs group. We work closely with the FDA to complete the Risk Evaluation and Minimization Strategy (sic) [Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies] or REMS for erythropoietic-stimulating agents. Already in just the first month, enrollment by prescribers and hospitals in the APPRISE program, a key component of our REMS, has been very brisk.
We also made substantial progress in other areas. Our marketing application for the use of Vectibix in first and second line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in patients who's tumors contain wild-type KRAS genes were submitted to the European Medicines Agency and will be submitted in the United States sometime later in the year. Also, we supported our partner, Takeda, Ltd., in the submission of the Vectibix file in Japan. Last week, Vectibix was approved by Japanese regulators for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer with wild-type KRAS genes in all lines of therapy.
Many of you who have seen our recent presentation at AACR [American Association for Cancer Research] in the use of next-generation DNA sequencing to identify patients most likely to benefit from Vectibix therapy. On Slide 29, I note that our targeted approach to cancer therapy, which benefits from advances in the understanding of mechanisms underlying the progression of malignancy, will be very much on display at the meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology at the beginning of June. 
We expect to have the opportunity to discuss in much more detail the recent results obtained using denosumab to delay skeletal-related events in patients with bony metastases. And we will also provide information on our therapeutics pipeline, including Motesanib, AMG 386 and AMG 479 among others. Indeed, because of the strength of our programs and to place the information presented at ASCO in an appropriated context, we have decided to hold an investor event on June 7.
Finally, on Slide 30, I note that the acquisition of important clinical data will continue at a rapid pace throughout the rest of the year. We have already shown that denosumab delays the progression of bony pathology in men with prostate cancer and metastatic bone disease. In the second half of the year, we will review data from a study testing whether denosumab can delay the appearance of bone metastases in prostate cancer patients with less advanced disease. 
We will also have the opportunity to review Phase III data for Vectibix in the treatment of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, Phase II data from a number of new targeted cancer therapies and Phase II data from our IL-17 receptor antagonist, AMG 827, in the treatment of psoriasis. For those who wish to see a preview of the latter, we will be presenting Phase I data for AMG 27 at psoriasis patients at the American Society for Investigative Dermatology meeting in May. Kevin?"

24816,109404809,70601,"Amgen Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Arvind. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call. I'm pleased that we delivered a solid quarter. Our base business continues to perform well both financially and operationally. Internationally, we're competing effectively, continuing",1207,"Thank you, Arvind. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call. I'm pleased that we delivered a solid quarter. Our base business continues to perform well both financially and operationally. 
Internationally, we're competing effectively, continuing to compete effectively against biosimilars, and we're seeing growth through new markets and products. Research and development, as Roger will report and you've probably concluded is, firing on all cylinders, and we have a lot to be proud of and a lot to look forward to. 
And I'd also like to take this moment to thank all of the Amgen staff who are listening and others for all the work you've done this year to make a difference for patients and to deliver value for our shareholders. As Arvind commented, we've had quite a number of significant events this year, and before I make specific comments, I'd like to recognize some of those events, put them in context and give you my perspective on them. 
Just six-short months ago, we were uncertain about whether Health Care Reform [U.S. Health Care Reform Legislation] would happen, and if it happened, what might be the effect us both financially and on a public-policy sense. The progress of Prolia and osteoporosis around the world and Denosumab in cancer were not nearly so clear as they are now. A number of ESA franchise questions were outstanding, important questions that we have much more information on now. And finally, we saw Europe as a region go through, to a degree, still go through, some very significant economic uncertainties with some impact in some countries on the biopharmaceutical space. 
I think my summary comment is from Amgen's point of view. Each one of these major questions of say, six months ago, have been answered in ways that are either within our expectation, or in some cases, even better. So sitting here now six months later, I feel proud of what we've done and very confident about the future. 
Let me talk first about Health Care Reform. We'll talk more specifically later. But I think Health Care Reform has been internalized by us. We can handle it economically, and we are delighted with the public policy rules that have come about with respect to biosimilars. And I'll let Jim later on, talk a bit and Michael about the economics. But we can handle them. 
Let's talk a little bit about Denosumab and Prolia. 
We were particularly pleased to receive Prolia's approvals in both the U.S. and the EU in the second quarter. A very, very major milestone we worked 15 years to achieve. And while it's still early days from a commercial point of view to launch as are progressing both in Europe and United States as we had planned, Jim will talk about it, a bit of few highlights. The initial feedback from physicians has been positive, and with GSK, we have a strong partner in the rest of the world, so I'm feeling optimistic based on where we are today. 
Jim Daly will give your more input and information about Prolia with a bit of a focus on the U.S. in a moment. Recently, as you know, the FDA granted priority review designation to Denosumab for the Reduction of Skeletal Related Events in patients with advanced cancer. Prior to review, designation is granted to drugs that offer potential for major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. So this is a real testament to the data generated in our SRE studies, where we compared ourselves to the market leader or the current standard of care. 
Also at the beginning of 2010, there were a number of uncertainties that related to our ESA business. And today, many of these, if not all of these issues have been addressed, if not resolved. Just to mention a few: The ESA REMS has been finalized. Enrollment is underway and we feel positive about the state of that business. CMS held a MEDCAC meeting on ESA's in nephrology, and we felt that, that was a productive discussion. 
We've all seen the top line Hematide data, and we'll continue to watch its development. The final dialysis bundling the rule is now out. We believe it is within our expectations and recognizes the importance of delivering quality care to patients. Roger will have more to say about this. Overall, we have a lot more clarity as we think about the future of the ESA business, and look forward to discussing the TREAT study in more detail at an advisory committee meeting later this year. 
The pipeline is the driver of future growth and ours continues to deliver. We had a good ASCO last month with much interest in our pipeline, and the progress continues. We're moving two of our oncology molecules, AMG 479 and 386 [AMG 386], an important tumor types in the Phase III, Roger will comment. As you know, we look forward to the more pivotal data yet this year, including the Denosumab bone mass prevention data. Roger will discuss this as well. 
I'll be remiss if I didn't comment on some of the management changes that have recently happened. Companies of all managements change and strong companies replace strong management with new-strong management. I believe we have done that. 
Before I comment specifically, I'd like to recognize someone who is making an appearance today on the call, Michael Kelly. Michael Kelly is a distinguished and experienced financial executive, who's been our acting CFO for a number of months, and I'd like to recognize his contribution and partnership. Michael, thank you. 
Here is some leadership changes that we have announced and I'll comment. Bob Bradway was recently appointed our President and Chief Operating Officer. Bob's leadership and experience make him the right person for this important position. We recently announced we would be replacing Bob as permanent CFO with Jonathan Peacock. Jonathan will join us later this summer, and he brings a set of skills in international experience that will be critical as we implement our international-expansion strategy. 
Finally, I'd like to comment on George Morrow. It's hard to put into words what George has meant to this company for the past 10 years. He's been one of our key leaders, he's been one of my key partners, he delivered for shareholders, he delivered for patients and he built a very strong management team. In fact, two of the folks who reported to him are moving up the organization, Rolf Hoffman, has grown international; and Jim Daly, North America. You'll hear later from Jim today, as he discusses the results. We have much to thank George for, and I, here publicly, want to acknowledge that. George will be with us until early next year, and I want to assure everyone on this call that we continue to benefit from George's advice and perspective and he remains integral to us. 
For the rest of the year, as it is every year, delivering financially, making our products, particularly Prolia's success, advancing the pipeline, expanding internationally and creating value for our shareholders, will remain our key priorities. 
I'd like to now turn the call over to Michael Kelly, who will discuss our quarterly performance in more detail. Michael, over to you."

On Page 5, I'll take you through the adjusted P&L for the quarter. Year-over-year revenues were up 2% in the second quarter to $3.8 billion. In terms of geography, our year of sales decreased 2% to $2.8 billion for the quarter. Excluding Ar",1066,"Thanks, Kevin. On Page 5, I'll take you through the adjusted P&L for the quarter. Year-over-year revenues were up 2% in the second quarter to $3.8 billion. In terms of geography, our year of sales decreased 2% to $2.8 billion for the quarter. Excluding Aranesp, which was down again this quarter, U.S. sales were up 1% on a year-over-year basis. With respect to wholesale-inventory levels, we exited the quarter in the U.S. and overall wholesaler inventory at the mid to low end of normal ranges. 
Second quarter U.S. revenues include a $45 million accrual for certain Health Care Reform Legislation provisions that were in effect during the quarter, partially offset by a $9 million favorable adjustment related to changes and accounting estimates with respect to accruals for U.S. Health Care Reform, recorded in the first quarter of 2010. 
Recall in the first quarter, we said that we expect the full year 2010 impact of Health Care Reform to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million, and that estimate remains unchanged. Jim will speak in some detail in a moment on the topic of Health Care Reform and its continued impact on our business. 
Shifting now to our International business, we posted sales of $826 million, an increase of 3% versus the prior year. Changes in foreign exchange positively impacted second quarter sales by $11 million. Without that benefit, International sales were up 2% year-over-year. I will have more to say about foreign exchange in a moment. 
I also want to note that revenues in the second quarter of 2010, benefited from milestone payments associated with certain ongoing collaborations, revenues reflect milestone payments from GlaxoSmithKline for approval and launch of Prolia in Europe and from Velcade for the approval of Vectibix in Japan. 
Turning now to operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, our total-operating expenses were up 4% this quarter versus last year. Our cost of sales margin increased 0.7%, primarily driven by higher bulk-material costs and less-favorable product mix. This increase was partially offset by lower royalties and lower excess-capacity charges. 
R&D expenses decreased 2%, primarily driven by the $50 million payment in the second quarter of 2009, to obtain an exclusive license from Cytokinetics, partially offset by lower expense recoveries associated with ongoing collaborations in higher staff-related cost. We continue to expect R&D expenses to increase in the second half of the year, consistent with our spending patterns in prior years. 
SG&A expenses increased 9% versus the same quarter last year. This increase includes higher staff-related costs and spending for activities in anticipation of the approval of Prolia. We expect SG&A expenditures to increase in the second half of the year, primarily driven by Prolia-related activities. Recall that in the second quarter of 2009, our Prolia sales force was not yet hired. In addition, SG&A expenses were higher in Q2 2010 due to higher mitigation expenses and higher staff-related costs, which were partially offset by expenses associated with the Enbrel profit share and expense recoveries associated with the GlaxoSmithKline collaboration agreement for Prolia. 
Excluding expenses associated with the Enbrel profit share, adjusted SG&A expenses in the second quarter of 2010 increased 14% versus the same quarter last year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20% compared to 18.1% in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in the second quarter of 2009, and changes in profits associated with our Puerto Rico operations in the second quarter of 2010, versus the second quarter of 2009. Q1 2010 adjusted earnings per share were $1.38, up 7% versus prior year, and our GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.25, unchanged from the prior year. Now turning to the balance sheet on Page 6. 
You should note, we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow. Let me spend a moment to discuss some key balance sheet items. Our Q2 2010 ending global cash balance was $14.5 billion, we ended the quarter with $12.2 billion of debt. Our adjusted stock holders' equity increased by $2 billion year-over-year to $22.9 billion. With respect to our cash flow, we generated approximate $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations in the second quarter of 2010, which is down slightly year-over-year. 
Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $177 million. We repurchased approximately 10 million of shares during the second quarter of 2010 at a cost of $600 million, bringing our cumulative share repurchases for 2010 to 39 million shares at a cost of $2.3 billion. We had 3.7 billion remaining under our board authorized stock repurchase program as of June 30, 2010. 
Next, our updated guidance is on Page 7. When we updated our revenue guidance in the first quarter, the prevailing dollar-euro spot rate was in the high 1.30s per euro. The exchange rate has been in the mid to high 1.20s per euro over the past several weeks. As you know, the majority of our foreign revenue is denominated in euros. 
Adjusting for the impact of a weaker euro, we now expect revenue to be slightly below $15.1 billion. This guidance assumes that foreign-exchange rates remain at current spot levels for the second half of the year. Our guidance continues to reflect the expected impact from Health Care Reform of $200 million to $250 million. 
Let me remind you that we do not hedge revenues and operating expenses separately. We hedge our net foreign currency exposure over a rolling three-year horizon with the financial impact of our hedges reflected in the revenue line of the income statement. While foreign exchange volatility could materially impact revenue and operating expense, we do not anticipate any material impact on EPS. 
Our EPS guidance remains unchanged. We still expect EPS to be towards the lower end of our current guidance range of $5.05 to $5.25. This guidance considers the expected increases in R&D and SG&A in the second half of the year that I alluded to earlier. 
With respect to the tax rate guidance, we continue to expect that our 2010 adjusted tax rate will be in the 20% to 21% range. As a reminder, this guidance assumes that the R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended for all of 2010. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million. 
Thank you and next to Bob, President and CEO for operations review."

I'm delighted to have a chance to talk to you today in my new capacity, and it's indeed a privilege to have an opportunity, to help build on the foundation of operational success that our company has enjoyed.

I'm delighted to have a chance to talk to you today in my new capacity, and it's indeed a privilege to have an opportunity, to help build on the foundation of operational success that our company has enjoyed. With my new role, I can assure you that we'll be focused on delivery and execution in several areas, including stabilizing and growing our core franchises of that in the phase of increased payor and competitive pricing pressures, successfully launching Prolia globally and here, I can report that every sign we see so far, confirms what we have believed about the unmet medical need that this therapy addresses, and our operations and commercial teams are right on track at this early stage of the product launch. 
Turning to the announcement bronchology, obviously we're excited that our file with the FDA has been granted a priority review, and we will be prepared to bring this important therapy to patients once approvals occur around the globe. Internationally, we remain committed to increasing our global sales footprint through our multi-year expansion initiative, which will increase the number of territories in which we sell our products from the current 46 to approximately 75. 
We remain focused on optimizing our manufacturing and supply chain through our operational excellence program, with the broad objective of continually improving on our efficient and safe supply of medicine to our patients. This area has been a core strength for Amgen and Fabrizio Bonanni and his team have made great progress in this regard. Finally, we'll continue to look for ways to achieve sustained growth through disciplined capital investing and improving utilization of our facilities. 
With that, I'd like to provide an overview of our commercial operations during the second quarter. So if you'll turn to Page 9. Starting with the year-on-year comparison, our global product sales declined by $21 million or 1%, which was affected by a few key factors. 
On the downside, our global Aranesp sales declined by $90 million or 13%, which I'll discuss in more detail in a moment, and we booked Health Care Reform accruals of about $36 million on the quarter. These downsides were partially offset by $69 million in growth across the rest of the global franchise, a 2% growth rate. Now there was in the quarter an $11 million benefit from foreign exchange, and the U.S. wholesaler inventory benefit of about $18 million. 
Now I know there's been much discussion about the mandatory price cuts in Europe, so I want to give you some perspective on how it affects us. First, let me remind you that our European sales are about 18% of our worldwide total sales, and we entered the year expecting that the effective price cuts across the International business would be about 3%. That 3% included our expectations for business as usual, payor-mandated price cuts, as well as competitive price cuts related to biosimilars. Now as a result of the incremental mandatory price actions announced over the past several weeks, we believe the effect on our business internationally this year will be some 4% or one percentage point worse than what we had planned for. 
Sequentially now, turning to global sales, you can see they grew 2% for the quarter or $85 million, and that was largely driven by seasonal increase in Enbrel demand and aided by favorable inventory effect. These were partially offset by lower sequential demand for Aranesp and Filgrastim. Importantly in the second quarter, we received regulatory approvals for Prolia in key markets and launched our selling effort. In the U.S., we were in the market with product and our sales force fully trained and deployed as of June 21. 
In Europe as you know, we received approval on May 28, and we've already received reimbursement authorization in Germany, and expect to receive reimbursement in another handful of countries in Europe over the course of the year. And in the meantime, we're selling into the private insurance markets. We've received regulatory approval in Australia, and we anticipate reimbursement authorization there next year, and so finally, we recorded some $3 million in sales for the quarter for Prolia, which reflects the fact that we had few selling days after the launch. 
Turning now to Slide 10, which graphically illustrates the components of our year-over-year growth in the second quarter for the portfolio. You can see the $90 million decline in Aranesp depicted here in the separate U.S. and International components. Both markets experienced segment decline, reflecting more conservative ESA utilization worldwide. 
Enbrel also experienced a modest sales decline, largely attributable to unit-demand decline, partially offset by an increase in average-net-sales price. As you can also see, the newer products, Vectibix and Nplate  are growing nicely and contributed nearly $50 million of growth in the quarter. Now, I'll turn it over to Jim Daly, who will discuss each of the product results in more detail."

Worldwide Aranesp sales declined 13% in the second quarter year-over-year. In the U.S., Aranesp sales were down 21% year-over-year, while internationally, sales were down 5%. The decline in both markets was demand driven, primarily due to segment decline. 
Slide 12 displays actual weekly U.S. Aranesp sales going back to 2008. As a reminder, the sharp peaks and troughs are largely a result of wholesaler-inventory fluctuations, not fluctuations in actual-patient utilization. The red trend lines indicate average-weekly sales over the past five quarters. These lines exclude returns and discount accrual true ups, as well as effects of wholesaler inventory fluctuations, which all serve to distort the quarter-on-quarter comparisons shown on the previous slide. As you can see, average weekly sales for Aranesp have declined slightly in the second quarter 2010, reflecting a trend towards more conservative use of ESA's in both oncology and nephrology. 
In late March, we launched the oncology REMS and CMS conducted a MEDCAC meeting on the use of ESA's in the nephrology setting. We cannot rule out a further decline in Aranesp sales, as a consequence of these events. 
Filgrastim is next on Slide 13. Neulasta/NEUPOGEN combined sales grew 1% in the second quarter year-over-year. In the U.S., sales grew 2%, primarily driven by inventory, price and partially offset by a decline in units. Contributing to the unfavorable unit comparison, was the impact of a late first-quarter buying by customers to take advantage of favorable contractual terms, that expired in late March of this year. Neulasta wholesaler inventory levels exited the second quarter near the midpoint of the normal range, while NEUPOGEN exit the second quarter at the low end of the normal range. 
Internationally, Neulasta/NEUPOGEN increased 1% year-on-year. Neulasta experienced 6% growth for the period, while NEUPOGEN sales declined 9%, due to the impact of biosimilars. 
Next is Enbrel on Slide 14. Net sales were down 2% in the second quarter year-over-year. The decline was primarily driven by market-share loss to new competition. Net-price growth partially offset our unit decline. On A sequential quarter basis, Enbrel net sales were up 9%. This increase was driven by demand, with growth in both Rheumatology and Dermatology. Historically, both Rheumatology and Dermatology segments have been impacted by seasonality with softness, typically seen in the first quarter, followed by strength in the second quarter as patients work through their annual deductibles and other insurance changes. In the second quarter 2010, this seasonal pattern has continued. Enbrel maintained its leadership position in both Rheumatology and Dermatology during the second quarter. 
Next is EPOGEN on Slide 15. EPOGEN grew by 3% in the second quarter year-over-year, driven by patient growth, wholesaler inventory and partially offset by a decline in dose. During the year, dose fluctuations may continue as providers refined their treatment practices in order to maintain hemoglobin levels in the 10 to 12 range. 
On The next slide, we'll address the final rule on bundling and dialysis, which goes into effect January 2011. This past Monday, CMS published the final rule. CMS also published concurrently, the ESRD Quality Improvement Program, QIP proposed rule. This proposed rule will have a 60-day comment period ending September 24, 2010, and the final rule is expected in 2011. 
Key provisions under these rules include the following. Anemia management. Under the QIP, beginning in 2012, facilities will be subject to a payment penalty of up to 2%, for failure to meet or exceed CMS standards. CMS proposes a penalty be based on a composite score of measures, and that the measure for hemoglobin levels below 10 grams per deciliter, constitute 50% of the weight, and the remaining measures each represent 25% of the weight. 
Unit of payment. CMS finalizes its proposal to continue a per-treatment unit of payment. Consistent with current policy, ESRD facilities could be paid for up to three treatments per week, unless medical necessity justifies more. 
Payment rate. For 2011, the base rate is $229.63, which is based on 2007 claims data and the application of several adjustors. Total spending in 2011 under the bundled-payment system is based on 98% of estimated spending, if bundling had not been implemented. 
Oral drugs without IV equivalents. CMS finalized the definition of renal-dialysis services, to include oral-only drugs, for postponed payments for such drugs until January 1, 2014. Oral-only drugs such as Sensipar and phosphate binders, will remain under Medicare beneficiaries, prescription-drug benefit and paid for under Medicare Part D until 2014. Amgen is supportive of policies that improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery, as well as preserve patient access to imported medicines for patients on dialysis. 
The ESRD final rule demonstrates CMS' strong commitment to these principles. We are continuing to review the final rule to better understand the potential impact on patient access and quality of care. 
Now let's move to Sensipar performance on Slide 17. For the second quarter, Worldwide Sensipar sales grew 3% versus last year, primarily driven by demand. In the U.S., inventory decreased in the second quarter this year compared to an inventory build last year, partially offset by demand. International growth was 11%, driven by demand. 
Next is Vectibix on Slide 18. U.S. Vectibix sales grew 21% versus the prior year, primarily due to demand, while International sales grew 34% in the second quarter. 
On Slide 19, we provide an update on our overall Health Care Reform impacts. As the slide indicates, we have already booked $69 million in accruals this year for the three components of Health Care Reform that are currently in effect, circled here in red. As you can see, we will be accruing for these three components in the third quarter. And by the fourth quarter, the AMP calculation charges will also become effective. Finally, we're maintaining our estimated range of $200 million to $250 million impact for Health Care Reform in 2010. 
Slide 20 summarizes our International performance. Internationally, sales grew 2%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. Growth was driven by new product launches and expansion to new territories, offset by a decline in Aranesp sales. 
On the next few slides, we'll look at the share data for Aranesp Nephrology, followed by share for the Filgrastim franchise. Consistent with previous quarters, Aranesp Nephrology share remained steady as Biosimilars continue to take share from Epo alpha and Epo beta, and Mircera growth continue to drive largely from NeoRecormon. 
Slide 22 provides comparable data for the G-CSF market. Again, we see very consistent trends despite Biosimilar presence in our major markets. 
On my final slide, we'll provide a Prolia launch update. In both the U.S. and the EU, we are on track with our launch plan and encouraged by the early market reaction to Prolia. In the U.S., physicians are trialling the product in some of their most difficult-to-treat patients, while assessing reimbursement and patient affordability. Nearly 90% of Prolia sales to date have been accessed via ""buy and bill"" reimbursement. 50% of patients have had a co-pay of zero to $15. And for the remaining 50% of patients, the co-pay remains modest. 
It may be useful to you for me to take a minute and outline the “buy and bill” process in just a little more detail. Step one is clinical agreement, in which the physicians identify appropriate patients based upon the Prolia prescribing information. Typically, these are postmenopausal women with a history of fracture or multiple risk factors for fracture or who have failed other therapy or who are intolerant of other therapy. Overall, our early experience is that physicians are readily able to identify appropriate patients for Prolia in their practice. 
Step two is coverage confirmation. The physician's office staff submits an insurance verification requests, or IVR, to our reimbursement hub called Prolia plus. Within a day or two, the office staff receives back a summary of benefits, which is what the payor will reimburse and what, if anything, the patient must pay. The staff discusses this with the patient and then orders Prolia from their wholesaler. 
Step three, the patient returns to the office and Prolia is administered. Step four, the office submits the claim and reimbursement is paid, generally, within 14 to 30 days, assuming a clean claim. With new products, it's not unusual for a payor to request additional documentation. 
To date, many claims have been submitted, and we expect the bulk of them to be start being paid in August and September. Once offices have received paid claims, we expect they will continue to identify additional patients appropriate for Prolia. This process is the basis for our sales forecast ramp in 2010. In early 2011, we expect utilization of the pharmacy benefit under Medicare Part D to increase as prescription drug plans make their formulary decisions. 
Turning to Europe. Germany is our first major market, with reimbursement received on July 1, and we're off to a strong start. We're also encouraged by the positive preliminary NICE recommendation for Prolia, Prolia reimbursement in the U.K., and expect to see sales ramp in the fourth quarter of this year when the recommendation becomes effective. Reimbursement and launch in additional major markets, including France and Spain, is expected in early 2011. We look forward to providing you with more detailed information on the Prolia launch on our third quarter call. Now over to Roger."

Well, as Kevin mentioned, the second quarter of 2010 was an extremely important one for Amgen's Research and Development group, and especially for our Global Regulatory and Safety Surveillance organization. 
Slide 25, documents that we are pursuing Prolia regulatory approval around the globe. And again, as Bob indicated, our first approval came in Europe from the European Medicines Agency at the end of May, followed almost immediately thereafter by U.S. FDA approval. We also have approval in Australia, and we are expecting approval in Canada and in Switzerland during the third quarter of this year. I wish also to mention that we are in the process of preparing more than 30 filings around the world in collaboration with our partners, GlaxoSmithKline. So in short order, we will be pursuing Prolia launches throughout the globe. 
Turning to Slide 26. Prolia is Denosumab administered at 60 milligrams once every six months. But Denosumab can also  be administered in a more intensive schedule at 12x the exposure, which is at a 120 milligrams every month in the setting of advanced cancer. I've spoken previously in a variety of settings about the importance of Denosumab in the setting and reducing or delaying the appearance of skeletal-related events in patients with bony metastasis, and we have submitted our file to the FDA and to other regulatory authorities for that indication. 
As Kevin mentioned, the U.S. FDA granted priority review, with a PDUFA date of November 18, 2010, and we're working closely with the FDA in evaluating our data set. Also, the review by the European Medicines Agency is proceeding with the usual cadence. Filing has also been completed in Canada and Australia and our partner, Daiichi Sankyo, expects to file for approval in Japan for the skeletal-related events indication in the third quarter of this year. Other filings around the world will be pursued in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline. I should mention that in addition to Denosumab as Prolia and also in the more intensive schedule for skeletal-related events, we are expecting a lot of important new data, which will arrive later this year. 
And turning to Slide 27. There are several key events that I wish to highlight. First of all, during the third quarter of this year, we will obtain data on the use of Vectibix in the setting of refractory relapse or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and these data should be available relatively shortly. We also will gain data from an important Phase III study of Denosumab for the prevention of bony metastasis in patients with prostate cancer at high risk for bony metastasis, so cold '147 study, and these data will be available in the fourth quarter of this year. 
As Kevin mentioned, we have initiated our -- or we will initiate our first Phase III study for AMG 386, and we are expecting to have patients with relapsed refractory ovarian cancer joining the study in the fourth quarter of this year. And we do intend also to advance the AMG 479 study into Phase III, so likely the first patient will not be admitted to these studies until the beginning of 2011. Additional Phase II data sets from our AMG 386, AMG 479 and from the AMG 827 programs will also become available later in this year, and we'll have the opportunity to share those with you at future earnings calls.

Well, Geoff, I think you put your finger on the core issue, which is these new rules could apply to anywhere from 25% of Medicare dialysis patients all the way up to 100% depending on whether providers decide to opt in 100% or phase in 25% a year.

Now CMS interestingly made an assumption of about a 43% opt-in rate. Right now, we're working very close with our customers to understand what they anticipate doing. They have until November 1 to decide one way or the other. So I think this is a situation of stay tuned, and clearly, we will be very close to our customers. In terms of the second part of your question, what impact will this have on utilization? Well, certainly, there's a couple of things we do not anticipate happening. One, we do not anticipate wholesale moves to subdue administration for a number of reasons, including the fact that our label recommends against it and also the fact that patients do not like it. And also, the clinical data is somewhat dubious in terms of what type of dose savings you can actually realize over an extended period of time. So we don't see that as a major drag on utilization. We don't see IV iron creating a major drag on utilization. Most patients, 85% are iron replete, so we don't see that as being a major issue. Where we're modeling right now potential utilization impact is on hyporesponder patients. Right now, if you define a hyporesponder as we do in our label, patients who fail to achieve 10 up to 12 weeks. That's about 1% of patients who represent about 3% of utilization."

In the U.S., you have a rate-limiting step, which is reimbursement. Right now we're focused on the medical benefit, and physicians are reluctant to put a large number of patients on the product until they have greater confidence that reimbursement will be adequate, timely and the patients will not have an exorbitant out-of-pocket costs.

The data for AMG 386 and for AMG 479 from the Phase II studies are pretty impressive. Now for 386, you have data in the ovarian cancer setting in which there is -- it's placebo-controlled data that we actually are doing a direct study of chemotherapy plus AMG 386 versus AMG chemotherapy alone. And if there is a dose-response curve, so that the 10-milligram per kilogram arm was more impressive than the 3-milligram per kilogram arm, which in itself still demonstrated a response compared to chemotherapy alone. And the data showed that not only could you see an effect with respect to the tumors themselves, but there's also a quantitative effect with respect to, in this case, a biomarker for tumor mass CA-125. So all of that tends to give you more confidence that, in fact, you will see a treatment effect that duplicates that in the Phase III study. Of course, the magnitude could be different, the extent to which overall survival might be prolonged. In such a study, it could be different, but it gives you more confidence. And similarly, the magnitude of the treatment effect and the fact that there is an exposure-response relationship with the AMG 479 study in pancreatic cancer also gives you some confidence. You can never be sure. Just as you say, you have to see the Phase III studies. But the data sets are really quite impressive in Phase II and more robust than most that you usually see. We've got a lot of other things going on in the cancer area as we talked about at ASCO, and we can get to that some other time. But I would point out those two studies that we've taken into Phase III are really quite powerful."

So you're looking at Simponi, Actemra, Cimzia. So it's inevitably lose some level of share as the market leader. Now in dermatology, I think it's a little different. The share loss is primarily going to STELARA, which is a new market entrant. STELARA has a 13% share, and we've seen our market share go to 49%.

There's enormous complexity in a Biosimilar that's not as easy to characterize. And as a result, it's hard to predict what the clinical performance will be, and that has been in the past what has been such a great concern, both from the perspective of immunogenicity as well as from the perspective of overall efficacy.

Our base business continues to perform well both financially and operationally. 
Internationally, we're competing effectively, continuing to compete effectively against biosimilars, and we're seeing growth through new markets and products. Research and development, as Roger will report and you've probably concluded is, firing on all cylinders, and we have a lot to be proud of and a lot to look forward to. 
And I'd also like to take this moment to thank all of the Amgen staff who are listening and others for all the work you've done this year to make a difference for patients and to deliver value for our shareholders. As Arvind commented, we've had quite a number of significant events this year, and before I make specific comments, I'd like to recognize some of those events, put them in context and give you my perspective on them. 
Just six-short months ago, we were uncertain about whether Health Care Reform [U.S. Health Care Reform Legislation] would happen, and if it happened, what might be the effect us both financially and on a public-policy sense. The progress of Prolia and osteoporosis around the world and Denosumab in cancer were not nearly so clear as they are now. A number of ESA franchise questions were outstanding, important questions that we have much more information on now. And finally, we saw Europe as a region go through, to a degree, still go through, some very significant economic uncertainties with some impact in some countries on the biopharmaceutical space. 
I think my summary comment is from Amgen's point of view. Each one of these major questions of say, six months ago, have been answered in ways that are either within our expectation, or in some cases, even better. So sitting here now six months later, I feel proud of what we've done and very confident about the future. 
Let me talk first about Health Care Reform. We'll talk more specifically later. But I think Health Care Reform has been internalized by us. We can handle it economically, and we are delighted with the public policy rules that have come about with respect to biosimilars. And I'll let Jim later on, talk a bit and Michael about the economics. But we can handle them. 
Let's talk a little bit about Denosumab and Prolia. 
We were particularly pleased to receive Prolia's approvals in both the U.S. and the EU in the second quarter. A very, very major milestone we worked 15 years to achieve. And while it's still early days from a commercial point of view to launch as are progressing both in Europe and United States as we had planned, Jim will talk about it, a bit of few highlights. The initial feedback from physicians has been positive, and with GSK, we have a strong partner in the rest of the world, so I'm feeling optimistic based on where we are today. 
Jim Daly will give your more input and information about Prolia with a bit of a focus on the U.S. in a moment. Recently, as you know, the FDA granted priority review designation to Denosumab for the reduction of skeletal related events in patients with advanced cancer. Prior to review, designation is granted to drugs that offer potential for major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. So this is a real testament to the data generated in our SRE studies, where we compared ourselves to the market leader or the current standard of care. 
Also at the beginning of 2010, there were a number of uncertainties that related to our ESA business. And today, many of these, if not all of these issues have been addressed, if not resolved. Just to mention a few: The ESA REMS has been finalized. Enrollment is underway and we feel positive about the state of that business. CMS held a MEDCAC meeting on ESAs in nephrology, and we felt that, that was a productive discussion. 
We've all seen the top line Hematide data, and we'll continue to watch its development. The final dialysis bundling rule is now out. We believe it is within our expectations and recognizes the importance of delivering quality care to patients. Roger will have more to say about this. Overall, we have a lot more clarity as we think about the future of the ESA business, and look forward to discussing the TREAT study in more detail at an advisory committee meeting later this year. 
The pipeline is the driver of future growth and ours continues to deliver. We had a good ASCO last month with much interest in our pipeline, and the progress continues. We're moving two of our oncology molecules, AMG 479 and 386 [AMG 386], an important tumor types in the Phase III, Roger will comment. As you know, we look forward to the more pivotal data yet this year, including the Denosumab bone mass prevention data. Roger will discuss this as well. 
I'll be remiss if I didn't comment on some of the management changes that have recently happened. Companies of all managements change and strong companies replace strong management with new strong management. I believe we have done that. 
Before I comment specifically, I'd like to recognize someone who is making an appearance today on the call, Michael Kelly. Michael Kelly is a distinguished and experienced financial executive, who's been our acting CFO for a number of months, and I'd like to recognize his contribution and partnership. Michael, thank you. 
Here is some leadership changes that we have announced and I'll comment. Bob Bradway was recently appointed our President and Chief Operating Officer. Bob's leadership and experience make him the right person for this important position. We recently announced we would be replacing Bob as permanent CFO with Jonathan Peacock. Jonathan will join us later this summer, and he brings a set of skills in international experience that will be critical as we implement our international-expansion strategy. 
Finally, I'd like to comment on George Morrow. It's hard to put into words what George has meant to this company for the past 10 years. He's been one of our key leaders, he's been one of my key partners, he delivered for shareholders, he delivered for patients and he built a very strong management team. In fact, two of the folks who reported to him are moving up the organization, Rolf Hoffmann, has grown international; and Jim Daly, North America. You'll hear later from Jim today, as he discusses the results. We have much to thank George for, and I, here publicly, want to acknowledge that. George will be with us until early next year, and I want to assure everyone on this call that we continue to benefit from George's advice and perspective and he remains integral to us. 
For the rest of the year, as it is every year, delivering financially, making our products, particularly Prolia's success, advancing the pipeline, expanding internationally and creating value for our shareholders, will remain our key priorities. I'd like to now turn the call over to Michael Kelly, who will discuss our quarterly performance in more detail. Michael, over to you."

On Page 5, I'll take you through the adjusted P&L for the quarter. Year-over-year revenues were up 2% in the second quarter to $3.8 billion. In terms of geography, our year of sales decreased 2% to $2.8 billion for the quarter. Excluding Ar",1067,"Thanks, Kevin. On Page 5, I'll take you through the adjusted P&L for the quarter. Year-over-year revenues were up 2% in the second quarter to $3.8 billion. In terms of geography, our year of sales decreased 2% to $2.8 billion for the quarter. Excluding Aranesp, which was down again this quarter, U.S. sales were up 1% on a year-over-year basis. With respect to wholesale-inventory levels, we exited the quarter in the U.S. and overall wholesaler inventory at the mid to low end of normal ranges. 
Second quarter U.S. revenues include a $45 million accrual for certain Health Care Reform Legislation provisions that were in effect during the quarter, partially offset by a $9 million favorable adjustment related to changes in accounting estimates with respect to accruals for U.S. Health Care Reform, recorded in the first quarter of 2010. 
Recall in the first quarter, we said that we expect the full year 2010 impact of Health Care Reform to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million, and that estimate remains unchanged. Jim will speak in some detail in a moment on the topic of Health Care Reform and its continued impact on our business. 
Shifting now to our International business, we posted sales of $826 million, an increase of 3% versus the prior year. Changes in foreign exchange positively impacted second quarter sales by $11 million. Without that benefit, International sales were up 2% year-over-year. I will have more to say about foreign exchange in a moment. 
I also want to note that revenues in the second quarter of 2010, benefited from milestone payments associated with certain ongoing collaborations, revenues reflect milestone payments from GlaxoSmithKline for approval and launch of Prolia in Europe and from Takeda for the approval of Vectibix in Japan. 
Turning now to operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, our total operating expenses were up 4% this quarter versus last year. Our cost of sales margin increased 0.7%, primarily driven by higher bulk material costs and less-favorable product mix. This increase was partially offset by lower royalties and lower excess-capacity charges. 
R&D expenses decreased 2%, primarily driven by the $50 million payment in the second quarter of 2009, to obtain an exclusive license from Cytokinetics, partially offset by lower expense recoveries associated with ongoing collaborations in higher staff-related cost. We continue to expect R&D expenses to increase in the second half of the year, consistent with our spending patterns in prior years. 
SG&A expenses increased 9% versus the same quarter last year. This increase includes higher staff-related costs and spending for activities in anticipation of the approval of Prolia. We expect SG&A expenditures to increase in the second half of the year, primarily driven by Prolia-related activities. Recall that in the second quarter of 2009, our Prolia sales force was not yet hired. 
In addition, SG&A expenses were higher in Q2 2010 due to higher mitigation expenses and higher staff-related costs, which were partially offset by expenses associated with the Enbrel profit share and expense recoveries associated with the GlaxoSmithKline collaboration agreement for Prolia. 
Excluding expenses associated with the Enbrel profit share, adjusted SG&A expenses in the second quarter of 2010 increased 14% versus the same quarter last year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20% compared to 18.1% in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in the second quarter of 2009, and changes in profits associated with our Puerto Rico operations in the second quarter of 2010, versus the second quarter of 2009. Q1 2010 adjusted earnings per share were $1.38, up 7% versus prior year, and our GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.25, unchanged from the prior year. 
Now turning to the balance sheet on Page 6. You should note, we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow. Let me spend a moment to discuss some key balance sheet items. Our Q2 2010 ending global cash balance was $14.5 billion, we ended the quarter with $12.2 billion of debt. Our adjusted stockholders' equity increased by $2 billion year-over-year to $22.9 billion. With respect to our cash flow, we generated approximate $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations in the second quarter of 2010, which is down slightly year-over-year. 
Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $177 million. We repurchased approximately 10 million of shares during the second quarter of 2010 at a cost of $600 million, bringing our cumulative share repurchases for 2010 to 39 million shares at a cost of $2.3 billion. We had 3.7 billion remaining under our board authorized stock repurchase program as of June 30, 2010. 
Next, our updated guidance is on Page 7. When we updated our revenue guidance in the first quarter, the prevailing dollar-euro spot rate was in the high 1.30s per euro. The exchange rate has been in the mid to high 1.20s per euro over the past several weeks. As you know, the majority of our foreign revenue is denominated in euros. 
Adjusting for the impact of a weaker euro, we now expect revenue to be slightly below $15.1 billion. This guidance assumes that foreign-exchange rates remain at current spot levels for the second half of the year. Our guidance continues to reflect the expected impact from Health Care Reform of $200 million to $250 million. 
Let me remind you that we do not hedge revenues and operating expenses separately. We hedge our net foreign currency exposure over a rolling three-year horizon with the financial impact of our hedges reflected in the revenue line of the income statement. While foreign exchange volatility could materially impact revenue and operating expense, we do not anticipate any material impact on EPS. 
Our EPS guidance remains unchanged. We still expect EPS to be towards the lower end of our current guidance range of $5.05 to $5.25. This guidance considers the expected increases in R&D and SG&A in the second half of the year that I alluded to earlier. 
With respect to the tax rate guidance, we continue to expect that our 2010 adjusted tax rate will be in the 20% to 21% range. As a reminder, this guidance assumes that the R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended for all of 2010. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million. 
Thank you and next to Bob, President and CEO for operations review."
24816,109404809,70648,"Amgen Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Michael. I'm delighted to have a chance to talk to you today in my new capacity, and it's indeed a privilege to have an opportunity, to help build on the foundation of operational success that our company has enjoyed. With my new role, I can as",818,"Thank you, Michael. I'm delighted to have a chance to talk to you today in my new capacity, and it's indeed a privilege to have an opportunity, to help build on the foundation of operational success that our company has enjoyed. With my new role, I can assure you that we'll be focused on delivery and execution in several areas, including stabilizing and growing our core franchises of that in the phase of increased payor and competitive pricing pressures, successfully launching Prolia globally and here, I can report that every sign we see so far, confirms what we have believed about the unmet medical need that this therapy addresses, and our operations and commercial teams are right on track at this early stage of the product launch. 
Turning to the announcement bronchology, obviously we're excited that our file with the FDA has been granted a priority review, and we will be prepared to bring this important therapy to patients once approvals occur around the globe. Internationally, we remain committed to increasing our global sales footprint through our multi-year expansion initiative, which will increase the number of territories in which we sell our products from the current 46 to approximately 75. 
We remain focused on optimizing our manufacturing and supply chain through our operational excellence program, with the broad objective of continually improving on our efficient and safe supply of medicine to our patients. This area has been a core strength for Amgen and Fabrizio Bonanni and his team have made great progress in this regard. Finally, we'll continue to look for ways to achieve sustained growth through disciplined capital investing and improving utilization of our facilities. 
With that, I'd like to provide an overview of our commercial operations during the second quarter. So if you'll turn to Page 9. Starting with the year-on-year comparison, our global product sales declined by $21 million or 1%, which was affected by a few key factors. 
On the downside, our global Aranesp sales declined by $90 million or 13%, which I'll discuss in more detail in a moment, and we booked Health Care Reform accruals of about $36 million on the quarter. These downsides were partially offset by $69 million in growth across the rest of the global franchise, a 2% growth rate. Now there was in the quarter an $11 million benefit from foreign exchange, and the U.S. wholesaler inventory benefit of about $18 million. 
Now I know there's been much discussion about the mandatory price cuts in Europe, so I want to give you some perspective on how it affects us. First, let me remind you that our European sales are about 18% of our worldwide total sales, and we entered the year expecting that the effective price cuts across the International business would be about 3%. That 3% included our expectations for business as usual, payor-mandated price cuts, as well as competitive price cuts related to biosimilars. Now as a result of the incremental mandatory price actions announced over the past several weeks, we believe the effect on our business internationally this year will be some 4% or one percentage point worse than what we had planned for. 
Sequentially now, turning to global sales, you can see they grew 2% for the quarter or $85 million, and that was largely driven by seasonal increase in Enbrel demand and aided by favorable inventory effect. These were partially offset by lower sequential demand for Aranesp and Filgrastim. Importantly in the second quarter, we received regulatory approvals for Prolia in key markets and launched our selling effort. In the U.S., we were in the market with product and our sales force fully trained and deployed as of June 21. 
In Europe as you know, we received approval on May 28, and we've already received reimbursement authorization in Germany, and expect to receive reimbursement in another handful of countries in Europe over the course of the year. And in the meantime, we're selling into the private insurance markets. We've received regulatory approval in Australia, and we anticipate reimbursement authorization there next year, and so finally, we recorded some $3 million in sales for the quarter for Prolia, which reflects the fact that we had few selling days after the launch. 
Turning now to Slide 10, which graphically illustrates the components of our year-over-year growth in the second quarter for the portfolio. You can see the $90 million decline in Aranesp depicted here in the separate U.S. and International components. Both markets experienced segment decline, reflecting more conservative ESA utilization worldwide. 
Enbrel also experienced a modest sales decline, largely attributable to unit-demand decline, partially offset by an increase in average-net-sales price. As you can also see, the newer products, Vectibix and Nplate  are growing nicely and contributed nearly $50 million of growth in the quarter. Now, I'll turn it over to Jim Daly, who will discuss each of the product results in more detail."
24816,109404809,70648,"Amgen Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's go straight to Slide 11. Worldwide Aranesp sales declined 13% in the second quarter year-over-year. In the U.S., Aranesp sales were down 21% year-over-year, while internationally, sales were down 5%. The",1558,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's go straight to Slide 11. Worldwide Aranesp sales declined 13% in the second quarter year-over-year. In the U.S., Aranesp sales were down 21% year-over-year, while internationally, sales were down 5%. The decline in both markets was demand driven, primarily due to segment decline. 
Slide 12 displays actual weekly U.S. Aranesp sales going back to 2008. As a reminder, the sharp peaks and troughs are largely a result of wholesaler-inventory fluctuations, not fluctuations in actual-patient utilization. The red trend lines indicate average-weekly sales over the past five quarters. These lines exclude returns and discount accrual true ups, as well as effects of wholesaler inventory fluctuations, which all serve to distort the quarter-on-quarter comparisons shown on the previous slide. As you can see, average weekly sales for Aranesp have declined slightly in the second quarter 2010, reflecting a trend towards more conservative use of ESA's in both oncology and nephrology. 
In late March, we launched the oncology REMS and CMS conducted a MEDCAC meeting on the use of ESA's in the nephrology setting. We cannot rule out a further decline in Aranesp sales, as a consequence of these events. 
Filgrastim is next on Slide 13. Neulasta/NEUPOGEN combined sales grew 1% in the second quarter year-over-year. In the U.S., sales grew 2%, primarily driven by inventory, price and partially offset by a decline in units. Contributing to the unfavorable unit comparison, was the impact of a late first-quarter buying by customers to take advantage of favorable contractual terms, that expired in late March of this year. Neulasta wholesaler inventory levels exited the second quarter near the midpoint of the normal range, while NEUPOGEN exit the second quarter at the low end of the normal range. 
Internationally, Neulasta/NEUPOGEN increased 1% year-on-year. Neulasta experienced 6% growth for the period, while NEUPOGEN sales declined 9%, due to the impact of biosimilars. 
Next is Enbrel on Slide 14. Net sales were down 2% in the second quarter year-over-year. The decline was primarily driven by market-share loss to new competition. Net-price growth partially offset our unit decline. On A sequential quarter basis, Enbrel net sales were up 9%. This increase was driven by demand, with growth in both Rheumatology and Dermatology. Historically, both Rheumatology and Dermatology segments have been impacted by seasonality with softness, typically seen in the first quarter, followed by strength in the second quarter as patients work through their annual deductibles and other insurance changes. In the second quarter 2010, this seasonal pattern has continued. Enbrel maintained its leadership position in both Rheumatology and Dermatology during the second quarter. 
Next is EPOGEN on Slide 15. EPOGEN grew by 3% in the second quarter year-over-year, driven by patient growth, wholesaler inventory and partially offset by a decline in dose. During the year, dose fluctuations may continue as providers refined their treatment practices in order to maintain hemoglobin levels in the 10 to 12 range. 
On The next slide, we'll address the final rule on bundling and dialysis, which goes into effect January 2011. This past Monday, CMS published the final rule. CMS also published concurrently, the ESRD Quality Improvement Program, QIP proposed rule. This proposed rule will have a 60-day comment period ending September 24, 2010, and the final rule is expected in 2011. 
Key provisions under these rules include the following. Anemia management. Under the QIP, beginning in 2012, facilities will be subject to a payment penalty of up to 2%, for failure to meet or exceed CMS standards. CMS proposes a penalty be based on a composite score of measures, and that the measure for hemoglobin levels below 10 grams per deciliter, constitute 50% of the weight, and the remaining measures each represent 25% of the weight. 
Unit of payment. CMS finalizes its proposal to continue a per-treatment unit of payment. Consistent with current policy, ESRD facilities could be paid for up to three treatments per week, unless medical necessity justifies more. 
Payment rate. For 2011, the base rate is $229.63, which is based on 2007 claims data and the application of several adjustors. Total spending in 2011 under the bundled-payment system is based on 98% of estimated spending, if bundling had not been implemented. 
Oral drugs without IV equivalents. CMS finalized the definition of renal-dialysis services, to include oral-only drugs, for postponed payments for such drugs until January 1, 2014. Oral-only drugs such as Sensipar and phosphate binders, will remain under Medicare beneficiaries, prescription-drug benefit and paid for under Medicare Part D until 2014. Amgen is supportive of policies that improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery, as well as preserve patient access to imported medicines for patients on dialysis. 
The ESRD final rule demonstrates CMS' strong commitment to these principles. We are continuing to review the final rule to better understand the potential impact on patient access and quality of care. 
Now let's move to Sensipar performance on Slide 17. For the second quarter, Worldwide Sensipar sales grew 3% versus last year, primarily driven by demand. In the U.S., inventory decreased in the second quarter this year compared to an inventory build last year, partially offset by demand. International growth was 11%, driven by demand. 
Next is Vectibix on Slide 18. U.S. Vectibix sales grew 21% versus the prior year, primarily due to demand, while International sales grew 34% in the second quarter. 
On Slide 19, we provide an update on our overall Health Care Reform impacts. As the slide indicates, we have already booked $69 million in accruals this year for the three components of Health Care Reform that are currently in effect, circled here in red. As you can see, we will be accruing for these three components in the third quarter. And by the fourth quarter, the AMP calculation charges will also become effective. Finally, we're maintaining our estimated range of $200 million to $250 million impact for Health Care Reform in 2010. 
Slide 20 summarizes our International performance. Internationally, sales grew 2%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. Growth was driven by new product launches and expansion to new territories, offset by a decline in Aranesp sales. 
On the next few slides, we'll look at the share data for Aranesp Nephrology, followed by share for the Filgrastim franchise. Consistent with previous quarters, Aranesp Nephrology share remained steady as Biosimilars continue to take share from Epo alpha and Epo beta, and Mircera growth continue to drive largely from NeoRecormon. 
Slide 22 provides comparable data for the G-CSF market. Again, we see very consistent trends despite Biosimilar presence in our major markets. 
On my final slide, we'll provide a Prolia launch update. In both the U.S. and the EU, we are on track with our launch plan and encouraged by the early market reaction to Prolia. In the U.S., physicians are trialling the product in some of their most difficult-to-treat patients, while assessing reimbursement and patient affordability. Nearly 90% of Prolia sales to date have been accessed via ""buy and bill"" reimbursement. 50% of patients have had a co-pay of zero to $15. And for the remaining 50% of patients, the co-pay remains modest. 
It may be useful to you for me to take a minute and outline the “buy and bill” process in just a little more detail. Step one is clinical agreement, in which the physicians identify appropriate patients based upon the Prolia prescribing information. Typically, these are postmenopausal women with a history of fracture or multiple risk factors for fracture or who have failed other therapy or who are intolerant of other therapy. Overall, our early experience is that physicians are readily able to identify appropriate patients for Prolia in their practice. 
Step two is coverage confirmation. The physician's office staff submits an insurance verification requests, or IVR, to our reimbursement hub called Prolia plus. Within a day or two, the office staff receives back a summary of benefits, which is what the payor will reimburse and what, if anything, the patient must pay. The staff discusses this with the patient and then orders Prolia from their wholesaler. 
Step three, the patient returns to the office and Prolia is administered. Step four, the office submits the claim and reimbursement is paid, generally, within 14 to 30 days, assuming a clean claim. With new products, it's not unusual for a payor to request additional documentation. 
To date, many claims have been submitted, and we expect the bulk of them to be start being paid in August and September. Once offices have received paid claims, we expect they will continue to identify additional patients appropriate for Prolia. This process is the basis for our sales forecast ramp in 2010. In early 2011, we expect utilization of the pharmacy benefit under Medicare Part D to increase as prescription drug plans make their formulary decisions. 
Turning to Europe. Germany is our first major market, with reimbursement received on July 1, and we're off to a strong start. We're also encouraged by the positive preliminary NICE recommendation for Prolia, Prolia reimbursement in the U.K., and expect to see sales ramp in the fourth quarter of this year when the recommendation becomes effective. Reimbursement and launch in additional major markets, including France and Spain, is expected in early 2011. We look forward to providing you with more detailed information on the Prolia launch on our third quarter call. Now over to Roger."

Well, as Kevin mentioned, the second quarter of 2010 was an extremely important one for Amgen's Research and Development group, and especially for our Global Regulatory and Safety Surveillance organization. 
Slide 25, documents that we are pursuing Prolia regulatory approval around the globe. And again, as Bob indicated, our first approval came in Europe from the European Medicines Agency at the end of May, followed almost immediately thereafter by U.S. FDA approval. We also have approval in Australia, and we are expecting approval in Canada and in Switzerland during the third quarter of this year. I wish also to mention that we are in the process of preparing more than 30 filings around the world in collaboration with our partners, GlaxoSmithKline. So in short order, we will be pursuing Prolia launches throughout the globe. 
Turning to Slide 26. Prolia is Denosumab administered at 60 milligrams once every six months. But Denosumab can also  be administered in a more intensive schedule at 12x the exposure, which is at a 120 milligrams every month in the setting of advanced cancer. I've spoken previously in a variety of settings about the importance of Denosumab in the setting and reducing or delaying the appearance of skeletal-related events in patients with bony metastasis, and we have submitted our file to the FDA and to other regulatory authorities for that indication. 
As Kevin mentioned, the U.S. FDA granted priority review, with a PDUFA date of November 18, 2010, and we're working closely with the FDA in evaluating our data set. Also, the review by the European Medicines Agency is proceeding with the usual cadence. Filing has also been completed in Canada and Australia and our partner, Daiichi Sankyo, expects to file for approval in Japan for the skeletal-related events indication in the third quarter of this year. Other filings around the world will be pursued in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline. I should mention that in addition to Denosumab as Prolia and also in the more intensive schedule for skeletal-related events, we are expecting a lot of important new data, which will arrive later this year. 
And turning to Slide 27. There are several key events that I wish to highlight. First of all, during the third quarter of this year, we will obtain data on the use of Vectibix in the setting of refractory relapse or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and these data should be available relatively shortly. We also will gain data from an important Phase III study of Denosumab for the prevention of bony metastasis in patients with prostate cancer at high risk for bony metastasis, so cold '147 study, and these data will be available in the fourth quarter of this year. 
As Kevin mentioned, we have initiated our -- or we will initiate our first Phase III study for AMG 386, and we are expecting to have patients with relapsed refractory ovarian cancer joining the study in the fourth quarter of this year. And we do intend also to advance the AMG 479 study into Phase III, so likely the first patient will not be admitted to these studies until the beginning of 2011. Additional Phase II data sets from our AMG 386, AMG 479 and from the AMG 827 programs will also become available later in this year, and we'll have the opportunity to share those with you at future earnings calls.

In terms of the second part of your question, what impact will this have on utilization? Well, certainly, there's a couple of things we do not anticipate happening. One, we do not anticipate wholesale moves to subdue administration for a number of reasons, including the fact that our label recommends against it and also the fact that patients do not like it. And also, the clinical data is somewhat dubious in terms of what type of dose savings you can actually realize over an extended period of time. So we don't see that as a major drag on utilization. We don't see IV iron creating a major drag on utilization. Most patients, 85% are iron replete, so we don't see that as being a major issue. Where we're modeling right now potential utilization impact is on hyporesponder patients. Right now, if you define a hyporesponder as we do in our label, patients who fail to achieve 10 up to 12 weeks. That's about 1% of patients who represent about 3% of utilization."

If you contrast Germany, which once you have government reimbursement as we received on July 1, German physicians are free to prescribe for virtually any patient. And as a result, we are seeing very nice uptake of the product in Germany, which is consistent with our expectation that there is a relatively large population of patients who will benefit from Prolia. In the U.S., you have a rate-limiting step, which is reimbursement. Right now we're focused on the medical benefit, and physicians are reluctant to put a large number of patients on the product until they have greater confidence that reimbursement will be adequate, timely and the patients will not have an exorbitant out-of-pocket costs.

The data for AMG 386 and for AMG 479 from the Phase II studies are pretty impressive. Now for 386, you have data in the ovarian cancer setting in which there is -- it's placebo-controlled data that we actually are doing a direct study of chemotherapy plus AMG 386 versus AMG chemotherapy alone. And if there is a dose-response curve, so that the 10-milligram per kilogram arm was more impressive than the 3-milligram per kilogram arm, which in itself still demonstrated a response compared to chemotherapy alone. And the data showed that not only could you see an effect with respect to the tumors themselves, but there's also a quantitative effect with respect to, in this case, a biomarker for tumor mass CA-125. So all of that tends to give you more confidence that, in fact, you will see a treatment effect that duplicates that in the Phase III study. Of course, the magnitude could be different, the extent to which overall survival might be prolonged. In such a study, it could be different, but it gives you more confidence. And similarly, the magnitude of the treatment effect and the fact that there is an exposure-response relationship with the AMG 479 study in pancreatic cancer also gives you some confidence. You can never be sure. Just as you say, you have to see the Phase III studies. But the data sets are really quite impressive in Phase II and more robust than most that you usually see. We've got a lot of other things going on in the cancer area as we talked about at ASCO, and we can get to that some other time.

So you're looking at Simponi, Actemra, Cimzia. So it's inevitable you're going to lose some level of share as the market leader. Now in dermatology, I think it's a little different. The share loss is primarily going to STELARA, which is a new market entrant. STELARA has a 13% share, and we've seen our market share go to 49%.

I would like to welcome you to our second quarterly results conference call, another solid quarter behind us as we embark on the second half of this year. 
It's also been a year of tremendous change as many of the uncertainties weighing on our business have now been resolved. To discuss these issues in greater detail, as well as to introduce the many changes we have had on our leadership team, I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Kevin Sharer. Following Kevin, our acting CFO, Michael Kelly, will both provide additional details on our second quarter financial performance. Bob Bradway, our newly appointed President and Chief Operating Officer, will then articulate his charter for our company's operations, followed by Jim Daly. Jim is our Senior Vice President of North American Commercial Operations, and he will focus on three main topics: First, our product performance during the quarter; second, an early read on the Prolia launch; and lastly, our perspective on the recent final rule for the bundled-payment system for dialysis patients. Our Head of R&D, Roger Perlmutter will conclude our prepared comments by providing an R&D update. 
We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you separately by email. I would like to remind you that our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement. What it says in summary is that through the course of our presentation today, we may make certain forward-looking statements and actual results could vary materially.

Our base business continues to perform well both financially and operationally. 
Internationally, we're competing effectively, continuing to compete effectively against biosimilars, and we're seeing growth through new markets and products. Research and development, as Roger will report and you've probably concluded is, firing on all cylinders, and we have a lot to be proud of and a lot to look forward to. 
And I'd also like to take this moment to thank all of the Amgen staff who are listening and others for all the work you've done this year to make a difference for patients and to deliver value for our shareholders. As Arvind commented, we've had quite a number of significant events this year, and before I make specific comments, I'd like to recognize some of those events, put them in context and give you my perspective on them. 
Just six-short months ago, we were uncertain about whether Health Care Reform [U.S. Health Care Reform Legislation] would happen, and if it happened, what might be the effect us both financially and on a public-policy sense. The progress of Prolia and osteoporosis around the world and Denosumab in cancer were not nearly so clear as they are now. A number of ESA franchise questions were outstanding, important questions that we have much more information on now. And finally, we saw Europe as a region go through, to a degree, still go through, some very significant economic uncertainties with some impact in some countries on the biopharmaceutical space. 
I think my summary comment is from Amgen's point of view. Each one of these major questions of say, six months ago, have been answered in ways that are either within our expectation, or in some cases, even better. So sitting here now six months later, I feel proud of what we've done and very confident about the future. 
Let me talk first about Health Care Reform. We'll talk more specifically later. But I think Health Care Reform has been internalized by us. We can handle it economically, and we are delighted with the public policy rules that have come about with respect to biosimilars. And I'll let Jim later on, talk a bit and Michael about the economics. But we can handle them. 
Let's talk a little bit about Denosumab and Prolia. 
We were particularly pleased to receive Prolia's approvals in both the U.S. and the EU in the second quarter. A very, very major milestone we worked 15 years to achieve. And while it's still early days from a commercial point of view to launch as are progressing both in Europe and United States as we had planned, Jim will talk about it, a bit of few highlights. The initial feedback from physicians has been positive, and with GSK, we have a strong partner in the rest of the world, so I'm feeling optimistic based on where we are today. 
Jim Daly will give your more input and information about Prolia with a bit of a focus on the U.S. in a moment. Recently, as you know, the FDA granted priority review designation to Denosumab for the reduction of skeletal related events in patients with advanced cancer. Prior to review, designation is granted to drugs that offer potential for major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. So this is a real testament to the data generated in our SRE studies, where we compared ourselves to the market leader or the current standard of care. 
Also at the beginning of 2010, there were a number of uncertainties that related to our ESA business. And today, many of these, if not all of these issues have been addressed, if not resolved. Just to mention a few: The ESA REMS has been finalized. Enrollment is underway and we feel positive about the state of that business. CMS held a MEDCAC meeting on ESAs in nephrology, and we felt that, that was a productive discussion. 
We've all seen the top line Hematide data, and we'll continue to watch its development. The final dialysis bundling rule is now out. We believe it is within our expectations and recognizes the importance of delivering quality care to patients. Roger will have more to say about this. Overall, we have a lot more clarity as we think about the future of the ESA business, and look forward to discussing the TREAT study in more detail at an advisory committee meeting later this year. 
The pipeline is the driver of future growth and ours continues to deliver. We had a good ASCO last month with much interest in our pipeline, and the progress continues. We're moving two of our oncology molecules, AMG 479 and 386 [AMG 386], an important tumor types in the Phase III, Roger will comment. As you know, we look forward to the more pivotal data yet this year, including the Denosumab bone mass prevention data. Roger will discuss this as well. 
I'll be remiss if I didn't comment on some of the management changes that have recently happened. Companies of all managements change and strong companies replace strong management with new strong management. I believe we have done that. 
Before I comment specifically, I'd like to recognize someone who is making an appearance today on the call, Michael Kelly. Michael Kelly is a distinguished and experienced financial executive, who's been our acting CFO for a number of months, and I'd like to recognize his contribution and partnership. Michael, thank you. 
Here is some leadership changes that we have announced and I'll comment. Bob Bradway was recently appointed our President and Chief Operating Officer. Bob's leadership and experience make him the right person for this important position. We recently announced we would be replacing Bob as permanent CFO with Jonathan Peacock. Jonathan will join us later this summer, and he brings a set of skills in international experience that will be critical as we implement our international-expansion strategy. 
Finally, I'd like to comment on George Morrow. It's hard to put into words what George has meant to this company for the past 10 years. He's been one of our key leaders, he's been one of my key partners, he delivered for shareholders, he delivered for patients and he built a very strong management team. In fact, two of the folks who reported to him are moving up the organization, Rolf Hoffmann, has grown international; and Jim Daly, North America. You'll hear later from Jim today, as he discusses the results. We have much to thank George for, and I, here publicly, want to acknowledge that. George will be with us until early next year, and I want to assure everyone on this call that we continue to benefit from George's advice and perspective and he remains integral to us. 
For the rest of the year, as it is every year, delivering financially, making our products, particularly Prolia's success, advancing the pipeline, expanding internationally and creating value for our shareholders, will remain our key priorities. I'd like to now turn the call over to Michael Kelly, who will discuss our quarterly performance in more detail. Michael, over to you."

On Page 5, I'll take you through the adjusted P&L for the quarter. Year-over-year revenues were up 2% in the second quarter to $3.8 billion.

Year-over-year revenues were up 2% in the second quarter to $3.8 billion. In terms of geography, our year of sales decreased 2% to $2.8 billion for the quarter. Excluding Aranesp, which was down again this quarter, U.S. sales were up 1% on a year-over-year basis. With respect to wholesale-inventory levels, we exited the quarter in the U.S. and overall wholesaler inventory at the mid to low end of normal ranges. 
Second quarter U.S. revenues include a $45 million accrual for certain Health Care Reform Legislation provisions that were in effect during the quarter, partially offset by a $9 million favorable adjustment related to changes in accounting estimates with respect to accruals for U.S. Health Care Reform, recorded in the first quarter of 2010. 
Recall in the first quarter, we said that we expect the full year 2010 impact of Health Care Reform to be in the range of $200 million to $250 million, and that estimate remains unchanged. Jim will speak in some detail in a moment on the topic of Health Care Reform and its continued impact on our business. 
Shifting now to our International business, we posted sales of $826 million, an increase of 3% versus the prior year. Changes in foreign exchange positively impacted second quarter sales by $11 million. Without that benefit, International sales were up 2% year-over-year. I will have more to say about foreign exchange in a moment. 
I also want to note that revenues in the second quarter of 2010, benefited from milestone payments associated with certain ongoing collaborations, revenues reflect milestone payments from GlaxoSmithKline for approval and launch of Prolia in Europe and from Takeda for the approval of Vectibix in Japan. 
Turning now to operating expenses. On an adjusted basis, our total operating expenses were up 4% this quarter versus last year. Our cost of sales margin increased 0.7%, primarily driven by higher bulk material costs and less-favorable product mix. This increase was partially offset by lower royalties and lower excess-capacity charges. 
R&D expenses decreased 2%, primarily driven by the $50 million payment in the second quarter of 2009, to obtain an exclusive license from Cytokinetics, partially offset by lower expense recoveries associated with ongoing collaborations in higher staff-related cost. We continue to expect R&D expenses to increase in the second half of the year, consistent with our spending patterns in prior years. 
SG&A expenses increased 9% versus the same quarter last year. This increase includes higher staff-related costs and spending for activities in anticipation of the approval of Prolia. We expect SG&A expenditures to increase in the second half of the year, primarily driven by Prolia-related activities. Recall that in the second quarter of 2009, our Prolia sales force was not yet hired. 
In addition, SG&A expenses were higher in Q2 2010 due to higher mitigation expenses and higher staff-related costs, which were partially offset by expenses associated with the Enbrel profit share and expense recoveries associated with the GlaxoSmithKline collaboration agreement for Prolia. 
Excluding expenses associated with the Enbrel profit share, adjusted SG&A expenses in the second quarter of 2010 increased 14% versus the same quarter last year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20% compared to 18.1% in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to the benefit of the federal R&D tax credit in the second quarter of 2009, and changes in profits associated with our Puerto Rico operations in the second quarter of 2010, versus the second quarter of 2009. Q1 2010 adjusted earnings per share were $1.38, up 7% versus prior year, and our GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.25, unchanged from the prior year. 
Now turning to the balance sheet on Page 6. You should note, we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flow. Let me spend a moment to discuss some key balance sheet items. Our Q2 2010 ending global cash balance was $14.5 billion, we ended the quarter with $12.2 billion of debt. Our adjusted stockholders' equity increased by $2 billion year-over-year to $22.9 billion. With respect to our cash flow, we generated approximate $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations in the second quarter of 2010, which is down slightly year-over-year. 
Capital expenditures for the second quarter were $177 million. We repurchased approximately 10 million of shares during the second quarter of 2010 at a cost of $600 million, bringing our cumulative share repurchases for 2010 to 39 million shares at a cost of $2.3 billion. We had 3.7 billion remaining under our board authorized stock repurchase program as of June 30, 2010. 
Next, our updated guidance is on Page 7. When we updated our revenue guidance in the first quarter, the prevailing dollar-euro spot rate was in the high 1.30s per euro. The exchange rate has been in the mid to high 1.20s per euro over the past several weeks. As you know, the majority of our foreign revenue is denominated in euros. 
Adjusting for the impact of a weaker euro, we now expect revenue to be slightly below $15.1 billion. This guidance assumes that foreign-exchange rates remain at current spot levels for the second half of the year. Our guidance continues to reflect the expected impact from Health Care Reform of $200 million to $250 million. 
Let me remind you that we do not hedge revenues and operating expenses separately. We hedge our net foreign currency exposure over a rolling three-year horizon with the financial impact of our hedges reflected in the revenue line of the income statement. While foreign exchange volatility could materially impact revenue and operating expense, we do not anticipate any material impact on EPS. 
Our EPS guidance remains unchanged. We still expect EPS to be towards the lower end of our current guidance range of $5.05 to $5.25. This guidance considers the expected increases in R&D and SG&A in the second half of the year that I alluded to earlier. 
With respect to the tax rate guidance, we continue to expect that our 2010 adjusted tax rate will be in the 20% to 21% range. As a reminder, this guidance assumes that the R&D tax credit will be retroactively extended for all of 2010. Finally, we continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $600 million. 
Thank you and next to Bob, President and CEO for operations review."

I'm delighted to have a chance to talk to you today in my new capacity, and it's indeed a privilege to have an opportunity, to help build on the foundation of operational success that our company has enjoyed. With my new role, I can assure you that we'll be focused on delivery and execution in several areas, including stabilizing and growing our core franchises of that in the phase of increased payor and competitive pricing pressures, successfully launching Prolia globally and here, I can report that every sign we see so far, confirms what we have believed about the unmet medical need that this therapy addresses, and our operations and commercial teams are right on track at this early stage of the product launch. 
Turning to the announcement bronchology, obviously we're excited that our file with the FDA has been granted a priority review, and we will be prepared to bring this important therapy to patients once approvals occur around the globe. Internationally, we remain committed to increasing our global sales footprint through our multi-year expansion initiative, which will increase the number of territories in which we sell our products from the current 46 to approximately 75. 
We remain focused on optimizing our manufacturing and supply chain through our operational excellence program, with the broad objective of continually improving on our efficient and safe supply of medicine to our patients. This area has been a core strength for Amgen and Fabrizio Bonanni and his team have made great progress in this regard. Finally, we'll continue to look for ways to achieve sustained growth through disciplined capital investing and improving utilization of our facilities. 
With that, I'd like to provide an overview of our commercial operations during the second quarter. So if you'll turn to Page 9. Starting with the year-on-year comparison, our global product sales declined by $21 million or 1%, which was affected by a few key factors. 
On the downside, our global Aranesp sales declined by $90 million or 13%, which I'll discuss in more detail in a moment, and we booked Health Care Reform accruals of about $36 million on the quarter. These downsides were partially offset by $69 million in growth across the rest of the global franchise, a 2% growth rate. Now there was in the quarter an $11 million benefit from foreign exchange, and the U.S. wholesaler inventory benefit of about $18 million. 
Now I know there's been much discussion about the mandatory price cuts in Europe, so I want to give you some perspective on how it affects us. First, let me remind you that our European sales are about 18% of our worldwide total sales, and we entered the year expecting that the effective price cuts across the International business would be about 3%. That 3% included our expectations for business as usual, payor-mandated price cuts, as well as competitive price cuts related to biosimilars. Now as a result of the incremental mandatory price actions announced over the past several weeks, we believe the effect on our business internationally this year will be some 4% or one percentage point worse than what we had planned for. 
Sequentially now, turning to global sales, you can see they grew 2% for the quarter or $85 million, and that was largely driven by seasonal increase in Enbrel demand and aided by favorable inventory effect. These were partially offset by lower sequential demand for Aranesp and Filgrastim. Importantly in the second quarter, we received regulatory approvals for Prolia in key markets and launched our selling effort. In the U.S., we were in the market with product and our sales force fully trained and deployed as of June 21. 
In Europe as you know, we received approval on May 28, and we've already received reimbursement authorization in Germany, and expect to receive reimbursement in another handful of countries in Europe over the course of the year. And in the meantime, we're selling into the private insurance markets. We've received regulatory approval in Australia, and we anticipate reimbursement authorization there next year, and so finally, we recorded some $3 million in sales for the quarter for Prolia, which reflects the fact that we had few selling days after the launch. 
Turning now to Slide 10, which graphically illustrates the components of our year-over-year growth in the second quarter for the portfolio. You can see the $90 million decline in Aranesp depicted here in the separate U.S. and International components. Both markets experienced segment decline, reflecting more conservative ESA utilization worldwide. 
Enbrel also experienced a modest sales decline, largely attributable to unit-demand decline, partially offset by an increase in average-net-sales price. As you can also see, the newer products, Vectibix and Nplate  are growing nicely and contributed nearly $50 million of growth in the quarter. Now, I'll turn it over to Jim Daly, who will discuss each of the product results in more detail."
24816,109404809,70649,"Amgen Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's go straight to Slide 11. Worldwide Aranesp sales declined 13% in the second quarter year-over-year. In the U.S., Aranesp sales were down 21% year-over-year, while internationally, sales were down 5%. The",1558,"Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's go straight to Slide 11. Worldwide Aranesp sales declined 13% in the second quarter year-over-year. In the U.S., Aranesp sales were down 21% year-over-year, while internationally, sales were down 5%. The decline in both markets was demand driven, primarily due to segment decline. 
Slide 12 displays actual weekly U.S. Aranesp sales going back to 2008. As a reminder, the sharp peaks and troughs are largely a result of wholesaler-inventory fluctuations, not fluctuations in actual-patient utilization. The red trend lines indicate average-weekly sales over the past five quarters. These lines exclude returns and discount accrual true ups, as well as effects of wholesaler inventory fluctuations, which all serve to distort the quarter-on-quarter comparisons shown on the previous slide. As you can see, average weekly sales for Aranesp have declined slightly in the second quarter 2010, reflecting a trend towards more conservative use of ESA's in both oncology and nephrology. 
In late March, we launched the oncology REMS and CMS conducted a MEDCAC meeting on the use of ESA's in the nephrology setting. We cannot rule out a further decline in Aranesp sales, as a consequence of these events. 
Filgrastim is next on Slide 13. Neulasta/NEUPOGEN combined sales grew 1% in the second quarter year-over-year. In the U.S., sales grew 2%, primarily driven by inventory, price and partially offset by a decline in units. Contributing to the unfavorable unit comparison, was the impact of a late first-quarter buying by customers to take advantage of favorable contractual terms, that expired in late March of this year. Neulasta wholesaler inventory levels exited the second quarter near the midpoint of the normal range, while NEUPOGEN exit the second quarter at the low end of the normal range. 
Internationally, Neulasta/NEUPOGEN increased 1% year-on-year. Neulasta experienced 6% growth for the period, while NEUPOGEN sales declined 9%, due to the impact of biosimilars. 
Next is Enbrel on Slide 14. Net sales were down 2% in the second quarter year-over-year. The decline was primarily driven by market-share loss to new competition. Net-price growth partially offset our unit decline. On A sequential quarter basis, Enbrel net sales were up 9%. This increase was driven by demand, with growth in both Rheumatology and Dermatology. Historically, both Rheumatology and Dermatology segments have been impacted by seasonality with softness, typically seen in the first quarter, followed by strength in the second quarter as patients work through their annual deductibles and other insurance changes. In the second quarter 2010, this seasonal pattern has continued. Enbrel maintained its leadership position in both Rheumatology and Dermatology during the second quarter. 
Next is EPOGEN on Slide 15. EPOGEN grew by 3% in the second quarter year-over-year, driven by patient growth, wholesaler inventory and partially offset by a decline in dose. During the year, dose fluctuations may continue as providers refined their treatment practices in order to maintain hemoglobin levels in the 10 to 12 range. 
On The next slide, we'll address the final rule on bundling and dialysis, which goes into effect January 2011. This past Monday, CMS published the final rule. CMS also published concurrently, the ESRD Quality Improvement Program, QIP proposed rule. This proposed rule will have a 60-day comment period ending September 24, 2010, and the final rule is expected in 2011. 
Key provisions under these rules include the following. Anemia management. Under the QIP, beginning in 2012, facilities will be subject to a payment penalty of up to 2%, for failure to meet or exceed CMS standards. CMS proposes a penalty be based on a composite score of measures, and that the measure for hemoglobin levels below 10 grams per deciliter, constitute 50% of the weight, and the remaining measures each represent 25% of the weight. 
Unit of payment. CMS finalizes its proposal to continue a per-treatment unit of payment. Consistent with current policy, ESRD facilities could be paid for up to three treatments per week, unless medical necessity justifies more. 
Payment rate. For 2011, the base rate is $229.63, which is based on 2007 claims data and the application of several adjustors. Total spending in 2011 under the bundled-payment system is based on 98% of estimated spending, if bundling had not been implemented. 
Oral drugs without IV equivalents. CMS finalized the definition of renal-dialysis services, to include oral-only drugs, for postponed payments for such drugs until January 1, 2014. Oral-only drugs such as Sensipar and phosphate binders, will remain under Medicare beneficiaries, prescription-drug benefit and paid for under Medicare Part D until 2014. Amgen is supportive of policies that improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare delivery, as well as preserve patient access to imported medicines for patients on dialysis. 
The ESRD final rule demonstrates CMS' strong commitment to these principles. We are continuing to review the final rule to better understand the potential impact on patient access and quality of care. 
Now let's move to Sensipar performance on Slide 17. For the second quarter, Worldwide Sensipar sales grew 3% versus last year, primarily driven by demand. In the U.S., inventory decreased in the second quarter this year compared to an inventory build last year, partially offset by demand. International growth was 11%, driven by demand. 
Next is Vectibix on Slide 18. U.S. Vectibix sales grew 21% versus the prior year, primarily due to demand, while International sales grew 34% in the second quarter. 
On Slide 19, we provide an update on our overall Health Care Reform impacts. As the slide indicates, we have already booked $69 million in accruals this year for the three components of Health Care Reform that are currently in effect, circled here in red. As you can see, we will be accruing for these three components in the third quarter. And by the fourth quarter, the AMP calculation charges will also become effective. Finally, we're maintaining our estimated range of $200 million to $250 million impact for Health Care Reform in 2010. 
Slide 20 summarizes our International performance. Internationally, sales grew 2%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. Growth was driven by new product launches and expansion to new territories, offset by a decline in Aranesp sales. 
On the next few slides, we'll look at the share data for Aranesp Nephrology, followed by share for the Filgrastim franchise. Consistent with previous quarters, Aranesp Nephrology share remained steady as Biosimilars continue to take share from Epo alpha and Epo beta, and Mircera growth continue to drive largely from NeoRecormon. 
Slide 22 provides comparable data for the G-CSF market. Again, we see very consistent trends despite Biosimilar presence in our major markets. 
On my final slide, we'll provide a Prolia launch update. In both the U.S. and the EU, we are on track with our launch plan and encouraged by the early market reaction to Prolia. In the U.S., physicians are trialling the product in some of their most difficult-to-treat patients, while assessing reimbursement and patient affordability. Nearly 90% of Prolia sales to date have been accessed via ""buy and bill"" reimbursement. 50% of patients have had a co-pay of zero to $15. And for the remaining 50% of patients, the co-pay remains modest. 
It may be useful to you for me to take a minute and outline the “buy and bill” process in just a little more detail. Step one is clinical agreement, in which the physicians identify appropriate patients based upon the Prolia prescribing information. Typically, these are postmenopausal women with a history of fracture or multiple risk factors for fracture or who have failed other therapy or who are intolerant of other therapy. Overall, our early experience is that physicians are readily able to identify appropriate patients for Prolia in their practice. 
Step two is coverage confirmation. The physician's office staff submits an insurance verification requests, or IVR, to our reimbursement hub called Prolia plus. Within a day or two, the office staff receives back a summary of benefits, which is what the payor will reimburse and what, if anything, the patient must pay. The staff discusses this with the patient and then orders Prolia from their wholesaler. 
Step three, the patient returns to the office and Prolia is administered. Step four, the office submits the claim and reimbursement is paid, generally, within 14 to 30 days, assuming a clean claim. With new products, it's not unusual for a payor to request additional documentation. 
To date, many claims have been submitted, and we expect the bulk of them to be start being paid in August and September. Once offices have received paid claims, we expect they will continue to identify additional patients appropriate for Prolia. This process is the basis for our sales forecast ramp in 2010. In early 2011, we expect utilization of the pharmacy benefit under Medicare Part D to increase as prescription drug plans make their formulary decisions. 
Turning to Europe. Germany is our first major market, with reimbursement received on July 1, and we're off to a strong start. We're also encouraged by the positive preliminary NICE recommendation for Prolia, Prolia reimbursement in the U.K., and expect to see sales ramp in the fourth quarter of this year when the recommendation becomes effective. Reimbursement and launch in additional major markets, including France and Spain, is expected in early 2011. We look forward to providing you with more detailed information on the Prolia launch on our third quarter call. Now over to Roger."

Well, as Kevin mentioned, the second quarter of 2010 was an extremely important one for Amgen's Research and Development group, and especially for our Global Regulatory and Safety Surveillance organization. 
Slide 25, documents that we are pursuing Prolia regulatory approval around the globe. And again, as Bob indicated, our first approval came in Europe from the European Medicines Agency at the end of May, followed almost immediately thereafter by U.S. FDA approval. We also have approval in Australia, and we are expecting approval in Canada and in Switzerland during the third quarter of this year. I wish also to mention that we are in the process of preparing more than 30 filings around the world in collaboration with our partners, GlaxoSmithKline. So in short order, we will be pursuing Prolia launches throughout the globe. 
Turning to Slide 26. Prolia is Denosumab administered at 60 milligrams once every six months. But Denosumab can also  be administered in a more intensive schedule at 12x the exposure, which is at a 120 milligrams every month in the setting of advanced cancer. I've spoken previously in a variety of settings about the importance of Denosumab in the setting and reducing or delaying the appearance of skeletal-related events in patients with bony metastasis, and we have submitted our file to the FDA and to other regulatory authorities for that indication. 
As Kevin mentioned, the U.S. FDA granted priority review, with a PDUFA date of November 18, 2010, and we're working closely with the FDA in evaluating our data set. Also, the review by the European Medicines Agency is proceeding with the usual cadence. Filing has also been completed in Canada and Australia and our partner, Daiichi Sankyo, expects to file for approval in Japan for the skeletal-related events indication in the third quarter of this year. Other filings around the world will be pursued in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline. I should mention that in addition to Denosumab as Prolia and also in the more intensive schedule for skeletal-related events, we are expecting a lot of important new data, which will arrive later this year. 
And turning to Slide 27. There are several key events that I wish to highlight. First of all, during the third quarter of this year, we will obtain data on the use of Vectibix in the setting of refractory relapse or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, and these data should be available relatively shortly. We also will gain data from an important Phase III study of Denosumab for the prevention of bony metastasis in patients with prostate cancer at high risk for bony metastasis, so cold '147 study, and these data will be available in the fourth quarter of this year. 
As Kevin mentioned, we have initiated our -- or we will initiate our first Phase III study for AMG 386, and we are expecting to have patients with relapsed refractory ovarian cancer joining the study in the fourth quarter of this year. And we do intend also to advance the AMG 479 study into Phase III, so likely the first patient will not be admitted to these studies until the beginning of 2011. Additional Phase II data sets from our AMG 386, AMG 479 and from the AMG 827 programs will also become available later in this year, and we'll have the opportunity to share those with you at future earnings calls.

Well, Geoff, I think you put your finger on the core issue, which is these new rules could apply to anywhere from 25% of Medicare dialysis patients all the way up to 100% depending on whether providers decide to opt in 100% or phase in 25% a year. N",280,"Sure. Well, Geoff, I think you put your finger on the core issue, which is these new rules could apply to anywhere from 25% of Medicare dialysis patients all the way up to 100% depending on whether providers decide to opt in 100% or phase in 25% a year. Now CMS interestingly made an assumption of about a 43% opt-in rate. Right now, we're working very close with our customers to understand what they anticipate doing. They have until November 1 to decide one way or the other. So I think this is a situation of stay tuned, and clearly, we will be very close to our customers. In terms of the second part of your question, what impact will this have on utilization? Well, certainly, there's a couple of things we do not anticipate happening. One, we do not anticipate wholesale moves to subdue administration for a number of reasons, including the fact that our label recommends against it and also the fact that patients do not like it. And also, the clinical data is somewhat dubious in terms of what type of dose savings you can actually realize over an extended period of time. So we don't see that as a major drag on utilization. We don't see IV iron creating a major drag on utilization. Most patients, 85% are iron replete, so we don't see that as being a major issue. Where we're modeling right now potential utilization impact is on hyporesponder patients. Right now, if you define a hyporesponder as we do in our label, patients who fail to achieve 10 up to 12 weeks. That's about 1% of patients who represent about 3% of utilization."

If you contrast Germany, which once you have government reimbursement as we received on July 1, German physicians are free to prescribe for virtually any patient. And as a result, we are seeing very nice uptake of the product in Germany, which is consistent with our expectation that there is a relatively large population of patients who will benefit from Prolia. In the U.S., you have a rate-limiting step, which is reimbursement. Right now we're focused on the medical benefit, and physicians are reluctant to put a large number of patients on the product until they have greater confidence that reimbursement will be adequate, timely and the patients will not have an exorbitant out-of-pocket costs.

And if there is a dose-response curve, so that the 10-milligram per kilogram arm was more impressive than the 3-milligram per kilogram arm, which in itself still demonstrated a response compared to chemotherapy alone. And the data showed that not only could you see an effect with respect to the tumors themselves, but there's also a quantitative effect with respect to, in this case, a biomarker for tumor mass CA-125. So all of that tends to give you more confidence that, in fact, you will see a treatment effect that duplicates that in the Phase III study. Of course, the magnitude could be different, the extent to which overall survival might be prolonged. In such a study, it could be different, but it gives you more confidence. And similarly, the magnitude of the treatment effect and the fact that there is an exposure-response relationship with the AMG 479 study in pancreatic cancer also gives you some confidence. You can never be sure. Just as you say, you have to see the Phase III studies. But the data sets are really quite impressive in Phase II and more robust than most that you usually see. We've got a lot of other things going on in the cancer area as we talked about at ASCO, and we can get to that some other time. But I would point out those two studies that we've taken into Phase III are really quite powerful."

The share loss is primarily going to STELARA, which is a new market entrant. STELARA has a 13% share, and we've seen our market share go to 49%. Now the reassuring thing is that the STELARA share has stabilized at 13% quarter-over-quarter. So I think there was a bolus of patients who were refractory to TNF inhibitors.

I'd like to make a few comments about our business as kind of a higher level before I turn the mic over to Jon. 
Overall, I think we had a solid quarter, as we build the foundation for top line growth and invest for the future. Jon Peacock, our new CFO, will comment more fully, but I do note the growth on operating expenses compared to last year. We had an unusually low R&D quarter last year and a few other onetime unfavorable comparisons. I want to reinforce that we manage here very efficiently, and these quarter-over-quarter comparisons are not an indication of this approach has or will change.
Bob will lead the discussion of the Prolia experience to date, but I'd like to make a few comments first. Forecasting the growth ramp of any new product is a challenge. That said, we hear in independent surveys reinforced the attractiveness of Prolia in physician's eyes to treat osteoporosis for significant numbers of patients. Doctors and their offices are working to become accustomed to the new reimbursement dynamics Prolia often represents for them. Once this reimbursement process is mastered and they gain experience, I'm confident usage will be significant.
We look forward to the PDUFA date of November 18 for Denosumab oncology and the AMG 147 results near year end. We cannot predict what will happen November 18, but I am very confident in the medicine.
I am especially proud of our Cardiac team and the high-quality and scientific discussions the panel conducted that day. That was all of us in the medicines development, review and regulatory areas at our best. Finally, I would like to welcome Jon in his new role, and Bob's report after a full quarter in his new role. Jon, over to you."
24816,114170765,81471,"Amgen Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2010",2010-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. I'll briefly review the P&L and balance sheet to provide a perspective on performance in the quarter. Overall, our revenues were $3.8 billion at the same level as the third quarter in 2009. Bob will take you through the drivers of product s",611,"Thanks, Kevin. I'll briefly review the P&L and balance sheet to provide a perspective on performance in the quarter. Overall, our revenues were $3.8 billion at the same level as the third quarter in 2009. Bob will take you through the drivers of product sales in a few minutes. You'll also see that other revenues were down versus a year ago. This is primarily due to the lower partnership income following the PROCRIT recall. 
Commenting on the P&L as a whole, net income declined 14% while our revenues were flat. Kevin highlighted this, and there were two primary reasons for it: The first is that R&D costs, as Kevin mentioned, were unusually low in the third quarter of 2009, but this primarily was used in cost recoveries and true-ups on development projects last year. Our R&D costs this year and the most recent quarter of 18.3% of sales are broadly in line with our normal run rate. The second reason was the tax rate. Quarter three 2009 benefited from tax cases settled in the quarter and the release of some related provisions. The tax rate of 19.1% in 2010 is again more in line with our normal run rate. 
Let me comment briefly on the rest of the P&L. Cost of sales were one point higher than a year ago, roughly half of this was due to inventory write offs as a result of the EPOGEN and PROCRIT recalls. The rest was largely due to higher bulk unit material costs. SG&A spending increased 3% versus a year ago due to promotional activities to support Prolia and some high litigation expenses. Relative to net income, adjusted EPS benefited from buybacks during the year, which I'll comment on as we review cash flow. 
So moving to the balance sheet on the next page. We ended the quarter with $17 billion in cash, up $3 billion versus a year ago and $13.7 billion of debt, up $2.5 billion. This increase in debt results from our two debt offerings over the course of this year in advance of the $2.5 billion convertible that matures in February of 2011. I also wanted to comment on cash flow from operations, which was $1.3 billion in the third quarter. This is down by around $700 million year-over-year, and this is substantially driven by the timing of tax payments to the U.S. tax authorities. 
Finally on the quarter, share repurchases were $6.6 million at a cost of $400 million, bringing the cost of our cumulative repurchases in 2010 to $2.7 billion.
And so in closing, a few remarks on outlook. Firstly, we're re-affirming our full year guidance on revenues at slightly below $15.1 billion and adjusted EPS towards the lower end of $5.05  to $5.25. Secondly, a reminder that consistent with prior-year spending patterns, Q4 operating expenses will be higher relative to the first three quarters. This is due to the timing of a number of our promotional and development projects activities.  Finally, we expect the tax rate for the full year to be around 20%. If the federal R&D tax credit is renewed, it could be marginally lower than that. 
And then finally, one comment related to 2011. As some of you might have seen in the press, the Puerto Rico government introduced and signed new tax legislation over the weekend. We understand that any tax imposed by this legislation on U.S. taxpayers will be creditable against U.S. income taxes, thereby minimizing the impact to U.S. companies. However, legislation is complex. It's just been introduced, and we'll be evaluating its impact on our Puerto Rico activities in the weeks ahead. 
So with that, I'll hand over to Bob."

I'd like to provide a high-level summary of our global commercial performance for the third quarter and offer a few perspective comments on the fourth quarter as well. Our product-by-product details are contained in the remainder of our",984,"Thank you, Jon. I'd like to provide a high-level summary of our global commercial performance for the third quarter and offer a few perspective comments on the fourth quarter as well. 
Our product-by-product details are contained in the remainder of our slide material and in the press release. For the sake of brevity, I won't present this material, but I would also like to note that Jim Daly and George Morrow are here with us on the call, and together, we would be happy to answer product-specific questions during the Q&A period. 
For the year-on-year comparison, our global product sales grew by $23 million or about 1%, which reflects a few key factors: First, our U.S. [indiscernible] sales were up by $45 million or about 5% on the quarter, this after the effects of U.S. Health Care Reform. In addition, our products that are in an earlier stage of their life cycle, and in particular, Sensipar, Vectibix, Nplate and Prolia globally grew by $61 billion or about 24%.
Offsetting this growth were factors including our global Aranesp franchise, which dropped by about $62 million or 9% on the quarter. And in addition, I want to note that we booked accruals for U.S. Health Care Reform of $64 million for the quarter. And as you will recall, our year-to-date Health Care Reform accruals due to the second quarter were $69 million. So you can see the predicted ramp up continues as each element of Health Care Reform is implemented. 
And looking ahead to the remainder of 2010, as you've heard from Jon, we've reiterated our revenue guidance. And I wanted to suggest that when you think about the fourth quarter, bear in mind that we are expecting a growing impact from the ESA REMS program in the U.S. and we expect to see some impact from dialysis providers as they prepare for the bundled reimbursement environment.
Turning to Prolia, let me provide you with some additional perspective on the launch. As we discussed on our call in July, market feedback continues to indicate that there is a substantial unmet need in osteoporosis, and we are confident that Prolia can address this need. 
In the U.S., our objective is to establish a positive experience with Prolia in a select audience of specialists and high prescribing primary care physicians. Specifically, we're trying to help these physicians to understand the clinical importance and relevance of Prolia and to help them successfully navigate the reimbursement process to facilitate broader adoption.
I can tell you in my new role as Chief Operating Officer, I've spent considerable time with Jim, George and Helen Torley and their teams in the Prolia launch, and I think all of us feel we're making steady progress in addressing the key drivers of Prolia's uptick. 
I've also spent enough time with the regional and district managers, as well as reps in the field to know that while we are finding no major surprises in the launch environment, discussions with healthcare providers are taking a bit longer for Prolia as a new biologic with a noble mechanism [ph] of action than what we would find with the traditional launch. 
On balance, we're encouraged by the response so far from physicians who have adopted Prolia. Now from a patient perspective, the majority of current Prolia patients were previously on bisphosphonates, but we're also seeing a number of patients who were at high risk for fracture and who are receiving Prolia as their first postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment. 
Patient out-of-pocket costs are obviously a key factor in growth selection in osteoporosis, and we estimate when we look at the universal Prolia patients that approximately 80% of them are Medicare eligible and 20% are covered by commercial plans. For Medicare patients, until the Part D Plans make there formulary decisions in early 2011, access through Part B buy and bill represents the preferred channel for patients because it was all [indiscernible] out-of-pocket costs. So far, about 80% of Prolia use has been through buy and bill.
As we expected, some physicians are taking a wait-and-see approach to buy and bill until a reliable timely reimbursement has been clearly established. All 15 Medicare Administration Contractors (sic) [Medicare Administrative Contractor] or MACs, have by now confirmed medical coverage for Prolia, and through the end of the third quarter have issued paid claims in each of these 15 MACs. 
This is important as it enables our sales representatives to return to physicians who initially deferred the buy and bill and present evidence to them of successful reimbursement by their Medicare Administration Contractors. Although the adoption of Prolia so far among specialists is high, when we look at the universal prescriber so far, 60% of them have been primary care physicians. And this mix simply reflects the fact that the majority of PMO prescribers, and indeed, Prolia's targeted physicians are primary care doctors. For those primary care physicians and some specialists who have yet to adopt buy and bill, we expect utilization of the pharmacy benefit channel to increase early in next year as Part D and commercial coverage expands.
Turning to Prolia in Europe. Germany and Denmark are the first markets where we've achieved full reimbursement, and we are encouraged by the positive leading indicators in these markets. We've received preliminary notice of reimbursement for Prolia by NICE in the U.K., and in December, we expect reimbursement and launch in Australia. These two markets are the most rigorous in the world when it comes to health technology assessments, and were pleased with their preliminary endorsements.
Recall in 2011, we expect to have full reimbursement in 2/3 of our European market by value when we launch in France, Italy and Spain. So while it's still early days, I'd reiterate our confidence in Prolia's ability to address an important unmet medical need in osteoporosis. 
Now let's turn to Roger, who will update us on the pipeline."

So it was another busy and very productive quarter for research and development with important regulatory activities and development programs coming into focus. 
We also participated in a number of medical meetings, including the European Society for Medical Oncology where we presented the integrated analysis of all three Denosumab skeletal related events studies, which demonstrated superiority over zoledronic acid in delaying both the time of the first SRE and also to multiple SRE. At the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, we had the opportunity to present data from postmenopausal osteoporosis patients after five years of Prolia therapy, demonstrating continued efficacy with long-term Prolia treatment.
As noted on the site, we've been engaged in very productive discussions with the FDA on the Denosumab skeletal related events file. Kevin mentioned that PDUFA action date is November 18, and the FDA appears to be very, very engaged in this. I'd remind you, it's quite a large file, one and a half million pages. There's an enormous amount of work that has to be done, but we're pleased with the nature of the interactions and things are moving forward. 
Also, as Kevin noted, the 147 study, which compares the treatment effect of Denosumab with placebo in terms of prolonging bone metastasis-free survival in men with hormone refractory that is androgren independent prostate cancer. That study is nearly complete. We're in the process of validating the data, and we remain on track to have the results in hand by the end of year.
We also recently participated in the cardio renal advisory committee meeting where we discussed the results of the TREAT study. Kevin mentioned that as well. I thought that it was a very productive discussion, which informed how the TREAT study really reveals the benefits and risks of DSAs and chronic kidney diseased patients. We will continue to work with the Food and Drug Administration on our proposed label updates to try and make sure that these new lessons are incorporated to our label.
And as most of you know, we've completed our Phase III programs in first and second line metastatic colorectal cancer for Vectibix, and we've already filed in the European Union for these indications. We will now submit our application with the FDA in the very, very near future. Because KRAS mutations are predicted biomarker for a reduction in efficacy for Vectibix, our filing will also be tied to an application for a KRAS diagnostic test kit. We've been working closely with our partner [indiscernible] in the development of this, and all this will be filed together, as I say, very soon. More broadly, I should mention that our clinical programs continue to advance and we're looking forward to presenting these materials at the business review next year. Kevin?"

We had three goals, Kevin, as you remember, at the November analyst day a couple of years ago that we outlined. The first was to establish a compelling clinical profile, and I think we've made a really good progress on that front. Doctors like the clinical profile and they're keen to use the product. The second goal was to make it affordable for patients. And Medicare Part B is really accomplishing that goal, and that there's little to no co-pay for most of the patients. So the good news is patients aren't coming back, saying, ""oh my god, it costs this much at the pharmacy and I can't afford it."" So I think we've created the rights of impression about the affordability of the product. And the last is, and probably the most difficult launch challenge we knew going in was, make it easy to access, it's the so-called fulfillment process that's easy for physicians, their office staff and patients. And it's working for physicians who are willing to buy and bill, but most primary care physicians are not willing to buy and bill at this point. So as a result, we've got a relatively small satisfied group of adopters, and my sense is that's going to grow over time with probably three drivers: The first being greater confidence in Medicare and commercialization reimbursement; second will be reassurement on safety of Prolia. It's not an issue, but given all that's happened in the marketplace over the last decade or so, doctors want to know that what they're using is safe, and I think, Roger, the long-term safety updates are going to be well received by doctors in the community. But most importantly, Part D Medicare coverage with reasonable co-pays is what I feel will create significant lift in our trajectory, our launch trajectory. Because the vast majority of primary care physician would much rather write a prescription the way they prescribe most other drugs and have the patient then take care of about getting that filled. So I think it's probably proving as positive to be a little more challenging in terms of the time it takes. But I think all signs are very positive for the future of this product."

So they don't see that as a behavior shift as a result of bundling. They have indicated that they are going to investigate hypo responding patients more intensely to better understand underlying causes of the hyper-responsiveness, perhaps utilize IV vitamin, IV iron more intensely in those patients. But overall, they see the use of IV iron as being modest because most patients are iron replete at this time. So you put that together and some of the large dialysis centers have publicly stated that they are anticipating a dose impact of anywhere from 10% to 15%.

The Part D providers are required to make a formulary decision six months after product approval. We're in discussions with the PDPs right now, so we expect them to have formulary placement in the early part of next year. And by early, we're talking about January through March. You probably won't see communications until the March timeframe. We will be negotiating for favorable tier placement. We would see favorable tier placement being Tier 2 or Tier 3, with a relatively modest co-pay for patients anywhere from, say, $50 to $70. And at $50 to $70 for six months of therapy, we think that represents good value for patients. For Medicare patients, we cannot offset their co-pay through any mechanism other than donations to a third-party independent foundation. Now moving on to the REMS, we say that we cannot eliminate the possibility of further downward pressure due to REMS. Because at this point, not all customers have enrolled in the REMS program. To date, customers representing about 80% of our clinic business have enrolled and customers representing about 50% of our hospital business have enrolled.

I'd like to make a few comments about our business at kind of a higher level before I turn the mic over to Jon. 
Overall, I think we had a solid quarter, as we build the foundation for top line growth and invest for the future. Jon Peacock, our new CFO, will comment more fully, but I do note the growth on operating expenses compared to last year. We had an unusually low R&D quarter last year and a few other onetime unfavorable comparisons. I want to reinforce that we manage here very efficiently, and these quarter-over-quarter comparisons are not an indication this approach has or will change.
Bob will lead the discussion of the Prolia experience to date, but I'd like to make a few comments first. Forecasting the growth ramp of any new product is a challenge. That said, we hear in independent surveys reinforced the attractiveness of Prolia in physician's eyes to treat osteoporosis for significant numbers of patients. Doctors and their offices are working to become accustomed to the new reimbursement dynamics Prolia often represents for them. Once this reimbursement process is mastered and they gain experience, I'm confident usage will be significant.
We look forward to the PDUFA date of November 18 for Denosumab oncology and the AMG 147 results near year end. We cannot predict what will happen November 18, but I am very confident in the medicine.
I am especially proud of our Cardiac team and the high-quality and scientific discussions the panel conducted that day. That was all of us in the medicines development, review and regulatory areas at our best. Finally, I would like to welcome Jon in his new role, and Bob's report after a full quarter in his new role. Jon, over to you."
24816,114170765,81556,"Amgen Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2010",2010-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. I'll briefly review the P&L and balance sheet to provide a perspective on performance in the quarter. Overall, our revenues were $3.8 billion at the same level as the third quarter in 2009. Bob will take you through the drivers of product s",615,"Thanks, Kevin. I'll briefly review the P&L and balance sheet to provide a perspective on performance in the quarter. Overall, our revenues were $3.8 billion at the same level as the third quarter in 2009. Bob will take you through the drivers of product sales in a few minutes. You'll also see that other revenues were down versus a year ago. This is primarily due to the lower partnership income following the PROCRIT recall. 
Commenting on the P&L as a whole, net income declined 14% while our revenues were flat. Kevin highlighted this, and there are two primary reasons for it: The first is that R&D costs, as Kevin mentioned, were unusually low in the third quarter of 2009, this primarily was due to some cost recoveries and true-ups on development projects last year. Our R&D costs this year in the most recent quarter of 18.3% of sales are broadly in line with our normal run rate. The second reason was the tax rush [ph] (12:21) rate. Quarter three 2009 benefited from tax cases settled in the quarter and the release of some related provisions. The tax rate of 19.1% in 2010 is again more in line with our normal run rate. 
Let me comment briefly on the rest of the P&L. Cost of sales were one point higher than a year ago, roughly half of this was due to inventory write offs as a result of the EPOGEN and PROCRIT recalls. The rest was largely due to higher bulk unit material costs. SG&A spending increased 3% versus a year ago due to promotional activities to support Prolia and some higher litigation expenses. Relative to net income, adjusted EPS benefited from buybacks during the year, which I'll comment on as we review cash flow. 
So moving to the balance sheet on the next page. We ended the quarter with $17 billion in cash, up $3 billion versus a year ago and $13.7 billion of debt, up $2.5 billion. This increase in debt results from our two debt offerings over the course of this year in advance of the $2.5 billion convertible that matures in February of 2011. I also wanted to comment on cash flow from operations, which was $1.3 billion in the third quarter. This is down by around $700 million year-over-year, and this is substantially driven by the timing of tax payments to the U.S. tax authorities. 
Finally on the quarter, share repurchases were $6.6 million at a cost of $400 million, bringing the cost of our cumulative repurchases in 2010 to $2.7 billion.
And so in closing, a few remarks on outlook. Firstly, we're re-affirming our full year guidance on revenues at slightly below $15.1 billion and adjusted EPS towards the lower end of $5.05 to $5.25. Secondly, a reminder that consistent with prior-year spending patterns, Q4 operating expenses will be higher relative to the first three quarters. This is due to the timing of a number of our promotional and development projects activities. Finally, we expect the tax rate for the full year to be around 20%. If the federal R&D tax credit is renewed, it could be marginally lower than that. 
And then finally, one comment related to 2011. As some of you might have seen in the press, the Puerto Rico government introduced and signed new tax legislation over the weekend. We understand that any tax imposed by this legislation on U.S. taxpayers will be creditable against U.S. income taxes, thereby minimizing the impact to U.S. companies. However, the legislation is complex. It's just been introduced, and we'll be evaluating its impact on our Puerto Rico activities in the weeks ahead. 
So with that, I'll hand over to Bob."

I'd like to provide a high-level summary of our global commercial performance for the third quarter and offer a few prospective comments on the fourth quarter as well.

I'd like to provide a high-level summary of our global commercial performance for the third quarter and offer a few prospective comments on the fourth quarter as well. 
Our product-by-product details are contained in the remainder of our slide material and in the press release. For the sake of brevity, I won't present this material, but I would also like to note that Jim Daly and George Morrow are here with us on the call, and together, we would be happy to answer product-specific questions during the Q&A period. 
For the year-on-year comparison, our global product sales grew by $23 million or about 1%, which reflects a few key factors: First, our U.S. Filgrastim sales were up by $45 million or about 5% on the quarter, this after the effects of U.S. Health Care Reform. In addition, our products that are in an earlier stage of their life cycle, and in particular, Sensipar, Vectibix, Nplate and Prolia globally grew by $61 million or about 24%.
Offsetting this growth were factors including our global Aranesp franchise, which dropped by about $62 million or 9% on the quarter. And in addition, I want to note that we booked accruals for U.S. Health Care Reform of $64 million for the quarter. And as you will recall, our year-to-date Health Care Reform accruals due to the second quarter were $69 million. So you can see the predicted ramp up continues as each element of Health Care Reform is implemented. 
Now looking ahead to the remainder of 2010, as you've heard from Jon, we've reiterated our revenue guidance. And I wanted to suggest that when you think about the fourth quarter, bear in mind that we are expecting a growing impact from the ESA REMS program in the U.S. and we expect to see some impact from dialysis providers as they prepare for the bundled reimbursement environment.
Turning to Prolia, let me provide you with some additional perspective on the launch. As we discussed on our call in July, market feedback continues to indicate that there is a substantial unmet need in osteoporosis, and we are confident that Prolia can address this need. 
In the U.S., our objective is to establish a positive experience with Prolia in a select audience of specialists and high prescribing primary care physicians. Specifically, we're trying to help these physicians understand the clinical importance and relevance of Prolia and to help them successfully navigate the reimbursement process to facilitate broader adoption.
I can tell you in my new role as Chief Operating Officer, I've spent considerable time with Jim, George and Helen Torley and their teams in the Prolia launch, and I think all of us feel we're making steady progress in addressing the key drivers of Prolia's uptake. 
I've also spent enough time with the regional and district managers, as well as reps in the field to know that, while we are finding no major surprises in the launch environment, discussions with healthcare providers are taking a bit longer for Prolia as a new biologic with a novel mechanism [ph] (18:30) of action than what we would find with the traditional launch. 
On balance, we're encouraged by the response so far from physicians who have adopted Prolia. Now from a patient perspective, the majority of current Prolia patients were previously on bisphosphonates, but we're also seeing a number of patients who were at high risk for fracture and who are receiving Prolia as their first postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment. 
Patient out-of-pocket costs are obviously a key factor in growth selection in osteoporosis, and we estimate when we look at the universal Prolia patients that approximately 80% of them are Medicare eligible and 20% are covered by commercial plans. For Medicare patients, until the Part D Plans make their formulary decisions in early 2011, access through Part B buy and bill represents the preferred channel for patients because it results in low out-of-pocket costs. So far, about 80% of Prolia use has been through buy and bill.
As we expected, some physicians are taking a wait-and-see approach to buy and bill until a reliable timely reimbursement has been clearly established. All 15 Medicare Administration Contractors (sic) [Medicare Administrative Contractor] or MACs, have by now confirmed medical coverage for Prolia, and through the end of the third quarter have issued paid claims in each of these 15 MACs. 
This is important as it enables our sales representatives to return to physicians who initially deferred a buy and bill and present evidence to them of successful reimbursement by their Medicare Administration Contractors. Although the adoption of Prolia so far among specialists is high, when we look at the universal prescriber so far, 60% of them have been primary care physicians. And this mix simply reflects the fact that the majority of PMO prescribers, and indeed, Prolia's targeted physicians are primary care doctors. For those primary care physicians and some specialists who have yet to adopt buy and bill, we expect utilization of the pharmacy benefit channel to increase early in next year as Part D and commercial coverage expands.
Turning to Prolia in Europe. Germany and Denmark are the first markets where we've achieved full reimbursement, and we are encouraged by the positive leading indicators in these markets. We've received preliminary notice of reimbursement for Prolia by NICE in the U.K., and in December, we expect reimbursement and launch in Australia. These two markets are the most rigorous in the world when it comes to health technology assessments, and were pleased with their preliminary endorsements.
Recall in 2011, we expect to have full reimbursement in 2/3 of our European market by value when we launch in France, Italy and Spain. So while it's still early days, I'd reiterate our confidence in Prolia's ability to address an important unmet medical need in osteoporosis. 
Now let's turn to Roger, who will update us on the pipeline."

So it was another busy and very productive quarter for research and development with important regulatory activities and development programs coming into focus. 
We also participated in a number of medical meetings, including the European Society for Medical Oncology where we presented the integrated analysis of all three Denosumab skeletal related events studies, which demonstrated superiority over zoledronic acid in delaying both the time to first SRE and also to multiple SRE. At the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, we had the opportunity to present data from postmenopausal osteoporosis patients after five years of Prolia therapy, demonstrating continued efficacy with long-term Prolia treatment.
As noted on the slide, we've been engaged in very productive discussions with the FDA on the Denosumab skeletal related events file. Kevin mentioned that PDUFA action date is November 18, and the FDA appears to be very, very engaged in this. I'd remind you, it's quite a large file, one and a half million pages. There's an enormous amount of work that has to be done, but we're pleased with the nature of the interactions and things are moving forward. 
Also, as Kevin noted, the 147 study, which compares the treatment effect of Denosumab with placebo in terms of prolonging bone metastasis-free survival in men with hormone refractory that is androgren independent prostate cancer. That study is nearly complete. We're in the process of validating the data, and we remain on track to have the results in hand by the end of year.
We also recently participated in the cardio renal advisory committee meeting where we discussed the results of the TREAT study. Kevin mentioned that as well. I thought that it was a very productive discussion, which informed how the TREAT study really reveals the benefits and risks of DSAs in chronic kidney diseased patients. We will continue to work with the Food and Drug Administration on our proposed label updates to try and make sure that these new lessons are incorporated to our label.
And as most of you know, we've completed our Phase III programs in first and second line metastatic colorectal cancer for Vectibix, and we've already filed in the European Union for these indications. We will now submit our application with the FDA in the very, very near future. Because KRAS mutations are predicted biomarker for a reduction in efficacy for Vectibix, our filing will also be tied to an application for a KRAS diagnostic test kit. We've been working closely with our partner Qiagen [ph] (24:03) in the development of this, and all this will be filed together, as I say, very soon. More broadly, I should mention that our clinical programs continue to advance and we're looking forward to presenting these materials at the business review next year. Kevin?"

We had three goals, Kevin, as you remember, at the November analyst day a couple of years ago that we outlined. The first was to establish a compelling clinical profile, and I think we've made a really good progress on that front. Doctors like the clinical profile and they're keen to use the product. The second goal was to make it affordable for patients. And Medicare Part B is really accomplishing that goal, in that there's little to no co-pays for most of the patients. So the good news is patients aren't coming back, saying, ""oh my god, it costs this much at the pharmacy and I can't afford it."" So I think we've created the right sort of impression about the affordability of the product. And the last is, and probably the most difficult launch challenge we knew going in was, make it easy to access, it's the so-called fulfillment process that's easy for physicians, their office staff and patients. And it's working for physicians who are willing to buy and bill, but most primary care physicians are not willing to buy and bill at this point. So as a result, we've got a relatively small satisfied group of adopters, and my sense is that's going to grow over time with probably three drivers: The first being greater confidence in Medicare and commercialization reimbursement; second will be reassurement on safety of Prolia. It's not an issue, but given all that's happened in the marketplace over the last decade or so, doctors want to know that what they're using is safe, and I think, Roger, the long-term safety updates are going to be very well received by doctors in the community. But most importantly, Part D Medicare coverage with reasonable co-pays is what I feel will create significant lift in our trajectory, our launch trajectory. Because the vast majority of primary care physicians would much rather write a prescription the way they prescribe most other drugs and have the patient then take care of getting that filled. So I think it's probably prudent, as Bob said, to be a little more challenging in terms of the time it takes. But I think all signs are very positive for the future of this product."

I think the providers have been fairly upfront that they don't see that as being in the best interest of their patients. It's clearly not consistent with our labeling. So they don't see that as a behavior shift as a result of bundling. They have indicated that they are going to investigate hypo responding patients more intensely to better understand underlying causes of the hyper-responsiveness, perhaps utilize IV vitamin, IV iron more intensely in those patients. But overall, they see the use of IV iron as being modest because most patients are iron replete at this time. So you put that together and some of the large dialysis centers have publicly stated that they are anticipating a dose impact of anywhere from 10% to 15%.

The Part D providers are required to make a formulary decision six months after product approval. We're in discussions with the PDPs right now, so we expect them to have formulary placement in the early part of next year. And by early, we're talking about January through March. You probably won't see communications until the March timeframe. We will be negotiating for favorable tier placement. We would see favorable tier placement being Tier 2 or Tier 3, with a relatively modest co-pay for patients anywhere from, say, $50 to $70. And at $50 to $70 for six months of therapy, we think that represents good value for patients. For Medicare patients, we cannot offset their co-pay through any mechanism other than donations to a third-party independent foundation. Now moving on to the REMS, we say that we cannot eliminate the possibility of further downward pressure due to the REMS. Because at this point, not all customers have enrolled in the REMS program. To date, customers representing about 80% of our clinic business have enrolled and customers representing about 50% of our hospital business have enrolled.

Following Kevin, you'll hear from our recently appointed CFO, Jon Peacock, who will highlight key aspects of our financial performance during the quarter. Our President and Chief Operating Officer, Bob Bradway, will then give you a high-level summary of our global commercial sales as well as a report on full year commercialization. Our Head of R&D, Roger Perlmutter, will conclude our prepared comments by providing a regulatory and pipeline update.

I'd like to make a few comments about our business as kind of a higher level before I turn the mic over to Jon.
 Overall, I think we had a solid quarter, as we build the foundation for top line growth and invest for the future. Jon Peacock, our new CFO, will comment more fully, but I do note the growth on operating expenses compared to last year. We had an unusually low R&D quarter last year and a few other onetime unfavorable comparisons. I want to reinforce that we manage here very efficiently, and these quarter-over-quarter comparisons are not an indication of this approach has or will change.
 Bob will lead the discussion of the Prolia experience to date, but I'd like to make a few comments first. Forecasting the growth ramp of any new product is a challenge. That said, we hear in independent surveys reinforced the attractiveness of Prolia in physician's eyes to treat osteoporosis for significant numbers of patients. Doctors and their offices are working to become accustomed to the new reimbursement dynamics Prolia often represents for them. Once this reimbursement process is mastered and they gain experience, I'm confident usage will be significant.
 We look forward to the PDUFA date of November 18 for Denosumab oncology and the AMG 147 results near year end. We cannot predict what will happen November 18, but I am very confident in the medicine.
 I am especially proud of our Cardiac team and the high-quality and scientific discussions the panel conducted that day. That was all of us in the medicines development, review and regulatory areas at our best. Finally, I would like to welcome Jon in his new role, and Bob's report after a full quarter in his new role. Jon, over to you.

I'll briefly review the P&L and balance sheet to provide a perspective on performance in the quarter. Overall, our revenues were $3.8 billion at the same level as the third quarter in 2009. Bob will take you through the drivers of product",611," Thanks, Kevin. I'll briefly review the P&L and balance sheet to provide a perspective on performance in the quarter. Overall, our revenues were $3.8 billion at the same level as the third quarter in 2009. Bob will take you through the drivers of product sales in a few minutes. You'll also see that other revenues were down versus a year ago. This is primarily due to the lower partnership income following the PROCRIT recall.
 Commenting on the P&L as a whole, net income declined 14% while our revenues were flat. Kevin highlighted this, and there were two primary reasons for it: The first is that R&D costs, as Kevin mentioned, were unusually low in the third quarter of 2009, but this primarily was used in cost recoveries and true-ups on development projects last year. Our R&D costs this year and the most recent quarter of 18.3% of sales are broadly in line with our normal run rate. The second reason was the tax rate. Quarter three 2009 benefited from tax cases settled in the quarter and the release of some related provisions. The tax rate of 19.1% in 2010 is again more in line with our normal run rate.
 Let me comment briefly on the rest of the P&L. Cost of sales were one point higher than a year ago, roughly half of this was due to inventory write offs as a result of the EPOGEN and PROCRIT recalls. The rest was largely due to higher bulk unit material costs. SG&A spending increased 3% versus a year ago due to promotional activities to support Prolia and some high litigation expenses. Relative to net income, adjusted EPS benefited from buybacks during the year, which I'll comment on as we review cash flow.
 So moving to the balance sheet on the next page. We ended the quarter with $17 billion in cash, up $3 billion versus a year ago and $13.7 billion of debt, up $2.5 billion. This increase in debt results from our two debt offerings over the course of this year in advance of the $2.5 billion convertible that matures in February of 2011. I also wanted to comment on cash flow from operations, which was $1.3 billion in the third quarter. This is down by around $700 million year-over-year, and this is substantially driven by the timing of tax payments to the U.S. tax authorities.
 Finally on the quarter, share repurchases were $6.6 million at a cost of $400 million, bringing the cost of our cumulative repurchases in 2010 to $2.7 billion.
 And so in closing, a few remarks on outlook. Firstly, we're re-affirming our full year guidance on revenues at slightly below $15.1 billion and adjusted EPS towards the lower end of $5.05  to $5.25. Secondly, a reminder that consistent with prior-year spending patterns, Q4 operating expenses will be higher relative to the first three quarters. This is due to the timing of a number of our promotional and development projects activities.  Finally, we expect the tax rate for the full year to be around 20%. If the federal R&D tax credit is renewed, it could be marginally lower than that.
 And then finally, one comment related to 2011. As some of you might have seen in the press, the Puerto Rico government introduced and signed new tax legislation over the weekend. We understand that any tax imposed by this legislation on U.S. taxpayers will be creditable against U.S. income taxes, thereby minimizing the impact to U.S. companies. However, legislation is complex. It's just been introduced, and we'll be evaluating its impact on our Puerto Rico activities in the weeks ahead.
 So with that, I'll hand over to Bob.

I'd like to provide a high-level summary of our global commercial performance for the third quarter and offer a few perspective comments on the fourth quarter as well. Our product-by-product details are contained in the remainder of our",984," Thank you, Jon. I'd like to provide a high-level summary of our global commercial performance for the third quarter and offer a few perspective comments on the fourth quarter as well.
 Our product-by-product details are contained in the remainder of our slide material and in the press release. For the sake of brevity, I won't present this material, but I would also like to note that Jim Daly and George Morrow are here with us on the call, and together, we would be happy to answer product-specific questions during the Q&A period.
 For the year-on-year comparison, our global product sales grew by $23 million or about 1%, which reflects a few key factors: First, our U.S. [indiscernible] sales were up by $45 million or about 5% on the quarter, this after the effects of U.S. Health Care Reform. In addition, our products that are in an earlier stage of their life cycle, and in particular, Sensipar, Vectibix, Nplate and Prolia globally grew by $61 billion or about 24%.
 Offsetting this growth were factors including our global Aranesp franchise, which dropped by about $62 million or 9% on the quarter. And in addition, I want to note that we booked accruals for U.S. Health Care Reform of $64 million for the quarter. And as you will recall, our year-to-date Health Care Reform accruals due to the second quarter were $69 million. So you can see the predicted ramp up continues as each element of Health Care Reform is implemented.
 And looking ahead to the remainder of 2010, as you've heard from Jon, we've reiterated our revenue guidance. And I wanted to suggest that when you think about the fourth quarter, bear in mind that we are expecting a growing impact from the ESA REMS program in the U.S. and we expect to see some impact from dialysis providers as they prepare for the bundled reimbursement environment.
 Turning to Prolia, let me provide you with some additional perspective on the launch. As we discussed on our call in July, market feedback continues to indicate that there is a substantial unmet need in osteoporosis, and we are confident that Prolia can address this need.
 In the U.S., our objective is to establish a positive experience with Prolia in a select audience of specialists and high prescribing primary care physicians. Specifically, we're trying to help these physicians to understand the clinical importance and relevance of Prolia and to help them successfully navigate the reimbursement process to facilitate broader adoption.
 I can tell you in my new role as Chief Operating Officer, I've spent considerable time with Jim, George and Helen Torley and their teams in the Prolia launch, and I think all of us feel we're making steady progress in addressing the key drivers of Prolia's uptick.
 I've also spent enough time with the regional and district managers, as well as reps in the field to know that while we are finding no major surprises in the launch environment, discussions with healthcare providers are taking a bit longer for Prolia as a new biologic with a noble mechanism [ph] of action than what we would find with the traditional launch.
 On balance, we're encouraged by the response so far from physicians who have adopted Prolia. Now from a patient perspective, the majority of current Prolia patients were previously on bisphosphonates, but we're also seeing a number of patients who were at high risk for fracture and who are receiving Prolia as their first postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment.
 Patient out-of-pocket costs are obviously a key factor in growth selection in osteoporosis, and we estimate when we look at the universal Prolia patients that approximately 80% of them are Medicare eligible and 20% are covered by commercial plans. For Medicare patients, until the Part D Plans make there formulary decisions in early 2011, access through Part B buy and bill represents the preferred channel for patients because it was all [indiscernible] out-of-pocket costs. So far, about 80% of Prolia use has been through buy and bill.
 As we expected, some physicians are taking a wait-and-see approach to buy and bill until a reliable timely reimbursement has been clearly established. All 15 Medicare Administration Contractors (sic) [Medicare Administrative Contractor] or MACs, have by now confirmed medical coverage for Prolia, and through the end of the third quarter have issued paid claims in each of these 15 MACs.
 This is important as it enables our sales representatives to return to physicians who initially deferred the buy and bill and present evidence to them of successful reimbursement by their Medicare Administration Contractors. Although the adoption of Prolia so far among specialists is high, when we look at the universal prescriber so far, 60% of them have been primary care physicians. And this mix simply reflects the fact that the majority of PMO prescribers, and indeed, Prolia's targeted physicians are primary care doctors. For those primary care physicians and some specialists who have yet to adopt buy and bill, we expect utilization of the pharmacy benefit channel to increase early in next year as Part D and commercial coverage expands.
 Turning to Prolia in Europe. Germany and Denmark are the first markets where we've achieved full reimbursement, and we are encouraged by the positive leading indicators in these markets. We've received preliminary notice of reimbursement for Prolia by NICE in the U.K., and in December, we expect reimbursement and launch in Australia. These two markets are the most rigorous in the world when it comes to health technology assessments, and were pleased with their preliminary endorsements.
 Recall in 2011, we expect to have full reimbursement in 2/3 of our European market by value when we launch in France, Italy and Spain. So while it's still early days, I'd reiterate our confidence in Prolia's ability to address an important unmet medical need in osteoporosis.
 Now let's turn to Roger, who will update us on the pipeline.

So it was another busy and very productive quarter for research and development with important regulatory activities and development programs coming into focus.
 We also participated in a number of medical meetings, including the European Society for Medical Oncology where we presented the integrated analysis of all three Denosumab skeletal related events studies, which demonstrated superiority over zoledronic acid in delaying both the time of the first SRE and also to multiple SRE. At the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, we had the opportunity to present data from postmenopausal osteoporosis patients after five years of Prolia therapy, demonstrating continued efficacy with long-term Prolia treatment.
 As noted on the site, we've been engaged in very productive discussions with the FDA on the Denosumab skeletal related events file. Kevin mentioned that PDUFA action date is November 18, and the FDA appears to be very, very engaged in this. I'd remind you, it's quite a large file, one and a half million pages. There's an enormous amount of work that has to be done, but we're pleased with the nature of the interactions and things are moving forward.
 Also, as Kevin noted, the 147 study, which compares the treatment effect of Denosumab with placebo in terms of prolonging bone metastasis-free survival in men with hormone refractory that is androgren independent prostate cancer. That study is nearly complete. We're in the process of validating the data, and we remain on track to have the results in hand by the end of year.
 We also recently participated in the cardio renal advisory committee meeting where we discussed the results of the TREAT study. Kevin mentioned that as well. I thought that it was a very productive discussion, which informed how the TREAT study really reveals the benefits and risks of DSAs and chronic kidney diseased patients. We will continue to work with the Food and Drug Administration on our proposed label updates to try and make sure that these new lessons are incorporated to our label.
 And as most of you know, we've completed our Phase III programs in first and second line metastatic colorectal cancer for Vectibix, and we've already filed in the European Union for these indications. We will now submit our application with the FDA in the very, very near future. Because KRAS mutations are predicted biomarker for a reduction in efficacy for Vectibix, our filing will also be tied to an application for a KRAS diagnostic test kit. We've been working closely with our partner [indiscernible] in the development of this, and all this will be filed together, as I say, very soon. More broadly, I should mention that our clinical programs continue to advance and we're looking forward to presenting these materials at the business review next year. Kevin?

We had three goals, Kevin, as you remember, at the November analyst day a couple of years ago that we outlined. The first was to establish a compelling clinical profile, and I think we've made a really good progress on that front. Doctors like the clinical profile and they're keen to use the product. The second goal was to make it affordable for patients. And Medicare Part B is really accomplishing that goal, and that there's little to no co-pay for most of the patients. So the good news is patients aren't coming back, saying, ""oh my god, it costs this much at the pharmacy and I can't afford it."" So I think we've created the rights of impression about the affordability of the product. And the last is, and probably the most difficult launch challenge we knew going in was, make it easy to access, it's the so-called fulfillment process that's easy for physicians, their office staff and patients. And it's working for physicians who are willing to buy and bill, but most primary care physicians are not willing to buy and bill at this point. So as a result, we've got a relatively small satisfied group of adopters, and my sense is that's going to grow over time with probably three drivers: The first being greater confidence in Medicare and commercialization reimbursement; second will be reassurement on safety of Prolia. It's not an issue, but given all that's happened in the marketplace over the last decade or so, doctors want to know that what they're using is safe, and I think, Roger, the long-term safety updates are going to be well received by doctors in the community. But most importantly, Part D Medicare coverage with reasonable co-pays is what I feel will create significant lift in our trajectory, our launch trajectory. Because the vast majority of primary care physician would much rather write a prescription the way they prescribe most other drugs and have the patient then take care of about getting that filled. So I think it's probably proving as positive to be a little more challenging in terms of the time it takes. But I think all signs are very positive for the future of this product.

So they don't see that as a behavior shift as a result of bundling. They have indicated that they are going to investigate hypo responding patients more intensely to better understand underlying causes of the hyper-responsiveness, perhaps utilize IV vitamin, IV iron more intensely in those patients. But overall, they see the use of IV iron as being modest because most patients are iron replete at this time. So you put that together and some of the large dialysis centers have publicly stated that they are anticipating a dose impact of anywhere from 10% to 15%. So at this point in time, we think that's as a reliable an assumption as we have out there. And again, we intend to stay very close to our customers.

What do the doctors and we think about the clinical profile and the need for this medicine in a big population? We're highly confident about that. It's taking longer than we would have imagined to get the reimbursement pattern to happen in a fully fluid way. And we've got Part D coming up. I'm not particularly worried that somehow our original plan is flawed. I don't think it is that all. It's just tough to predict the timing to product launches and how the changes in reimbursement will take. So we're confident that we'll be able to help the physicians through the various reimbursement dynamics and the clinical benefit of the medicine will then fully flow to the right patient. So we're good in terms of our understanding of what's happening and confident in the medicine. And in that regard, I'd like to acknowledge the really, really hard work of all the sales reps in the field and our regional medical liaisons who were bringing this message to the physicians and patients everyday. It's really, really outstanding work, and I deeply appreciate it.

The Part D providers are required to make a formulary decision six months after product approval. We're in discussions with the PDPs right now, so we expect them to have formulary placement in the early part of next year. And by early, we're talking about January through March. You probably won't see communications until the March timeframe. We will be negotiating for favorable tier placement. We would see favorable tier placement being Tier 2 or Tier 3, with a relatively modest co-pay for patients anywhere from, say, $50 to $70. And at $50 to $70 for six months of therapy, we think that represents good value for patients. For Medicare patients, we cannot offset their co-pay through any mechanism other than donations to a third-party independent foundation. Now moving on to the REMS, we say that we cannot eliminate the possibility of further downward pressure due to REMS. Because at this point, not all customers have enrolled in the REMS program. To date, customers representing about 80% of our clinic business have enrolled and customers representing about 50% of our hospital business have enrolled. If you look at Aranesp over the last three quarters and adjust for inventory and financial accrual, one-offs, we've been relatively stable, about $21 million per week. But again, because all customers haven't enrolled, we're cautiously optimistic in terms of our ability to maintain that.

I'd like to make a few comments about our business as kind of a higher level before I turn the mic over to Jon. 
Overall, I think we had a solid quarter, as we build the foundation for top line growth and invest for the future. Jon Peacock, our new CFO, will comment more fully, but I do note the growth on operating expenses compared to last year. We had an unusually low R&D quarter last year and a few other onetime unfavorable comparisons. I want to reinforce that we manage here very efficiently, and these quarter-over-quarter comparisons are not an indication of this approach has or will change.
Bob will lead the discussion of the Prolia experience to date, but I'd like to make a few comments first. Forecasting the growth ramp of any new product is a challenge. That said, we hear in independent surveys reinforced the attractiveness of Prolia in physician's eyes to treat osteoporosis for significant numbers of patients. Doctors and their offices are working to become accustomed to the new reimbursement dynamics Prolia often represents for them. Once this reimbursement process is mastered and they gain experience, I'm confident usage will be significant.
We look forward to the PDUFA date of November 18 for Denosumab oncology and the AMG 147 results near year end. We cannot predict what will happen November 18, but I am very confident in the medicine.
I am especially proud of our Cardiac team and the high-quality and scientific discussions the panel conducted that day. That was all of us in the medicines development, review and regulatory areas at our best. Finally, I would like to welcome Jon in his new role, and Bob's report after a full quarter in his new role. Jon, over to you."
24816,114170765,102142,"Amgen Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 25, 2010",2010-10-25,"Earnings Calls","Amgen Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kevin. I'll briefly review the P&L and balance sheet to provide a perspective on performance in the quarter. Overall, our revenues were $3.8 billion at the same level as the third quarter in 2009. Bob will take you through the drivers of product s",611,"Thanks, Kevin. I'll briefly review the P&L and balance sheet to provide a perspective on performance in the quarter. Overall, our revenues were $3.8 billion at the same level as the third quarter in 2009. Bob will take you through the drivers of product sales in a few minutes. You'll also see that other revenues were down versus a year ago. This is primarily due to the lower partnership income following the PROCRIT recall. 
Commenting on the P&L as a whole, net income declined 14% while our revenues were flat. Kevin highlighted this, and there were two primary reasons for it: The first is that R&D costs, as Kevin mentioned, were unusually low in the third quarter of 2009, but this primarily was used in cost recoveries and true-ups on development projects last year. Our R&D costs this year and the most recent quarter of 18.3% of sales are broadly in line with our normal run rate. The second reason was the tax rate. Quarter three 2009 benefited from tax cases settled in the quarter and the release of some related provisions. The tax rate of 19.1% in 2010 is again more in line with our normal run rate. 
Let me comment briefly on the rest of the P&L. Cost of sales were one point higher than a year ago, roughly half of this was due to inventory write offs as a result of the EPOGEN and PROCRIT recalls. The rest was largely due to higher bulk unit material costs. SG&A spending increased 3% versus a year ago due to promotional activities to support Prolia and some high litigation expenses. Relative to net income, adjusted EPS benefited from buybacks during the year, which I'll comment on as we review cash flow. 
So moving to the balance sheet on the next page. We ended the quarter with $17 billion in cash, up $3 billion versus a year ago and $13.7 billion of debt, up $2.5 billion. This increase in debt results from our two debt offerings over the course of this year in advance of the $2.5 billion convertible that matures in February of 2011. I also wanted to comment on cash flow from operations, which was $1.3 billion in the third quarter. This is down by around $700 million year-over-year, and this is substantially driven by the timing of tax payments to the U.S. tax authorities. 
Finally on the quarter, share repurchases were $6.6 million at a cost of $400 million, bringing the cost of our cumulative repurchases in 2010 to $2.7 billion.
And so in closing, a few remarks on outlook. Firstly, we're re-affirming our full year guidance on revenues at slightly below $15.1 billion and adjusted EPS towards the lower end of $5.05  to $5.25. Secondly, a reminder that consistent with prior-year spending patterns, Q4 operating expenses will be higher relative to the first three quarters. This is due to the timing of a number of our promotional and development projects activities.  Finally, we expect the tax rate for the full year to be around 20%. If the federal R&D tax credit is renewed, it could be marginally lower than that. 
And then finally, one comment related to 2011. As some of you might have seen in the press, the Puerto Rico government introduced and signed new tax legislation over the weekend. We understand that any tax imposed by this legislation on U.S. taxpayers will be creditable against U.S. income taxes, thereby minimizing the impact to U.S. companies. However, legislation is complex. It's just been introduced, and we'll be evaluating its impact on our Puerto Rico activities in the weeks ahead. 
So with that, I'll hand over to Bob."

I'd like to provide a high-level summary of our global commercial performance for the third quarter and offer a few perspective comments on the fourth quarter as well. 
Our product-by-product details are contained in the remainder of our slide material and in the press release. For the sake of brevity, I won't present this material, but I would also like to note that Jim Daly and George Morrow are here with us on the call, and together, we would be happy to answer product-specific questions during the Q&A period. 
For the year-on-year comparison, our global product sales grew by $23 million or about 1%, which reflects a few key factors: First, our U.S. [indiscernible] sales were up by $45 million or about 5% on the quarter, this after the effects of U.S. Health Care Reform. In addition, our products that are in an earlier stage of their life cycle, and in particular, Sensipar, Vectibix, Nplate and Prolia globally grew by $61 billion or about 24%.
Offsetting this growth were factors including our global Aranesp franchise, which dropped by about $62 million or 9% on the quarter. And in addition, I want to note that we booked accruals for U.S. Health Care Reform of $64 million for the quarter. And as you will recall, our year-to-date Health Care Reform accruals due to the second quarter were $69 million. So you can see the predicted ramp up continues as each element of Health Care Reform is implemented. 
And looking ahead to the remainder of 2010, as you've heard from Jon, we've reiterated our revenue guidance. And I wanted to suggest that when you think about the fourth quarter, bear in mind that we are expecting a growing impact from the ESA REMS program in the U.S. and we expect to see some impact from dialysis providers as they prepare for the bundled reimbursement environment.
Turning to Prolia, let me provide you with some additional perspective on the launch. As we discussed on our call in July, market feedback continues to indicate that there is a substantial unmet need in osteoporosis, and we are confident that Prolia can address this need. 
In the U.S., our objective is to establish a positive experience with Prolia in a select audience of specialists and high prescribing primary care physicians. Specifically, we're trying to help these physicians to understand the clinical importance and relevance of Prolia and to help them successfully navigate the reimbursement process to facilitate broader adoption.
I can tell you in my new role as Chief Operating Officer, I've spent considerable time with Jim, George and Helen Torley and their teams in the Prolia launch, and I think all of us feel we're making steady progress in addressing the key drivers of Prolia's uptick. 
I've also spent enough time with the regional and district managers, as well as reps in the field to know that while we are finding no major surprises in the launch environment, discussions with healthcare providers are taking a bit longer for Prolia as a new biologic with a noble mechanism [ph] of action than what we would find with the traditional launch. 
On balance, we're encouraged by the response so far from physicians who have adopted Prolia. Now from a patient perspective, the majority of current Prolia patients were previously on bisphosphonates, but we're also seeing a number of patients who were at high risk for fracture and who are receiving Prolia as their first postmenopausal osteoporosis treatment. 
Patient out-of-pocket costs are obviously a key factor in growth selection in osteoporosis, and we estimate when we look at the universal Prolia patients that approximately 80% of them are Medicare eligible and 20% are covered by commercial plans. For Medicare patients, until the Part D Plans make there formulary decisions in early 2011, access through Part B buy and bill represents the preferred channel for patients because it was all [indiscernible] out-of-pocket costs. So far, about 80% of Prolia use has been through buy and bill.
As we expected, some physicians are taking a wait-and-see approach to buy and bill until a reliable timely reimbursement has been clearly established. All 15 Medicare Administration Contractors (sic) [Medicare Administrative Contractor] or MACs, have by now confirmed medical coverage for Prolia, and through the end of the third quarter have issued paid claims in each of these 15 MACs. 
This is important as it enables our sales representatives to return to physicians who initially deferred the buy and bill and present evidence to them of successful reimbursement by their Medicare Administration Contractors. Although the adoption of Prolia so far among specialists is high, when we look at the universal prescriber so far, 60% of them have been primary care physicians. And this mix simply reflects the fact that the majority of PMO prescribers, and indeed, Prolia's targeted physicians are primary care doctors. For those primary care physicians and some specialists who have yet to adopt buy and bill, we expect utilization of the pharmacy benefit channel to increase early in next year as Part D and commercial coverage expands.
Turning to Prolia in Europe. Germany and Denmark are the first markets where we've achieved full reimbursement, and we are encouraged by the positive leading indicators in these markets. We've received preliminary notice of reimbursement for Prolia by NICE in the U.K., and in December, we expect reimbursement and launch in Australia. These two markets are the most rigorous in the world when it comes to health technology assessments, and were pleased with their preliminary endorsements.
Recall in 2011, we expect to have full reimbursement in 2/3 of our European market by value when we launch in France, Italy and Spain. So while it's still early days, I'd reiterate our confidence in Prolia's ability to address an important unmet medical need in osteoporosis. 
Now let's turn to Roger, who will update us on the pipeline."

So it was another busy and very productive quarter for research and development with important regulatory activities and development programs coming into focus. 
We also participated in a number of medical meetings, including the European Society for Medical Oncology where we presented the integrated analysis of all three Denosumab skeletal related events studies, which demonstrated superiority over zoledronic acid in delaying both the time of the first SRE and also to multiple SRE. At the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research, we had the opportunity to present data from postmenopausal osteoporosis patients after five years of Prolia therapy, demonstrating continued efficacy with long-term Prolia treatment.
As noted on the site, we've been engaged in very productive discussions with the FDA on the Denosumab skeletal related events file. Kevin mentioned that PDUFA action date is November 18, and the FDA appears to be very, very engaged in this. I'd remind you, it's quite a large file, one and a half million pages. There's an enormous amount of work that has to be done, but we're pleased with the nature of the interactions and things are moving forward. 
Also, as Kevin noted, the 147 study, which compares the treatment effect of Denosumab with placebo in terms of prolonging bone metastasis-free survival in men with hormone refractory that is androgren independent prostate cancer. That study is nearly complete. We're in the process of validating the data, and we remain on track to have the results in hand by the end of year.
We also recently participated in the cardio renal advisory committee meeting where we discussed the results of the TREAT study. Kevin mentioned that as well. I thought that it was a very productive discussion, which informed how the TREAT study really reveals the benefits and risks of DSAs and chronic kidney diseased patients. We will continue to work with the Food and Drug Administration on our proposed label updates to try and make sure that these new lessons are incorporated to our label.
And as most of you know, we've completed our Phase III programs in first and second line metastatic colorectal cancer for Vectibix, and we've already filed in the European Union for these indications. We will now submit our application with the FDA in the very, very near future. Because KRAS mutations are predicted biomarker for a reduction in efficacy for Vectibix, our filing will also be tied to an application for a KRAS diagnostic test kit. We've been working closely with our partner [indiscernible] in the development of this, and all this will be filed together, as I say, very soon. More broadly, I should mention that our clinical programs continue to advance and we're looking forward to presenting these materials at the business review next year. Kevin?"

We had three goals, Kevin, as you remember, at the November analyst day a couple of years ago that we outlined. The first was to establish a compelling clinical profile, and I think we've made a really good progress on that front. Doctors like the clinical profile and they're keen to use the product. The second goal was to make it affordable for patients. And Medicare Part B is really accomplishing that goal, and that there's little to no co-pay for most of the patients. So the good news is patients aren't coming back, saying, ""oh my god, it costs this much at the pharmacy and I can't afford it."" So I think we've created the rights of impression about the affordability of the product. And the last is, and probably the most difficult launch challenge we knew going in was, make it easy to access, it's the so-called fulfillment process that's easy for physicians, their office staff and patients. And it's working for physicians who are willing to buy and bill, but most primary care physicians are not willing to buy and bill at this point. So as a result, we've got a relatively small satisfied group of adopters, and my sense is that's going to grow over time with probably three drivers: The first being greater confidence in Medicare and commercialization reimbursement; second will be reassurement on safety of Prolia. It's not an issue, but given all that's happened in the marketplace over the last decade or so, doctors want to know that what they're using is safe, and I think, Roger, the long-term safety updates are going to be well received by doctors in the community. But most importantly, Part D Medicare coverage with reasonable co-pays is what I feel will create significant lift in our trajectory, our launch trajectory. Because the vast majority of primary care physician would much rather write a prescription the way they prescribe most other drugs and have the patient then take care of about getting that filled. So I think it's probably proving as positive to be a little more challenging in terms of the time it takes. But I think all signs are very positive for the future of this product."

And what our customers are telling us is that, number one, they do not plan to shift to subcutaneous dosing. I think the providers have been fairly upfront that they don't see that as being in the best interest of their patients. It's clearly not consistent with our labeling. So they don't see that as a behavior shift as a result of bundling. They have indicated that they are going to investigate hypo responding patients more intensely to better understand underlying causes of the hyper-responsiveness, perhaps utilize IV vitamin, IV iron more intensely in those patients. But overall, they see the use of IV iron as being modest because most patients are iron replete at this time. So you put that together and some of the large dialysis centers have publicly stated that they are anticipating a dose impact of anywhere from 10% to 15%. So at this point in time, we think that's as a reliable an assumption as we have out there. And again, we intend to stay very close to our customers."

What do the doctors and we think about the clinical profile and the need for this medicine in a big population? We're highly confident about that. It's taking longer than we would have imagined to get the reimbursement pattern to happen in a fully fluid way. And we've got Part D coming up. I'm not particularly worried that somehow our original plan is flawed. I don't think it is that all. It's just tough to predict the timing to product launches and how the changes in reimbursement will take. So we're confident that we'll be able to help the physicians through the various reimbursement dynamics and the clinical benefit of the medicine will then fully flow to the right patient. So we're good in terms of our understanding of what's happening and confident in the medicine. And in that regard, I'd like to acknowledge the really, really hard work of all the sales reps in the field and our regional medical liaisons who were bringing this message to the physicians and patients everyday. It's really, really outstanding work, and I deeply appreciate it."

The Part D providers are required to make a formulary decision six months after product approval. We're in discussions with the PDPs right now, so we expect them to have formulary placement in the early part of next year. And by early, we're talking about January through March. You probably won't see communications until the March timeframe. We will be negotiating for favorable tier placement. We would see favorable tier placement being Tier 2 or Tier 3, with a relatively modest co-pay for patients anywhere from, say, $50 to $70. And at $50 to $70 for six months of therapy, we think that represents good value for patients. For Medicare patients, we cannot offset their co-pay through any mechanism other than donations to a third-party independent foundation. Now moving on to the REMS, we say that we cannot eliminate the possibility of further downward pressure due to REMS. Because at this point, not all customers have enrolled in the REMS program. To date, customers representing about 80% of our clinic business have enrolled and customers representing about 50% of our hospital business have enrolled. If you look at Aranesp over the last three quarters and adjust for inventory and financial accrual, one-offs, we've been relatively stable, about $21 million per week. But again, because all customers haven't enrolled, we're cautiously optimistic in terms of our ability to maintain that."
