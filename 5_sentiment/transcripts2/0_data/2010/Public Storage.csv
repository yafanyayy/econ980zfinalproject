For the fourth quarter, our core FFO per share was $1.33, compared to $1.38 last year, representing a decline of 4%. Significant items impacting the quarter included decline in Same Store, net operating income by $9 million, which was partially offset by the growth in our non-Same Store properties of $2 million, a decline in interest earn on our cash balances by $5 million, due to lower interest rates and interest expense and preferred dividends in the aggregate were lower by $3 million, due to earlier repurchases. The decline in our Same Store revenue and NOI moderated in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. Revenue declined 3.9% in the fourth quarter compared to 4.6% in the third quarter and NOI declined 3.8% in the fourth quarter versus 6.3% in the third quarter. Notwithstanding the pressure on our operations, our financial position remains solid. At the end of the year, our leverage ratio, including preferred stock, was about 23%. During 2009, we retained a significant portion of our operating cash flow, approximately $430 million or 54% of our funds available for distribution. At year end, our cash balance was approximately $750 million. A portion of this cash balance will be used to redeem all outstanding equity shares Series A. These securities will be called as of April 15, 2010 at $24.50 per share, for a total of $205 million.Shurgard Europe has a 20% interest in a joint venture that has a 117 million euro loan that matures in July of 2010. We are actively working to refinance or renegotiate the terms of the loan. Our board increased the quarterly common dividend by 18% or $0.10 per share. Our consistent long-term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income. Taxable income attributable to our common shareholders, has increased due to recent purchases of preferred securities and equity stock, as well as the reduced depreciation, offset in part by declines in operating income. Future changes in our dividend will be impacted by these same factors, as well as property acquisitions. With that, I will now turn it over to Ron."

We started 2009 at 87.1% occupancy, 0.8% behind the prior year. Through aggressive pricing, promotion and marketing activity and solid execution by field operation, we eliminated this occupancy gap by year end. For the first two months of 2010, these positive trends have continued and we ended February 0.6% higher than the prior year.  Revenue declines have also continued to slow in Q1 2010, consistent with trends in Q4. First quarter 2010 expenses will be impacted by significantly higher snow removal cost. Q1 media will change both in terms of mix and day part and we will be in fewer markets. Media cost will be lower. In Europe, we are seeing similar trends. Europe started 2009 at 84.7% occupancy, almost 5% behind prior year. We ended the year at 85.7%, a full point higher. This trend has continued in Q1 with February occupancy ending 0.9% higher than the prior year. The decline in Same Store revenue and NOI moderated in the fourth quarter, as compared to the third quarter. Revenue was down 2% in Q4, compared to down 3% in Q3 and NOI was break even in Q4 versus down 7% in Q3. Going into 2010, we expect top-line revenue trends will continue to improve, resulting in positive NOI growth in Europe. It should be noted that these positive occupancy trends, both in the U.S. and Europe are primarily attributable to reduced move outs, not higher move-ins. Turning to acquisitions. During the fourth quarter, Shurgard Europe acquired a facility in Central London for about $5 million. This facility has approximately 15,000 net rentable square feet. While a mature property, we acquired it out of bankruptcy and it needs to be repositioned.Opportunities for acquisition in the U.S. are about the same as last quarter. We continue to have more conversations but no consummated transactions. We will remain disciplined. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."

Many buyers have limited to no financial capacity. Operating trends have been down. And so you're waiting for probably more favorable operating trends and a more robust competitive environment in terms of potential buyers for the asset. Macro trend two is if you don't have equity in your property, meaning you overpaid in the loan. Is it substantially worth more than the value whether you use an eight or a 10 or a seven cap rate? The bank essentially owns the property. And has been widely reported, banks are not exactly moving aggressively to foreclose on assets especially if they're paying interest. And with interest rates down where they are, it doesn't take much to keep the loan current. So I'd say those are two kind of big macro trends that are impeding acquisition or transaction volume."

For the fourth quarter, our core FFO per share was $1.33 compared to $1.38 last year, representing a decline of 4%. Significant items impacting the quarter included decline in Same Store, net operating income by $9 million, which was partially offset by the growth in our non-Same Store properties of $2 million, a decline in interest earned on our cash balances by $5 million, due to lower interest rates and interest expense and preferred dividends in the aggregate were lower by $3 million, due to earlier repurchases. The decline in our Same Store revenue and NOI moderated in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. Revenue declined 3.9% in the fourth quarter compared to 4.6% in the third quarter and NOI declined 3.8% in the fourth quarter versus 6.3% in the third quarter. Notwithstanding the pressure on our operations, our financial position remains solid. At the end of the year, our leverage ratio, including preferred stock was about 23%. During 2009, we retained a significant portion of our operating cash flow approximately $430 million or 54% of our funds available for distribution. At year end, our cash balance was approximately $750 million. A portion of this cash balance will be used to redeem all outstanding equity shares of Series A. These securities will be called as of April 15, 2010, at $24.50 per share for a total of $205 million.Shurgard Europe has a 20% interest in the joint venture that has a 117 million euro loan that matures in July of 2010. We are actively working to refinance or renegotiate the terms of the loan. Our Board increased the quarterly common dividend by 18% or $0.10 per share. Our consistent long-term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income. Taxable income attributable to our common shareholders has increased due to recent purchases of preferred securities and equity stock. As well as the reduced depreciation, offset in part by declines in operating income. Future changes in our dividend will be impacted by these same factors as well as property acquisitions.

We started 2009 at 87.1% occupancy, 0.8% behind the prior year. Through aggressive pricing, promotion and marketing activity and solid execution by field operations, we eliminated this occupancy gap by year end. For the first two months of 2010, these positive trends have continued and we ended February 0.6% higher than the prior year. Revenue declines have also continued to slow in Q1 2010, consistent with trends in Q4. First quarter 2010 expenses will be impacted by significantly higher snow removal costs. Q1 media will change both in terms of mix and day part and we will be in fewer markets. Media costs will be lower. In Europe, we are seeing similar trends. Europe started 2009 at 84.7% occupancy, almost 5% behind prior year. We ended the year at 85.7%, a full point higher. This trend has continued in Q1 with February occupancy ending 0.9% higher than the prior year. The decline in Same Store revenue and NOI moderated in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. Revenue was down 2% in Q4 compared to down 3% in Q3 and NOI was break even in Q4 versus down 7% in Q3. Going into 2010, we expect top line revenue trends will continue to improve, resulting in positive NOI growth in Europe. It should be noted that these positive occupancy trends, both in the U.S. and Europe are primarily attributable to reduced move outs, not higher move ins. Turning to acquisitions. During the fourth quarter, Shurgard Europe acquired a facility in Central London for about $5 million. This facility has approximately 15,000 net rentable square feet. While a mature property, we acquired it out of bankruptcy and it needs to be repositioned.Opportunities for acquisition in the U.S. are about the same as last quarter.

One, if you're an owner and you have substantial equity in your property, you're probably not thinking that this is the all-time great environment to sell. Many buyers have limited to no financial capacity. Operating trends have been down. And so you're waiting for probably more favorable operating trends and a more robust competitive environment in terms of potential buyers for the asset. Macro trend two is if you don't have equity in your property, meaning you overpaid in the loan. Is it substantially worth more than the value whether you use an eight or a 10 or a seven cap rate? The bank essentially owns the property. And has been widely reported, banks are not exactly moving aggressively to foreclose on assets especially if they're paying interest. And with interest rates down where they are, it doesn't take much to keep the loan current. So I'd say those are two kind of big macro trends that are impeding acquisition or transaction volume."

For the first quarter, our core FFO per share was $1.15 compared to $1.16 last year, representing a decline of about 1%. Core FFO per share excludes such item as foreign currency, exchange gains or losses, and the effective income allocations from repurchasing and redeeming our preferred securities and equity stocks. 
Significant items impacting our core FFO during the quarter included a $7 million decline in our same-store net operating income, which was partially offset by growth in our non-same-store properties of $1 million and in Shurgard Europe of $3 million. Our interest earned on our cash balances declined by $2 million due to lower interest rates and interest expense and preferred dividends declined by $2 million due to prior repurchases. The declines in our same-store revenue and net operating income continue to moderate in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, revenues declined 2.2% in the first quarter compared to a 3.9% decline in the fourth quarter, and NOI declined 3% in the first quarter versus a decline of 3.7% in the fourth quarter. Our same-store NOI in the first quarter was impacted by higher property taxes and higher snow-removal expenses, offset by lower media advertising and property insurance expenses. As a result of changes to the accounting rules, costs associated with the acquisition of properties will now be expensed rather than capitalized. During the second quarter, we expect to expense approximately $2 million in acquisition costs related to our recent acquisitions. 
In the first quarter we retained approximately $80 million of our operating cash flow or about 43% of our funds available for distribution. At March 31, our cash balance and marketable securities were just over $800 million. In April we had three capital transactions impacting our cash balances. First, we completed the redemption of all of our outstanding equity stock for a total of $205 million. Second, we called for redemption our 7.5% Series B preferred stocks totaling $155 million, which will result in an EITF D-42 charge of approximately $5 million during the second quarter. And lastly, we issued $145 million of Series O preferred shares with an annual coupon rate of about 6 7/8%. 
We continue to actively work on refinancing of the $116 million euro JV loan due July 2010. Shurgard Europe has a 20% ownership in the JV. We increased our quarterly dividends by $0.15 per share or 23%. This brings our regular quarterly dividend to $0.80 per share. Our consistent long term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income. Taxable income attributable to our common shareholders has increased due to recent repurchases and redemptions of our preferred securities and equity stocks as well as reduced property depreciation offset in part by declines in operating income. 
With that I will now turn it over to Ron."

I'll start with current trends in our domestic same-store properties. Occupancy trend is higher on a year-over-year basis ending the quarter at 88.9%, about 1% higher than last year and 2% higher than in Q4. Occupancy has continued to improve into April, reaching 89.9%, about 1% higher than last year. Asking rates are at or modestly above last year and are turning better each month. Asking rates are still lower than in-place rents so we continue to experience rent roll down but at a much slower pace. Higher occupancies are offsetting part of the rental rate roll down resulting in improving revenue trend. The revenue decline was lower in the first quarter than in Q4, just as Q4 was better than Q3 last year. We expect this trend will continue into the second quarter. The first quarter media spend was lower than prior year as we modified both the mix and daypart along with advertising from pure market. We expect the second quarter media spend will be comparable to last year. 
In Europe, same-store operating trends have continued to improve. Europe started 2010 at 85.7% occupancy and ended the first quarter at 84.8%. April occupancy was 84.5%, about 1% lower than last year. Lower occupancies were offset by higher asking rents, generally about 10% higher than last year and 7% higher than in-place rent. Revenues and net operating income grew by 1% and 6% respectively in the first quarter. NOI benefited from lower marketing, R&M and lower payroll expenses. 
Going into Q2 we expect top-line revenue trends will continue to improve. With respect to acquisitions, we entered into an agreement to acquire 30 self-storage facilities for $189 million, including debt assumption of $100 million. 28 of the facilities are about 1.8 million square feet are located in Southern California. The other facilities are located in the Chicago area. 
The properties complement our existing portfolio nicely and we have a good upside potential as we re-brand and integrate them into the PS platform. We expect to close the transaction during the second quarter. In Europe, we opened our 22nd store in the London market, a 50,000 square-foot development property costing about $14 million. Initial asking rates are about $40 a foot. 
Lastly, Steven De Tollenaere, Shurgard Europe’s CEO, will be leaving effective June 1, having accepted a position in a different industry. Steven has done a superb job of creating shareholder value since our acquisition of Shurgard Europe in 2006. We wish Steven the best of luck in his new endeavors. Jean Kreusch, Shurgard Europe's longtime CFO, will assume the additional responsibility of interim CEO. We have a solid management team in place in Europe and we will continue to grow Shurgard Europe.

For the first quarter, our core FFO per share was $1.15 compared to $1.16 last year, representing a decline of about 1%. Core FFO per share excludes such item as foreign currency, exchange gains or losses, and the effective income allocations from repurchasing and redeeming our preferred securities and equity stocks. 
Significant items impacting our core FFO during the quarter included a $7 million decline in our same-store net operating income, which was partially offset by growth in our non-same-store properties of $1 million and in Shurgard Europe of $3 million. Our interest earned on our cash balances declined by $2 million due to lower interest rates and interest expense and preferred dividends declined by $2 million due to prior repurchases. The declines in our same-store revenue and net operating income continue to moderate in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, revenues declined 2.2% in the first quarter compared to a 3.9% decline in the fourth quarter, and NOI declined 3% in the first quarter versus a decline of 3.7% in the fourth quarter. Our same-store NOI in the first quarter was impacted by higher property taxes and higher snow-removal expenses, offset by lower media advertising and property insurance expenses. As a result of changes to the accounting rules, costs associated with the acquisition of properties will now be expensed rather than capitalized. During the second quarter, we expect to expense approximately $2 million in acquisition costs related to our recent acquisitions. 
In the first quarter we retained approximately $80 million of our operating cash flow or about 43% of our funds available for distribution. At March 31, our cash balance and marketable securities were just over $800 million. In April we had three capital transactions impacting our cash balances. First, we completed the redemption of all of our outstanding equity stock for a total of $205 million. Second, we called for redemption our 7.5% Series B preferred stocks totaling $155 million, which will result in an EITF D-42 charge of approximately $5 million during the second quarter. And lastly, we issued $145 million of Series O preferred shares with an annual coupon rate of about 6 7/8%. 
We continue to actively work on refinancing of the $116 million euro JV loan due July 2010. Shurgard Europe has a 20% ownership in the JV. We increased our quarterly dividends by $0.15 per share or 23%. This brings our regular quarterly dividend to $0.80 per share. Our consistent long term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income. Taxable income attributable to our common shareholders has increased due to recent repurchases and redemptions of our preferred securities and equity stocks as well as reduced property depreciation offset in part by declines in operating income. 
With that I will now turn it over to Ron.

I'll start with current trends in our domestic same-store properties. Occupancy trend is higher on a year-over-year basis ending the quarter at 88.9%, about 1% higher than last year and 2% higher than in Q4. Occupancy has continued to improve into April, reaching 89.9%, about 1% higher than last year. Asking rates are at or modestly above last year and are turning better each month. Asking rates are still lower than in-place rents so we continue to experience rent roll down but at a much slower pace. Higher occupancies are offsetting part of the rental rate roll down resulting in improving revenue trend. The revenue decline was lower in the first quarter than in Q4, just as Q4 was better than Q3 last year. We expect this trend will continue into the second quarter. The first quarter media spend was lower than prior year as we modified both the mix and daypart along with advertising from pure market. We expect the second quarter media spend will be comparable to last year. 
In Europe, same-store operating trends have continued to improve. Europe started 2010 at 85.7% occupancy and ended the first quarter at 84.8%. April occupancy was 84.5%, about 1% lower than last year. Lower occupancies were offset by higher asking rents, generally about 10% higher than last year and 7% higher than in-place rent. Revenues and net operating income grew by 1% and 6% respectively in the first quarter. NOI benefited from lower marketing, R&M and lower payroll expenses. 
Going into Q2 we expect top-line revenue trends will continue to improve. With respect to acquisitions, we entered into an agreement to acquire 30 self-storage facilities for $189 million, including debt assumption of $100 million. 28 of the facilities are about 1.8 million square feet are located in Southern California. The other facilities are located in the Chicago area. 
The properties complement our existing portfolio nicely and we have a good upside potential as we re-brand and integrate them into the PS platform. We expect to close the transaction during the second quarter. In Europe, we opened our 22nd store in the London market, a 50,000 square-foot development property costing about $14 million. Initial asking rates are about $40 a foot. 
Lastly, Steven De Tollenaere, Shurgard Europe’s CEO, will be leaving effective June 1, having accepted a position in a different industry. Steven has done a superb job of creating shareholder value since our acquisition of Shurgard Europe in 2006. We wish Steven the best of luck in his new endeavors. Jean Kreusch, Shurgard Europe's longtime CFO, will assume the additional responsibility of interim CEO. We have a solid management team in place in Europe and we will continue to grow Shurgard Europe. 
With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.

In terms of our long-term strategy with Europe, we've continually said and it's true that Shurgard Europe is our kind of European growth platform, similar to PS Business Parks, which we've owned since 1996. We expect to hold that position for a long, long, long, long time. And we continue to work with the European team to grow that platform. You'll recall, Europe has tremendous growth opportunities. There's only 1,500 facilities in Europe, but a comparable population here to the U.S. So there's just a tremendous growth opportunity in Europe and we want to participate in it.

The numbers that I gave you would say that: okay, we've been more aggressive on rates in Europe than in the U.S. and that has resulted in a slight occupancy degradation in Europe versus the U.S. where we've had an uptick in occupancy. But overall, revenue growth is still positive. And we moved to a positive street rates, above in-place rents, and some nice growth there on the revenue per available foot. The other thing Europe, if you looked at it by market, more than seven countries, there's kind of one laggard there.

For the first quarter, our core FFO per share was $1.15 compared to $1.16 last year, representing a decline of about 1%. Core FFO per share excludes such items as foreign currency exchange gains or losses and the effective income allocations from repurchasing and redeeming our preferred securities and equity stocks. 
Significant items impacting our core FFO during the quarter included a $7 million decline in our same-store net operating income, which was partially offset by growth in our non-same-store properties of $1 million and in Shurgard Europe of $3 million. Our interest earned on our cash balances declined by $2 million due to lower interest rates and interest expense and preferred dividends declined by $2 million due to prior repurchases. The declines in our same-store revenue and net operating income continue to moderate in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis, revenues declined 2.2% in the first quarter compared to a 3.9% decline in the fourth quarter, and NOI declined 3% in the first quarter versus a decline of 3.7% in the fourth quarter. Our same-store NOI in the first quarter was impacted by higher property taxes and higher snow-removal expenses, offset by lower media advertising and property insurance expenses. As a result of changes to the accounting rules, costs associated with the acquisition of properties will now be expensed rather than capitalized. During the second quarter, we expect to expense approximately $2 million in acquisition costs related to our recent acquisitions. 
In the first quarter we retained approximately $80 million of our operating cash flow or about 43% of our funds available for distribution. At March 31, our cash balance and marketable securities were just over $800 million. In April we had three capital transactions impacting our cash balances. First, we completed the redemption of all of our outstanding equity stock for a total of $205 million. Second, we called for redemption our 7.5% Series B preferred stocks totaling $155 million, which will result in an EITF D-42 charge of approximately $5 million during the second quarter. And lastly, we issued $145 million of Series O preferred shares with an annual coupon rate of about 6 7/8%. 
We continue to actively work on refinancing of the $116 million euro JV loan due July 2010. Shurgard Europe has a 20% ownership in the JV. We increased our quarterly dividends by $0.15 per share or 23%. This brings our regular quarterly dividend to $0.80 per share. Our consistent long term dividend policy has been to distribute only our taxable income. Taxable income attributable to our common shareholders has increased due to recent repurchases and redemptions of our preferred securities and equity stock, as well as reduced property depreciation, offset in part by declines in operating income. 
With that, I will now turn it over to Ron."

I'll start with current trends in our domestic same-store properties. Occupancy trended higher on a year-over-year basis ending the quarter at 88.9%, about 1% higher than last year and 2% higher than in Q4. Occupancy has continued to improve into April, reaching 89.9%, about 1% higher than last year. Asking rates are at or modestly above last year and are turning better each month. Asking rates are still lower than in-place rents so we continue to experience rent roll down, but at a much slower pace. Higher occupancies are offsetting part of the rental rate roll down, resulting in improving revenue trend. The revenue decline was lower in the first quarter than in Q4, just as Q4 was better than Q3 last year. We expect this trend will continue into the second quarter. The first quarter media spend was lower than prior year as we modified both the mix and daypart along with advertising from pure market. We expect the second quarter media spend will be comparable to last year. 
In Europe, same-store operating trends have continued to improve. Europe started 2010 at 85.7% occupancy and ended the first quarter at 84.8%. April occupancy was 84.5%, about 1% lower than last year. Lower occupancies were offset by higher asking rents, generally about 10% higher than last year and 7% higher than in-place rent. Revenues and net operating income grew by 1% and 6% respectively in the first quarter. NOI benefited from lower marketing, R&M and lower payroll expenses. 
Going into Q2 we expect top-line revenue trends will continue to improve. With respect to acquisitions, we entered into an agreement to acquire 30 self-storage facilities for $189 million, including debt assumption of $100 million. 28 of the facilities are about 1.8 million square feet are located in Southern California. The other facilities are located in the Chicago area. 
The properties complement our existing portfolio nicely and we have a good upside potential as we re-brand and integrate them into the PS platform. We expect to close the transaction during the second quarter. In Europe, we opened our 22nd store in the London market, a 50,000 square-foot development property costing about $14 million. Initial asking rates are about $40 a foot. 
Lastly, Steven De Tollenaere, Shurgard Europe’s CEO, will be leaving effective June 1, having accepted a position in a different industry. Steven has done a superb job of creating shareholder value since our acquisition of Shurgard Europe in 2006. We wish Steven the best of luck in his new endeavors. Jean Kreusch, Shurgard Europe's longtime CFO, will assume the additional responsibility of interim CEO. We have a solid management team in place in Europe and we will continue to grow Shurgard Europe.

It sounds like you chose to raise rates there perhaps a little too quick. Or I'm not sure, but can you just comment on that? And also like versus what you're doing here in the United States, perhaps."

I don't think their strategy -- I know their strategy is not materially different than ours, which is to optimize growth in revenue per available foot. But there’s ways to do that, whether it's holding rates down, going for more occupancy, or pushing rates a little more when you feel demand is strong. And so there's a trade off and a balancing act. The numbers that I gave you would say that, okay we've been more aggressive on rates in Europe than in the U.S. and that has resulted in a slight occupancy degradation in Europe versus the U.S. where we've had an uptick in occupancy. But overall, revenue growth is still positive. And we moved to a positive street rates, above in-place rents, and some nice growth there on the revenue per available foot. The other thing in Europe, if you looked at it by market, and we’re in seven countries, there's kind of one laggard there. Holland, which is dragging down the averages, but across the platform, whether it's U.K., Belgium, France, Sweden, we're up across all of the markets."

Our core FFO per share was $1.27 compared to $1.25 last year, representing an increase of 2%. Core FFO per share excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, EITF D-42 charges from redeeming our preferred securities",408,"Thank you, Clem. Our core FFO per share was $1.27 compared to $1.25 last year, representing an increase of 2%. Core FFO per share excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, EITF D-42 charges from redeeming our preferred securities and due diligence costs related to our acquisition activity. Our core FFO during the quarter was impacted by the redemption of our equity stock, improved operations from both Shurgard Europe and our non-stabilized assets in the U.S., partially offset by reduced operations in our same-store properties. 
The redemption of $205 million of our equity stock during the quarter resulted in a $5 million increase in our FFO as distributions to these shareholders were eliminated. Notwithstanding the currency conversion rate that was 6 1/2% lower than last year due to a stronger dollar, FFO from Shurgard Europe increased by $2 million. This increase was primarily due to improved property operations, which Ron will discuss in a moment. 
Operations, with respect to our portfolio of 94 non-stabilized facilities, increased by $3 million. Included in this number is $1.5 billion generated by the 31 facilities that were acquired during the quarter. Partially offsetting these items is a $3 million decline in our same-store net operating income. The declines in our year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI continue to moderate sequentially in the second quarter, as compared to the first quarter and the fourth quarter of last year. 
On a year-over-year basis, revenues declined 0.2% in the second quarter, compared to a 2.2% decline in the first quarter and a 3.8% decline in the fourth quarter. NOI declined 1 1/2% in the second quarter, compared to a decline of 3% in the first quarter and a 3.4% decline in the fourth quarter. 
During the quarter, we were able to put approximately $338 million of cash to work, $205 million to redeem our equity stock, $118 million to acquire facilities, and together, with the net proceeds from a new preferred series, $15 million to redeem one of our existing preferred series.  In the second quarter, we retained approximately $48 million of operating cash flow. At June 30, 2010, our cash and marketable securities total about $570 million. 
In July, our Shurgard Europe team completed the refinancing of the EUR 115 million JV loan. The new loan's maturity date is July 2013. Shurgard Europe has a 20% interest in the joint venture. With that, I will now turn it now over to Ron."

Occupancy trended higher year-over-year, ending the second quarter of 91.8%, about 1.2% higher than last year. Both occupancy and in-place rents were higher in July than prior year. 
Asking or street rates were above last year and have been higher since March. Our year-over-year revenue-per-available-foot growth, or REVPAF growth, was positive in June and July, the first positive months of December 2008. 
There is a large gap in revenue growth rates between various markets. The Northeast, led by New York, Philadelphia and Washington D.C., Baltimore had positive revenue growth rates of between 2% and 5% during the quarter. Los Angeles, our largest market, was down 2%, and the entire West Coast was negative. The Southeast markets continue to be our worst, with Charlotte at a negative 4.4% growth rate. However, the West Coast and Southeast markets both improved more than the Northeast during the second quarter. 
In the second quarter, we decreased spot TV by about 30% resulting in lower media spend. Our customer acquisition costs were also 2% lower, primarily due to a 3% higher movement volume. Going into the third quarter, we expect the media spend to be lower than last year. 
In Europe, same-store operating trends continue to improve, Higher asking rents were offset by lower occupancy leading to a 2% revenue growth. Net operating income grew by 8% in the second quarter, due primarily to higher revenues and significantly lower advertising costs. 
Similar to the U.S., there was a wide variance in growth rates between the various European markets. Most markets were positive, between 2% and 7%, led by Sweden. The only negative growth rate market was the Netherlands, down 6%. 
During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of 31 properties consisting of approximately 2 million square feet for $200 million. We are currently under contract to acquire seven lender-owned properties for approximately $27 million for 400,000 square feet. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."

And we're continuing to see pretty good move-in activity with that, and we're able to get higher rates with that. Move-outs, during the first quarter, our move-outs were substantially below last year, but during the second quarter it pretty much got back into line with last year. So move-outs, I would say, are more at a normalized level to what we've historically seen.

And so your cap rates are, so to speak, all over the board from 0 to probably 7% or 8%. I would say, which I've said in prior quarters, that in this environment, you should look at it as more of a price-per-pound kind of transaction versus a cap rate. Certainly, an initial cap rate. We think the longer-term trend, once the properties are stabilized, operated under the Public Storage system, we'll move probably somewhere between the 8% and 10%, if not north of that yield on the investment. But like one of the properties we have today under contract is in Hawaii that we're buying at $80, $85 a foot, which is, by any measure, substantially below replacement cost. So I think that's -- really, the way you need to look at it is big discount to replacement cost upon stabilization somewhere between 8% and 10%."

I mean, it is physically next door, it's a property where we have substantially high rates. It's 94% occupied. And so filling this property up is what you would call a slam dunk. We have another property in Illinois, $31 a foot. It's in a submarket where we have, that'll be a little more challenging but we think we'll do it at decent rates. And then we have wave illustration of property in Hawaii. Hawaii has come on the rebound here this year, but for the last three years has been an extremely tough market.

Our core FFO per share was $1.27 compared to $1.25 last year, representing an increase of 2%. Core FFO per share excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, EITF D-42 charges from redeeming our preferred securities and due diligence costs related to our acquisition activity. Our core FFO during the quarter was impacted by the redemption of our equity stock, improved operations from both Shurgard Europe and our non-stabilized assets in the U.S., partially offset by reduced operations in our same-store properties. 
The redemption of $205 million of our equity stock during the quarter resulted in a $5 million increase in our FFO as distributions to these shareholders were eliminated. Notwithstanding the currency conversion rate that was 6 1/2% lower than last year due to a stronger dollar, FFO from Shurgard Europe increased by $2 million. This increase was primarily due to improved property operations, which Ron will discuss in a moment. 
Operations, with respect to our portfolio of 94 non-stabilized facilities, increased by $3 million. Included in this number is $1.5 billion generated by the 31 facilities that were acquired during the quarter. Partially offsetting these items is a $3 million decline in our same-store net operating income. The declines in our year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI continue to moderate sequentially in the second quarter, as compared to the first quarter and the fourth quarter of last year. 
On a year-over-year basis, revenues declined 0.2% in the second quarter, compared to a 2.2% decline in the first quarter and a 3.8% decline in the fourth quarter. NOI declined 1 1/2% in the second quarter, compared to a decline of 3% in the first quarter and a 3.4% decline in the fourth quarter. 
During the quarter, we were able to put approximately $338 million of cash to work, $205 million to redeem our equity stock, $118 million to acquire facilities, and together, with the net proceeds from a new preferred series, $15 million to redeem one of our existing preferred series.  In the second quarter, we retained approximately $48 million of operating cash flow. At June 30, 2010, our cash and marketable securities total about $570 million. 
In July, our Shurgard Europe team completed the refinancing of the EUR 115 million JV loan. The new loan's maturity date is July 2013. Shurgard Europe has a 20% interest in the joint venture. With that, I will now turn it now over to Ron."

Occupancy trended higher year-over-year, ending the second quarter of 91.8%, about 1.2% higher than last year. Both occupancy and in-place rents were higher in July than prior year. 
Asking or street rates were above last year and have been higher since March. Our year-over-year revenue-per-available-foot growth, or REVPAF growth, was positive in June and July, the first positive months of December 2008. 
There is a large gap in revenue growth rates between various markets. The Northeast, led by New York, Philadelphia and Washington D.C., Baltimore had positive revenue growth rates of between 2% and 5% during the quarter. Los Angeles, our largest market, was down 2%, and the entire West Coast was negative. The Southeast markets continue to be our worst, with Charlotte at a negative 4.4% growth rate. However, the West Coast and Southeast markets both improved more than the Northeast during the second quarter. 
In the second quarter, we decreased spot TV by about 30% resulting in lower media spend. Our customer acquisition costs were also 2% lower, primarily due to a 3% higher movement volume. Going into the third quarter, we expect the media spend to be lower than last year. 
In Europe, same-store operating trends continue to improve, Higher asking rents were offset by lower occupancy leading to a 2% revenue growth. Net operating income grew by 8% in the second quarter, due primarily to higher revenues and significantly lower advertising costs. 
Similar to the U.S., there was a wide variance in growth rates between the various European markets. Most markets were positive, between 2% and 7%, led by Sweden. The only negative growth rate market was the Netherlands, down 6%. 
During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of 31 properties consisting of approximately 2 million square feet for $200 million. We are currently under contract to acquire seven lender-owned properties for approximately $27 million for 400,000 square feet. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."

Length of stay, as best we could tell, is pretty much trending the same way it has historically. So we haven't seen any real change in that particularly. And I'm talking about new tenants coming in and how long they stay after the move-in. In terms of move-ins, our move-ins were relatively strong during the quarter. And we're continuing to see pretty good move-in activity with that, and we're able to get higher rates with that. Move-outs, during the first quarter, our move-outs were substantially below last year, but during the second quarter it pretty much got back into line with last year. So move-outs, I would say, are more at a normalized level to what we've historically seen. So I know in the past couple of conference calls, we've talked about how move-out activity has ramped up quite a bit a year ago. And then they ramped down, I would say, over the past six months. But in the second quarter of this year, we're back to more normalized levels."

Our core FFO per share was $1.27 compared to $1.25 last year, representing an increase of 2%.

Our core FFO per share was $1.27 compared to $1.25 last year, representing an increase of 2%. Core FFO per share excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, EITF D-42 charges from redeeming our preferred securities and due diligence costs related to our acquisition activity. Our core FFO during the quarter was impacted by the redemption of our equity stock, improved operations from both Shurgard Europe and our non-stabilized assets in the U.S., partially offset by reduced operations in our same-store properties. 
The redemption of $205 million of our equity stock during the quarter resulted in a $5 million increase in our FFO as distributions to these shareholders were eliminated. Notwithstanding the currency conversion rate that was 6 1/2% lower than last year due to a stronger dollar, FFO from Shurgard Europe increased by $2 million. This increase was primarily due to improved property operations, which Ron will discuss in a moment. 
Operations, with respect to our portfolio of 94 non-stabilized facilities, increased by $3 million. Included in this number is $1.5 billion generated by the 31 facilities that were acquired during the quarter. Partially offsetting these items is a $3 million decline in our same-store net operating income. The declines in our year-over-year same-store revenue and NOI continue to moderate sequentially in the second quarter, as compared to the first quarter and the fourth quarter of last year. 
On a year-over-year basis, revenues declined 0.2% in the second quarter, compared to a 2.2% decline in the first quarter and a 3.8% decline in the fourth quarter. NOI declined 1 1/2% in the second quarter, compared to a decline of 3% in the first quarter and a 3.4% decline in the fourth quarter. 
During the quarter, we were able to put approximately $338 million of cash to work, $205 million to redeem our equity stock, $118 million to acquire facilities, and together, with the net proceeds from a new preferred series, $15 million to redeem one of our existing preferred series.  In the second quarter, we retained approximately $48 million of operating cash flow. At June 30, 2010, our cash and marketable securities total about $570 million. 
In July, our Shurgard Europe team completed the refinancing of the EUR 115 million JV loan. The new loan's maturity date is July 2013. Shurgard Europe has a 20% interest in the joint venture. With that, I will now turn it now over to Ron."

Occupancy trended higher year-over-year, ending the second quarter of 91.8%, about 1.2% higher than last year. Both occupancy and in-place rents were higher in July than prior year. 
Asking or street rates were above last year and have been higher since March. Our year-over-year revenue-per-available-foot growth, or REVPAF growth, was positive in June and July, the first positive months of December 2008. 
There is a large gap in revenue growth rates between various markets. The Northeast, led by New York, Philadelphia and Washington D.C., Baltimore had positive revenue growth rates of between 2% and 5% during the quarter. Los Angeles, our largest market, was down 2%, and the entire West Coast was negative. The Southeast markets continue to be our worst, with Charlotte at a negative 4.4% growth rate. However, the West Coast and Southeast markets both improved more than the Northeast during the second quarter. 
In the second quarter, we decreased spot TV by about 30% resulting in lower media spend. Our customer acquisition costs were also 2% lower, primarily due to a 3% higher movement volume. Going into the third quarter, we expect the media spend to be lower than last year. 
In Europe, same-store operating trends continue to improve, Higher asking rents were offset by lower occupancy leading to a 2% revenue growth. Net operating income grew by 8% in the second quarter, due primarily to higher revenues and significantly lower advertising cost. 
Similar to the U.S., there was a wide variance in growth rates between the various European markets. Most markets were positive, between 2% and 7%, led by Sweden. The only negative growth rate market was the Netherlands, down 6%. 
During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of 31 properties consisting of approximately 2 million square feet for $200 million. We are currently under contract to acquire seven lender-owned properties for approximately $27 million for 400,000 square feet. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions."

In terms of move-ins, our move-ins were relatively strong during the quarter. And we're continuing to see pretty good move-in activity with that, and we're able to get higher rates with that. Move-outs, during the first quarter, our move-outs were substantially below last year, but during the second quarter it pretty much got back into line with last year. So move-outs, I would say, are more at a normalized level to what we've historically seen. So I know in the past couple of conference calls, we've talked about how move-out activity has ramped up quite a bit a year ago. And then they ramped down, I would say, over the past six months.

And we're certainly at one of those junctures. But we think in the long run, the preferred is a very economical source of capital when you consider both interest rate risk, the refinancing risk, the fact that we can call the preferred after five years and the fact that the dividends are tax deductible. All those features combined, we think, makes the preferred a lower cost of capital in the long run than debt. Again, I think, it certainly was validated in the financial crisis because there's a number of people that had a lot of leverage that had to sell a lot of equity at extremely low prices, substantially below NAV to remediate or fix their balance sheet."

We think the longer-term trend, once the properties are stabilized, operated under the Public Storage system, will move probably somewhere between the 8% and 10%, if not north of that yield on the investment. But like one of the properties we have today under contract is in Hawaii that we're buying at $80, $85 a foot, which is, by any measure, substantially below replacement cost.

The one market where we're having trouble is the Netherlands, and that's a function for us of both -- we put a lot of product into that market over the last couple of years. Several other operators put a fair amount of product into that market. And then we've had some operational issues as well which have since been corrected, but that's been a challenge for us as well.

I mean, it is physically next door, it's a property where we have substantially high rates. It's 94% occupied. And so filling this property up is what you would call a slam dunk. We have another property in Illinois at $31 a foot. It's in a submarket where we have, that'll be a little more challenging but we think we'll do it at decent rates. And then we have wave illustration of property in Hawaii. Hawaii has come on the rebound here this year, but for the last three years, it's been an extremely tough market.

Our core FFO per share was $1.27 compared to $1.25 last year representing an increase of 2%. Core FFO per share excludes the impact of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, EITF D-42 charges from redeeming our preferred securities and due diligence costs related to our acquisition activity.
Our core FFO during the quarter was impacted by the redemption of our equity stock, improved operations from both Shurgard Europe and our non-stabilized assets in the U.S., partially offset by reduced operations in our Same Store properties. The redemption of 205 million of our equity stock during the quarter resulted in a $5 million increase in our FFO as distributions to these shareholders were eliminated.
Notwithstanding the currency conversion rate that was 6.5% lower than last year due to a stronger dollar, FFO from Shurgard Europe increased by $2 million. This increase was primarily due to improved property operations, which Ron will discuss in a moment.
Operations with respect to our portfolio of 94 non-stabilized facilities increased by 3 million. Included in this number is 1.5 million generated by the 31 facilities that were acquired during the quarter.
Partially offsetting these items is a $3 million decline in our Same Store net operating income. The declines in our year-over-year Same Store revenue and NOI continue to moderate sequentially in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter and the fourth quarter of last year.
On a year-over-year basis, revenues declined 0.2% in the second quarter compared to a 2.2% decline in the first quarter and a 3.8% decline in the fourth quarter. NOI declined 1.5% in the second quarter compared to a decline of 3% in the first quarter and a 3.4% decline in the fourth quarter.
During the quarter, we were able to put approximately $338 million of cash to work, $205 million to redeem our equity stock and $118 million to acquire facilities and together with the net proceeds from a new preferred series $15 million to redeem one of our existing preferred series.
In the second quarter, we retained approximately $48 million of our operating cash flow. At June 30, 2010, our cash and marketable securities totaled about $570 million. In July our Shurgard Europe team completed the refinancing of the €115 million JV loans. The new loan’s maturity date is July 2013. Shurgard Europe has a 20% interest in the joint venture.
With that I will now turn it over to Ron.

Occupancy traded higher year-over-year ending the second quarter at 91.8% about 1.2% higher than last year. Both occupancy and in-place rents were higher in July than prior year. Asking or street rates were above last year and have been higher since March.
Our year-over-year revenue per available foot growth or REVPAF growth was positive in June and July, the first positive month since December 2008. There is a large gap in revenue growth rates between various markets.
The Northeast led by New York, Philadelphia and Washington DC, Baltimore had positive revenue growth rates of between 2% and 5% during the quarter. Los Angeles our largest market was down 2% and the entire West Coast was negative. The Southeast markets continue to be our worst with Charlotte at a negative 4.4% growth rate. However the West Coast and Southeast markets, both improved more than the Northeast during the second quarter.
In the second quarter, we decreased spot TV by about 30% resulting in lower media spend. Our customer acquisition costs were also 2% lower primarily due to a 3% higher move-in volume. Going into the third quarter, we expect the media spend to be lower than last year.
In Europe, Same Store operating trends continue to improve. Higher asking rents were offset by lower occupancy leading to a 2% revenue growth. Net operating income grew by 8% in the second quarter, due primarily to higher revenues and significantly lower advertising costs.
Similar to the U.S., there was a wide variance in growth rates between the various European markets. Most markets were positive between 2% and 7%, led by Sweden. The only negative growth rate market was the Netherlands, down 6%.
During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of 31 properties, consisting of approximately 2 million square feet for $200 million. We are currently under contract to acquire seven lender-owned properties for approximately $27 million or 400,000 square feet.

In terms of move-ins, our move-ins were relatively stronger in the quarter and we’re continuing to see pretty good move-in activity with that and we’re able to get higher rates with that. Move-outs, during the first quarter, our move-outs were substantially below last year, but during the second quarter, it pretty much got back into line with last year, so throughout move-outs, I’d say, are more at a normalized level to what we historically have seen.
I know in the past couple of conference calls, we’ve talked about how move-out activity has ramped up quite a bit a year ago and then they ramped down, I would say, over the past six months, but in the second quarter of this year, we’re back to more normalized levels.

The second group of sellers are financial institutions that have foreclosed upon properties, and if you look at the seven deals that on the contract and the one property we did in Q2 in Atlanta, those were all lender foreclosed upon transactions, all at, what I would consider, substantially below replacement cost, which is another reason why I think acquisitions are the best source of capital deployment.

The first month as the tenant moves in we don’t amortize it out over a period of time. So yes, you are absolutely right. The realized rent per square foot did drop down.

We think the longer-term trends, once the properties are stabilized operated under the Public Storage system, will move probably somewhere between the 8% and 10%, if not north of that, yield on the investments, but like one of the properties we have today under contract is in Hawaii that we’re buying at $80, $85 a foot, which is by any measure substantially below replacement cost.

It is our largest or second largest in the portfolio, so it’s a big weight, and so which is driving the overall average occupancy you see down in that.

As we expand today, we’re still highly occupied. We’re probably going to actually be more conservative on our rates as we move forward, because we’re getting to August, which is a big move-out month. Hence our goal is going to be to try to hold on to the occupancies best as possible, and as Ron also touched on, we’re going to have reduced media spend.

As outlined in our press release our core FFO per share was $1.35 compared to $1.30 last year representing an increase of $0.05 per share or 3.8%. Two items principally drove this growth the redemption of our equity stock and property acquisitions. In the second quarter, we redeemed $205 million of our equity stock. This eliminated $5 million of quarterly distributions to the shareholders and resulted in a corresponding increase in FFO to our common shareholders of $0.03 per share.
During the first nine months of 2010 we acquired 38 facilities for approximately $225 million. Net operating income for these facilities totaled $3.7 million in the quarter. Or $3.1 million after netting out related interest expense on the loans that we assumed to acquire these facilities. On a net basis this resulted in an increase in FFO of $0.02 per share.
Our same-store net operating income increased by 600,000 this is the first positive growth since the fourth quarter of 2008. FFO from our investment in Shurgard Europe decrease by approximately 700,000, this reduction was principally caused by currency loss of $1.8 million as the conversion ratio of euros to dollars was 10% lower than last year due to a stronger dollar.
We retained approximately $700 million of our operating cash flow during the quarter. At September 30, 2010 our cash and marketable securities totaled $615 million. During October, we had three capital transactions. On October 7, we issued $125 million of our 6.5% series P preferred stock. In connection with this issuance, we called for redemption our 7% and 8% series B preferred security for approximately $109 million. This he redemption happened today.
Also in October 25, we repurchased all of our 7.25% series J preferred partnership unit for approximately $100 million. These preferred units were otherwise redeemable in May 2011. We expect to record EITF D-42 charges of approximately $4 million or $0.02 per share related to these securities in the fourth quarter. These capital transactions will improve our ongoing annual FFO by approximately $0.04 per share.
With that I will now turn it over to Ron.

As we said on our last conference call, our pricing strategy this quarter was to be conservative on rental rates in order to accelerate move-in volumes as we come out of the prime rental season.Our objective is to enter 2011 at a higher",472,"Thank you, John. As we said on our last conference call, our pricing strategy this quarter was to be conservative on rental rates in order to accelerate move-in volumes as we come out of the prime rental season.
Our objective is to enter 2011 at a higher occupancy level than 2010. Our strategy worked and we had an exceptional quarter with respect to rental activity. Move-in volumes accelerated nicely and we rented 15,000 more units this quarter versus the third quarter last year for about 57% increase. This was offset in part by 6,000 more move-outs resulting in 9,000 additional customers.
As a result, the spread in year-over-year occupancy increased to 1.7% at September 30th from 1.1% at June 30th. For October, both occupancy and in place rents were higher than the prior year. Asking or street rents were above last year during Q3 as they have been for most of the year.
In our 20 largest markets achieved positive year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter compared to only six in the second quarter. The Washington, D.C. Baltimore market led the country at 4.7% in Q3 followed by New York at 4.5%. Los Angeles, our largest market was down only 0.7% compared to a negative 2.1% in the second quarter. Even Florida and Georgia markets also improved from a negative 1.4% in Q2 to a positive 0.1% in Q3.
Charlotte, our worst market over the past two years, grew by 0.2% versus the negative 4.4% in the second quarter. In the third quarter, we decreased by 20% resulting in lower media advertising costs. Our net customer acquisition costs were 13% lower due to higher move-in volume and higher rental rates. Going into the fourth quarter we expect the media spend will be lower than last year.
We plan to continue our current strategy of conservative rental rates and high promotional discounts for the balance of Q4. In Europe, same-store top-line growth continued to improve. Higher asking rates were offset by lower occupancy leads to 1% revenue growth. Net operating income declined by about 2% due primarily to higher advertising and payroll expenses.
There is a wide variance in NOI growth rates between the European markets. Two markets were positive while the remaining markets were negative. Year-to-date through September, we've acquired 38 properties with about $2.4 million square feet for approximately $225 million, just over $90 a square foot.
We currently have an additional four properties under contract in Ohio, New Jersey and Florida, totaling about 300,000 square feet at a purchase price of around $14 million. Property sales volume activity has accelerated nicely in 2010 versus 2009. Private owners and banks are selling properties in the prospective buyers are plentiful. We anticipate the volume of activity will continue to grow into 2011.
With that operator, let's open it up for questions.

As I've touched on before, I mean we're looking at somewhere on a stabilized basis somewhere between 7.5, 9 or 8 and 10 somewhere in that range depending on the property in the market, but several of the properties that we’re acquiring, in fact, three out of the four that we're buying this quarter are such low occupancy levels that they're not even breaking even.
So some of the product that's coming to market, especially the foreclosure stuff, is not really - it's not an NOI purchase or a yield purchase. It's really, as I've said before, price per pound. Dave, anything to add?

We're going to continue that into Q4 and probably going into the first part of Q1, so that when we come into the rental season next year we're at a higher occupancy level and that's also the time when we send out the rental rate increases.

I know you probably think it's uncharacteristic of us or me, but the property level people did a great job in Q3. One of their incentives is occupancy and they did a great job and so almost all of that increase is due to incentive bonuses to property-level personnel. Up close to a million dollars in Q3 and it was also up in Q2.

We - initially, when we started off the year we were thinking our increase for the full year would be about 3.5% and we basically accrued property taxes through the first two quarters, that 3.5%. We have since revised our both year-over-year increase to about 2.5%. So we dropped it by a full percentage point.
And what we're seeing is that assessed values are coming down quite a bit. They're somewhat offset by increased tax rate, but on a net-net basis, the amount of increase that we were expecting at the beginning of the year is certainly not materializing and it is possible that we could see further decline as we move into the fourth quarter. There's a couple of states that we have yet to really get a good feel for, particularly Illinois and more particular the Cook County properties we have in the Chicago area, could result in further decreases in property taxes in the fourth quarter, from what we originally were estimating.

I just wanted to ask you - I assume on the supply front that new supply is probably fairly low but given that this industry, I think in retrospect is it's probably a lot more resilient than people had thought it would be, kind of at the onset of this recession. Would you expect construction lending and therefore supply to maybe come back faster than you would have thought maybe a year ago?
It seems that acquisition financing is coming back. It's not really an issue for you, but, other companies are getting access to buy properties and typically construction lending I think follows. What’s sort of your thoughts on that?

So lenders want real cash flow, real coverage ratios, very little, if any, in terms of new development lending. I think the guys that extra space chronicled the woes of trying to get development loans over the past year. So we don't see any - very little of any development lending going on.
