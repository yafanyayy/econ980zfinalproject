Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter call. This is Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and also with us today are Chris Clark, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Jellison",1943,"Thank you, Missy. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter call. This is Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and also with us today are Chris Clark, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bill Jellison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.Each of the three of us have some prepared remarks today. We're going to comment on the state of the market in late 2009, and how we see it going into 2010. And of course, we're going to cover in some detail, our fourth quarter 2009 performance as well as the full year 2009 performance. And as usual, following our formal remarks, we will be pleased to answer any questions you may have.Before we get started, it's important to note that this conference call will in fact include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. And those should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and the uncertainties described in the company's most recent annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly filings on Form 10-Q, as well as our press releases and other filings with the SEC. It's important to note that the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. And as usual, a recording of this conference call in its entirety will be available on our website.Last evening, we were pleased to announce fourth quarter and full-year earnings. Our 2009 performance, I think, illustrates DENTSPLY's ability to deliver consistent performance throughout economic cycles. We achieved solid results in a very challenging market, largely due to efforts to balance our continued investment and growth prospects, but also a rapid reduction in our non-essential discretionary expenses. On balance, I think we did a good job of controlling cost, taking market share in select markets and improving cash flows. Our fourth quarter results show some signs of markets stabilizing and also, even improving in certain markets. In total, the fourth quarter sales were up 11.3% ex precious metals, and that was driven by constant currency growth of 5.7% and a currency benefit of 5.6%. The constant currency growth of 5.7% included internal growth of a positive 0.6% and acquisition growth of 5.1%.Looking at just the dental business, excluding our non-dental businesses, the internal growth would've been 1.3%. I think it's important to note that this is the first positive internal growth we've seen since Q3 of 2008. And although we had an easier comp in the fourth quarter, we nevertheless view the positive growth as reflective of perhaps a modest improvement in select markets in some regions of the world.The dental internal growth was driven by a positive growth in our consumable lines and our specialty products in total, which were both positive during the quarter. The Prosthetics business continues to lag and have negative internal growth in the quarter. I think there are a couple of important messages here. One is that consumable growth appears to be coming back the fastest in the market. And while we recognize there is a low base year comparison for consumables particularly in the U.S., this growth is a good indicator that everyday dentistry is being performed at a slightly higher pace. And I think it's probably also an indicator that we're taking share in some of these broad categories.The specialties, which we continue to experience positive internal growth in implants and orthodontics and just slightly negative internal growth in endodontics has held up pretty well throughout the recession. I think it's important to note that our Specialty businesses and the aggregate have reported positive internal growth in all four quarters of 2009. Although they're not really growing rapidly yet at this point, they appear to be holding their own in a slow growth pattern and given the growth that we've experienced in these categories, we believe that we continue to outperform the market and take share.The prosthetics market, that's the products that are sold primarily through the dental lab, continues to be the most economically-sensitive as these procedures generally come at a high cost. They're somewhat discretionary and deferrable. This market continues to contract, and we don't see any meaningful signs of recovery in either the U.S. or Europe at this point.Geographic growth was much improved in the U.S. with internal growth of 3.0% in total and 4.2% for the dental business. While Europe was a negative 3.5% in total, and rest of the world was positive 4.9%. A couple of observations, the U.S. dental growth reflects Chairside consumable internal growth in the double digits and that was aided by an easier comp from the prior year. Adjusting for our best guess of what were the changes in dealer inventory this year versus last and also for anesthetic product outage last year, we think we probably grew 1% to 2% in consumables in the quarter. And we believe that's probably more reflective of market growth or perhaps just above market.Our specialty products in the U.S. continue to grow in the 2% to 3% range this quarter, which is a slight pickup. This also was off a lower comp in the prior year quarter, but probably also above market. And lastly, the Prosthetics business in the U.S. experienced a double-digit decline in the quarter where in the prior year, it was essentially flat and actually reflects probably unfavorable changes in dealer inventories this year compared to last year. Absent the changes in the dealer inventory, we believe the Prosthetics business would have been down probably, mid-single digits. Europe also showed growth in consumables and implants in the quarter, but not to the extent we've seen in the U.S, while lab was also negative in Europe. Just a reminder that Europe was still growing in the 3% to 4% range in the fourth quarter of last year. So this is a region where we're actually up against tougher comps in the prior year.At this point, it's evident to us that the U.S. market is likely to recover first and with the economic trends and the earliest stimulus that was applied in the U.S., we believe it will emerge and begin to grow earlier and perhaps faster than Europe, which, of course, enters the recession later and had less stimulus to exit the recession at this point.In the rest of world, category, as usual is a mixed bag. However, we saw particularly strong or improving growth in Latin America, Canada, Japan, and Australia. Overall, a positive trend seems to be developing in numerous regions. On the earnings side, we produced $0.50 per diluted share in the quarter on a GAAP reported basis and $0.48 on a non-GAAP basis or 6.7% improvement on a non-GAAP basis. And this was in fact, a record fourth quarter for the company on an earnings basis.Bill will speak more to the components, but at a high level, we did continue to experience gross margin contraction this quarter as we brought inventories down. However, I feel that we're probably getting closer to a point where we need to be on inventory, and I would now expect to production the quarter to return to match closer to demand levels and this should give us some relief from the cost absorption issues that we face for a couple of quarters and allow some sequential improvement in gross margins as we enter 2010.For the full year 2009, our net sales decreased slightly by 1.5%, that includes precious metals. Excluding precious metals, it was basically flat. It was down 1/10 of 1% versus the record revenue that we recorded in 2008. Internal growth was negative for the year at negative 2.2 in total and negative a 1.3 for our Dental business. While both these measures are probably the lowest we've seen in many years, we do think we weathered an extraordinary economic contraction and outperformed many other companies in and outside of the dental industry. Our acquisition growth for the year was 4.5%, which allowed us to report positive constant currency growth of 2.3% for the full year. Our currency translation was a big headwind for us in 2009. It reduced our sales by 2.4%, which in turn pulled our overall sales for the year to just slightly below the 2008 level. In 2010, we initially had expected some relief from currency. However, the dollar has strengthened really remarkably in the past 10 days such that if rates remain where they are today, we in fact would face a small headwind in 2010.Putting the full year in perspective, sales in 2009 were essentially flat with 2008 and earnings on a non-GAAP basis declined just 2.1% compared with our all-time record in sales and earnings in 2008. And this is despite what turned out to be a very deep recession and a very negative currency environment for us.One last comment on 2009, we did produce very strong cash flow in the year. It was up close to 8% for the full year. During the fourth quarter, we did step up our share repurchase program and expect to have additional activity in this area in 2010. As we said before, business development or acquisitions is our primary use for free cash flow, and we hope to see that be more active in 2010.  Early in the year, we have completed one small transaction and we've signed another that we expect to close here in the first quarter.  We entered 2010 with a very strong balance sheet and are well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities if they arise.Looking forward, the rate of any economic recovery, I guess, still remains uncertain and will likely develop at very different paces depending on the region. At this point, we feel the markets are gradually recovering in the U.S. with the possible exception of prosthetics, which we mentioned here this morning. And the markets in Europe are not consistently recovering at this point but very greatly by country. And the rest of the world category course is mixed.  I've asked Chris to speak more to the developing growth trends that we see in the market when he gets his prepared remarks in a few minutes.Our overall 2010, we do expect to have positive internal growth probably in the low single-digit range, given the outlook for economic growth and employment levels. In addition, currency at this point, looks like it could be a modest headwind for 2010 if rates remain where they are today. But for our own internal planning purposes, we're considering European currency rates to be comparable in 2010 to what we saw for the full year 2009, which would require the dollar to weaken just a bit from where it is today. Our earnings outlook is likewise influenced by the dramatic strengthening of the dollar in the last week to 10 days. Given the strengthening, we have moved our currency assumptions to be neutral with 2010, as I've mentioned, and also adjusted our internal outlook on earnings down by a few cents a share at both the high-end and the low-end of the range to reflect this change in the currency environment. Accordingly, we're initiating our earnings guidance at $1.90 to $2 per share for all of 2010. Again, this reflects our belief that the markets are beginning to improve, but on a gradual basis, that we will return to positive internal growth in 2010. And that European currencies will essentially be neutral with the dollar in 2010 compared to 2009. Now that concludes my prepared remarks. I'd like to now turn the call over to Chris Clark who will discuss market developments further."

As Bret mentioned, we're beginning to see some signs of stabilization or slight improvement in certain market segments and geographies. I'd like to take just a few moments to provide some additional perspective as to some of the trends that we are seeing. As we look at the various markets, it appears that consumable growth may be coming back the fastest. While we were helped by some favorable prior-year comparisons, our consumable business is showing some degree of gradual strengthening over the past two quarters, particularly in the U.S. The European consumable market appears to be less uniform, thus far, in its recovery. We do believe that conditions in the U.K., France, Italy and Germany as a whole are generally consistent with what we're seeing in the U.S. But Spain, CIS, including Russia and Eastern Europe continue to face very difficult market conditions due to particularly weak local economies, high unemployment levels and, in some cases, continued weak currencies. We did see some improvements in CIS in the quarter, as demand appears to have improved at this sequentially. One encouraging sign in the quarter as well on the consumable front was a solid improvement on our small equipment product lines, indicating that dentists may be feeling a little more confident and willing to invest a bit more proactively in these types of products. We do believe as a whole, we gained market share in the global consumables market during 2009.As Bret mentioned, our Specialties business continues to experience positive growth as a whole. And we believe that we are outperforming markets here as well. We don't see any significant change in the global demand for implants, which we believe are still down mid-single digits, although we continue to outpace the growth rate of most of our competitors and grew internally once again in the quarter. We're particularly gaining ground in the U.S. behind investments we've made to the U.S. Implant business over the last few years.We believe the global endodontic market to be down slightly, although this is probably an area that's somewhat less impacted by the economy, at least, so far as treatment of symptomatic cases.  On the orthodontics side, although we believe the global ortho market is probably flat at best, we continue to post positive internal growth. And for the year, we saw a stronger orthodontic market in Europe as opposed to the U.S., due largely to differences in reimbursement coverages.Regarding the Lab business, this area remains most negatively impacted by the economy. And as Bret mentioned, we're really not seeing any noticeable improvement in marketing conditions, thus far.  The Removable or Dentures segment of the Lab business continues to be more stable at an end-user demand level compared to the fixed segment of Crown and Bridge, which is facing particular pressure from lower cost clinical alternatives to the traditional solutions of precious metal frameworks or all-ceramic restorations. Unlike the consumable side, we don't see any appreciable improvement in the willingness of labs at this point to invest in equipment.From a geographic standpoint, I also wanted to briefly touch on two other areas, where we believe our performance continues to solidly outpace market growth. While the Australian dental market probably held ground better than most other developed markets in 2009, we're particularly pleased with our double-digit internal growth performance there. And we do believe that to be well above market growth. In Japan, while it's a slightly negative internal growth for the year, indications are that we outpaced market in Japan by at least five points, again, indicating that we should be making solid market share improvement. We're particularly encouraged by the Japanese performance in light of the significant decline of the private market in Japan, which includes most of the specialty businesses that have been accretive to our growth rate there for the last several years.I now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison, who will cover the financial results for the fourth quarter of 2009 in greater detail. Bill?"

Net",1634,"Thanks, Chris. Good morning, everyone. As Bret mentioned, net sales for the fourth quarter of 2009 increased by 11.9% and net sales, excluding precious metals content, increased 11.3% in the quarter with internal growth of positive 0.6% in the period. Net sales for the full year were $2.2 billion, a decrease of 1.5% over last year, while net sales ex precious metals were $2 billion. Ex are virtually flat for the year.  The 2009 geographic mix of sales without precious metal content was as follows. The U.S. represents 38% of sales, Europe was 41% this year and the rest of the world was 21% of sales. Gross margins for the fourth quarter were 54.7% of sales, ex precious metals, or a decrease of 3.3 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2008. Gross margins were negatively impacted this quarter by the roll off of the higher cost captured in our inventory last quarter. They were also negatively impacted by unfavorable mix in the period, especially of products within the product category and by unabsorbed overhead cost as inventories were brought down an additional seven days in the quarter compared to building them by six days in the fourth quarter of 2008. Although the lower volume, driven in part by our inventory reductions were a drag on margins in the latter half of 2009, we should see the cost structure begin to improve sequentially as we move into 2010 as production more closely matches sell through of our products.  Full-year gross margins were 55.8%, ex precious metals, compared to 57.8% last year. Negative product mix, FX and under-absorbed operating costs were the biggest contributors, offset somewhat by improved pricing in the year.SG&A expenses were $180 million or 34.6% of sales, ex precious metals in the fourth quarter of 2009 versus 37.2% in the fourth quarter of 2008. SG&A expenses continue to show improvement compared to last year, both for the quarter and also for the full year. These expenses were not only lower than those in last year's fourth quarter on a constant dollar basis despite acquisitions, but they were also lower when measured as a percent of sales.  Expenses continue to be tightly controlled in many areas as we work to not only bring down discretionary costs, but also to reduce various fixed expenses to maintain an appropriate balance, while at the same time, making some key investments to drive future growth.  Total year SG&A was $723.2 million or 36.3% of sales, ex precious metals in 2009 versus 37.1% in 2008.Operating margins were 18.2% including restructuring and other expenses in the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating margins were 19.9% on sales, ex precious metals in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 18.3% in the same period last year, including restructuring, impairments and other charges. Operating margins, ex precious metals, on a non-GAAP basis excluding restructuring, impairments and other charges in both periods were 20.1% for the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to 20.9% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Full-year operating margins were 19.1% on sales ex precious metals in 2009 and 19.1% in 2008. Operating margins on sales, ex precious metals on a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring, impairments and other charges were 19.7% in 2009 compared to 20.7% in 2008.Net interest and other expense in the fourth quarter was $4 million or $6.6 million lower than last year's fourth quarter. Interest expense was 0.2 million lower in the quarter than last year. And FX transaction losses and other expenses were 6.4 million lower in the quarter compared to the same period last year, as last year was negatively impacted by the volatility in foreign exchange rates in the period.  Net interest and other expense for the full year was $17.8 million or an expense reduction of $7.7 million for the year. Net interest expense was $16.8 million in 2009 compared to net interest expense of $15.4 million in 2008 or an increase of $1.4 million. Although interest expense was lower in 2009, the low interest rates on invested cash caused net interest expense to increase during the year. The impact of foreign exchange transaction losses and other items in 2009 was an expense of $1 million in 2009 versus an expense of $10.1 million in 2008 or an expense reduction of $9.1 million. This primarily related to the significant foreign exchange transaction losses that occurred in the back half of 2008.The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 23.5% compared to 5.9% in the fourth quarter of 2008. However, the operational tax rate in these periods were 26.9% in the fourth quarter of 2009 and 22% in the fourth quarter of 2008.  The 2009 full-year tax rate of 24.5% included an operational rate of 26.1% compared to 25.9% in 2008. You should note that while the FX transaction impact was favorable in the fourth quarter, the negative impact of our operational tax rate nearly offset this benefit in this period. To better understand and follow some of the following comments, you can look at the tables included in our recent press release, which reconciles performance from U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP to adjusted non-GAAP performance.Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $75 million or $0.50 per diluted share compared to $71 million or $0.47 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2008.  On an adjusted basis, earnings, excluding restructuring, impairments and other related items and tax adjustments in both periods, which constitute a non-GAAP measure, were $72.6 million or $0.48 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared to $67.8 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2008, an increase of 6.7% in diluted earnings per share.Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in 2009 for the full year was $274.4 million or $1.83 per diluted share. Net income for 2008 was $283.9 million or $1.87 per diluted share. Net income for comparability purposes on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the reconciling items in the press release for the years ending 2009 and 2008, were $275.7 million and $285.5 million, respectively. This represents earnings of $1.84 per diluted share for 2009 compared to $1.88 in 2008, a decrease of 2.1% for the year. In looking at our cash flow and some balance sheet related items, our operating cash flow was $117 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2009. Operating cash flows for the year were approximately $362 million compared to $336 million in 2008.  Capital expenditures were $56 million for the year with depreciation and amortization for the year totaling $65 million.Inventory days ended the year at 99 days for 2009 year-end versus 103 days last year or in 2008. In the first half of the year, inventories crept up. Production levels weren't cut back as quickly as the falloff in sales. However, in the last half of the year, inventory levels were reduced by 11 days as specific actions were taken to get inventories back in line. Receivable days ended 2009 at 55 days compared to 61 days at the end of the third quarter of 2009 and 54 days at the end of 2008. We were very pleased with the significant improvement we saw from both our collection efforts and the improved liquidity of our customers that they experienced in the fourth quarter. This, along with the further assessment of our bad debt reserve and specific receivable write offs, allowed us to have a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts in the period. We are hopeful that these improvements will continue as global liquidity continues to improve as we move through 2010.The balance sheet has strengthened even further during 2009 and end the year in very good shape. The year ended with $450 million in cash and short-term investments with total debt of $470 million at the end of 2009.DENTSPLY repurchased 2.5 million shares for $79 million in 2009. Based on the company's authorization to maintain up to 17 million shares of treasury stock, we still have approximately 1.2 million shares available for repurchase. We repurchased approximately 1.7 million shares in the fourth quarter and expect to continue to have some additional share repurchase in 2010. We continue to monitor both the market's liquidity and our investment needs in making these decisions.In looking at 2010, we believe currency translation impacts at current foreign exchange rates should have a slightly negative sales and earnings impact for the year. and the recent volatility in these markets make it even more difficult to predict. Our guidance is based on a slightly weaker dollar at levels closer to 2009's average exchange rates. We are also facing SG&A headwinds north of a 0.5% of sales as commission expenses, bonuses and customer rebate levels are reset to reflect a more normalized budget. We are anticipating some improvements in gross profit margins during the year, which will also help to offset some, if not more than offset, the SG&A headwinds.  Global economic markets are also beginning to show signs of improvement and we are hopeful that the improvement will continue. We believe as the global economies improve, the global dental market will also be able to return to positive growth once again in 2010. As Brett stated, our guidance for earnings in 2010 is in the range of $1.90 to $2 per diluted share. This excludes restructuring and other costs and income tax related adjustments. While we will be focused on sales growth and gross profit margin improvements for the year, we are also confident in our position in the market. And we will continue to make investments to support our business as well as for our future sales and earnings growth. That concludes our prepared remarks. And we'll be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time."

And that pulled product into Q3 last year and out of Q4 last year. So we created kind of a low base for Q4 last year. And the second issue was at the end of the third quarter last year, we warned that we were suffering an outage at our manufacturer, for dental anesthetics in U.S. had suffered a plant outage and that we'd be out of the market in the fourth quarter for anesthetics, and that in fact happened. So last year's internal growth rate for consumables, which is the categories affected by both of those items, was artificially low, and that causes the comparison this year to be artificially high. So we were trying to reconcile that down for you for purposes of understanding the mid-teens-type consumable growth for us this year. I think what I would add to that, and perhaps I should have that in our prepared remarks, was when we were exiting third quarter, we had told you that this same circumstance had caused third quarter's internal growth to be low by about half a point to one point. This is the 2009 growth. It has the counter-effect on Q4, meaning our worldwide growth was probably helped by half a point to a point because of these circumstances.

And some of those costs were hung up, that under absorption was hung up in inventory costs at the end of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we brought them down another seven days and none of those costs are hung up in inventory at the end of the fourth quarter. So in the fourth quarter, we took that absorption hit for both the inventory reduction in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, compared to building inventory in prior year. So I think that's the overview comment. Bill can give you more of the specifics."

What transpired was that the dollar, of course, had weakened pretty substantially against the euro and the Swiss franc, up until about three or four weeks ago. And then just in the last week, I mean, it's, kind of, since last Friday, the dollar dramatically strengthened against the euro in particular. And I would say, the comments in our prepared remarks were intended to let you know that if we would had issued our guidance let's say, two weeks ago, it would have been higher than what it is today, meaning, that dramatic change in the currency, particularly against the euro, but also to a lesser extent against the Swiss currency, drove us to lower our guidance a couple of cents on both the top end and the low end of the range. So I guess for people that have issued their own guidance before that, they wouldn't have had the opportunity to take that into account. And we're trying to send you a signal now that needs to be taken into account. We don't try to predict currencies in our own guidance. We said this year, we're assuming it's going to be neutral to European currencies against the U.S. currencies, neutral in '10 versus '09, which would require a slight weakening of the dollar, not a lot but just a little bit. But within our range of guidance, $1.90 to $2, of course, there's room in there for different levels of currency. There's room in there for different levels of internal growth. And as Bill said a moment ago, different levels of operating margin expansion. I'm going to let Bill now address how you should understand what a movement in the currency would mean to us on the bottom line, and then I think he wants to revisit the tax question."

It has a top line impact on us of about three percentage points, plus or minus, depending on the movement of the FX. And then at the bottom line, it's probably has an of about $0.01 a share, roughly, per quarter impact for us. Now again, that's based on if all currencies are moving in the same direction, which is generally not the case. Most recently, you've seen, obviously, moves with the yen strengthening against the dollar while some of the other currencies have actually weakened. Larry, just to also revisit one of your last questions, I was thinking you were still, actually, on working capital-related activities over the next few years. I think your question actually was on the tax rate. And if that's the case, we think that in 2010, we're still, as I mentioned to Jeff, we're still probably targeting a range that's similar to what we were in 2009. As you move beyond that, I think that a lot of it is still up in the year based on what both domestic tax-related issues and changes will be, especially as some of the things on the international-related income from what the Obama administration has at least discussed or identified. And then also what a number of other municipalities, both domestically as well as other international locations will in dealing with their funding-related needs. Based on all of that, I would expect that our tax rate would definitely, more than likely, increase once we get past 2010, depending on what those changes really are."

Of course in our major markets in the U.S., we haven't seen companies really cut back on dental insurance a whole lot. So the trend there is that if people lose their jobs, they lose their insurance, generally speaking. So I think there's a slight reduction in reimbursement in the U.S. In Europe, in the major countries in Europe, we've been pulling them. There's always a chance that you would see a reduction in reimbursement, particularly if it's government-supplied reimbursement. Although the countries under the most pressure in Europe are not really government-reimbursed. So at this point, we don't expect any changes in Europe. The one area where we do expect a change is Japan, which frankly, has some of the highest reimbursement rates in the world. And we've become accustomed to the Japanese lowering their reimbursement slightly every couple of years. And at this point, we think that they may be due for another reduction in reimbursement. Historically, they brought it down about 10 points when they do bring it down. This year, kind of, the signal from our business there and our reading of the tea leaves say it might be less than 10 but nevertheless, we probably expect a slight reduction in reimbursement in Japan."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter call.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter call.  This is Bret Wise, Chairman and CEO, and also with us today are Chris Clark, our President and COO, and Bill Jellison, our Senior Vice President and CFO.  Each of us will have some prepared remarks this morning and then following our prepared remarks we'll be glad to answer any questions you may have.  
Before we get started it's important to note that this call will include some forward looking statements and those are subject to risks and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, as well as our quarterly reports, press releases, and other filings.
The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise the forward looking statements, to reflect events or circumstance that may arise after the date of this call.  And as usual, a recording of this conference call in its entirety will be available on our website.  
This morning we announced our results for the first quarter 2010 and we're pleased to report a continued acceleration in growth, following what we believe was a bottoming of the dental markets mid last year.  As we expected and commented on in our year-end call, we expect 2010 to start slow, probably with a gradual recovery that varies widely by geographic region.  This frankly in fact is what we have seen, and although there are promising signs in certain geographies for product categories, it is apparent that we are still in the early stages of recovery of many of the dental markets.
It's important to keep in mind that the dental market is usually a bit of a trailing indicator both going into and also coming out of recessions as our market tends to lag the overall economy just a bit.
For the first quarter of 2010 our overall growth was 7.7% aided by internal growth and also benefiting from a weaker dollar on a year over year basis.  Sales without precious metal increased 6.8% and that was driven by internal growth of 2.5%, acquisition growth of 0.2%, and giving a constant currency growth of 2.7% and was also aided by currency which added 4.1% in the first quarter.
The internal growth by geography was 0.9% growth in the US, 2.4% growth in Europe, and 6.0% growth in the rest of the world category.  On a product category basis we continue to see some acceleration in the chairside consumables which grew mid single digits.  The specialty products as a category continued low single digit growth and that is consistent really with what we saw throughout 2009, and the lab category contracted low single digits.
The continued improvement in the chairside consumables I think is encouraging as we would expect those products that are used every day in the operatory really to be the first to recover and begin to grow.  This is an area of course where we had a favorable comparison last year, particularly outside the US with some dealer destocking in the base, however, despite that we view the growth this quarter as encouraging and reflective of early signs of more normal growth returning to this market, although slowly.
In the specialties I would say there's not a robust recovery at this point, however, as we stated before these are in some ways the most discretionary and most expensive procedures.  It's also important to realize that we had internal growth in this category in each quarter last year so for us we're not going up against an easy base period at this point.  Despite that, it's comforting to see that these products are continuing to grow, albeit slowly at this point.  
And although the prosthetics remain negative in the quarter, the degree of such was much less than we had seen in prior quarters, so perhaps this is an area that is also turning the corner or getting close to turning the corner at this point.  
Overall I would say that there's some reasonably good signs on many fronts in the dental market both on a geographic basis and a product category basis.  From an earnings perspective we saw gross margins improve sequentially by 200 basis points compared to the fourth quarter 2009.  You might recall from our year-end call that we had expected to see some sequential improvement in our margins and although we also commented that there would likely be some year over year declines remaining in the first quarter, and that was due to both a tough comparison coming out of the first quarter last year, some adverse currency impacts that will be affecting us this year, also lower plant absorption as we had much tighter controlled inventories in the first quarter of 2010 versus what happened in 2009.,
And that's essentially what happened.  We had a year over year decline in our margins of 40 basis points, but a sequential improvement in our gross margins over Q4 2009 of 200 basis points.  I think it's also important to note that at 56.7% gross margins in Q1 of 2010 we are starting out a full 90 basis points above the full year 2009 gross margins.
So overall on a GAAP basis earnings were essentially flat with the prior year in the first quarter of 2010 and on a non-GAAP basis at $0.44 a share, increased 2.3% over the first quarter of 2009.  In total I'd say we're starting out the year about as we had anticipated on a pure operating basis, although our currency assumptions were for a much stronger euro exchange rate at this point.
Also during the quarter we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares under our prior authorization, and as you probably saw, we announced earlier that our board of directors increased our authorization by 5 million shares in late March.  We did complete two small acquisitions in the quarter, both in Europe, and we signed LOIs on two other small transactions which we would expect to close in Q2 or Q3.  In addition, we continue to be active in discussion with other companies for collaborations or acquisitions and are hopeful that we can see some continued acceleration in this activity as we move forward.
Looking forward we are pleased to be off to a good start and still expect a gradual recovery throughout 2010.  We remain comfortable with our earlier guidance of low single digit internal growth for the full year.  From a total growth standpoint we have seen the euro continue to weaken and at current rates it would be as light negative in Q2 and would be much more of a headwind in Q3 and Q4 if those rates don't recover somewhat.  
We are confirming our earnings guidance at $1.90 to $2 per share for all of 2010, however this can also be influenced by the strength of the dollar.  For the full year, our guidance continues to be based on a euro of $1.39, and although there are still many variables to manage, a stronger dollar would tend to push us towards the lower end of that guidance and a weaker dollar would tend to push us towards the higher end of that guidance.
That concludes my prepared remarks.  I'd like to turn the call over now to Chris Clark who's going to give you an update on our new products and our innovation efforts.

Innovation",639,"Thank you, Bret, and good morning, everyone.  I'd like to take a few moments and give you some additional insights into some of our key innovation efforts as well as our recent global implant symposium that was held in Barcelona last night.  
Innovation continues to be a key growth platform for us.  Since the beginning of the year we've introduced nine new products.  Highlighting just a few of these this morning, in the prosthetics area we introduced the new Ceramco IC integrated ceramic system.  This is a fully integrated universal porcelain system that offers a complete range of aesthetic shapes and also improves strength.  This allows dental laboratories to replace the optical characteristics of natural dentition or natural teeth while reducing processing steps and minimizing their inventory investment.  Further, the Ceramco IC system can be fabricated across a wide range of platforms, helping our lab customers to stay competitive on all ceramic, porcelain fused metal, and also pressed on metal restorations.
In the endodontics area we introduced the new X-Smart Easy cordless endodontic handpiece for the US market.  This lightweight simple to use endodontic motor features a comfortable and well balanced cordless handpiece that has a slim head that can be adjusted to allow for an improved field of vision and also better access which are both critical features for dentists that are performing root canal procedures.
We also continued to gain momentum on new products that you introduced last year.  On previous calls I think I've mentioned our August 2009 introduction of the SureFil SDR posterior bulk built flowable composite.  This product allows for excellent cavity adaptation and also bolt placements up to 4 mm in depth, and results in up to 30% less placement time for the dentist.  Importantly, this unique chemistry employs a new stress-decreasing resin system that addresses one of the primary causes of procedural failure for composites, namely stress accumulation during (inaudible).  
In the US we've achieved more than $2.5 million in retail sales in the first eight months since we've introduced the product and we've achieved over $2 million in wholesale sales in Europe since we introduced the product there in January.  Globally, over 21,000 dentists have tried the product and over 11,000 of those are new customers to DENTSPLY in the category of dental composites.  Customer feedback has been just exceptionally positive and we're enjoying various positive reviews from the various product rating agencies as well.
Looking forward in the orthodontics area we've announced the upcoming introduction of our MTM or minor tooth movement clear aligner which is a minor tooth movement system that uses software and digital scanning technology to deliver a series of clear custom fit liners that progressively move teeth into the prescribed treatment plan position.  The system utilizes our internal aligner service center with dentists and orthodontists sending us an impression or a patient model from which we would then fabricate multiple aligners for that specific patient.  We will be showing the MTM clear aligner product at the upcoming American Association of Orthodontists Meeting that's this weekend in Washington, DC, and we'll begin shipments after we receive final regulatory clearance.
Finally I'd like to touch briefly on our global implant symposium that we held last month in Barcelona, Spain.  We were extremely pleased with this event.  As we had over 2,500 attendees from over 67 countries, the symposium included a comprehensive scientific program that was led by almost 100 international lecturers and discussed a wide range of implant topics.  It also provided us a very strong platform to showcase our range of implant products including the ankylose implant system which we continue to believe is one of the fastest growing implant lines globally.  
I'd like to now turn the call over to Bill Jellison, our Chief Financial Officer, to discuss the first quarter financial results in greater detail.

Net sales for the first quarter of 2010 increased by 7.7% in total and increased by 6.8% excluding precious metals.  The sales increase ex precious metals for the quarter included a constant currency increase of 2.7% which includes a 2.5% increase from internal growth and a 0.2% increase from acquisitions.  The quarter was also positively impacted 4.1% from foreign exchange translation as the dollar strengthened against most currencies -- weakened against most currencies from last year's first quarter.
The geographic mix of sales ex precious metals in the first quarter of 2010 included the US at 37.4%, Europe represented 42.7%, and the rest of world was 19.9% of sales.  Gross profit margins as a percent of sales ex precious metal content in the first quarter of 2010 were 56.7% compared to 57.1% for the first quarter of 2009.  The rate was negatively impacted in the quarter compared to the same period last year due to negative product mix within the product line, foreign exchange transactional impacts, and also lower plant cost absorption compared to the prior period when we had significant inventory build which was offset somewhat by price increases.  These negative impacts were partially offset by the higher roll off of acquisition inventory step-up costs in 2009.  Although margins were lower than in the first quarter last year, they improved two full percentage points sequentially as price mix, FX, and manufacturing cost all improved.
SG&A expenses were $188 million or 37.8% of sales ex previous metals in the first quarter of 2010 versus 38.2% in the prior year's first quarter, a 40 basis point improvement.  These expenses were lower as a percent of sales primarily due to reductions that were made during 2009, partially offset by additional investments made to strengthen our future growth prospects, as well as from the normal resetting of some of our variable costs such as commissions, rebates, and bonuses.  Of the $10 million increase in SG&A, $8 million is from the impact of FX movement and acquisitions.  
Operational margins for the quarter were 16.4% compared to 17% in the first quarter of last year, operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals were 18% compared to 18.5% last year in the same period.  Operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals for comparative purposes, excluding recent acquisition activities and restructuring and other costs in both periods, would have been 19% in the first quarter of 2010 and 19.4% in the first quarter of 2009.
Net interest and other expense in the first quarter was $5.9 compared to net interest and other expense of $5.1 million last year in the first quarter.  The increase in this area resulted primarily from higher net interest expense which reflects lower returns on our cash balances.  
The corporate tax rate in the quarter of approximately 26% is relatively consistent with the first quarter of 2009.  We expect this to be a reasonable assumption for an operational tax rate for 2010. 
Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International for the first quarter of 2010 was $61.8 million or $0.41 per diluted share compared to $0.41 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009.  Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in the first quarter on an adjusted non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring and other costs, recent acquisition related activities, and income tax related adjustments, was $65.5 million or $0.44 per diluted share in 2010 compared to $64.1 million or $0.43 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2009 which is a 2.3% improvement in EPS.
Cash flow from operating activities in the first quarter of 2010 was approximately $37 million compared to $11 million in the same period last year.  The cash flow in the first quarter of 2010 was higher last year due primarily to an increase in accrued liabilities and accounts payable associated with various variable cost categories and less inventory build in the first quarter of this year compared to last year.
Capital expenditures were $8 million in the first quarter with depreciation and amortization at $17.8 million in the period.  Inventory days were 103 at the end of the first quarter of 2010 compared to 115 at the end of the first quarter last year and 99 days at the end of 2009.  Receivable days were 59 days at the end of the first quarter in 2010 compared to 58 days at the end of the first quarter in 2009 and 55 days at the end of 2009.  We believe our accounts receivables remain in good shape and continue to be a focus of our team.
At the end of the first quarter of 2010 we had $405 million in cash and short term investment.  Total debt was $477 million at the end of the first quarter.  During the first quarter we have also repurchased $41 million or 1.2 million shares at an average price of approximately $33.59 per share.  Based on the company's recent increase in its authorization which allows us to maintain up to 22 million shares of Treasury stock, we still have approximately 5.5 million shares available for repurchase and would expect some continued repurchase activity this year.
Finally, as Bret noted, we are reconfirming our full year guidance for diluted earnings per share of $1.90 to $2, excluding the impact of restructuring and other cost, acquisition-related activities, and one-time adjustments.  
The mid range of this guidance is based on an average dollar rate compared to the euro of approximately $1.36 to $1.40 which is a stronger euro than exists today.
That concludes our prepared remarks.  Thanks for your support and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.

And as you know, different currencies move in different directions, but I think a broader based movement on currencies in the neighborhood of about a 5% level typically has about a top line impact on it of about 3% since 60% of our sales are overseas, and I think that in general again if you have movements consistently with currencies in those same ranges at 5%, that typically has about a 1%-2% impact on our bottom line on average.  
So hopefully that kind of gives you an idea.  If rates right now are roughly closer to 131 level in comparison to an upper mid kind of 30 level, I think that you're probably looking at maybe a 2, 2.5, maybe 3% on average if all currencies were all moving in that same magnitude that probably equates to maybe a penny a share per half a year.

It included some coverage for children up to a multiple of the welfare level, so that'd be children under age 21, and it also of course includes a provision that children up to age 26 now can stay on their parents' coverage.  So those two provisions could in fact result in some expanded procedures for dentistry, and I think because it's mainly children it's mainly preventive type procedures rather than heavy reconstructive type procedures.
On the other hand because we're a medical device company we're subject to the 2.3% excise tax on medical device sales and that's for Class 1, Class 2, and Class 3 medical devices.  And most of our products do fall under those categories.  So at this point we see benefit because of perhaps higher coverage for children or dependents up to age 26, and at least at this point we're subject to that excise tax and it's a question of how that will affect our pricing and so forth going forward.  I think that's not entirely clear year because the bill hasn't been available for that long and there's going to need to be some changes to the bill so we're going to have to closely track what happens to that bill before this gets implemented.

I mean, if your children need braces and you can straighten their teeth at age 14, you can also straighten them at age 17, so it is deferrable, and I think the market clearly has seen that.
Now in terms of the general orthodontic market, my sense is it will gradually come back as Bret mentioned.  It will be a gradual recovery.  In terms of the specific AO show my guess is you will see, obviously we hope some excitement on the MTM product.

Implant, ortho, and actually endo, all three of our specialties, had low single digit internal growth during the quarter.  Specifically with orthodontics our business was much stronger in Europe than it was in the United States.  With respect to implants it was the opposite.  Our business was strongest in the United States and weaker outside the United States.  On implant I think I would add that even though we had low single digit growth overall for the world, there were two regions or two countries that -- or two regions frankly, that depressed that number for us, which was CIS and South Korea.  And absent CIS and South Korea we would've been mid-single digit internal growth in implant.  So we're still seeing good uptake in that product line.  As Chris mentioned we had our large symposium in Barcelona in March and we had very strong attendance at that so that was encouraging.  And overall I think we see the implant market and the orthodontics market both probably experiencing kind of low single digit growth coming out of the recession here.  And again, those grew throughout 2009.
Europe was a little bit stronger than we thought it would be in the first quarter, frankly.  You are probably recalling what we said on the conference call at the end of the year.  We saw very strong growth in the consumable categories in Europe and I think that is encouraging to us because it is evidence that every dentistry is starting to pick up there, although with Europe in particular it is important that we say it varies widely by country because we have some countries where their economies are under significant distress right now and others that seem to be participating in the global recovery.

As it relates to the interest expense category, Jeff, there's a couple points associated with that.  One is the weakening of the euro since that's where all of our cash is.  Obviously the interest income is getting translated at a lower level.  You've also got the fact that the $250 million private placement that we completed, that was about 100 million higher than the one that fell off and keep in mind that that one's a fixed rate one which was replacing that neither variable debt and/or cash.  So that's probably on average three quarters of a million to maybe a million dollars a quarter in that number, plus we also had some of the repurchasing activity within that quarter as well.

Thank you for joining us on our second quarter earnings call. This is Bret Wise, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and also with us today are Chris Clark our President, Chief Operating Officer, and Bill Jellison our Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer. I’d like to begin today’s call with some overview comments on our results for the quarter, and also our view of the state of the global dental market. And I’ll then have Bill Jellison provide more details on the financial results. And following our comments, of course we’ll be all glad to answer any questions you may have. 
Before we get started it’s important to note that this conference call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. And these should be considered in conjunction with the risk factors and uncertainties described in the company’s most recent annual report on Form 10K, and our periodic reports on Form 10Q, our press releases and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. And as usual a recording of this conference call in its entirety will be available on our website. 
This morning we announced our results for the second quarter of 2010 and are pleased to report a continuation of the sequential improvement that we saw emerging, beginning in the third quarter last year, continuing with positive internal growth in the fourth quarter 2009, and now a slight acceleration of growth as we move through the first half of 2010. Overall our sales improved 2.2% in the quarter, and without precious metal content improved 1.5%. This growth was driven by 2.5% internal growth, consistent with what we saw in the first quarter, and acquisition growth of 0.3% giving us a constant currency growth of 2.8%. This allowed us to overcome a negative comparison from currency of a minus 1.3% and that was driven largely by the rapid devaluation of the euro against the dollar during the quarter. 
The 2.5% internal growth reflects potentially flat growth in the US, down 0.1%, 4.4% growth in Europe and 3.7% growth for the rest of world. US growth reflects a continuation of the low single digit growth we’ve experienced in the specialties in the aggregate, and that’s really consistent with what we saw in the first quarter, offset by slightly weaker sales in the lab products which we were down low single digits in the quarter. Our overall assessment of the US market really has not shown any meaningful improvement over what we saw in the first quarter. However, that should not be a surprise as we look the economic data and the fact that we are really experiencing a jobless recovery in the US. And of course we will know more about the overall market when the distributors report in the next few weeks. 
European growth remains strong at 4.4% in part by easier comparisons from the prior year, particularly in the CIS region, but also strong growth this quarter in our consumables, and in essentially all of our specialty categories. The remainder of the world had internal growth of 3.7% and that was driven mostly by strong performance in Asia, Latin America and Canada. A worldwide performance by product category was low single digit growth in consumables, lab was negative low single digits and the specialty category was positive mid-single digits. 
There is always much interest in our dental implant business which had internal growth in the 3% to 4% range, led by double-digit growth in the US and low single digit growth in Europe. We believe we continue to take share in global implant market driven by two very strong implant product platforms, and also the investments we have made in sales, marketing and R&D over the past several years. 
Our earnings on a non-GAAP basis came in at $0.50 per share; it’s a 2% improvement on stronger operating margins of 20.3% again on a non-GAAP basis which was a 20 basis point improvement over the prior year quarter. These are the strongest operating margins we have delivered since 2008 prior to the recession. Our earnings would have been much stronger on a currency neutral basis, however the rapid decline in the euro in particular, and strength of the yen combined to hurt earnings by a couple pennies a share in the second quarter. 
In addition, we continue to have very strong cash from the quarter, with operating cash flows year-to-date of $150 million, that’s up 30% from the prior year. Year-to-day we have completed four small acquisitions, two of which were in July and today we repurchased 5.4 million shares under our share authorization which was expanded in March. Our balance sheet remains in really in very good shape, we are producing very strong cash flows and improving results and we feel good about our prospects. 
We continue to make internal investments in growth, and have been particularly pleased with the performance of some of our new products which was launched over the last year. We feel we continue to gain momentum in the specialty product categories and have had some real positive signs from select new product launches in the consumable category. This tells us that dentists still welcome the opportunity to invest in their practices through new dental technologies, which we view as a good sign for the future. 
As noted in the release, our exposure to the euro will likely continue to have a negative impact on our results compared to what we expected when we entered the year. With the euro now below $1.30, which compares unfavorably to what was $1.43 in the third quarter last year, and $1.47 in the fourth quarter last year, our currency will likely continue to be a headwind for us over the next two quarters. Given this currency impact we are adjusting our earning’s guidance to a range of $1.86 to $1.94 on a fully diluted basis for all of 2010, and again that’s measured on a non GAAP basis. 
I’d like to now turn the call over to Bill Jellison who will discuss the financial results in more detail. Bill.

Net sales for the second quarter of 2010 increased by 2.2% in total an increase by 1.5% excluding precious metals. The sales increased ex-precious metals for the quarter, included a constant currency increase of 2.8% which included at 2.5% increase from internal growth and 0.3% increase from acquisitions. The quarter was also negatively impacted 1.3% from foreign exchange translation, largely due to the dollar strengthening against the euro compared to last year’s second quarter. The geographic mix of sales ex-precious metals in the second quarter of 2010 included the US at 38%, Europe represented 39% and the rest of the world was 23% of sales. We do not believe the channel inventory changes has any significant impact on the company-wide internal growth rates in the period, however we do believe the European growth was benefited by a rebound in the CIS markets this quarter. The stronger dollar in the second quarter, especially against the euro in the same period last year had a negative impact on earnings per share in the period of nearly $0.02 per share. Although the euro has shown some recent strength based on the current currency rates we believe we will continue to have a negative impact on both, sales and earnings in the back half of the year.
Gross profit margins as a percentage of sales ex-precious metal content in the second quarter of 2010 were 55.4% compared to 55.8% for the second quarter of 2009. When compared to the same period last year, we were negatively impacted by product mix, which was partially offset by improved pricing. We did benefit from some positive manufacturing and purchase price variances, however many of those were not fully reflected in the second quarter, but they will have some benefit on the margin rates in the back half of the year. 
SG&A expenses were $182.4 million or 35.1% of sales ex-precious metals in the second quarter of 2010, versus 35.9% in the prior years second quarter. These expenses were not only lower than those in the last years second quarter on a dollar basis, but they were also lower when measured as a percent of sales. We are currently benefiting from some of the expense reductions we put in place last year. Importantly, some of the benefits of our expense focus continue to be reinvested in areas we believe can help support future growth opportunities. 
Operational margins for the quarter were 18.6% compared to 17.9% in the second quarter of last year. Our operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals were 20.2% compared to 19.3% last year in the same period. And operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals for comparative purposes, excluding acquisition related activities, and restructuring and other costs in both periods would have been 20.3% in the second quarter of 2010 and 20.1% in 2009. 
As we move into the back half of the year, we expect favorable improvements in our gross profit margin rates compared to last year, as we achieved better absorption of costs, reflect improved pricing and benefit from a slightly more favorable mix. However, we also believe SG&A expenses will run higher in the back half of the year as a percentage of sales as many of our cost improvements were already in place in the back half of last year, and we have continued to invest in key growth opportunities. 
Net interest and other expense in the second quarter was $6.6 million compared to $3.7 million last year in the second quarter. The increased expense in this area of $2.9 million was primarily the result of a non-cash interest charge of $1.2 million, resulting from a credit risk adjustment on the outstanding derivatives which we highlighted as an adjustment for our non GAAP earnings per share, and a foreign exchange transaction loss of $1.4 million versus a slight gain of $0.2 million in the same quarter last year. We were also negatively impacted by lower interest income on our cash balances as rates have decreased, since last year. 
The corporate tax rate in the second quarter of 2009 and 2010 was approximately 25.5%, and we believe this is also a reasonable rate to assume for the remainder of this year. Net income attributable to DENTSPLY International in the second quarter of 2010 was $72.4 million or $0.49 per diluted share compared to $70.2 million or $0.47 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2009. Our net income attributable to DENTSPLY on an adjusted non GAAP basis, excluding acquisition related costs, restructuring and other costs, a credit risk adjustment to outstanding derivatives and income tax related adjustments was $73.9 million or $0.50 per diluted share in 2010 compared to $73.1 million or $0.49 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2009. 
Cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter was $113 million compared to $105 million in the prior year quarter, and in the first half of 2010 it was approximately $150 million compared to $115 million in the same period last year. Capital expenditures were $19 million in the first half of the year, with depreciation and amortization at about $34 million in the first half. Capital expenditures right now are currently expected to be in the range of about $50 million to $60 million for the entire year. 
Inventory days were 100 at the end of the second quarter of 2010 compared to 103 days at the end of the first quarter, and 110 days at the end of the same period last year. We do expect some additional improvement in inventories by the end of year, but most of that should occur in the forth quarter. Accounts receivable days were 57 days at the end of the second quarter of 2010 compared to 59 days at the end of the first quarter, and 57 days at the end of the second quarter in 2009. We believe our accounts receivable are in good shape and they remain a key focus for our entire team. 
At the end of the second quarter of 2010 we had $340 million in cash in short-term investments; total debt was $475 million at the end of the second quarter as well. Year-to-date we have repurchased approximately $185 million of our stock or approximately 5.4 million shares at an average price of approximately $34. Based on the company’s authorization [demand] up to 22 million shares of treasury stock, we now have approximately 2 million shares still available for repurchase. 
Finally, due to the strengthening of the dollar against most currencies, and with the dollar at approximately $130 to the euro, we expect a top line headwind in the back half of the year of approximately 3% to 5%. As we look at our results year-to-date, our current business outlook and recent foreign exchange movements we are adjusting our 2010 full year earnings per diluted share guidance to $1.86 to $1.94 on a non GAAP basis, excluding restructuring and other costs, our recent acquisition related activities and income tax related adjustment. 
That concludes our prepared remarks and thanks for your support and we’d be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.

Specific to the MTM, I mean we did have a discussion on new the product with dentists and had filed F10-K on the product, and at this point are waiting for approval with FDA.

We’ve had less success in the rest of the world categories; particularly in Korea which is a market we think is contracting pretty rapidly. 
It's a little bit difficult for us to comment on the overall market implants because we are awaiting the reports of the two largest implant players that will come in the next two or three weeks. And that will give us more insights into what's happening in the market, but with respect to our performance, we are very pleased with that. With respect to orthodontics, we had low single digit growth and appeared to be executing well there as well. I think that's probably a pretty tough market because I think orthodontics stocks are probably not up in 2009 or 2010. And we continue to grow in that category and we are happy with that.

Each of us will have some prepared statements to make this morning and then of course after our remarks we will be glad to answer any questions you may have.
Before we get started, it's important to note that this conference call may include forward-looking statements involving risks and uncertainties. These should be considered in conjunction with our disclosures of the risk factors and uncertainties in our 10-K and our quarterly and periodic reports with the SEC.
The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this call. And as usual, a recording of this conference call and its entirety will be available on our website.
This morning we are pleased to announce our results for the third quarter of 2010 with revenues up 2% on a reported basis and positive 0.1% on a non-GAAP basis and that's excluding precious metal content.
We continue to see the dental consumable market is stable overall with improvements occurring in international markets and the U.S. market needed by weak or non-existed job growth at this point.
As mentioned our sales ex-precious metals were essentially flat up 0.1%. This was driven by 2.0% internal growth, 0.4% acquisition growth to yield constant currency growth of 2.4 and this was essentially offset by negative currency translation of 2.3% to arrive at that overall growth number of 0.1% ex-precious metal.
On a regional basis internal growth was down 0.8% in the U.S., was positive 4.5% in Europe and was positive 2.7% for the rest of world. Our U.S. growth was aided by continued positive growth in our specialty categories dental implants in particular and through chairside consumables, but was hurt by lower small equipment sales, also a very tough comp from last year when we are running heavy end-user promotions on certain of our small equipment products.
In the U.S. we are essentially flat on internal growth for the first nine months of the year and our overall assessment in the U.S. market has not shown any meaningful improvement over what we saw in first half of the year.
However, I think that should not be a surprise to anyone at this point as we look at the economic data and the job list recovery resulting in slow growth or no growth, perhaps of offices at this point.
European growth running strong at 4.5%, that's helped in part by an easier comparison from the prior year particularly in the CIS region, but also from stronger and all of our specialty categories and in chairside consumables while lab products continue to represent a headwind on our European growth in the quarter.
Year-to-date internal growth in Europe is 3.7%; the reminder of the world had internal growth of 2.7 for the quarter and is 4.0% year-to-date. And we see generally positive development in most of the regions that we have in that category.
As usual we did amount for implemented price increases on October 1 in most of our consumable products, given very low interest rates on cash holdings, we believe there are may have been a bit more purchasing ahead of the price increases this year which we would expect to wash up the fourth quarter.
From our perspective this makes sense as liquidity is certainly better than it was a year ago at this time and the dealers can easily make an extra one to two percentage points in 30 to 60 days by increasing their inventory ahead of the price increases. And that can be significant to the yield for their business models.
Our earnings non-GAAP came in at $0.45, it was $0.44 on a GAAP basis, $0.45 on a non-GAAP basis and that was a 2.3% improvement over the prior year quarter again on a non-GAAP basis. This is basically consistent with the trend we've experienced in the first half of the year, although, we are now coming up against slightly tougher comps both in the third quarter and again in the fourth quarter.
Earnings continue to be hurt by currency translation and transaction effects. Despite that we saw higher gross margins in the quarter that were essentially offset by higher SG&A spending as the investments we've gained to implement beginning this year are now fully in place. And the prior year base spending was very low in both the third and fourth quarters of last year.
We would expect this trend to continue for the fourth quarter with improving gross margins and with higher spending in event of product releases in 2011; and also as compared to what was a very low base for SG&A expense in the fourth quarter of last year.
Our cash flows continue to be strong and our priorities for cash deployment remain the same with acquisitions being our top priority. Activity in this area has picked up with execution and timing risk of course remaining very high. Year-to-date we've closed four transactions and signed a fifth which is contributing a bit to constant currency growth at this point.
Our second priority is share repurchases where we acquired 6.2 million shares for $209 million year-to-date, completing roughly 80% of the share repurchase authorization we announced earlier in the year. Our product pipeline looks good for 2011 including what could be major initiatives in several product categories, hopefully, early in the year. And that obviously is what's driving the higher spending a bit in the third quarter and in fourth quarters we prepare for those.
For the full year outlook, our exposure in euro will likely continue to have a negative effect on our results in the fourth quarter, although the impact maybe less than what we saw in Q2 and Q3. At current rate the euro was down about 6% from the average rate that we saw in Q4 last year.
The strength of the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen will continue to have a negative impact on our cost to goods sold as these are major production or product sourcing regions for us. Given the current currency rates and the continued lag in the U.S. economy and the dental market we are nearing our earnings guidance and now expect full year results to be in the $1.86 to $1.91 range and again as measured on a non-GAAP basis.
I'd like to now turn the call over to Chris Clark, who's going to speak more about our new product pipeline and the performance of our specialty businesses. Chris?

I'd like to take the next few minutes and supply some additional perspective about couple of the new products we've introduced recently. As well as more details of our performance in the specialty areas in general and in the implants in particular.
On the new product front, innovation continues to be a corner stone strategy for us. We are pleased with the performance of some of the key new products that we've introduced a few quarters ago that continue to gain significant market traction. These include the SureFil SDR, Bulk Fill Flowable composite which is gained over 35,000 new users at this point since introduction just over a year ago in the U.S. and earlier this year in Europe.
We're particularly pleased with the repurchase rate on this product as I'd indicated strong customer acceptance in addition to the strong trial levels. We are also very pleased and continue to be pleased with the ProFile Vortex nickel titanium rotary files. These continue to gain competitive endodontic users in U.S. for us and we continue to be pleased with the performance of that product.
We are also pleased with the Ceramco iC porcelain systems. These continue to be well received by laboratory technicians really for the versatility as well as for the beautiful aesthetics they create.
In the last few months we've also introduced several new innovations in the market including the SmartLite Max LED curing light. This offers dual wavelength technology and provides a wide range of versatility and confidence maturing all different types of restorative materials.
Also on the restorative side, we introduced Xeno V plus. This is our latest one component self etch adhesive and offers long working time, very short curing time, excellent bonding performance and clinical reliability.
In the prosthetic area, we continue to expand our Compartis centralized manufacturing platform and we are now offering fabrication of precious metal substructures in the Europe and the U.S. and also in Japan.
We've also added new scanning option that provides broader appeal to our Compartis platform. And as Bret mentioned, looking ahead, we are pleased with our innovation pipeline and we are looking forward to new product launches across several of our businesses early next year. And at this point we are spending again some of those opportunities now.
Now I'd like to provide some additional insights into our performance in the specialties area in general and specifically into implant performance. Specialties continue to be a strong growth platform in aggregate for us with third quarter and year-to-date internal growth both in the mid single-digit range.
All three of our specialty areas implants, endodontics and orthodontics have had positive internal growth for each of the three quarters in 2010 and we believe we continue to gain market share in this area as a whole.
Now looking specifically at implants, our third quarter performance was encouraging. Internal growth for the quarter was solidly in the mid single-digit range and continued a sequential strengthening of our growth rate throughout the year.
Now this is an area where we continue to invest on several fronts including internally and also the acquisition and we have completed one small implant related acquisition earlier this year, and recently signed another. Importantly we believe that, this global performance continues to indicate that we are gaining market share in implants.
We believe our strong implant performance is really due to a number of factors, these include our two well excepted global implant systems, XiVE with its wide range of restorative options and also enclosed with its bone level design and tissue care positioning. Also, the strong key opinion leader support we have in all the 20 years of clinical evidence.
The additional restorative versatility of the Ankylos C/X Abutment connection that we introduced last year. Our expanded implant prosthetics positioning which includes the ISUS custom milled implant bars and bridges in healthcare. And finally, a fact that we've invested in the periods over the last several quarters with were some of our key competitors have cut back.
We continue to believe that our implant business with Ankylos and XiVE is going faster than market as we continue to gain customers in many of the key markets around the world.
Geographically on implants our term growth in the U.S. implant market is double-digits through September on a well above market growth. We are pleased with our progress in generating new implant specialist customers in the U.S. in particular as they were responding favorably to our increased focus in the enclosed tissue care message.
Our growth in Europe is in the mid single-digit range for the quarter and we believe our performance in many geographies including the core German market continues to outpace market growth.
You might recall that we spoke of our global implant symposium on our first quarter call that event which was held in March in Barcelona has helped to continue our considerable momentum on this business and many countries in Europe including Germany.
Looking forward we are continuing to make investments to continue the momentum on this business. I look forward to sharing the results, some of the initiatives with you on future call.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Bill Jellison, who will cover the financial results of quarter in greater detail.

27504,114548545,82908,"DENTSPLY International Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone. Net sales for the third quarter of 2010 increased by 2% in total and increased by 0.1% excluding precious metals. The sales increased ex-precious metals for the quarter included a constant currency increase of 2.4% which includes a",991,"Good morning, everyone. Net sales for the third quarter of 2010 increased by 2% in total and increased by 0.1% excluding precious metals. The sales increased ex-precious metals for the quarter included a constant currency increase of 2.4% which includes a 2% increase from internal growth and a 0.4% increase from acquisitions.
The quarter was also negatively impacted by 2.3% from foreign exchange translations. The geographic mix of sales of ex-precious metals in the third quarter of 2010 included the U.S. at 40%, Europe represented 37% and the rest of the world was 23% of our sales. Our internal growth in the quarter also benefited by a slightly higher buy and ahead of our price increases, strong performance from our specialty businesses and improvement in our non-dental business.
But sales were negatively impacted by soft equipment sales which had a tougher comparison against some equipment promos which benefited the third quarter of last year and a decline in our lab business. Currency rates not only had a negative impact on sales in the quarter but also negatively impacted earnings by just over a penny per share as the dollar was generally stronger compared to last year.
The yen continued to be strong and the Swiss franc strengthened against the euro. Based on current currency rates foreign exchange is expected to still have a slight negative impact in the fourth quarter as the Swiss and the yen continue to be strong and the euro is weaker than last year in the fourth quarter despite its recent strengthening compared to earlier this year.
Gross profit margins as a percentage of sales ex-precious metals content in the third quarter of 2010, were 55.2% compared to 55% for the third quarter of 2009. The rate was slightly higher than last year as the benefits from price increases and improved operational leverage were offsetting the negative impacts of both foreign exchange, product mix and the effect of acquisitions in the quarter.
We expect the gross margins will again expand in the fourth quarter due to continued operating improvements particularly compared to the prior year when we were liquidating substantial inventories.
SG&A expenses were $182.1 million or 36.8% of sales of ex-precious metals in the third quarter of 2010 versus 36% in the third quarter of 2009. These expenses increased as a percentage of sales as we are running against lower levels that occurred in the back half of 2009 when our cost reductions were fully implemented and more importantly the investments we discussed at the beginning of the year, are now fully in place and should benefit us as we enter 2011.
We believe the fourth quarter will be our toughest comp in this category as we benefited from our lowest expense level as a percent of sales in the fourth quarter of last year. And the investments we see coming through in the third quarter will also be present in the fourth quarter.
Operational margins for the quarter were 16.7% compared to 17.5% in the third quarter of last year. Operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals were 18.3% compared to 18.8% last year in the same period. Operating margins based on sales excluding precious metals for comparative purposes excluding recent acquisition, related activities and restructuring and other costs in both periods would have been 18.7% in the third quarter of 2010 and 19.1% in 2009.
Net interest and other expenses in the third quarter was $5.3 million compared to 5.1 million last year in the third quarter. But net interest was aided by higher cash balances although return rates remain very low on those balances. Offsetting this was higher interest expense on over $200 million of share repurchases thus far this year. The corporate tax rate in the quarter was approximately 25% and we expect a tax rate of 25 to 26% to be a reasonable assumption for an operational tax rate for all of 2010.
Net income attributable to DENTSPLY in the third quarter of 2010 with $63.1 million or $0.44 per diluted share compared to $67.5 million or $0.45 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009. Net income attributable to DENTSPLY on an adjusted non-GAAP basis excluding acquisition related costs, restructuring in other costs and income tax related adjustments was $64.9 million or $0.45 per diluted share in 2010, compared to $65.9 million or $0.44 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2009, a 2.3% improvement.
Cash flow from operating activities for the first nine months of 2010 was up slightly at $249 million. Capital expenditures were $30 million in the first nine months of the year with depreciation and amortization at $50 million in the first nine month.
Inventory days were 103 at the end of the third quarter of 2010, a slight increase since year end but a slight reduction from 106 days in the third quarter of last year. Accounts receivable days were 59 days at the end of the third quarter of 2010 compared to 61 days at the end of the third quarter in 2009 and 55 days at the end of the year.
At the end of the third quarter of 2010 we had $534 million in cash and short term investments, total debt was 600 million at the end of the third quarter's fall. Year-to-date we have repurchased approximately $209 million of our stock or approximately 6.2 million shares at an average price of roughly $33.
Based on the company's authorization to maintain up to 22 million shares of treasury stock, we now have approximately 1.3 million shares available for repurchase. Finally, as Bret noted our 2010 full year earnings per diluted share guidance is now 186 to 191 on a non-GAAP basis excluding restructuring and other costs, recent acquisition related activities and income tax related adjustments.
That concludes our prepared remarks. Thanks for your support and we'll be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.

Did I interpret your commentary, that it seems like you're getting a little more active on M&A or the pipeline is picking up here and do you think we are kind of trending back towards that level versus it's been less than 100 basis points top-line contribution for a while now?

What you are seeing now is the consequence that we had for that one year. Your other comments about us hoping that we can transact more is true, we are very active in looking at transactions and we hate to predict where it will be in the short-term because transaction risk is always very high but when you look at our balance sheet with over $500 million in cash, very strong balance sheet, good cash flow our target is to redeploy that in growing the company through acquisitions and our target is around 4% growth per year on average from acquisition. So this year is a little bit lower than normal and last year at 4.5% was normal or maybe just a little bit above normal.

At this point in time, we obviously don't know what's going to be changing on the U.S. front. That's going to be a major driver. We hope that some of those things don't go into place but at this point in time, it's still little bit too early to tell what kind of changes are going to take place there. As we know more facts associated with what different government bodies are doing from a tax positioning perspective that will get us into more reviews associated with how to make sure that we are doing kind of the best tax planning that we can around those areas.

And thus, we don't see that much growth here. So, that's not a political statement or prediction to what's going to happen to tax rate but I think there's a lot of uncertainty as what's going to happen particularly with the U.S. rates going into next year or next two years.
