As stated in our earnings release today, our fourth quarter and annual results for the current and prior periods now reflect the reclassification of Ruehl into discontinued operations. The guidance we gave on our third quarter earnings call was prior to reflecting discontinued operations accounting for Ruehl and where significant, we have indicated the effects of this in our commentary on the quarter.

Thank you for joining us. We've been through a difficult year but we firmly believe it was a year in which we laid the foundations for future success. As we look back to a year ago, when we spoke to you regarding our objectives for",533,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We've been through a difficult year but we firmly believe it was a year in which we laid the foundations for future success. As we look back to a year ago, when we spoke to you regarding our objectives for 2009, we laid out what we were committed to protecting the brands, improving our product assortment and not sacrificing quality. We said we would preserve cash, seek expense-saving opportunities and efficiencies in the business, and continue to invest in our international expansion. All of which, we believe, we have done in a very difficult environment. We continue to be very encouraged by our international rollout and Jonathan will provide more color on our 2010 plans in a moment. Today, I feel more positive about our domestic business than I have for a long time. Why? First, because I feel good about our Male business and I think we are on the right track with the Female business. Our Male business has a clear identity, it's performing well and has outpaced the Women's business over the last year or so. The Female business is making progress. We are moving in the right direction for spring and will continue into summer in back-to-school. I encourage you to go to the stores and look at the assortment. You will see a healthy balance of basic and fashion products, exciting and improved fashion styles, along with increased variety. Personally, I am more involved in the women's product, and I'm approaching this challenge with renewed energy and enthusiasm for improving this side of the business.In addition, while we have never, and do not ever plan to be a promotionally-led business, we are getting better at figuring out something that was completely alien to us 18 months ago. We believe that AURs will need to continue to go lower in the spring, but we also know that how we deliver that lower AUR is very important, both in terms of its effectiveness and in terms of protecting the brands. And this must be done without sacrificing quality. We have some exciting social media and marketing initiatives in the pipeline that I believe will help our business. We are actively seeking new ways to effectively engage our customers through these medium. Having recently launched on Facebook, Abercrombie & Fitch has already 775,000 fans; Hollister, over 340,000 fans. We recently released an iPhone application and continue to invest in our mobile commerce platform. For the future, we are investing in some new initiatives that we believe will provide a significant boost to our direct-to-consumer business and beyond. Finally, everything we see tells us that our brands retain the aspirational nature they have always had. The importance of this cannot be underestimated. Our brands and everything they represent, aspiration, premium quality, exceptional store experience, are allowing us the opportunity to expand internationally. During the fourth quarter, we opened our first Abercrombie & Fitch flagship in Asia and an additional five Hollister mall-based stores in Europe. International expansion is firmly in our grasp and as I've said before, it is the future of our brands.  With that, I will hand the call over to Jonathan."

I want to start by walking through the highlights of our fourth quarter results, and will then give some color on how we're thinking about 2010 and beyond. For the fourth quarter, the company's net sales decreased 5% to $936 million, while comp store sales decreased 13%. On a two-year basis, our same-store sales for the quarter were slightly below the trend for the prior nine months. Within the quarter, November and December were weaker, with January being stronger. This is partly due to the gift card event, but also reflected the effect of the winter sale and clearance event during the month of January. The purpose of the gift card event was to offer a brand appropriate promotion in the pre-Christmas period and give us additional firepower in the post-Christmas period, when our customer typically expects us to offer season-ending reductions.  This was essentially how it played out, although the underlying sales trend was weaker than we had anticipated in the pre-Christmas period. Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 63.5%, down 110 basis points and within the guidance range given at the beginning of the quarter. The erosion of gross margin was due to lower AURs for the quarter, which were greater than the corresponding reduction in average-unit cost. In addition, gross margin for the quarter was affected by unplanned markdowns from spring product that would now either go straight to clearance or outlet stores. MG&A for the quarter was down 5% on a like-for-like basis, excluding Ruehl. Within MG&A, we accrued incentive compensation for eligible associates below the [indiscernible] level. MG&A for the quarter also included equity compensation of $8.4 million, as compared to $8.5 million last year. Store occupancy costs for the quarter, excluding  a store-related impairment charge of $33.2 million were approximately $159 million, slightly above the comparable third quarter figure of $158 million, excluding Ruehl. The 99 stores affected by the impairment charge are comprised of 34 A&F, 46 Kids, and 19 Hollister stores. I will come back to this year's [ph] underperforming stores in a few moments. All other stores and distribution costs were approximately $222 million or 23.7% of sales, consistent with our guidance at the beginning of the quarter that these costs would be modestly higher than the percentage of sales they represented last year, which was 23.2%, excluding Ruehl.Net income from continuing operations for the quarter was $61 million, or $0.68 per diluted share. Excluding non-cash asset impairment charges in discontinued operations, non-GAAP net income for the quarter is $94.2 million or $0.91 per diluted share. The closure of Ruehl was completed by the end of the quarter and we have incurred aggregate net pretax exit costs, with a net present value of approximately $56 million, down from the prior estimate of $60 million, of which $22.4 million was incurred in the fourth quarter. Of the original 29 Ruehl stores, we have terminated leases on 25 of the stores, three stores will be rebranded and in one case, we have not reached an agreement with the landlord but have accrued an estimated charge.The loss from discontinued operations for the quarter of $0.15, essentially all relates to Ruehl exit cost of $22.4 million, with the Ruehl business having operated at break even for the quarter, excluding those costs. During the quarter, we opened one A&F flagship in Tokyo and five Hollister mall-based stores in Europe. To provide some color on our international results, total international sales, including direct-to-consumer were approximately $143 million for the fourth quarter, and approximately $363 million on a year-to-date basis. Our international store sales were approximately $107 million for the quarter and approximately $256 million on a year-to-date basis. We now have three international flagship locations in addition to the A&F and Hollister Epic flagships in New York. The Fifth Avenue flagship remains our most productive store with annualized volume above $100 million. The three international flagship locations currently have annualized volumes of around $200 million in aggregate, although, it remains very early for us to project an accurate annualized volume. We now have 10 Hollister stores opened in the U.K., as well as one in Germany and one in Italy. The U.K. stores are annualizing at average volumes approximately six times our average domestic store at current exchange rates. The additional malls we added in the U.K. as we build towards our objective of 30 stores are likely to be less productive, on average, in the malls we are in currently. On the other hand, the three U.K. Hollister stores that have been opened for over a year have comped positively in aggregate, since becoming part of the comp base.In addition, across all of the Hollister stores we currently have opened in Europe, while not every individual store is above our initial expectations, an aggregate, that is the case. In 2010, we remain on track to open our Hollister Epic the flagship in the Fifth Avenue and A&F flagships in Fukuoka or Copenhagen.  In addition to Paris in 2011, we have several other flagship opportunities under consideration and we'll confirm details of these as leases are executed. Going forward, flagship openings are likely to be a combination of the original flagship model and the small store format, similar to the template we are using in Copenhagen.  With regard to international mall-based locations for Hollister, we currently expect to open approximately 30 stores in 2010 including in two more new countries. These openings will be predominantly in the third and particularly the fourth quarters. As we commit to new Hollister international openings, we continue to target four-wall margins of 30% or more. This excludes non-four wall costs, including DC costs and regional and district management costs. In addition, there are certain fixed costs on a per-country basis, as we get up and running in each country, as well as store-level preopening rent and other costs. We typically start to incur our costs approximately 18 months ahead of opening in a particular country.Based on all of the above, in broad terms for 2010, we expect that close to 20% of the incremental sales we add through international store openings will flow through to operating income. Turning back to the Domestic business, we expect to open two Gilly Hicks stores, three Hollister stores, and one A&F mall store in 2010, in addition to a number of outlets. Based on the above store openings, we expect total capital expenditures for 2010 to be approximately $250 million to $260 million, including $215 million to $225 million related to new stores, stores refreshes and remodels, and approximately $35 million related to IT, DC and other home office projects. Based on the store opening plans, quarterly store occupancy cost will continue to increase modestly on a sequential basis during the year, with some greater increases in the latter half of the year.With regard to store closings, on a rolling 12-month basis as of January 30, we had approximately 230 A&F, Kids and Hollister stores, with negative four-wall contribution. The total four-wall negative contribution from these stores was approximately $36 million in 2009. These figures exclude non-four wall costs such as variable DC costs and regional and district management costs, some potential transfer of sales to others stores upon closure.The negative contribution stores are skewed toward A&F and Kids stores are heavily concentrated in C malls [ph] and approaching half of the stores have leases expiring before the end of 2012. Our plan is to address these stores though a combination of natural lease expirations, rent relief and early closures for stores, where we do see a realistic likelihood that they will return to profitability. In terms of our overall guidance for 2010 and beyond, as we have said in the past, we fully expect 2009 to be the trough year from a margin and EPS standpoint. Going forward, our intent remains to drive our margins back towards historic levels and we believe this will require a combination of the following factors. First, returning gross margins to historic levels. We expect to make some progress on this for 2010 as a whole. For the spring, we will have year-over-year, like-for-like reductions in average unit cost of close to 10%. However, from a gross margin standpoint, we expect that AURs will continue to come down in the spring, in addition to which certain other gross margin items such as airfreight, are running higher than a year ago. On that basis, we may incur some modest erosion in gross margin for the spring. Second, as we've said in the past, we will need to achieve improvements in domestic productivity levels. To the extent not addressed through increase productivity, closure of negative contribution stores will also contribute to margin improvement. Third, we need to continue to achieve significantly profitable international growth. In that regard, we are planning for the accelerated pace of international openings in 2010 to continue and potentially accelerate further beyond that. Next, we expect that bringing Gilly Hicks to break even or beyond over time will contribute to operating margin improvement. We have a roadmap for Gilly Hicks stretching out over the next few years. For 2010 and 2011, that road map requires us to hold close to the current store count, while achieving aggressive goals for increased productivity. Assuming we can achieve those goals, and are on track with our IMU goals, we would expect to begin a ramp up of the store base in 2012.Lastly, we need to keep our expenses under tight control. For variable stores and distribution expenses, we will continue to seek greater efficiencies, as we have done over the past 18 months and we have identified some new initiatives that we will be putting in place in the coming months. In terms of home office expenses, which make up most of MG&A, we do not anticipate further structural reductions. Rather, our objective will be to hold increases in MG&A to modest levels and to fund incremental needs for international through offsetting efficiencies. For the spring season, we expect MG&A to increase somewhat against the comparable amount for 2009, excluding Ruehl. This includes the effect of the forward [ph] incentive comp accruals, increased IT-related depreciation and marketing expenses. Equity and incentive compensation is an area where charges may escalate quite significantly overtime and the expenses difficult to project. We will continue to report the actual charges quarter-by-quarter.  Based on all of the above factors, we believe that an operating margin objective from the range of 15% or better in 2012 is realistic. Finally, turning to the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with $680 million in cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under our credit agreement of $51 million and outstanding letters of credit of $50 million. We are very comfortable with our liquidity position going forward. But, at the same time, we'll continue to take a conservative approach to managing cash.  From an industry standpoint, we ended the quarter at down 15%, on a cost-per-square-foot basis. Now to Brian, who will provide some additional detail on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2009 financial performance."

As reported, fourth quarter net sale",1118,"Thanks, Jonathan, and good morning to everyone. As stated in our earnings release, the after-tax operating results of Ruehl are now included in discontinued operations on the income statement for all periods presented. As reported, fourth quarter net sales increased 5% to $936 million, compared to $980.8 million last year. Fourth-quarter direct-to-consumer net merchandise sales were $93.1 million, flat compared to last year. Total company comparable store sales decreased 13%. Average transaction per store decreased 1%, average transaction value decreased 6% and average unit retail decreased 11% for the quarter.For the year, net sales decreased 15% to $2.93 billion, compared to $3.48 billion last year, and total company direct-to-consumer net merchandise sales decreased 6% to $249.4 million. Total company comparable store sales decreased 23%, average transactions per store decreased 14%, average transaction value decreased 7% and average unit retail decreased 7% for the year. Across all brands, for the quarter, the masculine categories continue to outpace the feminine categories, as male comparable store sales decreased by a high single-digit, while female comparable store sales decreased in the high teens.For our merchandise classification standpoint, on a total company basis, for the quarter, male knit tops and graphic tees were weaker performers, while woven shirts and fragrance were stronger performing categories. Female sweaters and knit tops were weaker performers, while woven shirts and dresses were stronger performing categories. The fourth quarter gross profit rate was 63.5%, down 110 basis points from last year's fourth quarter rate of 64.6%, primarily driven by a lower AUR, partially offset by reductions in average unit costs. For the year, the gross profit rate was 64.3%, compared to 66.9% last year.Stores and distribution expense for the quarter, as a percentage of sales, increased 4.9 percentage points to 44.2% versus 39.3% for the last year. Fourth-quarter stores and distribution expense included a non-cash impairment charge of $33.2 million or 3.5% of sales this year compared to a charge of $3.8 million or 0.8% of sales last year, as it was determined that the carrying value of assets exceeded the fair value of those assets for 99 stores this year and 20 stores last year.Excluding the effect of impairment charges, the increase in stores and distribution expense as a percent of sales was primarily attributable to higher store-occupancy costs, including rent, depreciation and other occupancy costs. For the year, store and distribution expense, as a percent of sales increased 7.5 percentage points to 48.7% versus 41.2% last year.For the fourth quarter, marketing, general and administrative expense was $92.4 million, compared to $97.5 million last year. MG&A expense for the quarter reflects reductions in employee compensation and benefits, travel, outside services and marketing For the year, MG&A expense was $353.3 million, compared to $405.2 million last year. The income tax rate for continuing operations for the quarter was 35.3% compared to 44.4% last year. This year's income tax rate reflects the benefit from foreign operations, while last year's rate includes a $9.9 million charge associated with Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m). For the year, the income tax rate for continuing operations was 33.9%, compared to 39.5% last year. For 2010, we anticipate that income tax rate to be in the mid-30s.For the quarter, net loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes was $13.6 million or $0.15 per diluted share, compared to net loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes of $19.6 million or $0.22 per diluted share last year. For the year, net loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes was $78.7 million or $0.89 per diluted share, compared to net loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes of $35.9 million or $0.40 per diluted share last year. Net loss from discontinued operations includes the operating results, exit charges and non-cash impairment charges for Ruehl and are detailed in the table that accompany the condensed consolidated financial statements that were included in this morning's release.Net income for the fourth quarter was $47.5 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, compared to net income of $68.4 million, or $0.78 per diluted share last year. Net income for the year was $0.3 million, or $0.00 per diluted share, compared to net income of $272.3 million last year or $3.05 per diluted share last year. Excluding net loss from discontinued operations, and non-cash asset impairment charges, fourth quarter non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $0.91 compared to $1.06 last year.  And full-year non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $1.12, compared to $3.51 last year.  A reconciliation of net income per diluted share on a GAAP basis, to net income per diluted share, excluding net loss from discontinued operations and non-cash asset impairment charges and non-GAAP financial measure is summarized in a table that accompany the condensed consolidated financial statements that were included in this morning's release.For the year, historic gross square footage was reduced by 2%. We closed a total of 53 stores during the year including 12 Abercrombie & Fitch, eight Abercrombie Kids, four Hollister and 29 Ruehl stores. Store closings for the fourth quarter totaled 40 including seven Abercrombie & Fitch, four Abercrombie Kids, two Hollister and 27 Ruehl stores. We opened a total of 24 new stores consisting of 11 in the U.S. and 13 outside the U.S. Those stores included the Hollister Epic and SoHo, the A&F flagships in Milan and Ginza and the Abercrombie Kids flagship in Milan, as well as three Abercrombie Kids, four Hollister, one Ruehl and two Gilly Hicks mall-based stores in the U.S., one Abercrombie Kids store in Canada, seven Hollister stores in the U.K. and one Hollister store in Italy and one in Germany. Fiscal 2009 CapEx was $175.5 million, including in $136.5 million for new stores, store refreshes and remodels and $39 million related to information technology, distribution center and other home office projects. We ended fiscal 2009 with a total of 1,096 stores, 340 Abercrombie & Fitch, 205 Abercrombie Kids, 507 Hollister and 16 Gilly Hicks, domestically, six Abercrombie & Fitch, four Abercrombie Kid, and 18 Hollister stores, internationally. For fiscal 2009, depreciation and amortization expense, net of amortization of deferred lease credits was $191.6 million. We expect net depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal 2010 to be approximately in line with that of fiscal 2009.Preopening rent expense for fiscal 2009 was $35.4 million, primarily related to flagships. For fiscal 2010, we expect preopening rent expense to be slightly higher and primarily attributable to flagships and international Hollister stores. This now concludes our prepared comments of the call. We're now available to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question, so that we can speak with as many callers as possible.

The store closures piece of it, I guess we've framed the issue in terms of what the stores are currently contributing negatively. The number, on a truly variable basis, is somewhat greater than that when you factor in some of the cost that was not included in the four wall. But how that gets addressed depends really on what happens on productivity levels, to the extent that productivity levels come back, some of those stores will come back into being with positive contribution.

And given that the lease expirations are generated at the end of the year, it's partly going to be influenced by what we see happening over the course of this year and beyond in terms of productivity, as we get to the point where we have to start executing against that, other than the ones that are so deeply underwater where we'll be seeking to affect those sooner than that.

Looking back on the first quarter I would summarize it as one in which we continued to focus on the key long-term drivers of our business that we laid out in our least earnings call. We are pleased with the progress we have made but there is still much work to be done. 
First, we are pleased with the overall reported sales growth of 14% for the quarter and particularly with the international and direct-to-consumer sales growth within that figure. We continue to be very focused on achieving sustainable, profitable growth in both our domestic and international businesses. Internationally results for the quarter were very encouraging. We opened three new Hollister mall-based stores in the U.K.; in Aberdeen, Cardiff and New Castle and all three are doing very well and exceeding our projections. The three Hollister U.K. stores in the comp base each comped positively for the quarter. 
Domestically we have taken steps in the right direction and have seen some progress evidenced by our overall domestic business which was positive for the quarter including Hollister. The continued outperformance of the Abercrombie & Fitch Tourist and high volume stores domestically is a significant consideration in our review of the domestic footprint of the brand. 
Coming back to international and growth opportunity there, by the end of the year we expect to have 34 Hollister stores in Europe and we are working very hard to increase the pace of international expansion. We have been adding resources where we need to and are at various stages of laying the groundwork in more than 10 additional countries. Our intent is to ensure we can keep a steady pipeline of new openings and we remain very excited about the opportunities we see ahead of us. 
We are balancing this accelerated pace with ensuring we do not over-store particular regions or sacrifice quality and end up in locations where we don’t belong. We want to ensure the locations we choose make sense from a brand perspective, a location perspective and of course a financial perspective. We have made some tough decisions this quarter to pull back on a small number of locations that do not meet all of these criteria and we will be very disciplined in how we approach this. We will not sacrifice quality for a short-term sales opportunity if it doesn’t make sense for us in the long run. 
Turning to Abercrombie & Fitch we announced this morning we will be opening a flagship in Madrid in 2011. Beyond that, we are looking at around 15 additional flagship opportunities in Europe and Asia through 2012. Again, we will be diligent and disciplined in how we approach this but we are very excited about the opportunities ahead of us. We also announced today we will open our first international Gilly Hicks store in London later this year. This will be a great opportunity for us to see if the international reaction to the Gilly Hicks brand is as strong as the reaction we have seen for A&F and Hollister. 
With that I will hand the call over to Jonathan.

For the first quarter the company’s reported net sales increased 14% to $687.8 million and comp store sales increased 1%.

For the first quarter the company’s reported net sales increased 14% to $687.8 million and comp store sales increased 1%. Our direct to consumer business was up 42% for the quarter and new international sales were the primary drivers of our reported sales growth for the quarter. 
International sales in total were $119 million and up 102% in the quarter. Combining domestic DTC and same store sales for the quarter our overall domestic like for like sales for the quarter were up 4%. Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 62.7%, down 70 basis points. The erosion of gross margin was primarily due to a 10% decrease in AUR for the quarter which was somewhat greater on a mix-adjusted basis. We expect some further gross margin erosion in the second quarter. 
MG&A for the quarter was $96.6 million up 12% from $86.3 million in the first quarter last year due primarily to higher legal expenses, incentive compensation accruals and marketing expenses. MG&A for the quarter included total equity compensation of $8.3 million as compared to $7.9 million last year; somewhat higher than anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. For the second quarter we expect MG&A to be approximately in line with the first quarter in dollar terms with roughly half of the increase over last year’s second quarter being driven by higher incentive equity compensation. 
As a percentage of sales, stores and distribution expense for the quarter decreased to 51.5% of sales from 54.9% last year. Store occupancy costs for the quarter were approximately $159 million or 23.1% of sales compared to $154 million or 25.5% of sales in the first quarter last year. For the second quarter we anticipate occupancy costs to be a little higher in dollar terms before increasing more significantly in dollar terms in Q3 and Q4. 
All other stores and distribution costs were approximately $196 million or 28.5% of sales for the quarter and we anticipate a similar or slightly lower percentage for the second quarter. Operating loss for the quarter was $18.7 million compared to a loss of $33.9 million last year. The tax rate for the quarter from continuing operations was a benefit of 39.5% compared to a benefit of 28.9% last year. The tax rate for the first quarter included a modest net benefit for both the settlement of tax audits and the net release of valuation allowances. The reported net loss for the quarter was $11.8 million or $0.13 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of $23.1 million or $0.26 per share last year from continuing operations. 
Our international stores performed strongly during the quarter. The three new U.K. Hollister stores are exceeding our projections and as Mike mentioned earlier the three U.K. Hollister stores on a comp base, each comped positively for the quarter. On an overall basis four-wall margins for international stores were over 30% for the quarter. 
Turning to 2010 store openings we remain on track to open A&F flagships in Fukuoka and Copenhagen as well as a Hollister Epic store on Fifth Avenue in New York in the fourth quarter. We now have confirmed plans to open approximately 25 international mall-based Hollister stores in 2010 skewed towards the end of the year. Additionally we anticipate opening one A&F store in Canada. As Mike mentioned earlier, today we also announced plans to open the first international Gilly Hicks store in London in the fourth quarter. 
Domestically, we expect to open three A&F stores, two kids stores, three Hollister stores and two Gilly Hicks stores including a prototype of the smaller sized store format we have been working on for some time. We also expect to open five outlet stores. This morning we announced plans to open an A&F flagship in Madrid in 2011 and we remain on track to open an A&F flagship in Paris in 2011. The Madrid store is a smaller store with a footprint of approximately 14,000 square feet. It is in a great location and we expect it to be a successful and profitable store on conservative volume projections. 
Mike mentioned earlier we are working hard to increase the pace of our international expansion while remaining very disciplined in our approach to this. Based on current store opening plans and other capital expenditures we now expect total capital expenditures for 2010 to be in a range of $200-225 million including $165-190 million related to new stores, store refreshes and remodels and approximately $35 million related to IT, PC and other home office projects. This is down from the prior estimate due to lower store construction costs than previously estimated, the lower number of expected 2010 openings, other timing shifts and foreign currency impact.
During the quarter we opened three Hollister mall-based stores in the U.K. Domestically we opened two A&F stores, one kids store and one Hollister store. Additionally we closed three domestic stores including one A&F store, one kids store and one Hollister store. We continue to review underperforming domestic stores for potential closures and expect to have a clearer view on that by the end of the second quarter. More broadly, we continue to work on each of the margin improvement factors we outlined in our last earnings call and we will provide updates on the subsequent earnings calls as appropriate. 
Inventory for the quarter was up 17% on a cost per square foot basis excluding Ruehl. This was somewhat higher than anticipated at the beginning of the quarter partially due to timing of receipts and higher DTC inventory but was in line with the overall increase in sales. We expect a greater increase at the end of the second quarter in part reflecting we believe we were under-inventoried at the equivalent point last year. 
We ended the quarter with $600 million in cash and cash equivalents and outstanding borrowings, letters of credit of $95 million compared to $464 million in cash and outstanding borrowings and letters of credit of $143 million at the comparable point last year. 
Now to Brian who will provide some additional details on our first quarter performance.

As reported, first quarter net sales increased 14% to $687.8 million and comp store sales increased 1%. Our direct to consumer business was up 42% for the quarter and new international stores were the primary drivers of reported sales growth for the quarter. 
For the quarter average transaction per store increased 16%. Average transaction value decreased 4% and average unit retail decreased 10%. All metrics reflect an increasing proportion of sales coming from international. Across all brands for the quarter the masculine categories continued to outpace the feminine categories as male comparable store sales increased by high single digits while female comparable store sales decreased by a low single digit. 
From a merchandise classification standpoint on a total company basis for the quarter male graphic tees was a weaker performer while woven shirts, knit tops and fleece were stronger performing categories. Female knit tops and sweaters were weaker performers while dresses, woven shirts and graphic tees were stronger performing categories. 
For the quarter, store gross square footage was relatively flat. We closed a total of three stores during the quarter including one Abercrombie & Fitch, one Abercrombie kids and one Hollister store. We opened a total of seven new stores including three U.K. Hollister mall-based stores and domestically two Abercrombie & Fitch stores, one Abercrombie kids store and one Hollister store. We ended the quarter with a total of 1,100 stores; 341 Abercrombie & Fitch, 205 Abercrombie kids, 507 Hollister, 16 Gilly Hicks domestically and 6 Abercrombie & Fitch, 4 Abercrombie kids and 21 Hollister stores internationally. 
For fiscal 2010 we now expect pre-opening rent expense to be slightly lower than the $35.4 million incurred during fiscal 2009. This concludes our prepared comment section of the call.

Our problem has clearly been female and within female we have had a female tops problem. I believe we are making progress in female. 
The comp gap is narrowing between men’s and women’s and I believe those of us who have followed our business for awhile can take a look at what we are doing in that business and how we are merchandising that business and how it differs from the recent past. I urge you all to go to the stores on Saturday. Take a look at the classification statements that are being made. We have spent a lot of time determining trend, getting on trend and then backing the trend up with merchandise. 
I think you will see more of that as we go into back-to-school. You clearly won’t see our back-to-school assortments as of Saturday but you will see a merchandising strategy that is very much in our DNA. Clearly Hollister is the brand that is the most sensitive that we believe will be most sensitive on an ongoing basis and we think we are getting smarter about how we are pricing that product. Pricing and promoting the product and you know promotion isn’t a fundamental strength of ours but we are getting much, much smarter in Hollister in terms of what we promote, how we promote it and where we promote it. 
You will see continued promotion in Hollister because that is the way of life but you will see less promotion and you can already see that in Abercrombie & Fitch and Abercrombie.

Some of them are at different stages than others but they are ones we have potential to do between now and 2012. 
In terms of the number of Hollister’s, we haven’t at this point spoken to anything beyond 2010. We have updated the number to approximately 25 for this year and clearly we have been speaking to the fact we would like to accelerate that in 2011 and beyond and we are working hard to add additional resources there and to get people on the ground, researching all of the real estate opportunities with the caveat that as Mike spoke to earlier on we are not going to sacrifice the financials of those deals just to get to a higher number of store openings. 
In terms of the overall aggregate volumes in the flagships we haven’t updated that number. We probably will at some point in the future. So there is nothing to add on that at this point. Then in terms of the question of anything learned from Ginza can you just be a little more specific on that?

We haven’t specifically updated that but clearly that was anticipating that four-wall margins would be roughly in the range we are seeing; north of 30%. Over time we think the MG&A or fixed cost component of that can decline as we start to lever DC costs and some of the other pre-opening store specific costs and new country costs that are baked in at the moment. 
There are some additional investments we need to make as we roll out but as we have spoken in the past what we have been trying to do is hold our overall home office infrastructure pretty much close to its current level going back a few quarters and fund additional international investments through offsetting efficiencies. For the most part I think we have been fairly successful in doing that. 
At the same time, as we have discussed earlier on we are very interested in putting the resources we need to behind accelerating the pace of international expansion given what we have been seeing.

Looking back on the first quarter, I would summarize it as one in which we continued to focus on the key long-term drivers of our business that we laid out in our last earnings call. We are pleased with the progress we made, but there's still much work to be done.
First, we are pleased with the overall reported sales growth of 14% for the quarter and particularly with international and direct-to-consumer sales growth within that figure. We continue to be very focused on achieving sustainable, profitable growth in both our domestic and international businesses.
Internationally, results for the quarter were very encouraging. We opened three new Hollister mall-based stores in the U.K. in Aberdeen, Cardiff and Newcastle. And all three are doing very well and exceeding our projections. The three Hollister U.K. stores in the comp phase each comped positively for the quarter.
Domestically, we have taken steps in the right direction and have seen some progress, evidenced by our overall domestic business, which was positive for the quarter, including Hollister. The continued outperformance of the Abercrombie & Fitch tourist and high volume stores domestically is a significant consideration in our review of the domestic footprint of the brand.
Coming back to international and growth opportunity there, by the end of the year we expect to have 34 Hollister stores in Europe. And we are working very hard to increase the pace of international expansion. We have been adding resources where we need to and are at various stages of laying the groundwork in more than 10 additional countries. Our intent is to ensure that we can keep a steady pipeline of new openings, and we remain very excited about the opportunities we see ahead of us.
We are balancing this accelerated pace with ensuring we do not overstore particular regions or sacrifice quality and end up in locations where we don't belong. We want to ensure that the locations we choose make sense from a brand perspective, a location perspective and of course, a financial perspective. We have made some tough decisions this quarter to pull back on a small number of locations that do not meet all these criteria, and we will be very disciplined in how we approach this. We will not sacrifice quality for a short-term sales opportunity if it doesn't make sense for us in the long run.
Turning to Abercrombie & Fitch. We announced this morning that we will be opening a flagship in Madrid in 2011. Beyond that, we are looking at around 15 additional flagship opportunities in Europe and Asia through 2012. Again, we will be diligent and disciplined in how we approach this, but we are very excited about the opportunities ahead of us. We also announced today that we will open our first international Gilly Hicks store in London later this year. This will be great opportunity for us to see if the international reaction to the Gilly Hicks brand is as strong as the reaction we have seen for A&F and Hollister. 
With that, I will hand the call over to Jonathan."

For the first quarter, the company's reported net sales increased 14% to $687.8 million, and comp store sales increased 1%. Our Direct-to-consumer business, which was up 42% for the quarter, and new international stores were the primary drivers of our reported sales growth for the quarter. International sales in total were $119 million and up 102% for the quarter.
Combining domestic DTC and same-store sales for the quarter, our overall domestic like-for-like sales for the quarter were up 4%. Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 62.7%, down 70 basis points. The erosion of gross margin was primarily due to a 10% decrease in AUR for the quarter, which was somewhat greater on a mix-adjusted basis. We expect some further gross margin erosion in the second quarter.
MG&A for the quarter was $96.6 million, up 12% from $86.3 million in the first quarter last year due primarily to higher net legal expenses, incentive compensation accruals and marketing expenses. MG&A for the quarter included total equity compensation of $8.3 million as compared to $7.9 million last year, somewhat higher than anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. 
For the second quarter, we expect MG&A to be approximately in line with the first quarter in dollar terms, with roughly half of the increase over last year’s second quarter being driven by higher incentive and equity compensation. As a percentage of sales, stores and distribution expense for the quarter decreased to 51.5% of sales from 54.9% last year. Store occupancy costs for the quarter were approximately $159 million or 23.1% of sales compared to $154 million or 25.5% of sales in the first quarter last year.
For the second quarter, we anticipate occupancy cost to be a little higher in dollar terms, also [ph] before increasing more significantly in dollar terms for Q3 and Q4. All other stores and distribution costs were approximately $196 million or 28.5% of sales for the quarter and we anticipate a similar or slightly lower percentage for the second quarter. Operating loss for the quarter was $18.7 million compared to a loss of $33.9 million last year.
The tax rate for the quarter from continuing operations was a benefit of 39.5% compared to a benefit of 28.9% last year. The tax rate for the first quarter included a modest net benefit from both the settlement of tax audits and the net release of valuation allowances. The reported net loss for the quarter was $11.8 million or $0.13 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $23.1 million or $0.26 per share last year from continuing operations.
Our international stores performed strongly during the quarter. The three new U.K. Hollister stores are exceeding our projections and as Mike mentioned earlier, the new U.K. Hollister stores in the comp base, each comped positively for the quarter. On an overall basis four-wall margins for international stores were over 30% for the quarter. 
Turning to 2010 store openings, we remain on track to open A&F flagships in Fukuoka and Copenhagen, as well as a Hollister Epic store on Fifth Avenue in the fourth quarter. We now have confirmed plans to open approximately 25 international mall-based Hollister stores in 2010, skewed towards the end of the year. Additionally, we anticipate opening one A&F store in Canada. Mike mentioned earlier, today we also announced plans open the first international Gilly Hicks store in London in the fourth quarter.
Domestically, we expect to open three A&F stores, two kid stores, three Hollister stores and two Gilly Hicks stores, including a prototype of the smaller size store format we’ve been working on for some time.  We also expect to open five outlet stores. This morning we announced plans open an A&F flagship in Madrid in 2011, and we remain on track to open an A&F flagship in Paris in 2011.
The Madrid store is a smaller store with footprint of approximately 14,000 square feet. It is in a great location and expected to be a successful and profitable store on conservative volume projections. Mike mentioned earlier that we are working hard to increase the pace of our international expansion, while remaining very disciplined in our approach to this. Based on current store opening plans and other capital expenditures, we now expect total capital expenditures for 2010 to be in the range of $200 million to $225 million, including $165 million to $190 million related to new stores, store refreshes and remodels and approximately $35 million related to IT, DC and other home office projects. This is down from the prior estimate due to lower store construction costs than previously estimated, a lower number of expected 2010 openings, other timing shifts and foreign currency impact.
During the quarter, we opened three Hollister mall-based stores in the U.K. Domestically we opened two A&F stores, one kid store and one Hollister store. Additionally, we closed three domestic stores, including one A&F store, one kid store and one Hollister store.
We continue to review underperforming domestic stores with potential closures and expect to have a clearer view on that by the end of the second quarter. More broadly, we continue to work on each of the margin improvement factors we outlined in our last earnings call, and we’ll provide updates on these in subsequent earnings calls as appropriate.
Inventory for the quarter was up 17% on a cost-per-square foot basis, excluding Ruehl. This was somewhat higher than anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, partially due to timing of receipts of higher DTC inventory, but was in line with the overall increase in sales. We expect a greater increase at the end of the second quarter, in part reflecting that we believe we were under inventoried at the equivalent point last year. We ended the quarter with $600 million in cash and cash equivalents and outstanding borrowings and letters of credit of $95 million compared to $464 million cash and outstanding borrowings and letters of credit of $143 million at the comparable point last year.
Now to Brian, who will provide some additional detail on our first quarter performance."

For the quarter, average transactions per store increased 16%, average transaction value decreased 4% and average unit retail decreased 10%. All metrics reflect an increasing proportion of sales coming from international.
Across all brands for the quarter, the masculine categories continued to outpace the feminine category as male comparable store sales increased by a high single-digit, while female comparable store sales decreased by a low single-digit.
From a merchandise classification standpoint, on a total company basis for the quarter, male graphic tees was a weaker performer, while woven shirts, knit tops and fleece were stronger-performing categories. Female knit tops and sweaters were weaker performers while dresses, woven shirts and graphic tees were stronger performing categories.
For the quarter, store gross square footage was relatively flat. We closed a total of three stores during the quarter, including one Abercrombie & Fitch, one abercrombie kids and one Hollister store. We opened a total of seven new stores, including three U.K. Hollister mall-based stores and domestically, two Abercrombie & Fitch stores, one abercrombie kids store and one Hollister store.

I believe that those of us who have followed our business for a while can take a look at what we're doing in that business and how we're merchandising that business and how it differs from the recent past. I urge you all to go to the stores on Saturday, take a look at the classification statements that are being made. We've spent a lot of time determining trend, getting on trend and then backing trend up with merchandise. I think you'll see more of that as we go into back-to-school. You clearly won’t see our back-to-school assortments as of Saturday, but you'll see a merchandising strategy that is very much in our DNA. Clearly, Hollister is the brand that is the most sensitive, that we believe will be most sensitive on an ongoing basis. And we think we're getting smarter about how we're pricing that product. Pricing and promoting the product, and you know promotion isn't a fundamental strength of ours. But we're getting much, much smarter in Hollister in terms of what we promote, how we promote it, where we promote it.

But they are ones that we have the potential, we think, to do in the next, between now and 2012. In terms of the number of Hollisters, we haven’t at this point spoken to anything beyond 2010. We've updated the number to approximately 25 for this year. And clearly we've been speaking to the fact that we’d like to accelerate that in 2011 and beyond. And we’re working hard to add additional resources there and to get people on the ground researching all the real estate opportunities. We have the caveat that, as Mike spoke to earlier on, we’re not going to sacrifice the financials of those deals just to get to a higher number of store openings. In terms of the overall aggregate volumes of the flagships, we haven't updated that number.

There are some additional investments we need to make as we roll out, but as we've spoken about the past, what we've been trying to do is to hold our overall home office infrastructure pretty much close to its current level going back a few quarters and fund additional international investments through offsetting efficiencies.

We are pleased with the pr",522,"Good morning, guys. Thank you for joining us. Looking back on the first quarter, I would summarize it as one in which we continued to focus on the key long-term drivers of our business that we laid out in our last earnings call. We are pleased with the progress we made, but there's still much work to be done.
First, we are pleased with the overall reported sales growth of 14% for the quarter and particularly with international and direct-to-consumer sales growth within that figure. We continue to be very focused on achieving sustainable, profitable growth in both our domestic and international businesses.
Internationally, results for the quarter were very encouraging. We opened three new Hollister mall-based stores in the U.K. in Aberdeen, Cardiff and Newcastle. And all three are doing very well and exceeding our projections. The three Hollister U.K. stores in the comp phase each comped positively for the quarter.
Domestically, we have taken steps in the right direction and have seen some progress, evidenced by our overall domestic business, which was positive for the quarter, including Hollister. The continued outperformance of the Abercrombie & Fitch tourist and high volume stores domestically is a significant consideration in our review of the domestic footprint of the brand.
Coming back to international and growth opportunity there, by the end of the year we expect to have 34 Hollister stores in Europe. And we are working very hard to increase the pace of international expansion. We have been adding resources where we need to and are at various stages of laying the groundwork in more than 10 additional countries. Our intent is to ensure that we can keep a steady pipeline of new openings, and we remain very excited about the opportunities we see ahead of us.
We are balancing this accelerated pace with ensuring we do not overstore particular regions or sacrifice quality and end up in locations where we don't belong. We want to ensure that the locations we choose make sense from a brand perspective, a location perspective and of course, a financial perspective. We have made some tough decisions this quarter to pull back on a small number of locations that do not meet all these criteria, and we will be very disciplined in how we approach this. We will not sacrifice quality for a short-term sales opportunity if it doesn't make sense for us in the long run.
Turning to Abercrombie & Fitch. We announced this morning that we will be opening a flagship in Madrid in 2011. Beyond that, we are looking at around 15 additional flagship opportunities in Europe and Asia through 2012. Again, we will be diligent and disciplined in how we approach this, but we are very excited about the opportunities ahead of us. We also announced today that we will open our first international Gilly Hicks store in London later this year. This will be great opportunity for us to see if the international reaction to the Gilly Hicks brand is as strong as the reaction we have seen for A&F and Hollister. 
With that, I will hand the call over to Jonathan."

For the first quarter, the company's reported net sales increased 14% to $687.8 million, and comp store sales increased 1%. Our Direct-to-consumer business, which was up 42% for the quarter, and new international stores were the primary drivers of our reported sales growth for the quarter. International sales in total were $119 million and up 102% for the quarter.
Combining domestic DTC and same-store sales for the quarter, our overall domestic like-for-like sales for the quarter were up 4%. Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 62.7%, down 70 basis points. The erosion of gross margin was primarily due to a 10% decrease in AUR for the quarter, which was somewhat greater on a mix-adjusted basis. We expect some further gross margin erosion in the second quarter.
MG&A for the quarter was $96.6 million, up 12% from $86.3 million in the first quarter last year due primarily to higher net legal expenses, incentive compensation accruals and marketing expenses. MG&A for the quarter included total equity compensation of $8.3 million as compared to $7.9 million last year, somewhat higher than anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. 
For the second quarter, we expect MG&A to be approximately in line with the first quarter in dollar terms, with roughly half of the increase over last year’s second quarter being driven by higher incentive and equity compensation. As a percentage of sales, stores and distribution expense for the quarter decreased to 51.5% of sales from 54.9% last year. Store occupancy costs for the quarter were approximately $159 million or 23.1% of sales compared to $154 million or 25.5% of sales in the first quarter last year.
For the second quarter, we anticipate occupancy cost to be a little higher in dollar terms, also [ph] before increasing more significantly in dollar terms for Q3 and Q4. All other stores and distribution costs were approximately $196 million or 28.5% of sales for the quarter and we anticipate a similar or slightly lower percentage for the second quarter. Operating loss for the quarter was $18.7 million compared to a loss of $33.9 million last year.
The tax rate for the quarter from continuing operations was a benefit of 39.5% compared to a benefit of 28.9% last year. The tax rate for the first quarter included a modest net benefit from both the settlement of tax audits and the net release of valuation allowances. The reported net loss for the quarter was $11.8 million or $0.13 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $23.1 million or $0.26 per share last year from continuing operations.
Our international stores performed strongly during the quarter. The three new U.K. Hollister stores are exceeding our projections, and as Mike mentioned earlier, the new U.K. Hollister stores in the comp base, each comped positively for the quarter. On an overall basis four-wall margins for international stores were over 30% for the quarter. 
Turning to 2010 store openings, we remain on track to open A&F flagships in Fukuoka and Copenhagen, as well as a Hollister Epic store on Fifth Avenue in the fourth quarter. We now have confirmed plans to open approximately 25 international mall-based Hollister stores in 2010, skewed towards the end of the year. Additionally, we anticipate opening one A&F store in Canada. Mike mentioned earlier, today we also announced plans to open the first international Gilly Hicks store in London in the fourth quarter.
Domestically, we expect to open three A&F stores, two kid stores, three Hollister stores and two Gilly Hicks stores, including a prototype of the smaller size store format we’ve been working on for some time.  We also expect to open five outlet stores. This morning, we announced plans to open an A&F flagship in Madrid in 2011, and we remain on track to open an A&F flagship in Paris in 2011.
The Madrid store is a smaller store with a footprint of approximately 14,000 square feet. It is in a great location, and we expect it to be a successful and profitable store on conservative volume projections. Mike mentioned earlier that we are working hard to increase the pace of our international expansion, while remaining very disciplined in our approach to this. Based on current store opening plans and other capital expenditures, we now expect total capital expenditures for 2010 to be in the range of $200 million to $225 million, including $165 million to $190 million related to new stores, store refreshes and remodels and approximately $35 million related to IT, DC and other home office projects. This is down from the prior estimate due to lower store construction costs than previously estimated, a lower number of expected 2010 openings, other timing shifts and foreign currency impact.
During the quarter, we opened three Hollister mall-based stores in the U.K. Domestically we opened two A&F stores, one kids store and one Hollister store. Additionally, we closed three domestic stores, including one A&F store, one kid store and one Hollister store.
We continue to review underperforming domestic stores for potential closures and expect to have a clearer view on that by the end of the second quarter. More broadly, we continue to work on each of the margin improvement factors we outlined in our last earnings call, and we’ll provide updates on these in subsequent earnings calls as appropriate.
Inventory for the quarter was up 17% on a cost-per-square foot basis, excluding Ruehl. This was somewhat higher than anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, partially due to timing of receipts of higher DTC inventory, but was in line with the overall increase in sales. We expect a greater increase at the end of the second quarter, in part reflecting that we believe we were under inventoried at the equivalent point last year. We ended the quarter with $600 million in cash and cash equivalents and outstanding borrowings and letters of credit of $95 million compared to $464 million cash and outstanding borrowings and letters of credit of $143 million at the comparable point last year.
Now to Brian, who will provide some additional detail on our first quarter performance."

For the quarter, average transactions per store increased 16%, average transaction value decreased 4% and average unit retail decreased 10%. All metrics reflect an increasing proportion of sales coming from international.
Across all brands for the quarter, the masculine categories continued to outpace the feminine category as male comparable store sales increased by a high single-digit, while female comparable store sales decreased by a low single-digit.
From a merchandise classification standpoint, on a total company basis for the quarter, male graphic tees was a weaker performer, while woven shirts, knit tops and fleece were stronger-performing categories. Female knit tops and sweaters were weaker performers while dresses, woven shirts and graphic tees were stronger performing categories.
For the quarter, store gross square footage was relatively flat. We closed a total of three stores during the quarter, including one Abercrombie & Fitch, one abercrombie kids and one Hollister store. We opened a total of seven new stores, including three U.K. Hollister mall-based stores and domestically, two Abercrombie & Fitch stores, one abercrombie kids store and one Hollister store.

I urge you all to go to the stores on Saturday, take a look at the classification statements that are being made. We've spent a lot of time determining trend, getting on trend and then backing trend up with merchandise. I think you'll see more of that as we go into back-to-school. You clearly won’t see our back-to-school assortments as of Saturday, but you'll see a merchandising strategy that is very much in our DNA. Clearly, Hollister is the brand that is the most sensitive, that we believe will be most sensitive on an ongoing basis. And we think we're getting smarter about how we're pricing that product. Pricing and promoting the product, and you know promotion isn't a fundamental strength of ours. But we're getting much, much smarter in Hollister in terms of what we promote, how we promote it, where we promote it. You will see continued promotion in Hollister because that's a way of life, but you will see less promotion and you can already see that in Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie."

As I said, we're at a point where we're going to break out the comp performance of those U.K. stores more specifically. They did each comp positively for the quarter. Frankly, if they'd been flat or slightly down, we would've still been pretty happy given the incredibly strong opening each of those stores had. So the fact that they are comping positively we think directionally is a very positive sign.

We are pleased with the pr",522,"Good morning, guys. Thank you for joining us. Looking back on the first quarter, I would summarize it as one in which we continued to focus on the key long-term drivers of our business that we laid out in our last earnings call. We are pleased with the progress we made, but there's still much work to be done.
First, we are pleased with the overall reported sales growth of 14% for the quarter and particularly with international and direct-to-consumer sales growth within that figure. We continue to be very focused on achieving sustainable, profitable growth in both our domestic and international businesses.
Internationally, results for the quarter were very encouraging. We opened three new Hollister mall-based stores in the U.K. in Aberdeen, Cardiff and Newcastle. And all three are doing very well and exceeding our projections. The three Hollister U.K. stores in the comp phase each comped positively for the quarter.
Domestically, we have taken steps in the right direction and have seen some progress, evidenced by our overall domestic business, which was positive for the quarter, including Hollister. The continued outperformance of the Abercrombie & Fitch tourist and high volume stores domestically is a significant consideration in our review of the domestic footprint of the brand.
Coming back to international and growth opportunity there, by the end of the year we expect to have 34 Hollister stores in Europe. And we are working very hard to increase the pace of international expansion. We have been adding resources where we need to and are at various stages of laying the groundwork in more than 10 additional countries. Our intent is to ensure that we can keep a steady pipeline of new openings, and we remain very excited about the opportunities we see ahead of us.
We are balancing this accelerated pace with ensuring we do not overstore particular regions or sacrifice quality and end up in locations where we don't belong. We want to ensure that the locations we choose make sense from a brand perspective, a location perspective and of course, a financial perspective. We have made some tough decisions this quarter to pull back on a small number of locations that do not meet all these criteria, and we will be very disciplined in how we approach this. We will not sacrifice quality for a short-term sales opportunity if it doesn't make sense for us in the long run.
Turning to Abercrombie & Fitch. We announced this morning that we will be opening a flagship in Madrid in 2011. Beyond that, we are looking at around 15 additional flagship opportunities in Europe and Asia through 2012. Again, we will be diligent and disciplined in how we approach this, but we are very excited about the opportunities ahead of us. We also announced today that we will open our first international Gilly Hicks store in London later this year. This will be great opportunity for us to see if the international reaction to the Gilly Hicks brand is as strong as the reaction we have seen for A&F and Hollister. 
With that, I will hand the call over to Jonathan."

For the first quarter, the company's reported net sales increased 14% to $687.8 million, and comp store sales increased 1%. Our Direct-to-consumer business, which was up 42% for the quarter, and new international stores were the primary drivers of our reported sales growth for the quarter. International sales in total were $119 million and up 102% for the quarter.
Combining domestic DTC and same-store sales for the quarter, our overall domestic like-for-like sales for the quarter were up 4%. Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 62.7%, down 70 basis points. The erosion of gross margin was primarily due to a 10% decrease in AUR for the quarter, which was somewhat greater on a mix-adjusted basis. We expect some further gross margin erosion in the second quarter.
MG&A for the quarter was $96.6 million, up 12% from $86.3 million in the first quarter last year due primarily to higher net legal expenses, incentive compensation accruals and marketing expenses. MG&A for the quarter included total equity compensation of $8.3 million as compared to $7.9 million last year, somewhat higher than anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. 
For the second quarter, we expect MG&A to be approximately in line with the first quarter in dollar terms, with roughly half of the increase over last year’s second quarter being driven by higher incentive and equity compensation. As a percentage of sales, stores and distribution expense for the quarter decreased to 51.5% of sales from 54.9% last year. Store occupancy costs for the quarter were approximately $159 million or 23.1% of sales compared to $154 million or 25.5% of sales in the first quarter last year.
For the second quarter, we anticipate occupancy cost to be a little higher in dollar terms, also [ph] before increasing more significantly in dollar terms for Q3 and Q4. All other stores and distribution costs were approximately $196 million or 28.5% of sales for the quarter and we anticipate a similar or slightly lower percentage for the second quarter. Operating loss for the quarter was $18.7 million compared to a loss of $33.9 million last year.
The tax rate for the quarter from continuing operations was a benefit of 39.5% compared to a benefit of 28.9% last year. The tax rate for the first quarter included a modest net benefit from both the settlement of tax audits and the net release of valuation allowances. The reported net loss for the quarter was $11.8 million or $0.13 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $23.1 million or $0.26 per share last year from continuing operations.
Our international stores performed strongly during the quarter. The three new U.K. Hollister stores are exceeding our projections, and as Mike mentioned earlier, the new U.K. Hollister stores in the comp base, each comped positively for the quarter. On an overall basis four-wall margins for international stores were over 30% for the quarter. 
Turning to 2010 store openings, we remain on track to open A&F flagships in Fukuoka and Copenhagen, as well as a Hollister Epic store on Fifth Avenue in the fourth quarter. We now have confirmed plans to open approximately 25 international mall-based Hollister stores in 2010, skewed towards the end of the year. Additionally, we anticipate opening one A&F store in Canada. Mike mentioned earlier, today we also announced plans to open the first international Gilly Hicks store in London in the fourth quarter.
Domestically, we expect to open three A&F stores, two kid stores, three Hollister stores and two Gilly Hicks stores, including a prototype of the smaller size store format we’ve been working on for some time.  We also expect to open five outlet stores. This morning, we announced plans to open an A&F flagship in Madrid in 2011, and we remain on track to open an A&F flagship in Paris in 2011.
The Madrid store is a smaller store with a footprint of approximately 14,000 square feet. It is in a great location, and we expect it to be a successful and profitable store on conservative volume projections. Mike mentioned earlier that we are working hard to increase the pace of our international expansion, while remaining very disciplined in our approach to this. Based on current store opening plans and other capital expenditures, we now expect total capital expenditures for 2010 to be in the range of $200 million to $225 million, including $165 million to $190 million related to new stores, store refreshes and remodels and approximately $35 million related to IT, DC and other home office projects. This is down from the prior estimate due to lower store construction costs than previously estimated, a lower number of expected 2010 openings, other timing shifts and foreign currency impact.
During the quarter, we opened three Hollister mall-based stores in the U.K. Domestically we opened two A&F stores, one kids store and one Hollister store. Additionally, we closed three domestic stores, including one A&F store, one kid store and one Hollister store.
We continue to review underperforming domestic stores for potential closures and expect to have a clearer view on that by the end of the second quarter. More broadly, we continue to work on each of the margin improvement factors we outlined in our last earnings call, and we’ll provide updates on these in subsequent earnings calls as appropriate.
Inventory for the quarter was up 17% on a cost-per-square foot basis, excluding Ruehl. This was somewhat higher than anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, partially due to timing of receipts of higher DTC inventory, but was in line with the overall increase in sales. We expect a greater increase at the end of the second quarter, in part reflecting that we believe we were under inventoried at the equivalent point last year. We ended the quarter with $600 million in cash and cash equivalents and outstanding borrowings and letters of credit of $95 million compared to $464 million cash and outstanding borrowings and letters of credit of $143 million at the comparable point last year.
Now to Brian, who will provide some additional detail on our first quarter performance."

For the quarter, average transactions per store increased 16%, average transaction value decreased 4% and average unit retail decreased 10%. All metrics reflect an increasing proportion of sales coming from international.
Across all brands for the quarter, the masculine categories continued to outpace the feminine category as male comparable store sales increased by a high single-digit, while female comparable store sales decreased by a low single-digit.
From a merchandise classification standpoint, on a total company basis for the quarter, male graphic tees was a weaker performer, while woven shirts, knit tops and fleece were stronger-performing categories. Female knit tops and sweaters were weaker performers while dresses, woven shirts and graphic tees were stronger performing categories.
For the quarter, store gross square footage was relatively flat. We closed a total of three stores during the quarter, including one Abercrombie & Fitch, one abercrombie kids and one Hollister store. We opened a total of seven new stores, including three U.K. Hollister mall-based stores and domestically, two Abercrombie & Fitch stores, one abercrombie kids store and one Hollister store.

I urge you all to go to the stores on Saturday, take a look at the classification statements that are being made. We've spent a lot of time determining trend, getting on trend and then backing trend up with merchandise. I think you'll see more of that as we go into back-to-school. You clearly won’t see our back-to-school assortments as of Saturday, but you'll see a merchandising strategy that is very much in our DNA. Clearly, Hollister is the brand that is the most sensitive, that we believe will be most sensitive on an ongoing basis. And we think we're getting smarter about how we're pricing that product. Pricing and promoting the product, and you know promotion isn't a fundamental strength of ours. But we're getting much, much smarter in Hollister in terms of what we promote, how we promote it, where we promote it.

As I said, we're at a point where we're going to break out the comp performance of those U.K. stores more specifically. They did each comp positively for the quarter. Frankly, if they'd been flat or slightly down, we would've still been pretty happy given the incredibly strong opening each of those stores had. So the fact that they are comping positively we think directionally is a very positive sign.

Thank you for joining us. We are pleased with the progress we’re making as we pursue our strategy of leveraging the international appeal of our iconic brands to build a highly profitable, sustainable global business. We achieved",764,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We are pleased with the progress we’re making as we pursue our strategy of leveraging the international appeal of our iconic brands to build a highly profitable, sustainable global business. We achieved growth both domestically and internationally during the quarter. We are gaining traction and we are very excited by what we see ahead of us.
In that context, I want to take a few minutes to recap how we see the state of our business today and to talk about our progress on some of the key initiatives we have discussed in recent calls. 
Starting with our Domestic business, we are pleased that all of the brands achieved positive comps for the quarter. We are particularly pleased with the performance of the flagship and tourist stores both an absolute and a relative basis. Year-to-date, our U.S. tourist stores produced double-digit comps. And, as you know, we operate these locations without many of the sale events and promotions that we have run in the rest of the chain. At the same time, we are also pleased that our non-tourist stores for all brands were in positive territory for the quarter. I want to make special mention of Hollister Epic store in SoHo, which has posted very strong comps since it entered the comp base a few weeks ago.
Next, we believe that our marketing and promotional activities for the quarter were effective and appropriately timed. We also believe that the promotions were effective in driving overall gross profit dollars. Substantially, all of the promotions we ran during the quarter were planned in advance and were driven by our expectation that they would be effective in driving sales productivity and gross profit dollars. 
As we said at the beginning of the year, we are willing to tolerate some gross margin rate erosion in the near term to accomplish that. While it is too early to speak to back-to-school results, I can also tell you that I feel very good about the look and feel of our stores today. We have great product in both men's and women's. We are gaining traction with trends. And importantly, we have inventory behind these trends. 
The marketing in all of the brands is exciting and energetic, and we are engaging with our customer in ways that promote some of our key back-to-school items. We have an appropriate mix of fashion and basic items in the assortment, and we intentionally took a more wear-now approach to our back-to-school floor set. 
Most importantly, I feel that we are now properly organized in merchandising, planning and design to deliver sustainable growth domestically and internationally. Having said that, the performance of a number of our Domestic stores remains unsatisfactory. And to that end, we remain committed to a store closure plan, particularly for the A&F and kids brands. Jonathan will provide details on this in a few minutes.
Moving to our International business. We are very happy with the performance of both our stores and Direct-to-Consumer business. Our U.K. Hollister stores continued to comp positively in aggregate for the quarter. The London flagship had double-digit comps for the quarter, and Milan and Ginza continued to perform well. 
We will be below our planned International Hollister openings for this year, but this does not reflect a lack of excellent opportunities for new stores. Importantly, we have already taken steps to add resources to ensure that we keep the pipeline full going forward. 
It is very important to our plans that we achieve an accelerated rate of openings in 2011. We continue to work on additional flagship opportunities for 2011, beyond those already announced, as well as a longer list of opportunities for 2012.
From a sourcing standpoint, the costing benefits we obtained in the quarter significantly cushioned the impact of the AUR reduction. We anticipate a modest cost benefit in the second half of the year, despite much higher raw material costs. We are prepared for the fall season to be a very competitive selling environment.
I want to talk briefly about our Direct-to-Consumer business, where we are very pleased with the growth we have achieved. We want to sustain that growth going forward and are taking steps to do that, including adding resources, upgrading and expanding our platforms and continuing to allocate more inventory to Direct-to-Consumer. 
We continue to be very focused on the key initiatives we laid out on previous earnings calls to drive improvements in our operating margin and return it toward historical levels. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Jonathan."

So as Eric mentioned, I'll be making reference to our investor presentation on a number of occasions during these comments.

So as Eric mentioned, I'll be making reference to our investor presentation on a number of occasions during these comments. 
For the second quarter, the company's net sales increased 17% to $745.8 million and comp store sales increased 5%. Our Direct-to-Consumer business up 50% for the quarter and new International stores made significant contributions to our sales growth. International sales in total were $133 million, up 85% for the quarter. A number of key sales metrics are included on Page 5 of the investor presentation. 
Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 65.1%, down 150 basis points. The erosion of gross margin was primarily due to a 15% decrease in AUR for the quarter, which was partially offset by a reduction in average unit cost. 
A summary of our operating expenses is included on Page 7 of the investor presentation. As a percentage of sales and excluding an impairment charge of $2.2 million, stores and distribution expense for the quarter decreased to 48.6% of sales from 52.1% last year. Store occupancy costs for the quarter, excluding the impairment charge, was slightly below $160 million. For the third quarter, we anticipate store occupancy costs to be around $168 million. All other stores and distribution expense were approximately $203 million or 27.2% of sales for the quarter. For the third quarter, we anticipate all of the stores and distribution as a percentage of sales to be close to the 25.2% of sales they represented in the third quarter of 2009. 
MG&A for the quarter was $95.2 million, up 10% from $86.7 million in the second quarter last year. MG&A for the quarter included total equity and incentive comps of $11.6 million, as compared to $7.3 million last year. Also included in the MG&A is a $1.5 million net benefit of legal settlements offset by an adjustment to the SERP [Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan] accrual. For the third quarter, we expect MG&A to be up in a mid-teen percentage, driven by higher equity and incentive comp, higher net legal expenses and additional marketing investments.  
Operating margin for the quarter was 4%, excluding impairment charge, and represented a 260 basis points improvement over last year. The tax rate for the quarter was 27.2% and benefited from the resolution of certain state and federal items during the quarter. On a full-year basis, we expect the effective tax rate to be around 37%. However, the rate remains quite sensitive to the Domestic/International profit mix.
Net income for the quarter was $19.5 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, including a $0.02 loss per diluted share relating to the impairment charge. 
Turning to 2010 store openings. Page 9 of the investor presentation recaps our confirmed flagship openings. We also remain on track to open our first International Gilly store in London in the fourth quarter. Page 10 of the investor presentation summarizes our expected cumulative International store openings through the end of 2010. 
With regard to Hollister International stores, we are now expecting approximately 20 openings for the year, down from our prior estimate of 25. This reflects a lower-than-expected conversion rate, in some cases due to landlords being unable to deliver agreed space. As Mike said earlier, we are working hard to ensure that we have sufficient deals in the pipeline to meet our future objectives for International Hollister openings and have added resources to fulfill that fulfill that objective. Included in our expected 2010 Hollister openings are three stores in Spain. Domestically, we expect to open three A&F stores, including our first store in Puerto Rico, three kids stores, three Hollister stores, two Gilly stores and five outlet stores. We will also open one A&F store in Canada. 
Coming back to store closures. Over the past few months, we have reviewed our underperforming stores, with a particular focus on leases expiring in the next couple of years. Based on that review, we expect to close a total of approximately 60 Domestic stores over the course of 2010, predominantly at the end of the year. Most of these closures will be by way of natural lease expirations, and in the A&F and kids brands. In addition, we have a number of stores where we expect to complete buyouts or otherwise close earlier than the lease expiration date.
In addition to 2010 closures, we currently expect approximately 50 additional stores to close during 2011, predominantly by way of natural lease expirations, but including a small number of early closures. The total number of closures could increase if we are able to negotiate additional buyouts on underperforming stores, with later lease expirations. The impairment charge of $2.2 million taken in the quarter relates to stores currently expected to close earlier than their natural lease expirations, most of which were included in prior impairment charges. We anticipate incurring some additional charges for store closures related to lease buyouts, debranding costs and other items. And we’ll disclose these charges as they are incurred. 
Inventory at the end of the second quarter was up 47% at cost compared to year ago. The composition of this increase in dollar terms is shown on Page 12 of the investor presentation and comprises $25 million for higher spring carryover, $25 million for higher on-hand basic inventory, $61 million for higher on-hand full inventory and $44 million for high inventory in transit. In particular, given the wear-now trend of the business, we are comfortable with our higher spring carryover. 
With regard to fall and basic inventory, the increase includes a significant change in the timing of receipts compared to last year. We believe this is necessary to correct for the fact that we were significantly under-inventoried from the low presentation standards coming into the fall season last year. 
For the full season as a whole, we have bought to a mid-single digit comp, in addition to which we have added inventory to support high growth rates in DTC and in our International business. We expect the inventory levels to remain significantly elevated on a year-over-year basis at the end of the third quarter, before moderating at the end of the year. 
We now expect total CapEx for 2010 to be approximately $200 million, including $160 million related to new stores, store refreshes and remodels, and approximately $40 million related to IT, DC and other home office projects. The reduction in CapEx is a result of lower store openings combined with achieving CapEx reductions on committed projects.
This concludes our prepared comment section of the call. We are now available to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question, so that we can speak with as many callers possible. After everyone has had a chance, we will be happy to take follow-up questions. Thank you."

A few of those have already closed in the first half of the year, but most of them will be at the end of the year. Most of them are natural lease expirations, but we do have some buyouts we anticipate, as well as some kick-outs and other early closures, which are the ones that drive the impairment charge. Roughly speaking, those stores are averaging about $1 million of volume each. And that particular group of stores has roughly flat EBITDA on a four-wall basis on an annualized basis. That excludes other costs outside of the four-wall, and obviously that doesn't pick up any transfer of business to DTC or other brands or other stores. So we think the overall effect of closing them will be positive to EBITDA because of that. For 2011, the number is a little less solid at this point, just because it's further away. But as we said, we have about 50 stores that, at this point, we would expect to close. And we have a number of stores beyond both of those populations that we would be very interested in closing if we were able to agree economically acceptable buyouts with the landlords.

But clearly, we're very happy with the performance of the other Hollister stores we have in Europe, as well as the International flagships, which remain roughly around that $200 million aggregate volume between the three International locations we spoke to at the beginning of the year. Currency impact for the quarter on sales was under 1% year-over-year, so pretty modest. It's something we continue to look at closely. We spend a lot of time taking our Board through all of the components of FX risk. We talked a little bit about that in the past. We do, do some hedging. We stress-test our deals, looking at the currency low over a five-year period, which all of the currencies today are still above. So we spend a lot of time thinking about that and how we can mitigate the risk. But clearly perhaps the single most important factor in that is that the high operating margins we start with reach through the stores, which gives us some cushion against any currency exposure. Going forward, increasing the diversification of our global presence will also be an important part of that, so that we’re diversified on a currency basis. And then there are other things that we can do over time, including continuing to evolve our hedging strategy."

The malls in which those stores are in are predominantly C malls. The concentration of stores we're closing this year, relative to the total population, is partly a function of the fact that these were the malls that, at the end of the A&F chain expansion, were the malls we were going into roughly 10 years ago. And they were frankly, in most cases, never particularly good stores. And if you look at how they performed over the last few years, they've sort of consistently underperformed the other metrics of the chain and, in most cases, gradually got relatively worse than the chain. So we feel as well as the economics of closing these stores, this also helps us with the overall brand positioning. And as Mike spoke to earlier, if you look at the higher end of the A&F chain and the tourist stores, things have been going extremely well. They've been relatively outperforming. We typically don’t do the promotions there, which I think has just added more impetus to the heart of these lower-end stores."

I think we previously said mid-30s, so it's going to be the higher end of that range. What happened during the quarter was that we had some provision to return adjustments as a result of tax years being closed out. And we also resolved some pending tax matters that essentially -- I mean, at this point, we have no FIN 48 liabilities left on the books. So it's essentially some fairly significant pending items that have now been resolved. And relative to what we had accrued for them, we got a benefit in the quarter which rolls through into that overall effective rate projection for the year.

Thank you for joining us. We are pleased with the progress we’re making as we pursue our strategy of leveraging the international appeal of our iconic brands to build a highly profitable, sustainable global business. We achieved",764,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We are pleased with the progress we’re making as we pursue our strategy of leveraging the international appeal of our iconic brands to build a highly profitable, sustainable global business. We achieved growth both domestically and internationally during the quarter. We are gaining traction and we are very excited by what we see ahead of us.
In that context, I want to take a few minutes to recap how we see the state of our business today and to talk about our progress on some of the key initiatives we have discussed in recent calls. 
Starting with our Domestic business, we are pleased that all of the brands achieved positive comps for the quarter. We are particularly pleased with the performance of the flagship and tourist stores both an absolute and a relative basis. Year-to-date, our U.S. tourist stores produced double-digit comps. And, as you know, we operate these locations without many of the sale events and promotions that we have run in the rest of the chain. At the same time, we are also pleased that our non-tourist stores for all brands were in positive territory for the quarter. I want to make special mention of Hollister Epic store in SoHo, which has posted very strong comps since it entered the comp base a few weeks ago.
Next, we believe that our marketing and promotional activities for the quarter were effective and appropriately timed. We also believe that the promotions were effective in driving overall gross profit dollars. Substantially, all of the promotions we ran during the quarter were planned in advance and were driven by our expectation that they would be effective in driving sales productivity and gross profit dollars. 
As we said at the beginning of the year, we are willing to tolerate some gross margin rate erosion in the near term to accomplish that. While it is too early to speak to back-to-school results, I can also tell you that I feel very good about the look and feel of our stores today. We have great product in both men's and women's. We are gaining traction with trends. And importantly, we have inventory behind these trends. 
The marketing in all of the brands is exciting and energetic, and we are engaging with our customer in ways that promote some of our key back-to-school items. We have an appropriate mix of fashion and basic items in the assortment, and we intentionally took a more wear-now approach to our back-to-school floor set. 
Most importantly, I feel that we are now properly organized in merchandising, planning and design to deliver sustainable growth domestically and internationally. Having said that, the performance of a number of our Domestic stores remains unsatisfactory. And to that end, we remain committed to a store closure plan, particularly for the A&F and kids brands. Jonathan will provide details on this in a few minutes.
Moving to our International business. We are very happy with the performance of both our stores and Direct-to-Consumer business. Our U.K. Hollister stores continued to comp positively in aggregate for the quarter. The London flagship had double-digit comps for the quarter, and Milan and Ginza continued to perform well. 
We will be below our planned International Hollister openings for this year, but this does not reflect a lack of excellent opportunities for new stores. Importantly, we have already taken steps to add resources to ensure that we keep the pipeline full going forward. 
It is very important to our plans that we achieve an accelerated rate of openings in 2011. We continue to work on additional flagship opportunities for 2011, beyond those already announced, as well as a longer list of opportunities for 2012.
From a sourcing standpoint, the costing benefits we obtained in the quarter significantly cushioned the impact of the AUR reduction. We anticipate a modest cost benefit in the second half of the year, despite much higher raw material costs. We are prepared for the fall season to be a very competitive selling environment.
I want to talk briefly about our Direct-to-Consumer business, where we are very pleased with the growth we have achieved. We want to sustain that growth going forward and are taking steps to do that, including adding resources, upgrading and expanding our platforms and continuing to allocate more inventory to Direct-to-Consumer. 
We continue to be very focused on the key initiatives we laid out on previous earnings calls to drive improvements in our operating margin and return it toward historical levels. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Jonathan."

So as Eric mentioned, I'll be making reference to our investor presentation on a number of occasions during these comments.

So as Eric mentioned, I'll be making reference to our investor presentation on a number of occasions during these comments. 
For the second quarter, the company's net sales increased 17% to $745.8 million and comp store sales increased 5%. Our Direct-to-Consumer business up 50% for the quarter and new International stores made significant contributions to our sales growth. International sales in total were $133 million, up 85% for the quarter. A number of key sales metrics are included on Page 5 of the investor presentation. 
Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 65.1%, down 150 basis points. The erosion of gross margin was primarily due to a 15% decrease in AUR for the quarter, which was partially offset by a reduction in average unit cost. 
A summary of our operating expenses is included on Page 7 of the investor presentation. As a percentage of sales and excluding an impairment charge of $2.2 million, stores and distribution expense for the quarter decreased to 48.6% of sales from 52.1% last year. Store occupancy costs for the quarter, excluding the impairment charge, was slightly below $160 million. For the third quarter, we anticipate store occupancy costs to be around $168 million. All other stores and distribution expense were approximately $203 million or 27.2% of sales for the quarter. For the third quarter, we anticipate all of the stores and distribution as a percentage of sales to be close to the 25.2% of sales they represented in the third quarter of 2009. 
MG&A for the quarter was $95.2 million, up 10% from $86.7 million in the second quarter last year. MG&A for the quarter included total equity and incentive comps of $11.6 million, as compared to $7.3 million last year. Also included in the MG&A is a $1.5 million net benefit of legal settlements offset by an adjustment to the SERP [Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan] accrual. For the third quarter, we expect MG&A to be up in a mid-teen percentage, driven by higher equity and incentive comp, higher net legal expenses and additional marketing investments.  
Operating margin for the quarter was 4%, excluding impairment charge, and represented a 260 basis points improvement over last year. The tax rate for the quarter was 27.2% and benefited from the resolution of certain state and federal items during the quarter. On a full-year basis, we expect the effective tax rate to be around 37%. However, the rate remains quite sensitive to the Domestic/International profit mix.
Net income for the quarter was $19.5 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, including a $0.02 loss per diluted share relating to the impairment charge. 
Turning to 2010 store openings. Page 9 of the investor presentation recaps our confirmed flagship openings. We also remain on track to open our first International Gilly store in London in the fourth quarter. Page 10 of the investor presentation summarizes our expected cumulative International store openings through the end of 2010. 
With regard to Hollister International stores, we are now expecting approximately 20 openings for the year, down from our prior estimate of 25. This reflects a lower-than-expected conversion rate, in some cases due to landlords being unable to deliver agreed space. As Mike said earlier, we are working hard to ensure that we have sufficient deals in the pipeline to meet our future objectives for International Hollister openings and have added resources to fulfill that fulfill that objective. Included in our expected 2010 Hollister openings are three stores in Spain. Domestically, we expect to open three A&F stores, including our first store in Puerto Rico, three kids stores, three Hollister stores, two Gilly stores and five outlet stores. We will also open one A&F store in Canada. 
Coming back to store closures. Over the past few months, we have reviewed our underperforming stores, with a particular focus on leases expiring in the next couple of years. Based on that review, we expect to close a total of approximately 60 Domestic stores over the course of 2010, predominantly at the end of the year. Most of these closures will be by way of natural lease expirations, and in the A&F and kids brands. In addition, we have a number of stores where we expect to complete buyouts or otherwise close earlier than the lease expiration date.
In addition to 2010 closures, we currently expect approximately 50 additional stores to close during 2011, predominantly by way of natural lease expirations, but including a small number of early closures. The total number of closures could increase if we are able to negotiate additional buyouts on underperforming stores, with later lease expirations. The impairment charge of $2.2 million taken in the quarter relates to stores currently expected to close earlier than their natural lease expirations, most of which were included in prior impairment charges. We anticipate incurring some additional charges for store closures related to lease buyouts, debranding costs and other items. And we’ll disclose these charges as they are incurred. 
Inventory at the end of the second quarter was up 47% at cost compared to year ago. The composition of this increase in dollar terms is shown on Page 12 of the investor presentation and comprises $25 million for higher spring carryover, $25 million for higher on-hand basic inventory, $61 million for higher on-hand full inventory and $44 million for high inventory in transit. In particular, given the wear-now trend of the business, we are comfortable with our higher spring carryover. 
With regard to fall and basic inventory, the increase includes a significant change in the timing of receipts compared to last year. We believe this is necessary to correct for the fact that we were significantly under-inventoried from the low presentation standards coming into the fall season last year. 
For the full season as a whole, we have bought to a mid-single digit comp, in addition to which we have added inventory to support high growth rates in DTC and in our International business. We expect the inventory levels to remain significantly elevated on a year-over-year basis at the end of the third quarter, before moderating at the end of the year. 
We now expect total CapEx for 2010 to be approximately $200 million, including $160 million related to new stores, store refreshes and remodels, and approximately $40 million related to IT, DC and other home office projects. The reduction in CapEx is a result of lower store openings combined with achieving CapEx reductions on committed projects.
This concludes our prepared comment section of the call. We are now available to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question, so that we can speak with as many callers possible. After everyone has had a chance, we will be happy to take follow-up questions. Thank you."

The flagship openings, we did state that we still have an opportunity to open more 2011 stores and we do, and we're very close to being able to announce that.

A few of those have already closed in the first half of the year, but most of them will be at the end of the year. Most of them are natural lease expirations, but we do have some buyouts we anticipate, as well as some kick-outs and other early closures, which are the ones that drive the impairment charge. Roughly speaking, those stores are averaging about $1 million of volume each. And that particular group of stores has roughly flat EBITDA on a four-wall basis on an annualized basis. That excludes other costs outside of the four-wall, and obviously that doesn't pick up any transfer of business to DTC or other brands or other stores. So we think the overall effect of closing them will be positive to EBITDA because of that. For 2011, the number is a little less solid at this point, just because it's further away. But as we said, we have about 50 stores that, at this point, we would expect to close. And we have a number of stores beyond both of those populations that we would be very interested in closing if we were able to agree economically acceptable buyouts with the landlords. So that sort of remains on the docket and it’s something we’re going to continue to work through."

But clearly, we're very happy with the performance of the other Hollister stores we have in Europe, as well as the International flagships, which remain roughly around that $200 million aggregate volume between the three International locations we spoke to at the beginning of the year. Currency impact for the quarter on sales was under 1% year-over-year, so pretty modest. It's something we continue to look at closely. We spend a lot of time taking our board through all of the components of FX risk. We talked a little bit about that in the past. We do, do some hedging. We stress-test our deals, looking at the currency low over a five-year period, which all of the currencies today are still above. So we spend a lot of time thinking about that and how we can mitigate the risk. But clearly perhaps the single most important factor in that is that the high operating margins we start with reach through the stores, which gives us some cushion against any currency exposure. Going forward, increasing the diversification of our global presence will also be an important part of that, so that we’re diversified on a currency basis. And then there are other things that we can do over time, including continuing to evolve our hedging strategy."

There were a couple of stores that just pushed out into the spring, then a couple that have fallen through. I think, yes, the main conclusion we've drawn from it is that our traditional conversion rates in the U.S. are going to be somewhat lower internationally, particularly as we get into new countries and as we learn those markets. So the main conclusion is that we have to have more opportunities in the top of the funnel to drop through our required number of completed deals for each year. So that's what we're working very hard to effect, and to make sure we have enough deals in the pipeline to get to where we want to be in 2011 in terms of signed and completed deals."

The malls in which those stores are in are predominantly C malls. The concentration of stores we're closing this year, relative to the total population, is partly a function of the fact that these were the malls that, at the end of the A&F chain expansion, were the malls we were going into roughly 10 years ago. And they were frankly, in most cases, never particularly good stores. And if you look at how they performed over the last few years, they've sort of consistently underperformed the other metrics of the chain and, in most cases, gradually got relatively worse than the chain. So we feel as well as the economics of closing these stores, this also helps us with the overall brand positioning. And as Mike spoke to earlier, if you look at the higher end of the A&F chain and the tourist stores, things have been going extremely well. They've been relatively outperforming. We typically don’t do the promotions there, which I think has just added more impetus to the heart of these lower-end stores."

I think we previously said mid-30s, so it's going to be the higher end of that range. What happened during the quarter was that we had some provision to return adjustments as a result of tax years being closed out. And we also resolved some pending tax matters that essentially -- I mean, at this point, we have no FIN 48 liabilities left on the books. So it's essentially some fairly significant pending items that have now been resolved. And relative to what we had accrued for them, we got a benefit in the quarter which rolls through into that overall effective rate projection for the year. As we said on the call, the rate is still quite sensitive to the Domestic/International profit mix, so it could still move around a little bit if that mix moves further.

We achieved",764,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We are pleased with the progress we’re making as we pursue our strategy of leveraging the international appeal of our iconic brands to build a highly profitable, sustainable global business. We achieved growth both domestically and internationally during the quarter. We are gaining traction and we are very excited by what we see ahead of us.
In that context, I want to take a few minutes to recap how we see the state of our business today and to talk about our progress on some of the key initiatives we have discussed in recent calls. 
Starting with our Domestic business, we are pleased that all of the brands achieved positive comps for the quarter. We are particularly pleased with the performance of the flagship and tourist stores both an absolute and a relative basis. Year-to-date, our U.S. tourist stores produced double-digit comps. And, as you know, we operate these locations without many of the sale events and promotions that we have run in the rest of the chain. At the same time, we are also pleased that our non-tourist stores for all brands were in positive territory for the quarter. I want to make special mention of Hollister Epic store in SoHo, which has posted very strong comps since it entered the comp base a few weeks ago.
Next, we believe that our marketing and promotional activities for the quarter were effective and appropriately timed. We also believe that the promotions were effective in driving overall gross profit dollars. Substantially, all of the promotions we ran during the quarter were planned in advance and were driven by our expectation that they would be effective in driving sales productivity and gross profit dollars. 
As we said at the beginning of the year, we are willing to tolerate some gross margin rate erosion in the near term to accomplish that. While it is too early to speak to back-to-school results, I can also tell you that I feel very good about the look and feel of our stores today. We have great product in both men's and women's. We are gaining traction with trends. And importantly, we have inventory behind these trends. 
The marketing in all of the brands is exciting and energetic, and we are engaging with our customer in ways that promote some of our key back-to-school items. We have an appropriate mix of fashion and basic items in the assortment, and we intentionally took a more wear-now approach to our back-to-school floor set. 
Most importantly, I feel that we are now properly organized in merchandising, planning and design to deliver sustainable growth domestically and internationally. Having said that, the performance of a number of our Domestic stores remains unsatisfactory. And to that end, we remain committed to a store closure plan, particularly for the A&F and kids brands. Jonathan will provide details on this in a few minutes.
Moving to our International business. We are very happy with the performance of both our stores and Direct-to-Consumer business. Our U.K. Hollister stores continued to comp positively in aggregate for the quarter. The London flagship had double-digit comps for the quarter, and Milan and Ginza continued to perform well. 
We will be below our planned International Hollister openings for this year, but this does not reflect a lack of excellent opportunities for new stores. Importantly, we have already taken steps to add resources to ensure that we keep the pipeline full going forward. 
It is very important to our plans that we achieve an accelerated rate of openings in 2011. We continue to work on additional flagship opportunities for 2011, beyond those already announced, as well as a longer list of opportunities for 2012.
From a sourcing standpoint, the costing benefits we obtained in the quarter significantly cushioned the impact of the AUR reduction. We anticipate a modest cost benefit in the second half of the year, despite much higher raw material costs. We are prepared for the fall season to be a very competitive selling environment.
I want to talk briefly about our Direct-to-Consumer business, where we are very pleased with the growth we have achieved. We want to sustain that growth going forward and are taking steps to do that, including adding resources, upgrading and expanding our platforms and continuing to allocate more inventory to Direct-to-Consumer. 
We continue to be very focused on the key initiatives we laid out on previous earnings calls to drive improvements in our operating margin and return it toward historical levels. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Jonathan."

So as Eric mentioned, I'll be making reference to our investor presentation on a number of occasions during these comments. 
For the second quarter, the company's net sales increased 17% to $745.8 million and comp store sales increased 5%. Our Direct-to-Consumer business up 50% for the quarter and new International stores made significant contributions to our sales growth. International sales in total were $133 million, up 85% for the quarter. A number of key sales metrics are included on Page 5 of the investor presentation. 
Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 65.1%, down 150 basis points. The erosion of gross margin was primarily due to a 15% decrease in AUR for the quarter, which was partially offset by a reduction in average unit cost. 
A summary of our operating expenses is included on Page 7 of the investor presentation. As a percentage of sales and excluding an impairment charge of $2.2 million, stores and distribution expense for the quarter decreased to 48.6% of sales from 52.1% last year. Store occupancy costs for the quarter, excluding the impairment charge, was slightly below $160 million. For the third quarter, we anticipate store occupancy costs to be around $168 million. All other stores and distribution expense were approximately $203 million or 27.2% of sales for the quarter. For the third quarter, we anticipate all of the stores and distribution as a percentage of sales to be close to the 25.2% of sales they represented in the third quarter of 2009. 
MG&A for the quarter was $95.2 million, up 10% from $86.7 million in the second quarter last year. MG&A for the quarter included total equity and incentive comps of $11.6 million, as compared to $7.3 million last year. Also included in the MG&A is a $1.5 million net benefit of legal settlements offset by an adjustment to the SERP [Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan] accrual. For the third quarter, we expect MG&A to be up in a mid-teen percentage, driven by higher equity and incentive comp, higher net legal expenses and additional marketing investments.  
Operating margin for the quarter was 4%, excluding impairment charge, and represented a 260 basis points improvement over last year. The tax rate for the quarter was 27.2% and benefited from the resolution of certain state and federal items during the quarter. On a full-year basis, we expect the effective tax rate to be around 37%. However, the rate remains quite sensitive to the Domestic/International profit mix.
Net income for the quarter was $19.5 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, including a $0.02 loss per diluted share relating to the impairment charge. 
Turning to 2010 store openings. Page 9 of the investor presentation recaps our confirmed flagship openings. We also remain on track to open our first International Gilly store in London in the fourth quarter. Page 10 of the investor presentation summarizes our expected cumulative International store openings through the end of 2010. 
With regard to Hollister International stores, we are now expecting approximately 20 openings for the year, down from our prior estimate of 25. This reflects a lower-than-expected conversion rate, in some cases due to landlords being unable to deliver agreed space. As Mike said earlier, we are working hard to ensure that we have sufficient deals in the pipeline to meet our future objectives for International Hollister openings and have added resources to fulfill that fulfill that objective. Included in our expected 2010 Hollister openings are three stores in Spain. Domestically, we expect to open three A&F stores, including our first store in Puerto Rico, three kids stores, three Hollister stores, two Gilly stores and five outlet stores. We will also open one A&F store in Canada. 
Coming back to store closures. Over the past few months, we have reviewed our underperforming stores, with a particular focus on leases expiring in the next couple of years. Based on that review, we expect to close a total of approximately 60 Domestic stores over the course of 2010, predominantly at the end of the year. Most of these closures will be by way of natural lease expirations, and in the A&F and kids brands. In addition, we have a number of stores where we expect to complete buyouts or otherwise close earlier than the lease expiration date.
In addition to 2010 closures, we currently expect approximately 50 additional stores to close during 2011, predominantly by way of natural lease expirations, but including a small number of early closures. The total number of closures could increase if we are able to negotiate additional buyouts on underperforming stores, with later lease expirations. The impairment charge of $2.2 million taken in the quarter relates to stores currently expected to close earlier than their natural lease expirations, most of which were included in prior impairment charges. We anticipate incurring some additional charges for store closures related to lease buyouts, debranding costs and other items. And we’ll disclose these charges as they are incurred. 
Inventory at the end of the second quarter was up 47% at cost compared to year ago. The composition of this increase in dollar terms is shown on Page 12 of the investor presentation and comprises $25 million for higher spring carryover, $25 million for higher on-hand basic inventory, $61 million for higher on-hand full inventory and $44 million for high inventory in transit. In particular, given the wear-now trend of the business, we are comfortable with our higher spring carryover. 
With regard to fall and basic inventory, the increase includes a significant change in the timing of receipts compared to last year. We believe this is necessary to correct for the fact that we were significantly under-inventoried from the low presentation standards coming into the fall season last year. 
For the full season as a whole, we have bought to a mid-single digit comp, in addition to which we have added inventory to support high growth rates in DTC and in our International business. We expect the inventory levels to remain significantly elevated on a year-over-year basis at the end of the third quarter, before moderating at the end of the year. 
We now expect total CapEx for 2010 to be approximately $200 million, including $160 million related to new stores, store refreshes and remodels, and approximately $40 million related to IT, DC and other home office projects. The reduction in CapEx is a result of lower store openings combined with achieving CapEx reductions on committed projects.
This concludes our prepared comment section of the call. We are now available to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question, so that we can speak with as many callers possible. After everyone has had a chance, we will be happy to take follow-up questions. Thank you."

A few of those have already closed in the first half of the year, but most of them will be at the end of the year. Most of them are natural lease expirations, but we do have some buyouts we anticipate, as well as some kick-outs and other early closures, which are the ones that drive the impairment charge. Roughly speaking, those stores are averaging about $1 million of volume each. And that particular group of stores has roughly flat EBITDA on a four-wall basis on an annualized basis. That excludes other costs outside of the four-wall, and obviously that doesn't pick up any transfer of business to DTC or other brands or other stores. So we think the overall effect of closing them will be positive to EBITDA because of that. For 2011, the number is a little less solid at this point, just because it's further away. But as we said, we have about 50 stores that, at this point, we would expect to close. And we have a number of stores beyond both of those populations that we would be very interested in closing if we were able to agree economically acceptable buyouts with the landlords. So that sort of remains on the docket and it’s something we’re going to continue to work through."

But clearly, we're very happy with the performance of the other Hollister stores we have in Europe, as well as the International flagships, which remain roughly around that $200 million aggregate volume between the three International locations we spoke to at the beginning of the year. Currency impact for the quarter on sales was under 1% year-over-year, so pretty modest. It's something we continue to look at closely. We spend a lot of time taking our board through all of the components of FX risk. We talked a little bit about that in the past. We do, do some hedging. We stress-test our deals, looking at the currency low over a five-year period, which all of the currencies today are still above. So we spend a lot of time thinking about that and how we can mitigate the risk. But clearly perhaps the single most important factor in that is that the high operating margins we start with reach through the stores, which gives us some cushion against any currency exposure. Going forward, increasing the diversification of our global presence will also be an important part of that, so that we’re diversified on a currency basis. And then there are other things that we can do over time, including continuing to evolve our hedging strategy."

The malls in which those stores are in are predominantly C malls. The concentration of stores we're closing this year, relative to the total population, is partly a function of the fact that these were the malls that, at the end of the A&F chain expansion, were the malls we were going into roughly 10 years ago. And they were frankly, in most cases, never particularly good stores. And if you look at how they performed over the last few years, they've sort of consistently underperformed the other metrics of the chain and, in most cases, gradually got relatively worse than the chain. So we feel as well as the economics of closing these stores, this also helps us with the overall brand positioning. And as Mike spoke to earlier, if you look at the higher end of the A&F chain and the tourist stores, things have been going extremely well. They've been relatively outperforming. We typically don’t do the promotions there, which I think has just added more impetus to the heart of these lower-end stores."

With AUR being lower, the number of units in that inventory is somewhat greater than the percentage increase in inventory at cost. I can’t give you a precise number, but that's directionally the case. On the tax rate, we’re saying approximately an effective rate of 37% for the full year. I think we previously said mid-30s, so it's going to be the higher end of that range. What happened during the quarter was that we had some provision to return adjustments as a result of tax years being closed out. And we also resolved some pending tax matters that essentially -- I mean, at this point, we have no FIN 48 liabilities left on the books. So it's essentially some fairly significant pending items that have now been resolved. And relative to what we had accrued for them, we got a benefit in the quarter which rolls through into that overall effective rate projection for the year. As we said on the call, the rate is still quite sensitive to the Domestic/International profit mix, so it could still move around a little bit if that mix moves further.

One, improving Domestic productivity, which includes reviewing underperforming stores. That we continue to do. Achieve accretive International growth. That we continue to focus on. Returning gross margin to historical levels. We continue to push for that and we think that over time, we will get there. Our point of view hasn't changed about that. Maintain tight expense controls, which we continue to do. Achieve the Gilly Hicks roadmap goals, which we believe we are doing. And Direct-to-Consumer growth. These are all the levers for this 15% number.

But simply put, we are pleased with our performance against our objectives for the quarter and remained very excited about the opportunities",882,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Jonathan will talk to the specifics of the quarter in a moment. But simply put, we are pleased with our performance against our objectives for the quarter and remained very excited about the opportunities ahead of us across all areas of our business. Our Domestic business has continued to improve, our International results are outstanding, and our Direct-to-Consumer business is posting very strong growth.
We will share more details coming into 2011, but I want to take a few minutes to recap where we stand on our key roadmap objectives to achieve an operating margin of 15% or better, our goal for fiscal 2012.
As you recall, these include: improvements in domestic productivity, including store closures; returning gross margin to historical levels; driving significantly accretive international growth; driving our Direct-to-Consumer business through an increased strategic focus; doing all this while maintaining tight control of expenses; and last, fulfilling the potential of Gilly Hicks.
I will start with what appears today to be the most challenging of these objectives, returning our gross margin to historical levels of around 67%. We feel good about the elements of this objective that are under our control, namely, benefiting from a growing international component of our business, and turning the corner on domestic AURs. However, cost pressures from raw materials and labor costs have only increased as we have gone through the year, and transportation costs remain at very high levels.
We think it is possible that some of these factors, such as cotton costs, may abate somewhat. But that is not something we can count on. We expect to make progress on gross margin in the first half of 2011 overall. However, for receipts later in the season, costs are escalating significantly, and visibility beyond that is limited.
Aside from the gross margin objective, we are positive about the other components of our road map objectives. On domestic productivity, our objective is to be at 85% or better of 2007 productivity by 2012. We've made solid progress on that this year-to-date, with some strengthening as the year has gone on. And the domestic closures scheduled for this year and next will help. Beyond that, we will need mid-single digit increases and same-store sales in each of the next two years. We intend to achieve this by continuing to provide an assortment that is trend right, premium quality and offers a healthy balance of fashion and basic heritage items.
Over the last year, we have become much better at how we deliver fashion-right assortments with attractive price points, and we'll continue to improve on this process as we push for sales improvement.
Moving to our International business, we crossed a milestone this quarter with the opening of our first Hollister stores in Spain, one in Madrid and one in Barcelona. Both are running ahead of projections. We also opened our second Hollister store in Germany, in Oberhousen, and early signs are that this will reaffirm the very strong response we saw to our first opening in Germany last year. Meanwhile, our U.K. Hollister stores comped double digits for the quarter, and our Italian business got even stronger.
Looking forward, we need to accelerate our Hollister expansion in 2011 and 2012, beyond the 20 stores we will open this year, and are putting a huge amount of effort into making that happen. The focus is equally strong on A&F Flagship opportunities, and in both cases, we expect to give more concrete guidance coming into 2011. We are also looking very hard at the pipeline further out, to make sure we are fully capitalizing on the opportunity ahead of us.
Turning to Direct-to-Consumer, our business is up 40% year-to-date, with both International and Domestic up strongly. The Direct-to-Consumer business now represents around 10% of our business, and we continue to believe strongly in the growth opportunity it offers. Over the course of this year, we have made or will be making many different investments in our Direct-to-Consumer business, including headcount. Additionally, we have launched mobile sites, added on figure key looks, improved the shop-ability of our sites, are adding much stronger analytic capabilities and are experimenting with paid search and other initiatives. We have also invested in country-specific websites in each of the countries where we currently have store locations. 
On expenses, we are maintaining a strong focus on validating ROI, and our visibility to that has been enhanced by a new budgeting and reporting system in place for our current budget cycle, as well as continuing improvements in our [ph] camping ability.
Finally, turning to Gilly Hicks. Our like stores are comping in the 40s year-to-date, on track with our productivity goals. We are looking forward to our first U.K. opening on Saturday, November 27 in London. If anyone happens to be in London over Thanksgiving weekend, hopefully, you'll notice some buzz around that.
In summary, these are very exciting times for us. There's a huge amount of work to be done to execute our plans, but we have a very clear view of what we need to do, and I know that we have the team in place to get it done. A team obsessed with enhancing our iconic brands.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Jonathan."

Our results for the quarter are summarized on Page 3 of the investor presentation, and I'll start with the highlights of those results.
Sales for the third quarter were up 18% to $886 million, including our comp store sales increase of 7%. These results were very close to what we had planned coming into the quarter. Our DTC business was up 32% for the quarter, our International sales were up 87% for the quarter and represented 18.5% of total sales. Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 63.7%, down 40 basis points versus last year. This was slightly better than we had anticipated as a result of a currency benefit and lower freight costs than originally budgeted. We now expect a similar level of erosion in the fourth quarter and that the gross margin rate for the season as a whole will, therefore, be slightly below our prior expectations. A summary of operating expenses is included on Page 7 of the investor presentation. Overall, operating expenses for the quarter came in somewhat lower than anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. 
Store occupancy costs were $165 million, lower than expected due to lower depreciation charges. We anticipate fourth quarter store occupancy costs to be in the high 160s, excluding costs associated with store closures and potential impairment charges, resulting from our annual review of store-related assets.
All other stores and distribution expenses were approximately $220 million or 24.8% of sales for the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate a continued modest leverage benefit in these expenses versus last year.
MG&A for the quarter was $103 million, up 17% to last year. This was at the higher end of the midteen percentage growth we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter primarily due to higher incentive comp. MG&A for the quarter included total equity and incentive comp of $15.6 million compared to $10.3 million last year, accounting for approximately 600 basis points of the increase.
The impact with insurance recovery in the prior year accounted for approximately another 300 basis points of the increase. For the fourth quarter, we expect MG&A to be up slightly above the third quarter in dollar terms. Operating margin for the quarter was 8.8% and represented a 250 basis point improvement over last year. The tax rate for the quarter was 35.6% compared to a benefit of 4.7% from the third quarter of 2009. The 2009 rate was favorably impacted by a true-up in the year-to-date rate. On a full-year basis for 2010, we now expect the effective rate to be around 35%. Net income for the quarter was $0.56 per diluted share. 
Turning to inventory. Total inventory at quarter end was up 47% of costs versus last year, or up 43%, excluding inventory in-transit. This was in line with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. We expect the year-over-year inventory increase to moderate towards a closer alignment with sales at the end of the year.
We remain comfortable with our inventory levels, which we believe are appropriate to drive the business. We ended the quarter with approximately $618 million in cash and cash equivalents and outstanding borrowings and letters of credit of approximately $68 million. During the quarter, we purchased 669,000 shares under the company's existing share buyback authorizations at a total cost of $29.2 million. Going forward, we expect this share buyback program to continue subject to performance, to market conditions and to a healthy net cash cushion. With regard to CapEx, we now expect total CapEx for 2010 to be approximately $190 million. 
Turning to the fourth quarter, a summary of our gross margin expense and tax rate expectations is included on Page 11 of the investor presentation.  Our store opening plans for the year are on track for the guidance previously given and reflected on Pages 12 and 13 of our investor presentation. With regard to closures, we now expect 2010 store closures to be slightly above the previous figure of 60 planned closures. As previously indicated, we will record additional charges in the fourth quarter associated with these closures.
This concludes our prepared comments section of the call, we're now available to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question, so that we can speak with as many callers as possible. If everyone has had a chance, we will be happy to take follow-up questions. Thank you."

I think going forward, it's hard for us to be too specific about what that spread is going to be. I think, because you've got a lot of things moving in and out of the comp base, there's typically something we haven't given guidance on in the past. But I think, your best way of getting there is to model in the volume of the stores that are opening during the quarter and some assumption about DTC.

And Janet, you understand this, our long-term objective in the business, which is our perspective, is long-term. And we've always believed that some problems could be opportunities. We were looking at this, this way. We think lots of people are going to take a lot out of their product at this time. We're not. We're going to use this opportunity to enhance the product offering, and we can get paid for it, particularly in international locations. The second point I'd like to make, and maybe this is the strongest point I'd like to make, is that our perspective is long-term.

And if you look at the season as a whole, we are pretty close to where we thought we were going to be.

So cash on hand less outstanding revolver drawdowns and LCs that we would never want to be below around $350 million, is our current thinking. So that's kind of one guardrail. I think on the other end, we've seen our share count creep up over the last couple of years due to equity plan issuances. And I think going forward, we were at the minimum look to offset those equity plan share issuances with buybacks. So that, really, the kind of two guardrails. Where we end up between those two guardrails will be a function of how we're feeling about business, how we see our cash flow requirements in general going forward, market conditions, obviously, and potentially other factors. But we would expect to be somewhere within that range.

We haven't specifically updated that, but clearly our results for the third quarter were consistent with that buying assumption for the season, and we haven't spoke to anything subsequent to that. On store closings in '11, we'd originally said $110 million over '10 and '11. Few of those are pulling forward into '10, but we'd still expect doing the $40 million to $50 million range in '11. The primary reason why those stores are unprofitable is low-volume, which does tend to result in very high, first of all, low growth margin rates. So closing those stores helps with the gross margin and then high occupancy costs as a percentage of sales in some cases although not all. So I think you're generally going to see -- I think, clearly, because we have to still staff them to minimum levels, those variable expense items tend to run as high percentage of sales. So I think you're going to see the impact on gross margin and then in both components of stores and distribution expenses from a leverage benefit.

Thank you for joining us. Jonathan will talk to the specifics of the quarter in a moment. But simply put, we are pleased with our performance against our objectives for the quarter and remained very excited about the opportunities",881,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Jonathan will talk to the specifics of the quarter in a moment. But simply put, we are pleased with our performance against our objectives for the quarter and remained very excited about the opportunities ahead of us across all areas of our business. Our Domestic business has continued to improve, our International results are outstanding, and our Direct-to-Consumer business is posting very strong growth.
We will share more details coming into 2011, but I want to take a few minutes to recap where we stand on our key roadmap objectives to achieve an operating margin of 15% or better, our goal for fiscal 2012.
As you recall, these include: Improvements in domestic productivity, including store closures; returning gross margin to historical levels; driving significantly accretive international growth; driving our Direct-to-Consumer business through an increased strategic focus; doing all this while maintaining tight control of expenses; and last, fulfilling the potential of Gilly Hicks.
I will start with what appears today to be the most challenging of these objectives, returning our gross margin to historical levels of around 67%. We feel good about the elements of this objective that are under our control, namely, benefiting from a growing international component of our business, and turning the corner on domestic AURs. However, cost pressures from raw materials and labor costs have only increased as we have gone through the year, and transportation costs remain at very high levels.
We think it is possible that some of these factors, such as cotton costs, may abate somewhat. But that is not something we can count on. We expect to make progress on gross margin in the first half of 2011 overall. However, for receipts later in the season, costs are escalating significantly, and visibility beyond that is limited.
Aside from the gross margin objective, we are positive about the other components of our road map objectives. On domestic productivity, our objective is to be at 85% or better of 2007 productivity by 2012. We've made solid progress on that this year-to-date, with some strengthening as the year has gone on. And the domestic closures scheduled for this year and next will help. Beyond that, we will need mid-single digit increases and same-store sales in each of the next two years. We intend to achieve this by continuing to provide an assortment that is trend right, premium quality and offers a healthy balance of fashion and basic heritage items.
Over the last year, we have become much better at how we deliver fashion-right assortments with attractive price points, and we'll continue to improve on this process as we push for sales improvement.
Moving to our International business, we crossed a milestone this quarter with the opening of our first Hollister stores in Spain, one in Madrid and one in Barcelona. Both are running ahead of projections. We also opened our second Hollister store in Germany, in Oberhausen, and early signs are that this will reaffirm the very strong response we saw to our first opening in Germany last year. Meanwhile, our U.K. Hollister stores comped double digits for the quarter, and our Italian business got even stronger.
Looking forward, we need to accelerate our Hollister expansion in 2011 and 2012, beyond the 20 stores we will open this year, and are putting a huge amount of effort into making that happen. The focus is equally strong on A&F Flagship opportunities, and in both cases, we expect to give more concrete guidance coming into 2011. We are also looking very hard at the pipeline further out, to make sure we are fully capitalizing on the opportunity ahead of us.
Turning to Direct-to-Consumer, our business is up 40% year-to-date, with both International and Domestic up strongly. The Direct-to-Consumer business now represents around 10% of our business, and we continue to believe strongly in the growth opportunity it offers. Over the course of this year, we have made or will be making many different investments in our Direct-to-Consumer business, including headcount. Additionally, we have launched mobile sites, added on figure key looks, improved the shop-ability of our sites, are adding much stronger analytic capabilities and are experimenting with paid search and other initiatives. We have also invested in country-specific websites in each of the countries where we currently have store locations. 
On expenses, we are maintaining a strong focus on validating ROI, and our visibility to that has been enhanced by a new budgeting and reporting system in place for our current budget cycle, as well as continuing improvements in our [ph] ability.
Finally, turning to Gilly Hicks. Our like stores are comping in the 40s year-to-date, on track with our productivity goals. We are looking forward to our first U.K. open on Saturday, November 27 in London. If anyone happens to be in London over Thanksgiving weekend, hopefully, you'll notice some buzz around that.
In summary, these are very exciting times for us. There's a huge amount of work to be done to execute our plans, but we have a very clear view of what we need to do, and I know that we have the team in place to get it done. A team obsessed with enhancing our iconic brands.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Jonathan."

And good morning, everyone. Our results for the quarter are summarized on Page 3 of the investor presentation, and I'll start with the highlights of those results.
Sales for the third quarter were up 18% to $886 million, including our comp store sales increase of 7%. These results were very close to what we had planned coming into the quarter. Our DTC business was up 32% for the quarter, our International sales were up 87% for the quarter and represented 18.5% of total sales. Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 63.7%, down 40 basis points versus last year. This was slightly better than we had anticipated as a result of a currency benefit and lower freight costs than originally budgeted. We now expect a similar level of erosion in the fourth quarter and that the gross margin rate for the season as a whole will, therefore, be slightly below our prior expectations. A summary of operating expenses is included on Page 7 of the investor presentation. Overall, operating expenses for the quarter came in somewhat lower than anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. 
Store occupancy costs were $165 million, lower than expected due to lower depreciation charges. We anticipate fourth quarter store occupancy costs to be in the high 160s, excluding costs associated with store closures and potential impairment charges, resulting from our annual review of store-related assets.
All other stores and distribution expenses were approximately $220 million or 24.8% of sales for the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate a continued modest leverage benefit in these expenses versus last year.
MG&A for the quarter was $103 million, up 17% to last year. This was at the higher end of the mid-teen percentage growth we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter primarily due to higher incentive comp. MG&A for the quarter included total equity and incentive comp of $15.6 million compared to $10.3 million last year, accounting for approximately 600 basis points of the increase.
The impact with insurance recovery in the prior year accounted for approximately another 300 basis points of the increase. For the fourth quarter, we expect MG&A to be up slightly above the third quarter in dollar terms. Operating margin for the quarter was 8.8% and represented a 250 basis point improvement over last year. The tax rate for the quarter was 35.6% compared to a benefit of 4.7% from the third quarter of 2009. The 2009 rate was favorably impacted by a true-up in the year-to-date rate. On a full-year basis for 2010, we now expect the effective rate to be around 35%. Net income for the quarter was $0.56 per diluted share. 
Turning to inventory. Total inventory at quarter end was up 47% of costs versus last year, or up 43%, excluding inventory in-transit. This was in line with our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. We expect the year-over-year inventory increase to moderate towards a closer alignment with sales at the end of the year.
We remain comfortable with our inventory levels, which we believe are appropriate to drive the business. We ended the quarter with approximately $618 million in cash and cash equivalents and outstanding borrowings and letters of credit of approximately $68 million. During the quarter, we purchased 669,000 shares under the company's existing share buyback authorizations at a total cost of $29.2 million. Going forward, we expect this share buyback program to continue subject to performance, to market conditions and to a healthy net cash cushion. With regard to CapEx, we now expect total CapEx for 2010 to be approximately $190 million. 
Turning to the fourth quarter, a summary of our gross margin expense and tax rate expectations is included on Page 11 of the investor presentation.  Our store opening plans for the year are on track for the guidance previously given and reflected on Pages 12 and 13 of our investor presentation. With regard to closures, we now expect 2010 store closures to be slightly above the previous figure of 60 planned closures. As previously indicated, we will record additional charges in the fourth quarter associated with these closures.
This concludes our prepared comments section of the call, we're now available to take your questions. Please limit yourself to one question, so that we can speak with as many callers as possible. If everyone has had a chance, we will be happy to take follow-up questions. Thank you."

I think going forward, it's hard for us to be too specific about what that spread is going to be. I think, because you've got a lot of things moving in and out of the comp base, there's typically something we haven't given guidance on in the past. But I think, your best way of getting there is to model in the volume of the stores that are opening during the quarter and some assumption about DTC. And that will lead you to a spread expectation for the quarter."

We were looking at this, this way. We think lots of people are going to take a lot out of their product at this time. We're not.

And as we roll through year end, all those stores coming on stream in the fourth quarter will continue to add, to be a factor of causing an overall increase in inventory levels, as well as continuing to support DTC growth. So aside from the sort of underlying comp business, those factors are both causing inventory to be running at somewhat higher levels. But overall, I think the key point is that we're comfortable with where we are. We expect the year-over-year increase to moderate as we come out of the year and as we're lapping more normalized levels from the prior-year."

We're always going to want to maintain a healthy net cash cushion, which we define as our cash on hand less anything we've got drawn down on the revolver and any letters of credit we have outstanding against the revolver. I think historically, we used to talk about a $300 million cash cushion. Going forward, I think we're thinking more in terms of a $350 million net cash cushion. So cash on hand less outstanding revolver draw downs and LCs that we would never want to be below around $350 million, is our current thinking. So that's, kind of, one guardrail. I think on the other end, we've seen our share count creep up over the last couple of years due to equity plan issuances. And I think going forward, we would, at the minimum, look to offset those equity plan share issuances with buybacks. So that, really, the kind of two guardrails. Where we end up between those two guardrails will be a function of how we're feeling about business, how we see our cash flow requirements in general going forward, market conditions, obviously, and potentially other factors. But we would expect to be somewhere within that range. So without the sort of floor being as of today, that we would never go below a $350 million net cash cushion, but isn't to say that we're going to be at that level. It's just that would be the sort of guardrail of the lower end."

We haven't specifically updated that, but clearly our results for the third quarter were consistent with that buying assumption for the season, and we haven't spoke to anything subsequent to that. On store closings in '11, we'd originally said 110 over '10 and '11. Few of those are pulling forward into '10, but we'd still expect doing the 40 to 50 range in '11. The primary reason why those stores are unprofitable is low-volume, which does tend to result in very high, first of all, low growth margin rates. So closing those stores helps with the gross margin and then high occupancy costs as a percentage of sales in some cases although not all. So I think you're generally going to see -- I think, clearly, because we have to still staff them to minimum levels, those variable expense items tend to run as high percentage of sales. So I think you're going to see the impact on gross margin and then in both components of stores and distribution expenses from a leverage benefit.
