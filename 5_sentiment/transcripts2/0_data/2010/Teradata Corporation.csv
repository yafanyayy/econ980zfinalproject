Teradata finished the year with a record fourth quarter and 2009 reporting revenues of $496 million, up 1% from a strong fourth quarter in 2008 and revenues grew 9% in constant currency. Revenue for the full year",1924,"Thanks, Gregg and good morning, everyone. Teradata finished the year with a record fourth quarter and 2009 reporting revenues of $496 million, up 1% from a strong fourth quarter in 2008 and revenues grew 9% in constant currency. Revenue for the full year was $1.17 billion, down 3% from 2008 and down 1% in constant currency. The Teradata team had strong execution in 2009 with meaningful gross margin improvements, particularly in our Services business and excellent expense management, which allowed us to deliver increased operating income and increased earnings per share on lower revenue. More importantly, our results for 2009 included investments for our future, increased investments in R&D, our partners and additional sales territories. We extended our technology lead with innovative new releases in our database software, purpose built platform family, Teradata virtual storage and in key analytical applications. As a result, we have positioned ourselves stronger as we enter 2010. Looking at our business from a regional perspective, the Americas region had a strong Q4 generating $300 million of revenue, up 5% from the fourth quarter of 2008 and on top of the prior-year Q4, when revenues we're up 14% in constant currency. Revenue for the full year was roughly flat with 2008 at $981 million. Overall, solid performance for 2009. In Q4, the Americas brought in a number of significant new accounts, including Southern Cal [California] Edison, one of the largest utility companies in the U.S. We are placing additional focus on utility companies as they transform power generation and distribution through the implementation of smart grids and smart metering technology.Navistar, one of the largest wireless companies in Chile is installing a data warehouse and Teradata relationship manager to consolidate customer information and create personalized offers. United Supermarkets, a regional grocer in Texas which is leveraging our Teradata Accelerate program, which allows new customers to get started quickly and easily as they deploy an integrated data warehouse. A leading Fortune 500 health insurer, who serves more than 70 million consumers. And Caterpillar Logistics, a subsidiary of Caterpillar which is one of the top-five supply chain and logistic businesses in the U.S., which will use Teradata to support service parts management, demand forecasting and inventory planning and supporting very high data volumes with roughly five terabytes of new data per day.The Americas region also saw a broad-based upgrade activity in the quarter including: Dell, which is both a customer and a supplier, upgraded its data warehouse and is adding active applications to support its strategy of delivering global BI including executive dashboards; DIRECTV, which uses Teradata to load and analyze set-top information to provide better content and support to their subscriber base. One of the top three beverage manufacturers in the U.S., which is integrating Teradata with its SAP supply chain management and demand planning applications. One of the top five motion picture studios in the world is expanding their Teradata warehouse in support of their DVD and Blu-ray inventory application. One of the largest toy retailers added to their Teradata system to support organic growth and additional workload from consolidating data marts. The Teradata solution also enabled the retailer to analyze sales every 15 minutes, which was extremely valuable in the days leading up to the holiday shopping season. And also, Lowe's, Sirius and The Gap were among other expansions in the quarter.In EMEA, revenue of $106 million in the fourth quarter was down 7% from the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year, revenue was $430 million, down 5% from 2008. Adjusting for currency, full year revenue in the EMEA region was up 2% from the prior year which was a good performance for 2009.New wins from EMEA included: Ziraat Bank, the largest bank in Turkey, who chose Teradata to help it become more competitive by leveraging strategic and operational information; one of the top property and casualty insurance companies in the Czech Republic; and one of the largest banking institutions in Russia with over 20,000 branches and over 250 million customers.EMEA also saw a good upgrade activity from many different leading companies including: ABN AMRO Bank in the Netherlands, which is adding customer data from their merger with Fortis Bank, supporting new government reporting requirements, integrating Basel II data and adding new risk information. DGT [Dirección General de Tráfico], the Spanish department of traffic which is continuing to grow their system and consolidating multiple data marts into their Teradata warehouse platform. DGT uses Teradata to identify the root cause of traffic accidents, and has seen a 20% reduction in the number of accidents and also a decline in traffic fatalities to levels last seen in 1967. One of the top three global leaders in international express mail is now using Teradata to help with revenue assurance and collect unbilled revenue. HSBC Holdings, one of the largest banks in Europe. One of the world's leading auto manufacturers is upgrading their system to detect vehicle faults and quality issues earlier and more comprehensively. Telefónica, Spain's largest telco. BBVA [Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria], the second-largest bank in Spain. Bupa Health Insurance, the largest private healthcare insurer in the U.K. Belgacom International Carrier Services, and one of the top mobile operators in Poland is deploying an active application to identify fraud within minutes. Asia-Pacific, Japan recorded $90 million of revenue in the fourth quarter, down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year, revenue was $298 million, down 9% from 2008 and down 10% in constant currency. 2009 proved to be a challenging year for us in APJ. Key contributors to the decline included lumpiness for timing of major banking upgrades in Australia, softness in retail in Japan and delays in telco expansions in China and Japan. APJ new customer wins in Q4 included ANZ Bank, the largest bank in Australia which selected Teradata help them align and consolidate fragmented recording environments onto a common scalable platform. This will also enable them to get a complete view of their customers for new marketing strategies. Smart Communications in the Philippines chose Teradata to consolidate separate data stores into a single system for lower total cost of ownership and ease of maintenance. Neptune Orient Lines in Singapore and Chiba Bank, the second-largest regional bank in Japan.Upgrades included: Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation, one of the top three financial institutions in East Asia; AFLAC, a top 10 insurance provider in Japan; and one of the world's largest LCD manufacturers which will expand their Teradata warehouse to include cross factory defect analysis and enhance yield rates as well as reducing overall inventory.I was very pleased with the performance of our Services business across all the regions in 2009. Overall, our Services business grew revenues 3% as reported and 4% in constant currency. The consulting services team improved margins significantly, while providing outstanding service and value to our customers. Effective utilization of resources, leveraging offshore resources and overall expense management where the key drivers of the margin improvements.Not only was 2009 one of our best years operationally, it was one of our best years ever in terms of innovation. Teradata 13 was our most powerful database release in our history. We announced the world's first solid-state drive data warehouse appliance. Teradata Virtual Storage, which automatically places data on different types of storage devices based on its usage. This results in lower storage costs and increased performance for our customers. Market-leading tools such as Teradata Viewpoint for performance management. And in addition, we launched the Teradata Enterprise Analytics Cloud, our first public and private cloud computing offer. And last, we strengthened our applications including Teradata Relationship Manager and Teradata Integrated Web Intelligence. I was very pleased that last week, Teradata received recognition, once again, as being the clear leader in the Gartner Data Warehouse Magic Quadrant. Teradata has been in the Leaders Quadrant since 1998. And just this week, Gartner published its newest server evaluation model. And again, Teradata is ranked number one data warehouse DBMS server. I encourage you all to read these reports.Last, I'd like to share some information on the approximate revenue contribution by industry for 2009 which excludes maintenance. Financial services which includes banks, capital markets, credit card and insurance companies remained our largest industry contributing 28% of our total revenues, about the same as in 2008 when it was 29%. Communications which includes telecommunications, cable, e-business, media and entertainment companies finished at 23% down from 28% in 2008. The decline was driven primarily from the timing of major expansions with some Fortune 500 customers here in the Americas and to a much lesser degree in APJ.Retail increased to 17% from 16% in 2008 and grew double digits in the Americas. Manufacturing contributed 10% compared to 11% in 2008. Healthcare grew to 8% of our business, up from 4% with very strong growth in the Americas. Government increased two points to 7% with very strong growth in APJ and in the Americas. Travel and transportation was 6% flat compared to prior year and with good growth in APJ. Other industries made up 1% of our revenue in 2009. The investments we have been making in healthcare and government, in particular, in the U.S. have resulted in good growth for those industries. I am pleased with Teradata's overall position in the market and the performance of the Teradata team in 2009 and look forward to a good year going forward.Going into 2010, uncertainty and complexity in the business environment will continue to drive investments in BI and Analytics. New regulations and government policy in health and energy will also help drive demand and new data types such as sensor data and manufacturing and click stream and social media data from the web will all drive greater demand for BI and Analytics.However, more and more executives recognize the need to obtain a holistic view of the enterprise with transparency and granularity of information. Having consistent and detailed information that can be shared across organizations that is updated and accessed realtime for decisions is key for companies to compete in the marketplace. And this is best provided with an integrated enterprise data warehouse architecture. The world's leading companies have proven you have to breakout of the status quo model and build an agile, integrated data architecture to achieve greater insight and speed in decision making and the reduce costs. This is what Teradata does. Our competitors, on the other hand, advocate status quo and steer away from this best-in-class state architecture, as they can handle the high-complexity workload management and scalability of an integrated EDW [enterprise data warehouse], with moldable applications and thousands of users running concurrent, ad hoc and complex queries in addition to standard reporting. We expect the market will continue to move to an EDW architecture as companies realize the value that data has being integrated and shared and Teradata is the clear leader in doing it.Looking at 2010, we expect revenue to increase 7% and 9% from 2009 including one to two percentage points of benefit from currency, which we expect to yield earnings per share of $1.54 to $1.64. Based on the strong activity we are currently seeing in particular in the Americas, we expect to be at the higher end of the revenue guidance for the first half of the year. However, given the limited visibility we have for the second half of the year, we have modeled in a more conservative revenue number for the second half.Steve will now share in more details regarding our fourth quarter and full year performance as well as our 2010 expectations. Steve?"

Teradata delivered another solid performance in the fourth quarter of 2009 highlighted by record-setting performances across some of our key business categories including total revenue, consulting revenue, Americas",2292,"Thanks, Mike and good morning, everyone. Teradata delivered another solid performance in the fourth quarter of 2009 highlighted by record-setting performances across some of our key business categories including total revenue, consulting revenue, Americas revenue and services gross margin dollars. Revenue of $496 million was up 1% from the strong fourth quarter we reported in 2008 down 3% in constant currency. We grew 9% in constant currency in the fourth quarter of 2008. Product revenue of $239 million was down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2008 as the economy still weighed on IT CapEx spending. In constant currency, product revenue was down 7%. Services revenue, however, of $257 million was up 6% with consulting services being up 4% and maintenance services being up 7%. In constant currency, services revenue was up 1%. For the full year, total reported revenue was down 3% to $1.71 billion. In constant currency, total revenue was only down 1% from 2008.Product revenue for the year of $772 million was down 9% from 2008 and down 7% in constant currency. Services revenue of $937 million was up 3% or up 4% in constant currency. Reported revenue for consulting services was up 2% and maintenance revenue was up 3%. While in constant currency, consulting services was up 4% while maintenance services was up 5% for the year. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2009 was 56% compared to 54.6% in the fourth quarter of 2008. We had a meaningful increases in our product gross margin while holding our line on services gross margin. Gross margin for the year was 54.9% up one point from 53.9% in 2008. Product gross margin of 67.8% increased 420 basis points from 63.6% in Q4 2008. The increase in product gross margin was primarily driven by improvements in the Americas region and to a lesser extent in the EMEA region, which saw a more favorable deal mix as compared to the fourth quarter of 2008, which countered the increased amortization of previously capitalized software development costs that we have described in earlier earnings calls.Although we drove very attractive gross margin in Q4, we continue to expect higher amortization of software development costs to create pressure on product gross margin in the foreseeable future. As a reminder, when you amortize previously capitalized software development costs, the amortization is recorded in cost of product on the income statement. Much like we saw on Q3 and Q4 of 2009, we roughly expect another $11 million of higher amortization to record it in 2010 compared to 2009. Again, creating the possibility of a headwind for product gross margin. The proxy for future amortization is the amount of software development costs being capitalized and we capitalized $59 million in 2009 compared to $52 million in 2008. Product gross margin for the year was 65.2%, an increase of 80 basis points from the 64.4% achieved in 2008. Again, we are pleased with our performance in 2009, especially since we were facing the headwind of increased software amortization. Services gross margin in the quarter was about the same as reported last year at 45.1% versus 45.3% in Q4 of 2008. As was the case throughout 2009, we drove solid yields and margins in our Services business. Consulting services gross margin benefited from a higher utilization of internal resources, lower outside contractor service costs and a greater leverage of our offshore capabilities. We began to hire additional consulting resources in Q4 to keep up with the demand for these services. As these new resources are trained and become more fully productive, we anticipate this will somewhat soften our services gross margins from the high levels we achieved in 2009. We are likely to add these new resources on a gradual basis not intending to drive significant increase in these costs or to hit margins in any one period. Services gross margin for the full year was up 240 basis points to 46.4% due to our active management of our cost structure in this business. Moving to a geographical view of our gross margin. In the Americas region, gross margin was 60.7%, a meaningful improvement from the 57.2% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Largely due to the impact of a favorable deal mix on product gross margin and improvements in our Services business compared to Q4 2008. Americas gross margin was 58.1% for the full year versus 56.6% in 2008. Again, largely driven by an improvement in our Consulting Services business and to a lesser extent, the improved product deal mix which more than offset the increased amortization of software development costs and the impact of higher level of services revenue.Gross margin in the EMEA region of 51.9% was roughly the same as with the 51.8% reported in the fourth quarter of 2008. EMEA gross margin was 53.5% for the full year, an increase from the 51.9% in 2008 due to the improvements in our Consulting Services business that we described earlier. Gross margin in APJ was 45.6% declined from 50% in Q4 of 2008. The decline was driven by lower services margin and the impact of lower product volume. APJ gross margin was 46.3% for the full year versus 48.3% in 2008. Again, the decline was largely due to the impact of lower product revenue volume. Turning to our expense structure. SG&A expenses in Q4 of 2009 increased $1 million from a year ago. The slight increase was driven by selling expense from the increased number of sales territories, which was offset by continued focus on holding down overhead and other discretionary expense such as travel, entertainment, compensation and outside services. For the year, SG&A of $483 million was $25 million below the 2008 levels, a 5% reduction while absorbing the expense of our strategic initiatives such as our investments in incremental sales territories and strategic partnerships. However, as we discussed last quarter, we expect a continued increase in our selling expenses in 2010 as we add more sales territories consistent with our sales territory expansion strategy. We will also have a moderate compensation increase in 2010, which we did not have in 2009 while we froze salaries and we will see an increase in training and education expenses. Overall, in 2010 we expect SG&A expenses to increase at a rate less than our overall revenue growth rate. R&D in the quarter was $34 million versus $30 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. In large part, this was due to the timing of specific R&D expenses which hit in Q4 versus Q3 as we described last quarter. For the full year, research and development was $117 million versus $108 million in 2008. For 2010, we expect research and development expenses to increase slightly greater than 10% year-over-year. As a result of these items discussed, Teradata's operating margin in the fourth quarter was 21.4% versus 20.7% reported in Q4 of 2008. For the full year, we just missed 20% coming in at 19.8% versus 18.9% in 2008. For 2010, we expect operating margins to be in the 19% to 20% range. Below the operating income line as has been the case all year, interest income was not sufficient to offset the costs of our cash and foreign currency management programs. For the year, we had $4 million of other expense versus $5 million of other income in 2008. Again, due to the lower interest rate environment and the write-down of an equity investment. Our effective tax rate in Q4 of 2009 was 21% down from the 23% tax rate used in Q4 2008. Our effective tax rate was lower in Q4 of 2009 due to recognizing the annualized effects of previously estimated permanent differences. For the full year, our tax rate was 24% versus the 26% in 2008. Again, influenced primarily by the annualized activity in the fourth quarter. For 2010, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be approximately 24% to 25.5%. Summing it all up. GAAP EPS in Q4 2009 was $0.48 versus $0.45 in Q4 2008. For the full year, GAAP EPS was $1.46 versus $1.39 in 2008. Excluding impairment charges in Q3 of each year and a tax adjustment in Q3 of 2008, our non-GAAP EPS comparison was $1.48 in 2009 versus $1.42 in 2008. We are pleased that we are able to increase our earnings per share in 2009 despite the economic challenges and our continued investment in sales resources during the year. Many of you have asked, how much stock-based compensation expense is included in our operating income and EPS results? During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $6 million or $0.02 per share. For the full year 2009, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $23 million or $0.08 per share. We expect approximately the same amount of stock-based compensation expense in 2010 as we had in 2009 or approximately $0.08 per share. Turning to cash flow generation. Cash from operating activities was $91 million in Q4 of 2009, down from the $118 million generated in the fourth quarter of 2008. The largest contributor to the 2008 results was changes in assets and liabilities. That change was smaller in 2009. After $27 million of capital expenditures, including increased capitalization of software development costs and property, plant and equipment versus $13 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. We generated $64 million of free cash flow, down from $105 million of free cash flow in Q4 of 2008. During 2009, Teradata generated $455 million of cash from operating activities compared to $440 million in 2008. Capital expenditures in 2009 were $88 million compared to $71 million in the prior year, yielding $367 million of free cash flow for the year versus $369 million in 2008. Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software.Turning to the balance sheet. We had $661 million of cash as December 31, 2009, a $43 million decrease from the end of the third quarter as share repurchases more than offset our free cash flow generation. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares for approximately $103 million. For the year, our cash and short-term investment balance increased $219 million from the end of 2008 despite using $175 million through repurchase approximately seven million shares in 2009, investing roughly the same amount in our shares in 2009 as we did in 2008. Since our Board's initial share repurchase authorization at the beginning of 2008, we have repurchased 15.5 million shares of our stock or approximately 9% of the outstanding for approximately $350 million. We have approximately $234 million of Board authorization remaining for open market share repurchases. As we said before, we expect that the rate of our buyback will continue to fluctuate each quarter taking into account, among other things, our working capital needs, our stock price, alternative uses of cash and the economic and market conditions. Approximately 30% of our cash is available in the U.S. With respect to our accounts receivable, DSO, days sales outstanding was 83 days as of December 31,2009, compared to 93 days as of December 31, 2008, which speaks to the quality of our customers and our relationships we have with them. To provide further transparency around currency movement and the potential impact of revenue, we provided on our website additional detail regarding how currencies moved in 2009 and how this movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons in 2010 assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of January. We expect currency to create one- to two-point tailwind for us in 2010 and a five- to six-point benefit in Q1 2010. Mike provided some revenue and EPS guidance earlier in the call, but I want to give a little more color on some specific items.           Although we had another solid quarter in Q4, and we are looking at a healthy pipeline for the first half of 2010, it is not clear what the second half of 2010 will look like. As a result, our guidance for 2010 is 7% to 9% revenue growth, with our growth in the first half of the year probably tracking at the higher end of that range. As we discussed with you last quarter, we expect some of our cost and expenses lines to grow faster in 2010. As a result, we expect our EPS improvement for the year to be less than our long-term target of growing EPS at twice our revenue growth.Specifically, as we have discussed before, we anticipate headwind on our services gross margin as we add to our consulting teams; higher selling expenses due to more sales territories; normal increases in G&A, such as base compensation increases; and a return of expenses that were eliminated or reduced in 2009, including training and education; and research and development increasing slightly greater than 10% over the 2009 levels of $117 million. That said, we are very happy with how we are positioned and eager to operate in what we hopefully going to be a better economic environment than what we've seen over the last two years.In closing, Teradata continues to lead in data warehousing and enterprise analytics market. And this is due to our technology leadership position; our strong customer base and relationships, serving and enabling the Global 3000; our expanded product family; our geographically diverse business model; our strong recurring revenue model from our existing high-quality customer base as they routinely increase the size and the scope of their enterprise data warehouses, as well as the annuity revenue stream that comes from our Maintenance business; and finally, our strong capital position, $661 million in cash, no debt and a very attractive free cash flow model. And with that operator, we are ready to take questions."

What we're saying, Matt, is I didn't see any higher degrees of budget flush than we typically see in the fourth quarter. And some of the delays, like with some of the Fortune 500 companies here in the Americas, it's just more due to timing. I wouldn't call it an economic thing or anything else. I would call it the normal lumpiness that we've always seen over the years and the pluses and the minuses we see. You get a fairly significant Fortune 500 type of customer who upgraded, did a major expansion like in 2008, and they don't do an expansion in 2009. It can have a significant impact on the results for an industry or for our region. So in the Americas, we had some pluses in the lumpiness and other industries. And what I mentioned was, when looking at the com [communications] industry results for the year, we had a decline. And that was an example of the negatives of lumpiness in 2009. The flip side of it is, it becomes an opportunity for us in 2010. In APJ, the delays are much smaller dollars, but still has a similar kind of impact when you look at the APJ results. So some of those areas I alluded to earlier, like delays in telco, in China and Japan and banking in Australia, these become opportunities in 2010.

One of them is new account acquisition, and there, our average sales cycle is longer. When you run into a rough economic type of environment, the sales cycles in new accounts actually are impacted to a lesser degree. The bigger impact in sales cycles occurs in the user base with companies trying to defer spending and large CapEx expenditures and so forth.

Under GAAP, I would have to defer revenue based on the structure of the transaction. Those transactions vary quarter by quarter and year-over-year. And typically, sometimes, you get at the end of the year, some structures as when your review them and go through them required deferral of product revenue. And those vary, again, year by year.

Teradata started the year strong with record first quarter revenue of $429 million, operating income of $86 million, and EPS of $0.39.  Operating margin improved to 20% in Q1 from 16.3% in Q1 of 2009.  
Revenue was up 17% as reported and up 12% in constant currency over Q1 2009, which was not an easy prior year comparable.  Revenues grew 5% in constant currency in Q1 of 2009.  Product revenue grew 27%, which was our highest growth quarter during the past 9 years.  And all three regions grew revenues, and each reported strong double-digit product revenue growth.  Overall, it was a great start to 2010.  
The Americas had an outstanding Q1 generating $252 million in revenue, which was up 23% from the first quarter of 2009.  New customer wins we can name included Kohl's Department stores and Movistar, a mobile phone provider in Peru.  
Expansions and upgrades in the quarter including Macy's, CVS Caremark, Cabela's, Overstock.com, and Electronic Arts in the U.S and Rogers Communications and Hudson's Bay Company in Canada.  
With the return to a more stable economic climate in the U.S., we saw strong activity across most industry segments.  In particular, in manufacturing, financial services, retail, and health care.  
Turning to EMEA, revenue of $106 million in the first quarter was up 9% from the first quarter of 2009.  Adjusting for currency, revenue in EMEA was up 3% over a prior year comparable that had strong growth in constant currency of 12%.  New customer wins we can name included Cajasol, a financial services institution that merged with another bank in Spain and is integrating data from the two banks into a Teradata EDW, and EOS Group,  a financial services company in Germany.  
EDW expansions and upgrades included [arp lease]; BBVA; Dahmler; Volvo Cars; TNT Express; Telefonica Spain, which is converging their wire line and wireless businesses into an integrated EDW;  [inaudible] Telecom, one of the largest wireless providers in France, which is adding web and social network data for analytics as well as customer segmentation and regulatory compliance; Pannon, a leading mobile operator in Hungary, expanded their Teradata relationship manager CRM application to provide multistep, multichannel, and multi-offer campaigns for better customer life cycle marketing; and Shop Direct, the U.K.'s largest internet retailer, which is deploying Teradata integrated web intelligence to load near real time web browsing data into its EDW.  It can now understand customer intent as well as purchase history to better drive marketing campaigns and grow revenues.
Asia-Pacific/Japan reported $71 million of revenue in the first quarter, up 9% from the first quarter of 2009 and down 1% in constant currency.  
APJ had a record first quarter for new account wins, including NTT Solmare which is the number one content provider for mobile phones in Japan and will use Teradata in an active environment examining web logs to analyze customer navigation and deliver more effective web-based marketing; one of Australia's largest retail companies, which selected Teradata and SAS over strong competition from an incumbent based upon the value they saw from the integrated and advanced analytics environment that we provide.  
Star Track Express, an Australian logistics services company, is implementing a Teradata active data warehouse as the foundation for their active information management strategy.  Their vision includes integrating data from multiple operational systems with geospatial capabilities in order to optimize loading and routing for their fleets.  And a top-three mobile operator in Indonesia, which is implementing an active enterprise data warehouse.
Upgrades and expansions from the APJ region included NTT Communications, Japan's largest internet service provider, which is expanding its Teradata system for customer care to improve customer service and satisfaction.  KDDI Corporation, the second largest communications company in Japan, is adding to its Teradata EDW to provide better leverage of information across all their business units.  
And we saw expansions from numerous other leading communications companies in the region, including China, India, Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and Malaysia.  
Additional data and applications are being added to better understand and improve the customer experience and geospatial data for marketing and network analytics.  We're pretty excited about the execution of our platform family strategy.  
As we have discussed, our objective was to (1) add more customers, (2) grow our existing customers by gaining wallet share in their analytical environments, and (3) address competitive offerings in the data mark space.  
Our appliances helped us to increase new account wins in the first quarter.  And our extreme data appliance has opened new opportunities for our existing customers that need our [inaudible] analytical solutions at a lower cost.  Overall, our competitive win rate has never been stronger.  
With the release of our solid-state drive extreme performance appliance, we now have platforms to address any analytical need at competitive price points.  Best of all, they all leverage the industry leading database, Teradata.  
In Q1, our R&D team delivered several new models across the Teradata platform family.  We announced general availability of the 5600, Teradata's active enterprise data warehouse, which included a 65% increase in performance; the 1600, Teradata's extreme data appliance, which delivered a four times improvement in performance and a reduced data center footprint of 50%; and the 2580, Teradata's data warehouse appliance, which delivers up to two times the performance.  
We are also very pleased to be recognized by those in the industry.  In Q1, Teradata was named as one of Information Week's top ten most strategic IT vendors.  During the survey, they heard many of our customers attribute much of their success to the competitive intelligence they get through their partnership with Teradata; and partnership is the word these companies used most often.  
Teradata was also named to the Intelligent Enterprises list of the dozen companies that will matter the most in 2010.  And we were recently named to the top 100 most ethical companies in the world by the Ethisphere Institute.  These awards follow Teradata being recognized by Gartner for leadership in data warehousing and data warehousing servers.  
Going forward, more companies will be looking to drive value by adding more subject areas and applications to their data warehouses, more users, more queries, and enabling real-time decision making, while taking cost out via the consolidation of their data marks.  
This requires date warehouse technology that has the ability to manage complex mixed workloads, multiple applications, thousands of users, and concurrent queries in an active, real-time environment that can execute both strategic and operational decisions.  This is what Teradata provides that our competitors don't.  
In closing, we are very pleased with our strong start in Q1 and are increasing our revenue guidance to 8% to 10% revenue growth in 2010.  We now expect to generate EPS of $1.60 to $1.70 based on the strength of Q1 and the higher revenue guidance.  I will now turn the call over to  Steve Schepmannn, who will discuss our Q1 results and 2010 guidance in more detail.  Steve.

As anticipated, we got off to a great start in 2010.  Revenue of $429 million was up 17% from the first quarter of 2009 and, as Mike said, up 12% in constant currency, which was against a 5% constant currency growth perfo",1813,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning.  As anticipated, we got off to a great start in 2010.  Revenue of $429 million was up 17% from the first quarter of 2009 and, as Mike said, up 12% in constant currency, which was against a 5% constant currency growth performance in Q1 2009.  So we are comparing against a fairly solid quarter last year.
Product revenue of $200 million was up 27% from the first quarter of 2009 as the demand for and the value of infrastructure enhancing enterprise data warehousing fueled the strong start to the year for Teradata.  Services revenue of $229 million was up 9% or 4% in constant currency, with consulting services increasing 10% and maintenance services improving by 8% as reported.  
Gross margin in the first quarter of 2010 was 55% compared to 54.5% in the first quarter of 2009.  Higher services gross margin and a greater percentage of product revenue more than offset the lower product gross margins in the quarter.  Product gross margin of 64% decreased from 65.6% in Q1 2009.  At the end of the day, the decrease was primarily attributable to deal mix, for the most part in the EMEA region.  However, with that said, we experienced a significant increase in product revenue in the period.  
Other factors come into play, including more efficient leveraging of the product fixed cost structure, which has a favorable impact on product margin, and the fact that subscriptions make up the smaller percentage of our total revenue.  You will recall subscriptions are included in our product revenue, and this represents an unfavorable impact on our product margin.  
Services margin of 47.2% was a full point higher than a year ago due to more efficient utilization of our consulting resources in the quarter compared to a lower quarter in 2009.  We expect that Q2 will be a tougher comparable with the strong prior year.  As we have said in the past, as we add targeted capacity to meet the anticipated demand for consulting expertise, we expect services gross margins will soften from the higher levels achieved in 2009, especially as we proceed into the next few quarters.
Moving to a geographical view of gross margin.   In the Americas region, gross margin was 57.9%, an improvement from 57.1% in the first quarter of 2009, largely due to higher consulting services margins.  Gross margin in the EMEA region was 53.8%, down from the 54.6% reported in the first quarter of 2009, due to lower product margins.  Gross margin in APJ of 46.5% was roughly the same as last year, 46.2% in Q1 2009.  
Turning to our expense structure, SG&A expense in Q1 2010 increased $8 million from the same period last year.  This was largely driven by increased selling expense in the areas of head count, training, incentive compensation, and currency.  
Research and development, R&D, in the quarter was $32 million versus $30 million in the first quarter of 2009.  For the full year 2010, we are increasing our R&D investments and estimate that R&D may experience a percentage increase in the low teens year-over-year.  As a result of all these items discussed, Teradata's operating margin in this seasonally lower first quarter was 20% versus 16.3% reported in Q1 2009.  For the full year 2010, we continue to expect operating margins to be in the 19% to 20% range.  
Below the operating income line, our effective tax rate in Q1 2010 was 22%, down from the 25% tax rate used in the first quarter of 2009.  Our effective tax rate was lower in Q1 2010 due to a previously-disclosed $5 million tax benefit associated with the recognition of certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards resulting from an audit settlement in the first quarter.  
Due to more of our estimateable pre-tax earnings coming from the U.S. than previously expected, we now expect our full year effective tax rate for 2010 to be approximately 25.5% to 26.5%.  As a result, EPS in Q1 in 2010 was $0.39 versus $0.26 in Q1 2009.  
Noncash stock-based compensation expense is included in our operating income and EPS results.  During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $5 million or $0.02 of earnings per share.  For the full year, we expect approximately the same amount of stock-based compensation expense in 2010 as we had in 2009, roughly $23 million, or approximately $0.08 to $0.09 of earnings per share for the full year.
Turning to cash flow, cash from operating activities was $138 million in Q1 2010 versus the $165 million generated in the first quarter of 2009.  After $21 million of capital expenditures versus $20 million of capital expenditures in the first quarter of 2009, we generated $117 million of free cash flow, down from the $145 million of free cash flow in Q1 2009, or a decrease of $28 million.  
During the last few years, we, along with many other companies, were able to decrease our working capital as we reduced the amounts of our accounts receivable which benefited our free cash flow.  As you are aware, lowering receivables is generally a one-time cash flow benefit.  
From an absolute dollar perspective, our receivables were $64 million lower as of 12/31/09 compared to 12/31/08 due to improved efficiency throughout 2009.  As a result, this had the effect of creating a free cash flow head wind for 2010 when you compare it to the opportunity we had entering 2009.  
From an accounts receivable efficiency perspective, DSO improved to 69 days as of March 31, 2010, compared to 75 days as of March 31, 2009.  Now that we see growth again, our free cash flow generation should return to more normalized levels in line with the plus or minus $25 million of net income metric we have talked about since the spinoff.  
Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure for property and equipment and less additions to capitalized software.  
Turning to the balance sheet, as of March 31, 2010, we had $712 million of cash, a $51 million increase from the end of 2009, despite our share repurchase activity in 2010.  During the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares for approximately $70 million.  
As I have said before, we expect the rate of our buyback will continue to fluctuate each quarter taking into account, among other things, our working capital needs, our stock price, alternative uses of cash, and economic and market conditions.  Approximately 1/3 of our cash is available in the U.S.  
With respect to our deferred revenue, deferred revenue as of March 31, 2010, increased $70 million from 12/31/09 compared to a $66 million increase as of 3/31/09 versus 12/31/08
Deferred maintenance and deferred subscriptions had solid increases between periods and, together, they represent over 70% of the deferred revenue balance as of March 31, 2010.  To provide further transparency around currency movement and the potential impact on revenue, we provide on our website additional detail regarding how currencies moved in Q1 2010 and how this movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons for the remainder of 2010 assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of April.  
In Q1, our year-over-year revenue comparison included a 5-percentage point benefit from the currency translation.  Based on the spot rates as of the end of April, for Q2 we expect approximately 1 percentage point of benefit from the currency.  For the year, we now expect less than 1 percentage point of benefit from currency; and we expect to see 1 to 2 points of currency headwind in the second half of the year.  
Mike provided some revenue and EPS guidance earlier in the call, but I wanted to give you a little more color on the specific items.  We are increasing our revenue guidance for the year to 8% to 10%, which includes less than 1 percentage point of estimated benefit from currency.  
Our previous revenue guidance of 7% to 9% included a 1% to 2% of estimated benefit from currency.  Therefore, in effect, we are increasing our revenue guidance range by approximately 2%.  
Although we continue to see a healthy pipeline for the first half of 2010, it is difficult to accurately forecast what the second half product revenue will look like.  As is typically in the case of our business model, we do not have a high degree of predictability two to three quarters out.  We do not see anything that is likely to negatively impact us in the second half of the year, but we simply do not have a high degree of product revenue visibility at this time.  
We do have visibility into our services revenue which represents slightly greater than 50% of our total revenue, and this currently shows growth in the mid-single digits range in constant currency.  Included in the total services revenue is our maintenance revenue, which is a true annuity revenue stream.  As a result, more predictable over the remainder of the year.  
This maintenance revenue accounts for approximately one-half of our services revenue or approximately 25% of our total revenue.  As we discussed with you last quarter, we expect some of our cost and expense lines to grow faster than normal in 2010 due to reductions in 2009 and our increased investment in sales coverage and R&D.  As a result, we expect our EPS improvement for the year to be less than our long-term target of growing EPS at twice our revenue growth rate.
Specifically, as we have discussed before, we anticipate the following:  Tough year-over-year comps in our services gross margin as we add to our consulting teams; second, higher selling expenses due to more sales territories and higher commission as revenue increases; third, normal increases in G&A such as base compensation increases and a partial return of some expenses that were eliminated or reduced in 2009, including training and education.  Finally, due to increased investments, we expect low teens increase in R&D over the 2009 level of $117 million.  
That said, for the full year, we are increasing our EPS guidance from the $1.54 to $1.64 range to the $1.60 to the $1.70 range.  Keep in mind this includes the increase of our effective tax rate resulting from our expectation that more of our pre-tax earnings mix will come from the U.S. which reduced our EPS by approximately $0.03 per share if you assume the midpoints of our effective tax rate guidance ranges.  This impact has been incorporated into our new guidance for 2010.  
In closing, there is a strong correlation between the effective use of business analytics and profitability.  Effective use of business analytics begins with the right architecture and leveraging of the enterprises information infrastructure.  I believe you will see more companies focused on centralizing, integrating their information infrastructure as they look to improve their responsiveness and the effectiveness of their BI infrastructure.  
Teradata solutions, products, and services are well positioned from strategic to active enterprise intelligence to drive and manage this change.  We are excited about our start in 2010.  With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.

I am trying to put that in context with the overachievement that you did in the first quarter.  Pretty strong deferred revenue.  You have easy comparisons in the second quarter.  
It seems to me you are being very conservative in your assumption that the back half of the year closer to perhaps mid-single digit top line growth.  You mentioned lack of visibility on the product side.  Are you being incrementally more conservative now in the back half?  Is there anything on a competitive front that you're seeing which is different or is it purely lack of visibility?

If you look at the growth rate in constant currency, it's mid-single digits.  It's hard to move the dial on things like maintenance revenue, which is a little bit less than 25% of our revenues.  However, as we continue to grow product revenues, that will benefit the maintenance longer term.  When you look at the year, you can't move the dial that much on the maintenance revenue.  
On the consulting services piece, it's a little harder to move the dial at all.  When you take a look at the 8% to 10% revenue guidance, we're actually pretty bullish on our product revenue growth for the rest of the year to back into the 8% to 10% range.

It depends on what the particular addition they're doing to their EDW.  
The variability comes in is to when do they get lined up to actually pull the trigger and make the decision.  Then the revenue comes quickly.  
The other thing is, quite frankly, we have very large transactions in our business, very large.  In a given quarter, you have a couple of $10 million or $15 million types of opportunities or opportunities even much higher that don't happen.  It will change the percent of growth for not just for a quarter, but for an entire year.  
We've seen some years where, and this is 4-5 years ago when things were good, where you have a set of customers that deferred out of the year; and the impact on our top line revenue growth was huge.  So, it's the dynamics of the business model of operating without a backlog and the volatility we have with some large deals with large customers.

It really gets down to the mix and the timing of the mix that Mike talked about on these larger deals coming through.  
With respect to the effective tax rate, updating the guidance to 25.5% to 26.5% on the effective tax rate, that's really driven by the strength of the Americas.  We have FX influence or headwind because of the dollar strengthening on the EMEA side.  What you've seen now is the strength of the Americas stepping up.  It's a double-edged sword.  
In EMEA, I have a lower effective tax rate on taxable earnings in EMEA.  In the U.S., I have a higher tax rate.  You see the strength of the Americas coming through from that increase in the effective tax rate.  That's why we're coming up to the 25.5% to 26.5%.  It's all driven by the pre-tax earnings mix.

Operating income, operating margin and gross margi",1468,"Thanks, Gregg. Good morning, everyone. Teradata had its best second quarter ever reporting revenues of $470 million, up 12% from Q2 of 2009 and operating income of $106 million, up 26% over the last year. Operating income, operating margin and gross margin rates were the highest of any quarter in Teradata’s history.
Our platform family appliances had a strong second quarter and are now installed in over 125 customers in 20 countries. This has been accomplished in a very short timeframe of approximately two years since they were launched. Our investments in the platform family, along with our investments in new territories and focus on new account acquisitions, are going well. New customer wins for the first half of 2010 was our strongest performance in the last five years. These were also key contributors to our revenue growth for the first half, which was up 12%, and product revenue, which was up 22% in constant currency.
Some highlights on a region perspective, the Americas delivered an excellent Q2 generating $281 million of revenue, up 23% from the second quarter of 2009 and product revenue up 42%. For the first half, revenue growth in the Americas was 23% with product revenue up 40% over prior year. The Americas had a strong quarter for new account wins, which included Frito-Lay where a Teradata enterprise data warehouse is replacing a competitor. Manufacturers like Frito-Lay will utilize geospatial location data to improve real-time distribution of their products.
W.W. Grainger, a Fortune 500 distribution company, will use Teradata to help analyze and improve overall customer relationships and customer value. Our ongoing partnership with SAP helped in this new customer win. Oklahoma Gas & Electric which is a new data warehouse appliance customer in the utility industry and one of our growth markets. We’ve had good activity with utilities as y look to improve operations today and prepare to leverage the large real-time data from smart meters actionable information.
Serasa Experian the Brazilian part of the world’s largest credit bureaus will rely up on the speed and scalability of Teradata to analyze massive volumes of data and develop new products.
The Americas also added another top five pharmaceutical company in the quarter and added one of the largest financial institutions in the world where we also replaced a competitor's data warehouse.
Other new customer wins with data warehouse appliances included Bank of New York Mellon, Aviva Canada and Skechers footwear where we are replacing a competitor system to improve the company’s wholesale business.
While the Americas had a great quarter for new customers they also saw broad-based growth with current customers in the quarter including AT&T, one of several customers who are members of our petabyte club, which are customers who have EDWs with over a petabyte of data. AT&T is enhancing its Teradata system to support 360 degree view of its customers for improved marketing, advertising and sales operations.
At eBay we announced during Q2 our collaboration to develop analytic competencies for better customer online experiences. Starting with a six petabyte Teradata appliance, eBay is analyzing 30 terabytes of customer interaction data each day. This is in addition to eBay’s purpose built or private cloud ETW implementation, which put them in Teradata’s petabyte club several years ago. This is a good example of customers leveraging different members of our platform family for different analytical needs.
We also saw expansions and upgrades at World Bank Financial Group, Verizon, Delta Airlines, JC Penny, TIM Brazil where partnered with SAS[ph] and at Chrysler, which added a data warehouse appliance. In summary, Q2 was an outstanding quarter for the Americas as was as Q1.
In the EMEA region, Q2 revenues of 108 million was down 8% as reported and down 3% in constant currency. For the first half, revenue was flat as reported and also flat in constant currency. EMEA was going against a first half prior year comparable when revenues grew 9% in constant currency. EMEA had a good quarter for new customer wins. Some highlights included BNP Paribas in Belgium, which is installing Teradata to enhance such customer relationship management capabilities. Analytics Private Limited in Pakistan will use a Teradata data warehouse appliance as the platform for their software and service cloud offering.
The Royal Mail in the UK, which joins a growing number of the EMEA postal and package delivery customers, including DHL, the Czech Post, Poste Italiane and GNT to name a few.
Maersk, one of the leading liner shipping companies in the world, was also one in the quarter and will be using Teradata to compliment its SAP environment to integrate SAP and non-SAP data. The Teradata EDW will play a major role in their transformation to an analytics driven company.
Also with the win at a major telco in Europe, Teradata has now installed in all of the global top 20 telcos in the world. We also continue to see good activity from existing EMEA customers. As they continue to increase the size and scope of their Teradata platforms, including Air France, which is expanding their EDW to address more sales and marketing applications. C&A, a retailer that is expanding their Teradata EDW tripling data volume adding 10 times to users and strengthening active warehouse elements including improved workload management.
Bank Söhne in Poland added a data warehouse appliance to their existing EDW. Other customer expansions included at Barclays, Jaguar Land Rover, Vodafone, and the Commercial International Bank in Egypt.
Turning to Asia Pacific/Japan, we’ve reported $81 million of revenue in the second quarter, up 9% from Q2 of 2009 and up 4% in constant currency. For the first half, revenues were up 9% as reported and up 1% in constant currency. Several new customer wins in the quarter came from the financial services industry including the Bank of Okinawa, which will use their Teradata system for revenue management and improve transfer pricing. Guangzhou Bank in China, which bough a data warehouse appliance and our financial services logical data model for its entry level EDW, GS Securities, a large Chinese stock brokerage firm.
APJ upgrades included Vodafone New Zealand, which is adding analysis of geospatial location data for improved marketing and network analytics, and Oita Bank in Japan, which is enhancing their business intelligence capabilities with Teradata and SAS. In addition, SAS Marketing Automation software will run on Teradata to improve customer segmentation and drive more effective marketing campaigns.
Other upgrades and expansions included the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Services, Toshiba, Chi Mei Optoelectronics, Fuji Xerox, The Bank of East Asia, Resona Bank, APL in Singapore, and Murata Manufacturing in Japan which added a data warehouse appliance.
As mentioned earlier, we are pleased with the results of our purpose built platform family and the return we're seeing our R&D investments there. Our competitive win rates and product margins remain strong across all members of the platform family. Our strategy to enter the appliance market is proving to be successful, helping to attract new customers and helping to expand share with current customers.
Over 10% of our product revenues came from data warehouse appliances in Q2, and close to 10% of our product revenues in the first half of 2010. We continue to expect our appliances to contribute 5% to 10% of our product revenues going forward.
Our Active EDW platform results were also excellent for the first half and will continue to be key contributor to our business. We will continue to invest and focus on leading the market for the most demanding active data warehouse environments in the world.
We're also seeing momentum with Teradata's analytical applications. In the enterprise marketing management space, our Teradata Relationship Manager solution has seen good success this year. CVS Caremark, the (inaudible) Bank and Telefonica are just a few customers driving revenue growth using Teradata to quickly capitalize on every customer interaction. Teradata Relationship Manager was also recognized by Gartner. Again, being positioned in the leader squadron for multi-channel, campaign management.
In Q2, we also announced enhancements to our demand chain management solution. One financial analyst recently noted that the Home Depot is implementing Teradata’s demand chain management system and has already improved the accuracy of demand forecasting by 15% to 30%, which is a material improvement for a retailer.
In summary, our revenue growth in the quarter, and for the first half, are evidence that we are beginning a return on our investments in R&D, partners and sales territory. Looking forward given our first half performance, we now expect our revenue growth and earnings per share for the full year to be at the high end of our previous guidance ranges.
With that I will now turn the call over to Steve Scheppmann to discuss our Q2 results and our full year outlook in more detail. Steve?

Revenue of $470 million was up 12% from the second quarter 2009 and also up 12% in consta",1859,"Good morning. Our solid Q2 results validated comments we made at beginning of the year that we expected a strong first half of the year particularly in the Americas. Revenue of $470 million was up 12% from the second quarter 2009 and also up 12% in constant currency. Revenue for the first half of the year was up 14% and 12% in constant currency. Product revenue up $223 million was up 21% from the second quarter of 2009 and up 24% for the first half. Services revenue up 247 million was up 5% and 7% year-to-date. Within services consulting services was up 4% in Q2 and maintenance services was up 6%.
Gross margin in the second quarter was 57% compared to 55.3% in the second quarter of 2009. Higher product gross margin offset lower services gross margin in the quarter. Product gross margin of 68.2% increased from 64.3% in Q2 2009. The increase was primarily driven by positive deal mix. Product gross margins increased in all three regions. Services margin of 47% as anticipated was lower than the strong services gross margin achieved in Q2 2009 due to, as we've had previously referenced, building capacity to grow revenues.
On the positive front, demand for our consulting business has increased, and we are adding more value creation resources to meet this demand. While these new resources are added, trained and working[ph] they become more fully productive and profitable, we anticipate that this will lower our services gross margins from the levels achieved in 2009 when we were not adding resources and related costs.
Moving to a geographical view of gross margin. In the Americas region, gross margin was 60.9%, an improvement from 58.1% in the second quarter of 2009, driven primarily by higher product margins as well as a higher proportion of product revenue compared to the services revenue.
Gross margin in the EMEA region of 52.8% was down from the 54.2% reported in the second quarter of 2009, driven by a lower proportion of product revenue as compared to services revenue as well as lower consulting services margins.
Gross margin in the APJ was 49.4%, up from 48.6% in Q2 2009. The increase was driven primarily by higher product and maintenance margins as well as a greater proportion of product revenue as compared to services revenue.
Turning to our expense structure. SG&A expense in Q2 2010 increased $4 million from the year ago period. The increase was largely driven by increased selling expense. However, when looking at SG&A as a percentage of revenue, we continue to improve the efficiency of the SG&A investment year-over-year. Even coming off of a tight austerity year 2009, where specific cost reductions and deferral programs fluctuated quarter by quarter as we actively managed expenses. SG&A expenses in 2010 will return to a more normalized level, more comparable to the 2008 levels but an improved percentage of revenue versus the 2009 SG&A revenue efficiency rate, even while continuing to execute our strategic initiative of expanding our sales territories.
The continued improvement in leveraging the efficiency of our SG&A infrastructure is one of the strategic drivers of our long-term operating margin expansion. R&D in the quarter was $36 million versus $27 million in the second quarter of 2009. As anticipated, we continue to invest in our core database platform family consistent with our post spend strategy. For the full year 2010, we now expect R&D to increase in the mid 20s percentile year-over-year.
As a result of all of these items discussed, Teradata's operating margin in the second quarter was a record 22.6% versus 20% reported in Q2 2009. For the full year 2010, we expect operating margin to be in the higher end of the 19% to 20% range we had previously discussed. However, increased investments in sales and R&D will create more of a headwind from margin and EPS, specifically in Q3 and Q4.
Below the operating income line, the effective income tax rate in the second quarter of 2010 was 30%, which compared to 26% tax rate in the prior period, driven by an overall proportional increase in US pretax earnings. Due to the expectation that a higher proportion of Teradata's pretax income will be generated in the United States and the uncertainties surrounding the retroactive restatement in 2010 of the US Federal Research and Development Tax Credit, we anticipate a potentially higher full year effective tax credit for 2010 in the 27% to 28% range.
As a result, GAAP EPS in Q2 2010 was $0.44 versus $0.36 in Q2 2009. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense is included in our operating and EPS results. During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $6 million or $0.02 per share.
To allow you to better compare our results to those of our other sophomore companies that excludes stock-based compensation expense, we're now providing the non-GAAP measure. Non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter excluding stock-based compensation expense was $0.46. This compares to $0.38 in the second quarter of 2009. For the full year, we expect approximately the same amount of stock-based compensation expense in 2010 as we had in 2009, roughly $23 million or approximately $0.09 per share for the full year.
As a reminder, we have a table on the foot notes of our earnings release as well as detailed schedules on our website that reconciles the differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results. We will also provide the non-GAAP EPS excluding stock-based compensation expense for the prior periods on our website. For the most part, stock-based compensation expense had a $0.02 per impact on reported quarterly earnings. As an example, it was $0.08 for the full year 2009 approximately $0.02 per quarter.
Turning to cash flow, cash from operating activities was $62 million in Q2 2010 versus the $103 million generated in the second quarter of 2009. When comparing to the prior year the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was principally due to anticipated increase in accounts receivable DSO.
After $23 million of capital expenditures versus $20 million of CapEx in the second quarter of 2009, we generated $39 million of free cash flow down from the $83 million of free cash flow in Q2 2009. During the last few years, we along with many other companies were able to successfully decrease our working capital as we reduced our accounts receivable DSO, which benefited our free cash flow. As you know, as we have discussed over the last several quarters, you can only reduce receivables so much so the larger opportunities increase cash flow from working capital management is for the most part behind us. 
In Q2, the meaningful revenue growth that we generated and the timing as such revenue growth added to our receivables balance and increased our working capital needs as one would expect.
Our annual free cash flow generation should return to more normalize levels in line with plus or minus $25 million of net income metric we've talked about since this summer[ph]. Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment an additions to capitalized software. 
Turning to the balance sheet. As of June 30, 2010, we had several $724 million of cash, a $12 million increase from the end of the first quarter 2010. During the second quarter, we did not repurchase any shares of our stock, however, on our year-to-date basis we only purchase $71 million in 2010 compared to $50 million in 2009.
As we said before, we expect that the rate of our buyback will continue to fluctuate each quarter taking into account, among other things, our working capital needs, our stock price, potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions, and economic and market conditions.
At the end of Q2, approximately 67% of our cash was held outside the United States and in effect was not available for share repurchases. Almost we repatriate the cash back to the US and pay corresponding taxes as significant tax cost.
We continuously evaluate different options relating to our most efficient capital structure given the current and future factors that may influence our business model in the markets we operate in. With respect to our accounts receivable, DSO was 76 days as of June 30, 2010, compared to 73 days as at June 30, 2009.
To provide further transparency around currency movement, we provided on our website additional detail regarding how currencies moved in Q2 2010 and how this movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons for the remainder of 2010, assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of July.
As I mentioned earlier, our Q2 total company year-over-year revenue comparison was not impacted by currency translation. EMEA region did see 5 points of currency headwind in the year-over -year revenue comparison in the quarter. However, during the course of the second quarter, currency translations clearly moved against us versus the spot rates at the beginning of the quarter, which cost us approximately $5 million of reported revenue or approximately $0.01 of EPS. As you know, currencies had moved in a more favorable direction since the end of Q2. As result we now expect less than 1% currency benefit impact for the full year revenue comparison, but one to two points of headwind from currency in the third and fourth quarters.
As Mike said earlier in the call, we now expect our revenue and EPS for full year 2010 to be at the high end of our previous guidance ranges, a revenue growth at 8% to 10% and EPS in the range of $1.60 to $1.70. Excluding stock base compensation non-GAAP EPS was expected to be in the high end of the $1.69 to $1.79 range. As we discussed with you last quarter and as we’ve seen in Q2, we expect some of our cost and expense lines to grow faster than normal in 2010 due to increased investments in sales coverage and R&D and our other expense reductions that we saw in 2009 that are partially or fully reinstated in 2010. As a result, we expect our EPS growth was second half of the year and especially in the third quarter to be less than our long-term targeted growing EPS at twice our revenue growth.
Specifically, as we’ve discussed before in Q3 and in Q4 we anticipate headwind from the following. R&D increasing mid 20s percentile or in the 2009 level of $117 million, annualized higher selling expense due to more sales territories and higher commissions and training costs. Normal increases in G&A such as base compensation increases and return of the expenses that were eliminated or reduced in 2009 including training and education. Lower services gross margins as we add to our consulting teams. Finally, potentially higher incentive compensation expense as the company is performing better relative to key incentive plan metrics compared to 2009.
That said, however, we are very pleased with our first half performance and feel very good about our technological and competitive leadership position, which position us well to deliver on our plan guidance for the second half of 2010.
With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.

Now that we’re into the second half of the year and in particular as we look out to the fourth quarter we expect EMEA to come back quite a bit.

We are somewhere, again I said, we’re kind of at the midpoint. My last conversations we’re at kind of the 75% of that targeted number.

So, there is some underlying things here when you are look at a new territories which go hand in hand with the upticks and new customer winds in the US along with the more utilizations of our appliances, all these things are contributing to the strong performance in the Americas in the first half.

Matt, if I give a little color on that kind of further explained my comments with respect to one of these questions. In the first of the year from a SG&A side, we saw SG&A expenses go up year-over-year $12 million. What I see based on the factors that I described earlier on the new territories proof of concepts, the incentive compensation, customer events and training. I see year-over-year the SG&A going up to low to mid 20s, okay, second half versus the second half last year driven by primarily with those items.
Now, the biggest impact is going to come in Q3. Again because in my prepared remarks, I mentioned, there is a lot of fluctuation or volatility in our expense say reduction initiatives, we actually went down in SG&A Q3 over Q2. Again, that was very focused with some period cost and very focused tied to Mike's direction on managing those costs in 2009. We’re returning to more normalized levels in 2010 again being very sensitive to the pressure on Q3 versus Q4 on that expense structure.
The overall message I want to leave you with, Matt, is that we’re still very focused on improving the efficiency of those SG&A expenses as a percentage of revenue. So, in 2010, you’ll see the efficiency rate, when I say efficiency rate as a percentage of expenses as it relates to revenue, improve in 2010 even over the tight austerity year in 2009. So, again, one of the key strategic drivers of our operating margin expansion is to improve the efficiency rate of SG&A and we’ve should accomplish that for 2010 even with the pressure in Q3 and the more normalized expense levels driven in Q4 driven by those five items I described. Does that help, Matt?

What’s given me the comfort on that is when you look at -- we track this things territory-by-territory when you see the new customer winds coming through and the activity that they’re generating not actually revenue activity, but the how they are moving the balls on the field with respect to those opportunities you're seeing that they are doing the proof of concepts. You see that they are having the appropriate pre-sale activities commencing in those territories. So, as we look at those soft points, those intangibles, and also the performance in the first half it gives increases my confidence that we’re moving towards getting closer to that revenue target of $100 million and position us to get back on line to the closer to $150 million in 2011 from the revenue payments from those new territory. So, the movement since October of ’09, from my perspective, continues to improve that confidence level be able to deliver on those commitments.

So, it would be 12% constant currency growth, the first half with a big pop from the Americas, 8% constant currency growth to second half.
As we said on the last call, the total 50% of our revenue comes from services, and it's hard to move the dial meaningfully on the services in a 12-month period, and services revenues in the first half we’re up 4% in constant currency. So, the second half, we’re looking at mid-single digits growth of our services business, which is over 50% of our revenues. So, that implies the product revenue growth in the second half would be double digits as high as 12% to 13% in order to get to the high-end of the guidance.

It was close to 10% of our revenues for first half. So that gives you some color on the amount. Obviously, the average deal sizes are of the magnitude of enterprise data warehouses. The professional services content as a percentage of the deal might be similar, but a lot smaller than enterprise data warehouses. A lot of it depends on what there it’s going in as a add on application specific appliance in an existing EDW environment, like the one example we gave, and with that if might get a lower yield on professional services. However, the appliance is also been very useful for new customer wins starting with an entry level on enterprise data warehouse. The professional services requirements there might be pretty sophisticated make sure that data is right using logical data models, integrating it and get in the profit value out of an entry level enterprise data warehouse. So I hope that gives you a little bit color, Derrick, without the specifics to the questions you just asked.

Teradata has delivered another strong quarter in Q3, with revenue growth of 15% and operating income growth of 20% versus prior year. Product revenue was up 27% in the quarter and for the year is up 25%. This is the highest total revenue growth and product revenue growth we have achieved during the past 10 years.
Data volumes continue to growth exponentially, with new data types coming from new data sources. As companies look to bring these new data elements together with traditional data, this makes for an attractive market opportunity for Teradata and our integrated active data warehouses. This has also created demand for our appliances to address big data and other evolving opportunities in large single-subject data marts. We continue to innovate on many fronts to capitalize on the evolving landscape from big data to advanced analytics, to enterprise marketing management, to mobile intelligence. These innovations are translating into growth in our customer base and growth in the number of customers that Teradata serves. New customer wins, year-to-date, are at our highest levels in six years.
Turning to the regions, the Americas had strong growth again in Q3, with revenue of $292 million, which was up 18% over 2009. New account wins included a world-leading manufacturer of aircraft engines, which will integrate and analyze large volumes of text analytics. This will them to quickly detect and react to changes that impact its forecasting and manufacturing schedules, which will, in turn, reduce inventory and service cost.
Other new account wins included a major high-tech manufacturer and Procter & Gamble and a leading department store retailer as well as the top two banks in Mexico and one in Chile. Customer upgrades and expansions included WellPoint, which has added our solid-state drive appliance to deliver critical care alerts to hospital staff and physicians within seconds.
Our Extreme Performance Data Warehouse, the 4600 Appliance is enabling new time-sensitive, mission critical, breakthrough applications that were not possible before. Additional upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Nationwide Insurance, Caterpillar Logistics, and Enterprise Holdings, which includes Alamo, National, and Enterprise Rent-A-Cars, and one of the world's largest retailers and one of the world's largest manufacturers of phones and computers.
Overall, the America is having an outstanding 2010 today, in terms of total revenue growth, product revenue growth and new customer wins. In EMEA, Q3 revenue of $109 million was equal to prior year, but it was up 7% in constant currency. New account wins included Unilever, a leading consumer packaged goods company. We're working with CPG manufacturers around the world to immigrate, explore and analyze their consumer and retail point-of-sale information to better understand preferences and build brand loyalty. EMEA also had four government new account wins with two in Turkey and one each in Italy and Belarus.
The government sector, as you all know, is an under-penetrated vertical for Teradata and is a big opportunity for us. Upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Lufthansa, which is adding operational over active decision making and is also redesigning their customer loyalty program and integrating it with partner airlines, and we had expansions at Lloyds, DHL, Telenor Pakistan, the Italian Tax Authority, COOP Norden, Mobinil in Egypt, and a Chronopost International in France.
For the first three quarters of 2010, EMEA's revenue was flat with 2009 as reported and up 2% in constant currency. However, keep in mind EMEA was going against the good prior year comparable when revenue grew 9% in constant currency through Q3 2009. EMEA's overall activity has been solid in 2010, and we expect good growth in Q4.
Asia Pacific Japan had an excellent quarter, generating $88 million of revenue in Q3, which was 28% increase over the third quarter of 2009. In constant currency, APJ grew 19%. China is having a strong 2010 and we continue to see good growth in financial services there our largest industry.
In Q3 we added Ping An Bank, as a new customer, and they will be consolidating 26 data marts into one centralized EDW. Ping An Bank joins a growing number of financial services institutions relying on Teradata to provide a single view of the customer, reducing credit risk and drive top and bottom line results. During the third quarter we also recognize significant expansions at several of China's top five banks, including ICBC, China Construction Bank, and the Bank of Communications.
Across APJ, active EDW implementations are fulfilling mission critical needs as well. A good example is the Australian border control which is processing data from a wide range of sources including near real-time data. The agency will utilize Teradata's event-triggering techniques to rapidly identify, analyze and respond to situations to ensure the safety of Australia's borders.
APJ also saw good growth from a number of other customers across the region in Q3; including the Australian tax authority, in Japan, Rakuten, Japan's largest online retailer, JCB, Mitsui Foods, and Sony Marketing, and in the Philippines, Globe Telecom.
Overall, APJ has grown revenue 15% this year as reported and 7% in constant currency. Growth has been especially strong in the countries outside of Japan. Our annual PARTNERS Conference was held in San Diego last week with over 3,000 attendees and 169 customers presenting at various sessions there.
One of the common themes from customers in Teradata was how to innovate with the wave of new big data. In particular, how to leverage the big data being driven from weblogs, smartphones, social media, sensors et cetera, together with what they already know such as customers, products and supply chains.
Organizations that move quickly and figure out how to leverage this new information will have a clear competitive advantage in the marketplace and Teradata is helping them to do that. I'd like to highlight a few of our announcements from the conference.
We introduced Teradata Database 13.10 which further extends our lead with temporal and compression capabilities among other things. Teradata's temporal software automatically timestamps data to allow customers to track and properly account through changes that involve in their business over time. For example, manufactures can obtain more meaningful sales performance reports that account for territory realignments or customer mergers and acquisitions that have occurred over the years, and retailers can get sales comparisons that reflect products changing the different categories.
The Teradata Database 13.10 has enhanced compression technologies that enable customers to store more data. Customers are receiving up to 20 times compression for select data types and up to four times overall compression.
We also released the next generation of our Platform Family to partners, which significantly boost performance across all models and reduces energy consumption as well. For example, our 5650 Active Enterprise Data Warehouse delivers a 43% performance boost over the previous generation and does this in the same-sized footprint, which reduces energy and floor space requirements.
In addition, we announced enhancements to our Customer Relationship Management application which we call CRM. New features include mobile intelligence capabilities, customized reporting and visualization tools. Now marketers and executives can visualize their data and access reports and dashboards across all medium channels from a variety of platforms, including mobile devices and iPads.
In summary, we see more opportunities than ever before to help customers drive value through data warehousing and we remain confident in our ability to execute with customers and in the market, with our best-in-class technology, solutions and the world's best data warehousing consulting practice.
Given our performance in Q3, we are increasing our guidance for 2010 revenue growth to be approximately 12% and we're increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance to the $1.80 to $1.83 range.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Steve for more details. Steve?

This quarter, we improved our revenue growth rates, expanded our gross and operating margins, and increased our EPS.
Now, moving to our revenue details. Revenue of $489 million was up 15% from the third quarter of 2009, and also up 15% in constant currency.
Revenue for the first nine months of the year was up 14%, 13% in constant currency. Product revenue of $243 million was up 27% from the third quarter of 2009 and up 25% for the first nine months.
Services revenue of $246 million was up 5% and 6% year-to-date. Within services, during Q3, consulting services revenue was up 6% and maintenance services revenue was up 5%.
Turning to our gross margin, gross margin in the third quarter improved to 57.1%, compared to 53.4% in the third quarter of 2009. Higher product gross margin and a more favorable mix of product revenue versus services revenue more than offset a lower services gross margin in the quarter. Product gross margin of 70.4% increased from 62.3% in Q3 2009. The increase was primarily driven by a positive deal mix, particularly in the Americas region.
Services gross margin in Q3 of 43.9% was lower than the strong services gross margin of 46.2% achieved in Q3 2009. Our consulting services business is expanding their headcount in response to growing business opportunities.
As we've discussed in prior quarters, this new headcount can have a negative impact on margin, particularly while the new consultants are being trained and are not yet fully productive or chargeable.
Our data warehouse and consulting capability is unmatched and a very important part of our business model. Not only does it enable us to grow services revenue, but it may open the door to future product revenue opportunities.
Moving to the geographical view of gross margin. In the Americas region, gross margin was 61.6%, an improvement from 55.9% in the third quarter of 2009, driven primarily by a higher product margins as well as a higher proportion of product revenue as compared to services revenue.
Gross margin in the EMEA region of 51.4% was down from the 53.2% reported in the third quarter of 2009, driven by lower services margin which were offset somewhat by the improved product margins.
Gross margin in the APJ region was 48.9%, up from the 44.9% in Q3 2009. The increase was primarily driven by higher product margin as well as a greater proportion of product revenue as compared to the services revenue.
Turning to our expense structure. SG&A expense in Q3 2010 increased $20 million from a year ago. The increase was largely driven by increased selling expenses associated with our strategic initiatives of expanding our sales territories as well as higher variable incentive compensation across the Company.
As we discussed last quarter, we expected this level of increase in SG&A expenses and the third quarter of 2009 was normally low due to timing and we curtailed expenses due to economy downturn and the associated uncertainty.
R&D in the quarter was $40 million versus $26 million in the third quarter of 2009. As anticipated, we continue to invest in our market leading technology. For the full year 2010, we expect R&D to be approximately $150 million. FAS 86 unfavorably impacted R&D expense $5 million in Q3 as compared to Q3 2009 and we'll have an anticipated unfavorable impact of approximately $11 million for 2010 as compared to 2009.
As a result of all these items discussed, Teradata's operating margin in the third quarter increased to 21.7% versus 20.7% reported in Q3 2009. Increased investments in sales territories and R&D will create more of a headwind on operating margin and EPS in Q4.
That said however, for the full year 2010 we now expect operating margin to be approximately 21%, higher than the 19% to 20% original guidance range we provided earlier this year due to all the operating income line.
The effective income tax rate in the third quarter 2010 was 29%, which compared to a 25% effective tax rate in the prior period, driven by an overall proportional increase in the US pre-tax earnings. For the full year, Teradata expects a higher proportion of its pre-tax income will be generated in United States in 2010 as compared to 2009.
As a result, we're anticipating the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 27%. However, if the US federal R&D tax credit is not retroactively reinstated by Congress before year end, our full year effective tax rate for 2010 will increase to approximately 28%.
GAAP EPS in Q3 2010 was $0.44 versus $0.36 in Q3 2009. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense is included in our EPS results. During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $7 million or approximately $0.02 per share.
Non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter, excluding the stock-based compensation expense, was $0.46 in the third quarter of 2010. This compares to $0.40 in the third quarter of 2009, excluding stock-based compensation expense as well as an impairment charge that we took in the third quarter of 2009.
For the full year, we expect approximately the same amount of stock-based compensation expense in 2010, as we had in 2009, roughly $24 million or approximately $0.09 per share for the full year. As a reminder, we have a table on the footnotes of our earnings release as well as detailed schedules on our website that reconciles the differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and outlook.
Focusing on cash flow, cash from operating activities was $65 million in Q3 2010 versus a $96 million generated in the third quarter of 2009. When comparing to the prior year period, the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was principally driven by the anticipated increase in our receivables balance as well as the higher inventory levels, which are used as a working capital. After $18 million balance of capital expenditures versus $21 million of CapEx in the third quarter of 2009, we generated $47 million of free cash flow, down from the $75 million free cash flow in Q3 of 2009.
In Q3 2010, the timing of the meaningful revenue growth added to our receivables balance and increased our working capital needs as one would expect. In 2008 and 2009, free cash flow benefited from working down our receivables balance and improving our DSO. Our free cash flow is now expected to run in line with the plus or minus $25 million of net income, annual guidance metric we talked about since the spin-off.
Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditure for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software.
With respect to our balance sheet, as on September 30, 2010, we have $741 million of cash, a $17 million increase from the end of the second quarter of 2010. During the third quarter, we used $29 million for tuck in technology investments and used approximately $17 million to repurchase 559,000 shares of our stock.
As we've said before, we expect that the rate of our buyback will continue to fluctuate each quarter, taking into account among other things, our working capital needs, our stock price, potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions, and economic and market conditions.
At the end of Q3 2010, approximately 67% of our cash was held outside the United States, and in effect not available for share repurchases unless we repatriate the cash back to the US and pay the corresponding taxes at a significant tax cost.
With respect to our receivables, our day’s sales outstanding was 80 days as of September 30, 2010, compared to 70 days as on September 30, 2009. Again, we target approximately 75 to 85 as our DSO targets.
To provide further transparency around our currency movement, we provided on our website additional detail regarding how currencies moved in Q3, 2010, and how those movement is expected to impact our year-over-year revenue comparisons for the remainder of 2010 assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of October.
As I mentioned earlier, our Q3 total Company year-over-year revenue comparison was not impacted by currency translation, but EMEA region did see seven points of currency headwind in the year-over-year revenue comparison in the quarter, while APJ benefited from nine percentage points of currency tailwind. Currencies moved in favorable directions since our last earnings call. As a result, we now expect 0% to 1% of currency benefit both in the fourth quarter and for the full year revenue comparison.
As Mike said earlier in the call, we are increasing our full year 2010 and EPS guidance ranges. We increased our expectations for revenue growth from the higher end of the 8% to 10% guidance range to approximately 12% and GAAP EPS from the $1.60 to $1.70 range to the $1.71 to the $1.74 range. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the $1.80 to $1.83 range.
As we discussed in the past and as we saw in Q3, some of our cost and expense lines continue to grow faster than normal due to the increased investments in sales coverage and R&, along with a more normalized spending in 2010.
As a result, we expect our EPS growth to be less than our long-term target of growing EPS at twice our revenue growth, probably more in the 1.5 times range. Specifically as we discussed last quarter and saw in Q3, we anticipate headwind in Q4 from the following factors.
R&D for the full year increasing to approximately $150 million, $11 million due to FAS 86 compared to the 2009 level of $117 million, annualized higher selling expense due to more sales territories, and increased training cost associated with new territories and headcount.
Normal increases in G&A, such as base compensation increases and a return of expenses that were eliminated or reduced in 2009, including training and education. Lower services gross margin as we add to our consulting teams, and finally, potentially higher incentive compensation across the Company as the Company is performing better relative to key incentive plan metrics as compared to 2009.
That said, we are very pleased with our year-to-date performance and we feel very good about our technology and competitive leadership positions which is clearly reflected in our operating results, and consequently, we have increased our guidance for both revenue growth and EPS for 2010.
With that operator, we're ready to take questions.

On the DSO side, it's really the timing of the year transactions as they come through in the quarter. So they are coming through later they will line up, hit the receivable balance, I won't have the collections during the quarter, if they are earlier in the quarter. So, as I said in the prepared remarks, I'm comfortable on a DSO range of 75 to 85 and we're right at 80. We were 70 last year. So, there is nothing that I saw unusual in the DSO with respect to any leading indicator, so nothing in there that would change my opinion on the quality of the activity going forward. On the inventory side, it's just normal fluctuation on when we do our pre-builds versus when we're completing the shipments. There is nothing unusual in that activity. I saw a buildup in the Americas on the finished goods inventory side which when I worked through the deals is perfectly anticipated. So the inventory buildup other than timing created no concern to me. On the deferred revenue side, I follow this metric of over 70% of our deferred revenue balance in maintenance and subscriptions, that continues to hold true on 74% as of 9/30, so that other percentage that fluctuate significantly between quarter is the transactional side. So that side still continues to be fluctuating more, but as long as I'm over that 70% of my total deferred revenue, I feel very comfortable on, and a decrease from Q2 to Q3 last year and Q2 to Q3 this year was reasonably in line, didn't concern me. A little bit more this year maybe like $7 million more. That didn't bother me because my percentages are still holding with the total deferred revenue. I hope that answers those questions, Katy.

So, we had a very favorable deal mix in the third quarter. I will say there is a slight benefit of having the appliance family in that we're able to sell products that fit the opportunity as opposed to in previous years we'd be selling the EDW or the 5000 class into a lot of these opportunities. So, it's a very minor benefit but it's a benefit. But the one thing I would like to add is, previously we've been saying the appliance product margins are similar to the EDW and even though, keep in mind, long-term we see appliances 5% to 10% of our overall product revenue mix, but we're starting to see slightly lower margins on the appliances versus the EDW. Okay? If you take a look at our appliances, overall, they have less software content than EDW which makes them a little bit less positive in product margin, gross margin, and the 1000 class, that's that big data, extreme data appliance, that has huge storage content. So, you look at the mix of those product, the configuration, there is a lot more storage, and storage is a little lower margin. Then of course the 4000 class machine which uses the solid state drives, that comes with a lower margin, and we're doing very well with the 1000 class series, lots of big implementations. We had one customer at our PARTNERS Conference last week that was talking about a 10 petabyte implementation, and it's a very effective solution for this big data analytics that's going on in the marketplace.

So, that's kind an overall weighting factor when we looked at the second half of the year and as we go into the fourth quarter. Where we stand today, and I have to qualify this that when you look at this sort of region basis, you can get some pretty good swings gone in one direction or another in a given quarter. But where we stand today, APJ will be somewhat flat in the fourth quarter. Now, that said, APJ is having a very, very strong year outside of Japan. We've been experiencing softness in Japan as well as other companies, and in Japan doing business there, and Japan's our largest country in APJ. So, in the fourth quarter and as we've seen for the year, we'll see very strong growth in APJ outside of Japan. So, APJ will be flattish as we stand today. EMEA will be up double-digits we believe at this juncture, and the Americas, which really has been driving the growth all year long with incredible product revenue growth, we're looking at Americas to be mid single digit. A minor thing about the Americas in the fourth quarter, but it is a fact, last year they grew 5% in the fourth quarter whereas previous quarters in 2009, they were going against declines, not big declines but declines and this year strength that the Americas had in product revenue in the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter it's just not going to continue in the fourth quarter at the rate it has. It's not a red flag, it's just timing. When you step back and look at the year, Americas will have a fantastic year. When you step back and look at our product revenue growth and what we're doing for the year, it's a tremendous year, but we see the Americas as we stand today in the mid single-digits range. So that's kind the make-up of as you look at the implied revenue growth in the fourth quarter, it's a mix of APJ flattish, EMEA kicking in, they've had good activity all year and it's kicking in the fourth quarter. They'll be up double digits and the Americas is in the mid single digits range as we stand today.

We announced 13.1 at the PARTNERS Conference and typically, we'll have a point release right after a major release and then you will have another major release coming. So it really boils down to, the next one is going to be major release and it comes down to when we can qualify for technological feasibility that will drive that capitalization and the corresponding increase on the balance sheet and the amortization coming through is product cost.

We're following the SAP ramp-up schedule for BW 7.14 and we are targeted to go into ramp up in the November, December timeframe. So, we do have customers that have been identified for that and then that would put us into their cycle that would have us in Q1 doing the betas, and then going GCA at the end of Q2. So, to your point, we wouldn't look to be then taking it to market in a broad until the second half for 2011 and we do work together following SAP schedule on that and their certification process, the ramp-up process. So we're trying to move with that schedule and with the market to say aligned there. We still do have lots of interest and lots of opportunity from customers wanting to integrate both their BW analytics and their non-SAP analytics into a common platform and we think Teradata will be the best at that. As it relates to SAS, we are seeing good momentum with SAS. We continue to build on our strategy there. We had a three-pronged approach around the things we were reporting and going to market with and we're seeing good traction in our industry app. So we've got good examples of where incrementally we're able to pull SAS analytics on to Teradata and/or SAS applications on to Teradata and we had several of our great customers showcased partners talking about that. So hope to get a chance to see some of those, but we've had any money laundering applications from SAS, that we've been ought to put on Teradata and of course what that does is, it allows us to leverage the EDW that's in place, the data that's in place and add new business value to their enterprise. So we're continuing to port and release industry applications, the latest of course was the manufacturing warranty and analytics that we think will have good upside in helping customers determine their early warranty problems and then also we just recently ported their customer application, customer marketing application to Teradata and had good success in that in Q3.

I guess I am trying to understand how you're looking at the quality aspect of that revenue, I would assume the future value is more substantial?

So us adding 90 more territories, it's not unreasonable out over five years. We are getting the same yield that we are getting across the Company today, and that's a very meaningful number, and that's why we want to continue add sales territories. We do want to get a good yield on the revenue short term and the comments about 2011 here, but at the same time, we want to build the pipelines for revenue growth for the years beyond as well, so it's balance.

Teradata has delivered another strong quarter in Q3, with revenue growth of 15% and operating income growth of 20% versus prior year. Product revenue was up 27% in the quarter and for the year is up 25%. This is the highest total revenue growth and product revenue growth we have achieved during the past 10 years.
Data volumes continue to grow exponentially, with new data types coming from new data sources. As companies look to bring these new data elements together with traditional data, this makes for an attractive market opportunity for Teradata and our integrated active data warehouses. This has also created demand for our appliance to address big data and other evolving opportunities in large, single subject data marts. We continue to innovate on many fronts to capitalize on the evolving landscape from big data to advanced analytics, to enterprise marketing management, to mobile intelligence. These innovations are translating into growth in our customer base and growth in the number of customers that Teradata serves. New customer wins year-to-date are at highest levels in 6 years.
Turning to the regions, the Americas had strong growth again in Q3, with revenue of $292 million, which was up 18% over 2009. New account wins included a world leading manufacturer of aircraft engines, which will integrate and analyze large volumes of text analytics. This will enable them to quickly detect and react to changes that impact its forecasting and manufacturing schedules, which will in turn reduce inventory and service cost. 
Other new account wins included a major high-tech manufacturer and Procter & Gamble and a leading department store retailer as well as the top 2 banks in Mexico and 1 in Chile. Customer upgrades and expansions included WellPoint, which has added our solid-state drive appliance to deliver critical care alerts to hospital staff and physicians within seconds.
Our Extreme Performance Data Warehouse, the 4600 Appliance is enabling new time-sensitive, mission-critical, breakthrough applications that were not possible before. Additional upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Nationwide Insurance, Caterpillar Logistics and Enterprise Holdings, which includes Alamo National and Enterprise Rental Cars and one of the world's largest retailers and one of the world's largest manufacturers of phones and computers.  Overall, the Americas is having an outstanding 2010 to date in terms of total revenue growth, product revenue growth and new customer wins. 
In EMEA, Q3 revenue of $109 million was equal to prior year, but was up 7% in constant currency. New account wins included Unilever, a leading consumer packaged goods company. We are working with CPG Manufacturers around the world to immigrate, explore and analyze their consumer and retail point-of-sale information to better understand preferences and build brand loyalty. 
EMEA also had 4 government new account wins with 2 in Turkey and 1 one each in Italy and Belarus.
The government sector, as you all know, is an under-penetrated vertical for Teradata and is a big opportunity for us. Upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Lufthansa, which is adding operational over active decision-making and is also redesigning their customer loyalty program and integrating it with partner airlines. And we had expansions at Lloyds, DHL, Telenor Pakistan, the Italian Tax Authority, COOP Norden, Mobinil in Egypt and at Chronopost International in France.
For the first 2 quarters of 2010, EMEA's revenue was flat with 2009 as reported and up 2% in constant currency. However, keep in mind, EMEA was going against the good prior year comparable when revenue grew 9% in constant currency through Q3, 2009. EMEA's overall activity has been solid in 2010, and we expect good growth in Q4.
Asia Pacific Japan had an excellent quarter, generating $88 million of revenue in Q3, which was a 28% increase over the third quarter of 2009. In constant currency, APJ grew 19%. China is having a strong 2010, and we continue to see good growth in financial services there, our largest industry.
In Q3, we added Bank as a new customer, and they will be consolidating 26 data marts into 1 centralized EDW. Ping an Bank joins a growing number of financial services institutions relying on Teradata to provide a single view of the customer, reduce credit risks and drive top and bottom line results. 
During the third quarter, we also recognized significant expansions at several of China's top  5 banks, including ICBC, China Construction Bank and the Bank of Communications.
Across APJ, active EDW implementations are fulfilling mission-critical needs as well. A good example is the Australian border control, which is processing data from a wide range of sources including near realtime data. The agency will utilize Teradata's event triggering techniques to rapidly identify, analyze and respond to situations to ensure the safety of Australia's borders.
APJ also saw good growth from a number of other customers across the region in Q3 including the Australian Tax Authority; in Japan, Rakuten, Japan's largest online retailer; JCB; Mitsui foods; and Sony Marketing. And in the Philippines, Globe Telecom.
Overall, APJ has grown revenue 15% this year as reported and 7% in constant currency. Growth has been especially strong in the countries outside of Japan. Our Annual Partners Conference was held in San Diego last week with over 3,000 attendees and 169 customers presenting at various sessions there.
One of the common themes from customers in Teradata was how to innovate with the wave of new big data. In particular, how to leverage the big data being driven from weblogs, smartphones, social media, sensors, et cetera, together with what they already know such as customers, products and supply chains.
Organizations that move quickly and figure out how to leverage this new information will have a clear competitive advantage in the marketplace, and Teradata is helping them to do that. I'd like to highlight a few of our announcements from the conference.
We introduced Teradata database 13.10, which further extends our lead with temporal and compression capabilities among other things. Teradata's temporal software automatically timestamps data to allow customers to track and properly account through changes that involve in their business over time. For example, manufacturers can obtain more meaningful sales performance reports that account for territory realignments or customer mergers and acquisitions that have occurred over the years. And retailers can get sales comparisons that reflect products changing the different categories.
The Teradata database 13.10 has enhanced compression technologies that enable customers to store more data. Customers are receiving up to 20 times compression for select data types and up to 4 times for overall compression.
We also released the next generation of our platform family at partners, with significantly boost performance across all models and reduces energy consumption as well. For example, our 5650 Active Enterprise Data Warehouse delivers a 43% performance boost over the previous generation and does this in the same sized footprint, which reduces energy and floor space requirements.
In addition, we announced enhancements to our Customer Relationship Management application which we call CRM. New features include mobile intelligence capabilities, customized reporting and visualization tools. Now marketers and executives can visualize their data and access reports and dashboards across all medium channels from a variety of platforms, including mobile devices and iPads.
In summary, we see more opportunities than ever before to help customers drive value through data warehousing. And we remain confident in our ability to execute with customers and in the market with our best in class technology, solutions and the world's best data warehousing consulting practice.
Given our performance in Q3, we are increasing our guidance for 2010 revenue growth to be approximately 12%, and we are increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance to the $1.80 to a $1.83 range.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Steve for more details. Steve?"
97999,114362192,162656,"Teradata Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Teradata Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This quarter, we improved our revenue growth rates, expanded our gross and operating margins and increased our EPS.Now moving to our revenue details. Revenue of $489 million was up 15% from the thir",1740,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This quarter, we improved our revenue growth rates, expanded our gross and operating margins and increased our EPS.
Now moving to our revenue details. Revenue of $489 million was up 15% from the third quarter of 2009 and also up 15% in constant currency. Revenue for the first 9 months of the year was up 14%, 13% in constant currency. Product revenue of $243 million was up 27% from the third quarter of 2009 and up 25% for the first 9 months.
Services revenue of $246 million was up 5% and 6% year-to-date. Within services, during Q3, consulting services revenue was up 6% and maintenance services revenue was up 5%.
Turning to our gross margin. Gross margin in the third quarter improved to 57.1%, compared to 53.4% in the third quarter of 2009. Higher product gross margin and a more favorable mix of product revenue versus services revenue more than offset a lower services gross margin in the quarter. Prior gross margin of 70.4% increased from 62.3% in Q3, 2009. The increase was primarily driven by a positive deal mix, particularly in the Americas region.
Services gross margin in Q3 of 43.9% was lower than the strong services gross margin of 46.2% achieved in Q3 2009. Our consulting services business is expanding their headcount in response to growing business opportunities. As we've discussed in prior quarters, this new headcount can have a negative impact on margin, particularly while the new consultants are being trained and are not yet fully productive or chargeable.
Our data warehousing consulting capability is unmatched and a very important part of our business model. Not only does it enable us to grow services revenue, but it may open the door to future product revenue opportunities.
Moving to a geographical view of gross margin. In the Americas region, gross margin was 61.6%, an improvement from 55.9% in the third quarter of 2009, driven primarily by higher product margins as well as a higher proportion of product revenue as compared to services revenue.
Gross margin in the EMEA region of 51.4% was down from the 53.2% reported in the third quarter of 2009, driven by lower services margins which were offset somewhat by the improved product margins. 
Gross margin in the APJ region was 48.9%, up from the 44.9% in Q3 2009. The increase was primarily driven by higher product margin as well as a greater proportion of product revenue as compared to the services revenue.
Turning to our expense structure. SG&A expense in Q2 2010 increased $20 million from a year ago. The increase was largely driven by increased selling expenses associated with our strategic initiatives of expanding our sales territories as well as higher variable incentive compensation across the company.
As we discussed last quarter, we expected this level of increase in SG&A expenses and the third quarter of 2009 was abnormally low due to timing and we curtailed expenses due to economy downturn and the associated uncertainty.
R&D in the quarter was $40 million versus $26 million in the third quarter of 2009. As anticipated, we continue to invest in our market-leading technology. For the full year 2010, we expect R&D to be approximately $150 million. As unfavorably impacted R&D expense $5 million dollars in Q3 as compared to Q3 2009 and will have an anticipated unfavorable impact of approximately $11 million for 2010 as compared to 2009.
As a result of all these items discussed, Teradata's operating margin in the third quarter increased to 21.7% versus 20.7% reported in Q3 2009. Increased investments in sales territories and R&D will create more of a headwind on operating margin and EPS in Q4.
That said, however, for the full year 2010 we now expect operating margin to be approximately 21%, higher than the 19% to 20% original guidance range we provided earlier this year due to all the operating income line. The effective income tax rate in the third quarter 2010 was 29%, which compared to a 25% effective tax rate in the prior period, driven by an overall proportional increase in the U.S. pre-tax earnings. For the full year, Teradata expects a higher proportion of its pre-tax income will be generated in United States in 2010 as compared to 2009. As a result, we are anticipating the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 27%. However, if the U.S. federal R&D tax credit is not retroactively reinstated by Congress before year end, our full year effective tax rate for 2010 will increase to approximately 28%.
GAAP EPS in Q3 2010 was $0.44 versus $0.36 in Q3 2009. Non-cash stock-based compensation expense is included in our EPS results. During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $7 million or approximately $0.02 per share.
Non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter, excluding the stock-based compensation expense, was $0.46 in the third quarter of 2010. This compares to $0.40 in the third quarter of 2009, excluding stock-based compensation expense as well as an impairment charge that we took in the third quarter of 2009.
For the full year, we expect approximately the same amount of stock-based compensation expense in 2010, as we had in 2009, roughly $24 million, or approximately $0.09 per share for the full year. As a reminder, we have a table on the footnotes of our earnings release, as well as detailed schedules on our website that reconciles the differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and outlook.
Focusing on cash flow, cash from operating activities was $65 million in Q3 2010, versus $96 million generated in the third quarter of 2009. When comparing to the prior year period, the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was principally driven by the anticipated increase in our receivables balance as well as the higher inventory levels, which are used as a working capital. After $18 million of capital expenditures versus $21 million of CapEx in the third quarter of 2009, we generated $47 million of free cash flow, down from the $75 million free cash flow in Q3 of 2009.
In Q3 2010, the timing of the meaningful revenue growth added to our receivables balance and increased our working capital needs as one would expect. In 2008 and 2009, free cash flow benefited from working down our receivables balance and improving our DSO. Our free cash flow is now expected to run in line with the plus or minus $25 million of net income, annual guidance metric we talked about since the spin-off.
Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software.
With respect to our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2010, we have $741 million of cash, a $17 million increase from the end of the second quarter of 2010. During the third quarter, we used $29 million for tuck-in technology investments and used approximately $17 million to repurchase 559,000 shares of our stock.
As we've said before, we expect that the rate of our buyback will continue to fluctuate each quarter, taking into account among other things our working capital needs, our stock price, potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions and economic and market conditions.
At the end of Q3 2010, approximately 67% of our cash was held outside the United States and in effect not available for share repurchases unless we repatriate the cash back to the U.S. and pay the corresponding taxes at a significant tax cost.
With respect to our receivables. Our day sales outstanding was 80 days as of September 30, 2010, compared to 70 days as of September 30, 2009. Again, we target approximately 75 to 85 as our DSO targets. To provide further transparency around our currency movement, we provided on our website additional detail regarding how currencies moved in Q3, 2010, and how these movement is expected to impact our year over year revenue comparisons for the remainder of 2010 assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of October.
As I mentioned earlier, our Q3 total company year over year revenue comparison was not impacted by currency translation, but EMEA region did see 7 points of currency headwind in the year-over-year revenue comparison in the quarter, while APJ benefited from 9 percentage points of currency tailwind. Currencies moved in favorable directions since our last earnings call. As a result, we now expect 0% to 1% of currency benefit both in the fourth quarter and for the full year revenue comparison.
As Mike said earlier in the call, we are increasing our full year 2010 and EPS guidance ranges. We increased our expectations for revenue growth from the higher end of the 8% to 10% guidance range to approximately 12% and GAAP EPS from the $1.60 to $1.70 to the $1.71 to $1.74 range. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the $1.80 to $1.83 range.
As we discussed in the past and as we saw in Q3, some of our cost and expense lines continue to grow faster than normal due to the increased investments in sales coverage and R&D along with a more normalized spending in 2010. As a result, we expect our EPS growth to be less than our long-term target of growing EPS at twice our revenue growth, probably more in the 1.5x range. Specifically as we discussed last quarter and saw in Q3, we anticipate headwind in Q4 from the following factors.
R&D for the full year increasing to approximately $150 million, $11 million due to FAS86 compared to the 2009 level of $117 million; annualized higher selling expense due to more sales territories and increased training costs associated with new territories and headcount; normal increases in G&A, such as base compensation increases and a return of expenses that were laminated were reduced in 2009, including training and education; lower Services gross margin, as we add to our consulting teams; and finally, potentially higher incentive compensation across the company as the company is performing better relative second quarter incentive plan metrics as compared to 2009.
That said, we are very pleased with our year-to-date performance, and we feel very good about our technology and competitive leadership positions, which is clearly with reflected in our operating results. And consequently, we have increased our guidance for both revenue growth and EPS for 2010.
And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

On the DSO side, it's really the timing on the transactions as they come through in the quarter.

On the DSO side, it's really the timing on the transactions as they come through in the quarter. So if they are coming through later and they will line up, hit the receivable downside, I won't have the collections during the quarter, if they are earlier in the quarter. So as I said in the call, on the prepared remarks, I'm comfortable on a DSO range of 75 to 85, and we are right at 80. We were 70 last year.  So There is nothing that I saw unusual in the DSO with respect to any leading indicator. So nothing in there that would change my opinion on the quality of the activity going forward. On the inventory side, it's just normal fluctuation on when we do our pre- builds versus when we're completing the shipments. There was nothing unusual in that activity. I saw a buildup in the Americas on the finished goods inventory side, which when I worked through the deals is perfectly anticipated. The inventory buildup, other than timing, proposed no -- created no concern to me. On the deferred revenue side, I'm still -- I follow this metric of over 70% of our deferred revenue balance in maintenance and subscriptions. That continues to hold true on 74% as of 9/30. So that other percentage that fluctuates significantly between quarter is the transactional side. So that side still continues to be fluctuating more, but as long as I'm over that 70% of my total deferred revenue, I feel very comfortable on. And the decrease from Q3 to Q4 -- Q2 to Q3 last year and Q2 to Q3 this year, was reasonably in line, didn't concern me, a little bit more this year, maybe like $7 million more, that didn't bother me because my percentages are still holding with the total deferred revenue. I hope that answers those questions, Katy."

So we had a very favorable deal mix in the third quarter. I will say there is a slight benefit of having the appliance family in that we are able to sell products that fit the opportunity as opposed to in previous years, we'd be selling the EDW or do buybacks in class into a lot of these opportunities. So there is a very -- it's a very minor benefit, but it's a benefit. But the one thing I would like to add is, previously we've been saying the appliance product margins are similar to the EDW, and even though, keep in mind, long-term we see appliances 5% to 10% of our overall product revenue mix. But we are starting to see slightly lower margins on the appliances versus the EDW, okay? If you take a look at our appliances, overall they have less software content than EDW, which makes them a little bit less positive in product margin, gross margin, and the 1000 class, that's that the big data, extreme data appliance, that has huge storage content. So you look at the mix of those product, the configuration there is a lot more storage, and storage is a little lower margin. And then of course the 4000 class machine which uses the solid-state drives, that comes with a lower margin. And we are doing very well with the 1000 class series, lots of big implementations. We had one customer at our PARTNERS Conference last week that was talking about a 10 petabyte implementation, and it's a very effective solution for this big data analytic that's going on in the marketplace."

What we were saying about the second half and as it goes into the fourth quarter is our services revenue is still growing mid-single digits. So that's kind of an overall weighting factor when we look at the second half of the year and as we go into the fourth quarter. Where we stand today, and I have to qualify this, that when you look at this on a region basis, you can get some pretty good swings going in one direction or another in a given quarter. And it's -- but where we stand today, APJ will be somewhat flat in the fourth quarter. Now, that said, APJ is having a very, very strong year outside of Japan. We're just -- we've been experiencing softness in Japan, as well as other companies, and in Japan, doing business there. And Japan's our largest country in APJ. So in the fourth quarter and as we've seen for the year, we'll see very strong growth in APJ outside of Japan. So APJ will be flattish as we stand today. EMEA will be up double digits, we believe at this juncture. And the Americas, which really has been driving the growth all year long with incredible product revenue growth, we're looking at Americas to be mid-single digits. A minor thing about the Americas in the fourth quarter, but it is a factor, last year they grew 5% in the fourth quarter whereas previous quarters in 2009 they were going against declines. Not big declines, but declines. And this year, strength that the Americas had in product revenue in the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, it's just not going to continue in the fourth quarter at the rate it has. It's not a red flag, it's just timing. When you step back and look at the Americas, what a fantastic year. When you step back and look at our product revenue growth and what we are doing for the year, it's a tremendous year. But we see the Americas, as we stand today, in the mid-single digits range. So that's the kind of the makeup of as you look at the implied revenue growth in the fourth quarter. It's a mix of APJ flattish, EMEA kicking in; they've got good activity all year and it's kicking in the fourth quarter, they'll be up double digits; and the Americas is in the mid-single digits range as we stand today."

We have a 3-pronged approach around the things we were reporting and going to market weighted and we are seeing good traction in our industry app. So we've got good examples of where incrementally we are able to pull SAS analytics onto Teradata and/or SAS applications onto Teradata, and we have several of our great customers showcased partners talking about that.

Product revenue was up 27% in the quarter and for the year is up 25%. This is the highest total revenue growth and product revenue growth we have achieved during the past 10 years.
Data volumes continue to grow exponentially, with new data types coming from new data sources. As companies look to bring these new data elements together with traditional data, this makes for an attractive market opportunity for Teradata and our integrated active data warehouses. This has also created demand for our appliances to address big data and other evolving opportunities in large, single subject data marts. We continue to innovate on many fronts to capitalize on the evolving landscape from big data to advanced analytics, to enterprise marketing management, to mobile intelligence. These innovations are translating into growth in our customer base and growth in the number of customers that Teradata serves. New customer wins year-to-date are at our highest levels in 6 years.
Turning to the regions, the Americas had strong growth again in Q3, with revenue of $292 million, which was up 18% over 2009. New account wins included a world leading manufacturer of aircraft engines, which will integrate and analyze large volumes of text analytics. This will enable them to quickly detect and react to changes that impact its forecasting and manufacturing schedules, which will in turn reduce inventory and service cost. 
Other new account wins included a major high-tech manufacturer and Procter & Gamble and a leading department store retailer as well as the top 2 banks in Mexico and one in Chile. Customer upgrades and expansions included WellPoint, which has added our solid-state drive appliance to deliver critical care alerts to hospital staff and physicians within seconds.
Our Extreme Performance data warehouse, the 4600 Appliance is enabling new time-sensitive, mission-critical, breakthrough applications that were not possible before. Additional upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Nationwide Insurance, Caterpillar Logistics and Enterprise Holdings, which includes Alamo, National and Enterprise Rent-A-Cars and one of the world's largest retailers and one of the world's largest manufacturers of phones and computers. Overall, the Americas is having an outstanding 2010 to date in terms of total revenue growth, product revenue growth and new customer wins. 
In EMEA, Q3 revenue of $109 million was equal to prior year, but it was up 7% in constant currency. New account wins included Unilever, a leading consumer packaged goods company. We are working with CPG manufacturers around the world to integrate, explore and analyze their consumer and retail point-of-sale information to better understand preferences and build brand loyalty. 
EMEA also had 4 government new account wins with 2 in Turkey and one each in Italy and Belarus.
The government sector, as you all know, is an under-penetrated vertical for Teradata and is a big opportunity for us. Upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Lufthansa, which is adding operational over active decision-making and is also redesigning their customer loyalty program and integrating it with partner airlines. And we had expansions at Lloyds, DHL, Telenor Pakistan, the Italian Tax Authority, COOP Norden, Mobinil in Egypt and at Chronopost International in France.
For the first 3 quarters of 2010, EMEA's revenue was flat with 2009 as reported and up 2% in constant currency. However, keep in mind, EMEA was going against the good prior year comparable when revenue grew 9% in constant currency through Q3 2009. EMEA's overall activity has been solid in 2010, and we expect good growth in Q4.
Asia Pacific Japan had an excellent quarter, generating $88 million of revenue in Q3, which was a 28% increase over the third quarter of 2009. In constant currency, APJ grew 19%. China is having a strong 2010, and we continue to see good growth in financial services there, our largest industry.
In Q3, we added Ping An Bank as a new customer, and they will be consolidating 26 data marts into 1 centralized EDW. Ping An Bank joins a growing number of financial services institutions relying on Teradata to provide a single view of the customer, reduce credit risk and drive top and bottom line results. 
During the third quarter, we also recognized significant expansions at several of China's top 5 banks, including ICBC, China Construction Bank and the Bank of Communications.
Across APJ, active EDW implementations are fulfilling mission-critical needs as well. A good example is the Australian border control, which is processing data from a wide range of sources, including near realtime data. The agency will utilize Teradata's event-triggering techniques to rapidly identify, analyze and respond to situations to ensure the safety of Australia's borders.
APJ also saw good growth from a number of other customers across the region in Q3, including the Australian tax authority; in Japan, Rakuten, Japan's largest online retailer; JCB; Mitsui Foods; and Sony Marketing. And in the Philippines, Globe Telecom.
Overall, APJ has grown revenue 15% this year as reported and 7% in constant currency. Growth has been especially strong in the countries outside of Japan. Our Annual Partners Conference was held in San Diego last week with over 3,000 attendees and 169 customers presenting at various sessions there.
One of the common themes from customers in Teradata was how to innovate with the wave of new big data. In particular, how to leverage the big data being driven from weblogs, smartphones, social media, sensors, et cetera, together with what they already know such as customers, products and supply chains.
Organizations that move quickly and figure out how to leverage this new information will have a clear competitive advantage in the marketplace, and Teradata is helping them to do that. I'd like to highlight a few of our announcements from the conference.
We introduced Teradata database 13.10, which further extends our lead with temporal and compression capabilities among other things. Teradata's temporal software automatically timestamps data to allow customers to track and properly account through changes that evolve in their business over time. For example, manufacturers can obtain more meaningful sales performance reports that account for territory realignments or customer mergers and acquisitions that have occurred over the years. And retailers can get sales comparisons that reflect products changing the different categories.
The Teradata database 13.10 has enhanced compression technologies that enable customers to store more data. Customers are receiving up to 20x compression for select data types and up to 4x for overall compression.
We also released the next generation of our platform family of partners, which significantly boost performance across all models and reduces energy consumption as well. For example, our 5650 Active Enterprise Data Warehouse delivers a 43% performance boost over the previous generation and does this in the same-sized footprint, which reduces energy and floor space requirements.
In addition, we announced enhancements to our Customer Relationship Management application which we call CRM. New features include mobile intelligence capabilities, customized reporting and visualization tools. Now marketers and executives can visualize their data and access reports and dashboards across all medium channels from a variety of platforms, including mobile devices and iPads.
In summary, we see more opportunities than ever before to help customers drive value through data warehousing. And we remain confident in our ability to execute with customers and in the market with our best-in-class technology, solutions and the world's best data warehousing consulting practice.
Given our performance in Q3, we are increasing our guidance for 2010 revenue growth to be approximately 12%, and we're increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance to the $1.80 to $1.83 range.
Now I'll turn the call over to Steve for more details. Steve?"

Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This quarter, we improved our revenue growth rates, expanded our gross and operating margins and increased our EPS.Now moving to our revenue details. Revenue of $489 million was up 15% from the thir",1742,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This quarter, we improved our revenue growth rates, expanded our gross and operating margins and increased our EPS.
Now moving to our revenue details. Revenue of $489 million was up 15% from the third quarter of 2009 and also up 15% in constant currency. Revenue for the first 9 months of the year was up 14%, 13% in constant currency. Product revenue of $243 million was up 27% from the third quarter of 2009 and up 25% for the first 9 months.
Services revenue of $246 million was up 5% and 6% year-to-date. Within services, during Q3, consulting services revenue was up 6% and maintenance services revenue was up 5%.
Turning to our gross margin. Gross margin in the third quarter improved to 57.1% compared to 53.4% in the third quarter of 2009. Higher product gross margin and a more favorable mix of product revenue versus services revenue more than offset a lower services gross margin in the quarter. Prior gross margin of 70.4% increased from 62.3% in Q3, 2009. The increase was primarily driven by a positive deal mix, particularly in the Americas region.
Services gross margin in Q3 of 43.9% was lower than the strong services gross margin of 46.2% achieved in Q3 2009. Our consulting services business is expanding their headcount in response to growing business opportunities. As we've discussed in prior quarters, this new headcount can have a negative impact on margin, particularly while the new consultants are being trained and are not yet fully productive or chargeable.
Our data warehousing consulting capability is unmatched and a very important part of our business model. Not only does it enable us to grow services revenue, but it may open the door to future product revenue opportunities.
Moving to a geographical view of gross margin. In the Americas region, gross margin was 61.6%, an improvement from 55.9% in the third quarter of 2009, driven primarily by higher product margins as well as a higher proportion of product revenue as compared to services revenue.
Gross margin in the EMEA region of 51.4% was down from the 53.2% reported in the third quarter of 2009, driven by lower services margins, which were offset somewhat by the improved product margins. 
Gross margin in the APJ region was 48.9%, up from the 44.9% in Q3 2009. The increase was primarily driven by higher product margin as well as a greater proportion of product revenue as compared to the services revenue.
Turning to our expense structure. SG&A expense in Q3 2010 increased $20 million from a year ago. The increase was largely driven by increased selling expenses associated with our strategic initiatives of expanding our sales territories as well as higher variable incentive compensation across the company.
As we discussed last quarter, we expected this level of increase in SG&A expenses and the third quarter of 2009 was abnormally low due to timing, and we curtailed the expenses due to the economy downturn and the associated uncertainty.
R&D in the quarter was $40 million versus $26 million in the third quarter of 2009. As anticipated, we continue to invest in our market-leading technology. For the full year 2010, we expect R&D to be approximately $150 million. FAS 86 unfavorably impacted R&D expense $5 million in Q3 as compared to Q3 2009 and will have an anticipated nonfavorable impact of approximately $11 million for 2010 as compared to 2009.
As a result of all these items discussed, Teradata's operating margin in the third quarter increased to 21.7% versus 20.7% reported in Q3 2009. Increased investments in sales territories and R&D will create more of a headwind on operating margin and EPS in Q4.
That said, however, for the full year 2010, we now expect operating margin to be approximately 21%, higher than the 19% to 20% original guidance range we provided earlier this year below the operating income line. The effective income tax rate in the third quarter of 2010 was 29%, which compared to a 25% effective tax rate in the prior period, driven by an overall proportional increase in U.S. pre-tax earnings. For the full year, Teradata expects a higher proportion of its pre-tax income will be generated in the United States in 2010 as compared to 2009. As a result, we are anticipating the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 27%. However, if the U.S. federal R&D tax credit is not retroactively reinstated by Congress before year end, our full year effective tax rate for 2010 will increase to approximately 28%.
GAAP EPS in Q3 2010 was $0.44 versus $0.36 in Q3 2009. Noncash stock-based compensation expense is included in our EPS results. During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $7 million or approximately $0.02 per share.
Non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter, excluding the stock-based compensation expense, was $0.46 in the third quarter of 2010. This compares to $0.40 in the third quarter of 2009, excluding stock-based compensation expense as well as an impairment charge that we took in the third quarter of 2009.
For the full year, we expect approximately the same amount of stock-based compensation expense in 2010 as we had in 2009, roughly $24 million, or approximately $0.09 per share for the full year. As a reminder, we have a table on the footnotes of our earnings release, as well as detailed schedules on our website that reconciles the differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and outlook.
Focusing on cash flow, cash from operating activities was $65 million in Q3 2010, versus a $96 million generated in the third quarter of 2009. When comparing to the prior year period, the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was principally driven by the anticipated increase in our receivables balance as well as the higher inventory levels, which are used as a working capital. After $18 million of capital expenditures versus $21 million of CapEx in the third quarter of 2009, we generated $47 million of free cash flow, down from the $75 million free cash flow in Q3 of 2009.
In Q3 2010, the timing of the meaningful revenue growth added to our receivables balance and increased our working capital needs as one would expect. In 2008 and 2009, free cash flow benefited from working down our receivables balance and improving our DSO. Our free cash flow is now expected to run in line with the plus or minus $25 million of net income annual guidance metric we talked about since the spin-off.
Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software.
With respect to our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2010, we have $741 million of cash, a $17 million increase from the end of the second quarter of 2010. During the third quarter, we used $29 million for tuck-in technology investments and used approximately $17 million to repurchase 559,000 shares of our stock.
As we've said before, we expect that the rate of our buyback will continue to fluctuate each quarter, taking into account, among other things, our working capital needs, our stock price, potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions and economic and market conditions.
At the end of Q3 2010, approximately 67% of our cash was held outside the United States and in effect not available for share repurchases unless we repatriate the cash back to the U.S. and pay the corresponding taxes at a significant tax cost.
With respect to our receivables. Our day sales outstanding was 80 days as of September 30, 2010, compared to 70 days as of September 30, 2009. Again, we target approximately 75 to 85 as our DSO targets. To provide further transparency around our currency movement, we provided on our website additional detail regarding how currencies moved in Q3, 2010, and how this movement is expected to impact our year over year revenue comparisons for the remainder of 2010, assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of October.
As I mentioned earlier, our Q3 total company year over year revenue comparison was not impacted by currency translation, but EMEA region did see 7 points of currency headwind in the year-over-year revenue comparison in the quarter, while APJ benefited from 9 percentage points of currency tailwind. Currencies moved in the favorable directions since our last earnings call. As a result, we now expect 0% to 1% of currency benefit both in the fourth quarter and for the full year revenue comparison.
As Mike said earlier in the call, we are increasing our full year 2010 and EPS guidance ranges. We increased our expectation for revenue growth from the higher end of the 8% to 10% guidance range to approximately 12% and GAAP EPS from the $1.60 to $1.70 to the $1.71 to $1.74 range. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the $1.80 to $1.83 range.
As we discussed in the past and as we saw in Q3, some of our cost and expense lines continue to grow faster than normal due to increased investments in sales coverage and R&D along with a more normalized spending in 2010. As a result, we expect our EPS growth to be less than our long-term target of growing EPS of twice our revenue growth, probably more in the 1.5x range. Specifically, as we discussed last quarter and saw in Q3, we anticipate headwind in Q4 from the following factors.
R&D for the full year increasing to approximately $150 million, $11 million due to FAS 86 compared to the 2009 level of $117 million; annualized higher selling expense due to more sales territories and increased training costs associated with new territories and headcount; normal increases in G&A, such as base compensation increases and a return of expenses that were eliminated or reduced in 2009, including training and education; lower services gross margin, as we add to our consulting teams; and finally, potentially higher incentive compensation across the company as the company is performing better relative to key incentive plan metrics as compared to 2009.
That said, we are very pleased with our year-to-date performance, and we feel very good about our technology and competitive leadership positions, which is clearly reflected in our operating results. And consequently, we have increased our guidance for both revenue growth and EPS for 2010.
And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

On the DSO side, it's really the timing of the year transactions as they come through in the quarter. So if they're coming through later and they will line up, hit the receivable downside, I won't have the collections during the quarter, if they're earlier in the quarter. So as I said in the call, on the prepared remarks, I'm comfortable on a DSO range of 75 to 85, and we're right at 80. We're 70 last year.  So there's nothing that I saw unusual in the DSO with respect to any leading indicator. So nothing in there that would change my opinion on the quality of the activity going forward. On the inventory side, it's just normal fluctuation and when we do our pre- builds versus when we're completing the shipments. There is nothing unusual in that activity. I saw a buildup in the Americas on the finished goods inventory side, which when I worked through the deals is perfectly anticipated. So the inventory buildup, other than timing ahead proposed no -- created no concern to me. On the deferred revenue side, I'm still -- I follow this metric of over 70% of our deferred revenue balance in maintenance and subscriptions. That continues to hold true on 74% as of 9/30. And so that other percentage that fluctuates significantly between quarter is the transactional side. So that side still continues to be fluctuating more, but as long as I'm over that 70% of my total deferred revenue, I feel very comfortable on. And the decrease from Q3 to Q4 -- Q2 to Q3 last year and Q2 to Q3 this year, was reasonably in line, didn't concern me, a little bit more this year, maybe like $7 million more, that didn't bother me because my percentages are still holding with the total deferred revenue.

So we had a very favorable deal mix in the third quarter. I will say there is a slight benefit of having the appliance family in that, we're able to sell products that fit the opportunity as opposed to in previous years, we'd be selling the EDW or the 5,000 class into a lot of these opportunities. So there's a very -- it's a very minor benefit, but it's a benefit. But the one thing I'd like to add is, previously we've been saying the appliance product margins are similar to the EDW, and even though, keep in mind, long-term we see appliances 5% to 10% of our overall product revenue mix. But we're starting to see slightly lower margins on the appliances versus the EDW, okay? If you take a look at our appliances, the have overall they have less software content than EDW, which makes them a little bit less positive in product margin, gross margin, and the 1000 class, that's that the big data, extreme data appliance, that has huge storage content. So you look at the mix of that product, the configuration, there's a lot more storage, and storage is a little lower margin. And then of course the 4000 class machine which uses the solid-state drives, that comes with a lower margin. And we're doing very well with the 1000 class series, lots of big implementations. We had one customer at our PARTNERS Conference last week that was talking about a 10 petabyte implementation, and it's a very effective solution for this big data analytic that's going on in the marketplace."

What we were saying about the second half and as it goes into the fourth quarter is our services revenue is still growing mid-single digits. So that's kind of an overall weighting factor when we look at the second half of the year and as we go into the fourth quarter. Where we stand today, and I have to qualify this, that when you look at this on a region basis, you can get some pretty good swings going in one direction or another in a given quarter. And it's -- but where we stand today, APJ will be somewhat flat in the fourth quarter. Now that said, APJ is having a very, very strong year outside of Japan. We're just -- we've been experiencing softness in Japan, as well as other companies, and in Japan, doing business there. And Japan's our largest country in APJ. So in the fourth quarter and as we've seen for the year, we'll see very strong growth in APJ outside of Japan. So APJ will be flattish as we stand today. EMEA will be up double digits, we believe at this juncture. And the Americas, which really has been driving the growth all year long with incredible product revenue growth, we're looking at Americas to be mid-single digits. A minor thing about the Americas in the fourth quarter, but it is a factor, last year they grew 5% in the fourth quarter whereas previous quarters in 2009 they were going against declines. Not big declines, but declines. And this year, strength that the Americas had in product revenue in the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, it's just not going to continue in the fourth quarter at the rate it has. It's not a red flag, it's just timing. When you step back and look at the Americas, what a fantastic year. When you step back and look at our product revenue growth and what we're doing for the year, it's a tremendous year. But we see the Americas, as we stand today, in the mid-single digits range. So that's kind of the makeup of as you look at the implied revenue growth in the fourth quarter. It's a mix of APJ flattish, EMEA kicking in; they've got good activity all year and it's kicking in the fourth quarter, they'll be up double digits; and the Americas is in the mid-single digits range as we stand today."

Teradata has delivered another strong quarter in Q3, with revenue growth of 15% and operating income growth of 20% versus prior year. Product revenue was up 27% in the quarter and for the year is up 25%. This is the highest total revenue growth and product revenue growth we have achieved during the past 10 years.
Data volumes continue to grow exponentially, with new data types coming from new data sources. As companies look to bring these new data elements together with traditional data, this makes for an attractive market opportunity for Teradata and our integrated active data warehouses. This has also created demand for our appliances to address big data and other evolving opportunities in large, single subject data marts. We continue to innovate on many fronts to capitalize on the evolving landscape from big data to advanced analytics, to enterprise marketing management, to mobile intelligence. These innovations are translating into growth in our customer base and growth in the number of customers that Teradata serves. New customer wins year-to-date are at our highest levels in 6 years.
Turning to the regions, the Americas had strong growth again in Q3, with revenue of $292 million, which was up 18% over 2009. New account wins included a world leading manufacturer of aircraft engines, which will integrate and analyze large volumes of text analytics. This will enable them to quickly detect and react to changes that impact its forecasting and manufacturing schedules, which will in turn reduce inventory and service cost. 
Other new account wins included a major high-tech manufacturer and Procter & Gamble and a leading department store retailer as well as the top 2 banks in Mexico and one in Chile. Customer upgrades and expansions included WellPoint, which has added our solid-state drive appliance to deliver critical care alerts to hospital staff and physicians within seconds.
Our Extreme Performance data warehouse, the 4600 Appliance is enabling new time-sensitive, mission-critical, breakthrough applications that were not possible before. Additional upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Nationwide Insurance, Caterpillar Logistics and Enterprise Holdings, which includes Alamo, National and Enterprise Rent-A-Cars and one of the world's largest retailers and one of the world's largest manufacturers of phones and computers. Overall, the Americas is having an outstanding 2010 to date in terms of total revenue growth, product revenue growth and new customer wins. 
In EMEA, Q3 revenue of $109 million was equal to prior year, but it was up 7% in constant currency. New account wins included Unilever, a leading consumer packaged goods company. We are working with CPG manufacturers around the world to integrate, explore and analyze their consumer and retail point-of-sale information to better understand preferences and build brand loyalty. 
EMEA also had 4 government new account wins with 2 in Turkey and one each in Italy and Belarus.
The government sector, as you all know, is an under-penetrated vertical for Teradata and is a big opportunity for us. Upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Lufthansa, which is adding operational over active decision-making and is also redesigning their customer loyalty program and integrating it with partner airlines. And we had expansions at Lloyds, DHL, Telenor Pakistan, the Italian Tax Authority, COOP Norden, Mobinil in Egypt and at Chronopost International in France.
For the first 3 quarters of 2010, EMEA's revenue was flat with 2009 as reported and up 2% in constant currency. However, keep in mind, EMEA was going against the good prior year comparable when revenue grew 9% in constant currency through Q3 2009. EMEA's overall activity has been solid in 2010, and we expect good growth in Q4.
Asia Pacific Japan had an excellent quarter, generating $88 million of revenue in Q3, which was a 28% increase over the third quarter of 2009. In constant currency, APJ grew 19%. China is having a strong 2010, and we continue to see good growth in financial services there, our largest industry.
In Q3, we added Ping An Bank as a new customer, and they will be consolidating 26 data marts into our centralized EDW. Ping An Bank joins a growing number of financial services institutions relying on Teradata to provide a single view of the customer, reduce credit risk and drive top and bottom line results. 
During the third quarter, we also recognize significant expansions at several of China's top 5 banks, including ICBC, China Construction Bank and the Bank of Communications.
Across APJ, active EDW implementations are fulfilling mission-critical needs as well. A good example is the Australian border control, which is processing data from a wide range of sources, including near realtime data. The agency will utilize Teradata's event-triggering techniques to rapidly identify, analyze and respond to situations to ensure the safety of Australia's borders.
APJ also saw good growth from a number of other customers across the region in Q3, including the Australian tax authority; in Japan, Rakuten, Japan's largest online retailer; JCB; Mitsui Foods; and Sony Marketing and in the Philippines, Globe Telecom.
Overall, APJ has grown revenue 15% this year as reported and 7% in constant currency. Growth has been especially strong in the countries outside of Japan. Our Annual Partners Conference was held in San Diego last week with over 3,000 attendees and 169 customers presenting at various sessions there.
One of the common themes from customers in Teradata was how to innovate with the wave of new big data. In particular, how to leverage the big data being driven from weblogs, smartphones, social media, sensors, et cetera, together with what they already know such as customers, products and supply chains.
Organizations that move quickly and figure out how to leverage this new information will have a clear competitive advantage in the marketplace, and Teradata is helping them to do that. I'd like to highlight a few of our announcements from the conference.
We introduced Teradata database 13.10, which further extends our lead with temporal and compression capabilities among other things. Teradata's temporal software automatically timestamps data to allow customers to track and properly account through changes that evolve in their business over time. For example, manufacturers can obtain more meaningful sales performance reports that account for territory realignments or customer mergers and acquisitions that have occurred over the years. And retailers can get sales comparisons that reflect products changing the different categories.
The Teradata database 13.10 has enhanced compression technologies that enable customers to store more data. Customers are receiving up to 20x compression for select data types and up to 4x for overall compression.
We also released the next generation of our platform family of partners, which significantly boost performance across all models and reduces energy consumption as well. For example, our 5650 Active Enterprise Data Warehouse delivers a 43% performance boost over the previous generation and does this in the same-sized footprint, which reduces energy and floor space requirements.
In addition, we announced enhancements to our Customer Relationship Management application which we call TRM. New features include mobile intelligence capabilities, customized reporting and visualization tools. Now marketers and executives can visualize their data and access reports and dashboards across all medium channels from a variety of platforms, including mobile devices and iPads.
In summary, we see more opportunities than ever before to help customers drive value through data warehousing. And we remain confident in our ability to execute with customers and in the market with our best-in-class technology, solutions and the world's best data warehousing consulting practice.
Given our performance in Q3, we are increasing our guidance for 2010 revenue growth to be approximately 12%, and we're increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance to the $1.80 to $1.83 range.
Now I'll turn the call over to Steve for more details. Steve?"
97999,114362192,162869,"Teradata Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2010",2010-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Teradata Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Mike. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This quarter, we improved our revenue growth rates, expanded our gross and operating margins and increased our EPS.Now moving to our revenue details. Revenue of $489 million was up 15% from the thir",1742,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This quarter, we improved our revenue growth rates, expanded our gross and operating margins and increased our EPS.
Now moving to our revenue details. Revenue of $489 million was up 15% from the third quarter of 2009 and also up 15% in constant currency. Revenue for the first 9 months of the year was up 14%, 13% in constant currency. Product revenue of $243 million was up 27% from the third quarter of 2009 and up 25% for the first 9 months.
Services revenue of $246 million was up 5% and 6% year-to-date. Within services, during Q3, consulting services revenue was up 6% and maintenance services revenue was up 5%.
Turning to our gross margind. Gross margin in the third quarter improved to 57.1% compared to 53.4% in the third quarter of 2009. Higher product gross margin and a more favorable mix of product revenue versus services revenue more than offset a lower services gross margin in the quarter. Prior gross margin of 70.4% increased from 62.3% in Q3, 2009. The increase was primarily driven by a positive deal mix, particularly in the Americas region.
Services gross margin in Q3 of 43.9% was lower than the strong services gross margin of 46.2% achieved in Q3 2009. Our consulting services business is expanding their headcount in response to growing business opportunities. As we've discussed in prior quarters, this new headcount can have a negative impact on margin, particularly while the new consultants are being trained and are not yet fully productive or chargeable.
Our data warehousing consulting capability is unmatched and a very important part of our business model. Not only does it enable us to grow services revenue, but it may open the door to future product revenue opportunities.
Moving to a geographical view of gross margin. In the Americas region, gross margin was 61.6%, an improvement from 55.9% in the third quarter of 2009, driven primarily by higher product margins as well as a higher proportion of product revenue as compared to services revenue.
Gross margin in the EMEA region of 51.4% was down from the 53.2% reported in the third quarter of 2009, driven by lower services margins, which were offset somewhat by the improved product margins. 
Gross margin in the APJ region was 48.9%, up from the 44.9% in Q3 2009. The increase was primarily driven by higher product margin as well as a greater proportion of product revenue as compared to the services revenue.
Turning to our expense structure. SG&A expense in Q3 2010 increased $20 million from a year ago. The increase was largely driven by increased selling expenses associated with our strategic initiatives of expanding our sales territories as well as higher variable incentive compensation across the company.
As we discussed last quarter, we expected this level of increase in SG&A expenses as the third quarter of 2009 was abnormally low due to timing, and we curtailed the expenses due to the economy downturn and the associated uncertainty.
R&D in the quarter was $40 million versus $26 million in the third quarter of 2009. As anticipated, we continue to invest in our market-leading technology. For the full year 2010, we expect R&D to be approximately $150 million. FAS 86 unfavorably impacted R&D expense $5 million in Q3 as compared to Q3 2009 and will have an anticipated nonfavorable impact of approximately $11 million for 2010 as compared to 2009.
As a result of all these items discussed, Teradata's operating margin in the third quarter increased to 21.7% versus 20.7% reported in Q3 2009. Increased investments in sales territories and R&D will create more of a headwind on operating margin and EPS in Q4.
That said, however, for the full year 2010, we now expect operating margin to be approximately 21%, higher than the 19% to 20% original guidance range we provided earlier this year below the operating income line. The effective income tax rate in the third quarter of 2010 was 29%, which compared to a 25% effective tax rate in the prior period, driven by an overall proportional increase in U.S. pre-tax earnings. For the full year, Teradata expects a higher proportion of its pre-tax income will be generated in the United States in 2010 as compared to 2009. As a result, we are anticipating the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 27%. However, if the U.S. federal R&D tax credit is not retroactively reinstated by Congress before year end, our full year effective tax rate for 2010 will increase to approximately 28%.
GAAP EPS in Q3 2010 was $0.44 versus $0.36 in Q3 2009. Noncash stock-based compensation expense is included in our EPS results. During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $7 million or approximately $0.02 per share.
Non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter, excluding the stock-based compensation expense, was $0.46 in the third quarter of 2010. This compares to $0.40 in the third quarter of 2009, excluding stock-based compensation expense as well as an impairment charge that we took in the third quarter of 2009.
For the full year, we expect approximately the same amount of stock-based compensation expense in 2010 as we had in 2009, roughly $24 million, or approximately $0.09 per share for the full year. As a reminder, we have a table on the footnotes of our earnings release, as well as detailed schedules on our website that reconciles the differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and outlook.
Focusing on cash flow, cash from operating activities was $65 million in Q3 2010, versus a $96 million generated in the third quarter of 2009. When comparing to the prior year period, the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was principally driven by the anticipated increase in our receivables balance as well as the higher inventory levels, which are used as a working capital. After $18 million of capital expenditures versus $21 million of CapEx in the third quarter of 2009, we generated $47 million of free cash flow, down from the $75 million free cash flow in Q3 of 2009.
In Q3 2010, the timing of the meaningful revenue growth added to our receivables balance and increased our working capital needs as one would expect. In 2008 and 2009, free cash flow benefited from working down our receivables balance and improving our DSO. Our free cash flow is now expected to run in line with the plus or minus $25 million of net income annual guidance metric we talked about since the spin-off.
Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software.
With respect to our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2010, we have $741 million of cash, a $17 million increase from the end of the second quarter of 2010. During the third quarter, we used $29 million for tuck-in technology investments and used approximately $17 million to repurchase 559,000 shares of our stock.
As we've said before, we expect that the rate of our buyback will continue to fluctuate each quarter, taking into account, among other things, our working capital needs, our stock price, potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions and economic and market conditions.
At the end of Q3 2010, approximately 67% of our cash was held outside the United States and in effect not available for share repurchases unless we repatriate the cash back to the U.S. and pay the corresponding taxes at a significant tax cost.
With respect to our receivables. Our day sales outstanding was 80 days as of September 30, 2010, compared to 70 days as of September 30, 2009. Again, we target approximately 75 to 85 as our DSO targets. To provide further transparency around our currency movement, we provided on our website additional detail regarding how currencies moved in Q3 2010, and how this movement is expected to impact our year over year revenue comparisons for the remainder of 2010, assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of October.
As I mentioned earlier, our Q3 total company year over year revenue comparison was not impacted by currency translation, but EMEA region did see 7 points of currency headwind in the year-over-year revenue comparison in the quarter, while APJ benefited from 9 percentage points of currency tailwind. Currencies moved in the favorable directions since our last earnings call. As a result, we now expect 0% to 1% of currency benefit both in the fourth quarter and for the full year revenue comparison.
As Mike said earlier in the call, we are increasing our full year 2010 and EPS guidance ranges. We increased our expectation for revenue growth from the higher end of the 8% to 10% guidance range to approximately 12% and GAAP EPS from the $1.60 to $1.70 to the $1.71 to $1.74 range. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the $1.80 to $1.83 range.
As we discussed in the past and as we saw in Q3, some of our cost and expense lines continue to grow faster than normal due to increased investments in sales coverage and R&D along with a more normalized spending in 2010. As a result, we expect our EPS growth to be less than our long-term target of growing EPS at twice our revenue growth, probably more in the 1.5x range. Specifically, as we discussed last quarter and saw in Q3, we anticipate headwind in Q4 from the following factors.
R&D for the full year increasing to approximately $150 million, $11 million due to FAS 86 compared to the 2009 level of $117 million; annualized higher selling expense due to more sales territories and increased training costs associated with new territories and headcount; normal increases in G&A, such as base compensation increases and a return of expenses that were eliminated or reduced in 2009, including training and education; lower services gross margin, as we add to our consulting teams; and finally, potentially higher incentive compensation across the company as the company is performing better relative to key incentive plan metrics as compared to 2009.
That said, we are very pleased with our year-to-date performance, and we feel very good about our technology and competitive leadership positions, which is clearly reflected in our operating results. And consequently, we have increased our guidance for both revenue growth and EPS for 2010.
And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

On the DSO side, it's really the timing of the year transactions as they come through in the quarter. So if they're coming through later and they will line up, hit the receivable downside, I won't have the collections during the quarter, if they're earlier in the quarter. So as I said in the call, on the prepared remarks, I'm comfortable on a DSO range of 75 to 85, and we're right at 80. We're 70 last year.  So there's nothing that I saw unusual in the DSO with respect to any leading indicator. So nothing in there that would change my opinion on the quality of the activity going forward. On the inventory side, it's just normal fluctuation and when we do our pre- builds versus when we're completing the shipments. There is nothing unusual in that activity. I saw a buildup in the Americas on the finished goods inventory side, which when I worked through the deals is perfectly anticipated. So the inventory buildup, other than timing ahead proposed no -- created no concern to me. On the deferred revenue side, I'm still -- I follow this metric of over 70% of our deferred revenue balance in maintenance and subscriptions. That continues to hold true on 74% as of 9/30. And so that other percentage that fluctuates significantly between quarter is the transactional side. So that side still continues to be fluctuating more, but as long as I'm over that 70% of my total deferred revenue, I feel very comfortable on. And the decrease from Q3 to Q4 -- Q2 to Q3 last year and Q2 to Q3 this year, was reasonably in line, didn't concern me, a little bit more this year, maybe like $7 million more, that didn't bother me because my percentages are still holding with the total deferred revenue. I hope that answers those questions, Katy."

So we had a very favorable deal mix in the third quarter. I will say there is a slight benefit of having the appliance family in that, we're able to sell products that fit the opportunity as opposed to in previous years, we'd be selling the EDW or the 5,000 class into a lot of these opportunities. So there's a very -- it's a very minor benefit, but it's a benefit. But the one thing I'd like to add is, previously we've been saying the appliance product margins are similar to the EDW, and even though, keep in mind, long-term we see appliances 5% to 10% of our overall product revenue mix. But we're starting to see slightly lower margins on the appliances versus the EDW, okay? If you take a look at our appliances, the have overall they have less software content than EDW, which makes them a little bit less positive in product margin, gross margin, and the 1000 class, that's that the big data, extreme data appliance, that has huge storage content. So you look at the mix of that product, the configuration, there's a lot more storage, and storage is a little lower margin. And then of course the 4000 class machine which uses the solid-state drives, that comes with a lower margin. And we're doing very well with the 1000 class series, lots of big implementations. We had one customer at our PARTNERS Conference last week that was talking about a 10 petabyte implementation, and it's a very effective solution for this big data analytic that's going on in the marketplace."

What we were saying about the second half and as it goes into the fourth quarter is our services revenue is still growing mid-single digits. So that's kind of an overall weighting factor when we look at the second half of the year and as we go into the fourth quarter. Where we stand today, and I have to qualify this, that when you look at this on a region basis, you can get some pretty good swings going in one direction or another in a given quarter. And it's -- but where we stand today, APJ will be somewhat flat in the fourth quarter. Now that said, APJ is having a very, very strong year outside of Japan. We're just -- we've been experiencing softness in Japan, as well as other companies, and in Japan, doing business there. And Japan's our largest country in APJ. So in the fourth quarter and as we've seen for the year, we'll see very strong growth in APJ outside of Japan. So APJ will be flattish as we stand today. EMEA will be up double digits, we believe at this juncture. And the Americas, which really has been driving the growth all year long with incredible product revenue growth, we're looking at Americas to be mid-single digits. A minor thing about the Americas in the fourth quarter, but it is a factor, last year they grew 5% in the fourth quarter whereas previous quarters in 2009, they were going against declines. Not big declines, but declines. And this year, strength that the Americas had in product revenue in the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, it's just not going to continue in the fourth quarter at the rate it has. It's not a red flag, it's just timing. When you step back and look at the Americas, what a fantastic year. When you step back and look at our product revenue growth and what we're doing for the year, it's a tremendous year. But we see the Americas, as we stand today, in the mid-single digits range. So that's kind of the makeup of as you look at the implied revenue growth in the fourth quarter. It's a mix of APJ flattish, EMEA kicking in; they've had good activity all year and it's kicking in the fourth quarter, they'll be up double digits; and the Americas is in the mid-single digits range as we stand today."

So at the conference, it looked like that we're targeting a November data for the SAP partnership. When you look at that timing and then when it would go GA, is your expectation that any impacts financially could be delayed until 2012 or maybe late 2011? And then on the SAS partnership that's been out for a while, the feedback was pretty positive but I was wondering is there any way to talk about how that impacts your revenue opportunity and maybe incremental opportunities that could generate if any?"

We are following the SAP ramp-up schedule for BW 7.14, and we are targeted to go into ramp-up in the November, December timeframe. So we do have customers that have been identified for that, and then that would put us into their cycle that would have us in Q1 doing the betas and then going GCA at the end of Q2. So to your point, we wouldn't look to be then taking it to market in a broad way until the second half of 2011. And we do work together following SAP schedule on that and their certification process and ramp-up process. So we're trying to move with that schedule and with the market to stay aligned there. We still do have lots of interest and lots of opportunity from customers wanting to integrate both their BW analytics and their non-SAP analytics into a common platform, and we think Teradata will be the best at that. As it relates to SAS, we are seeing good momentum with SAS. We continue to build on our strategy there. We have a 3-pronged approach around the things we were reporting and going to market weighted and we are seeing good traction in our industry app. So we've got good examples of where incrementally we are able to pull SAS analytics onto Teradata and/or SAS applications onto Teradata, and we have several of our great customers showcased at PARTNERS talking about that. So we hope to get a chance to see some of those, but we've had any money laundering applications from SAS, that we've been ought to put on Teradata and of course what that does is, it allows us to leverage the EDW that's in place, the data that's in place, and add new business value to their enterprise. So we are continuing to port and release industry applications, the latest of course, was the manufacturing warranty and analytics that we think will have good upside in helping customers determine their early warranty problems. And then also we just recently ported their customer application, customer marketing application to Teradata and had good success in that in Q3."

So as adding 90 more territories, it's not unreasonable out over 5 years, we are getting the same yield that we are getting across the company today. And that's a very meaningful number. And that's why we want to continue to add sales territories. We want to -- we do want to get a good yield on the revenue short-term, and we comments about 2011 here.

Teradata has delivered another strong quarter in Q3, with revenue growth of 15% and operating income growth of 20% versus prior year. Product revenue was up 27% in the quarter and for the year is up 25%. This is the highest total revenue growth and product revenue growth we have achieved during the past 10 years.
Data volumes continue to grow exponentially, with new data types coming from new data sources. As companies look to bring these new data elements together with traditional data, this makes for an attractive market opportunity for Teradata and our integrated active data warehouses. This has also created demand for our appliances to address big data and other evolving opportunities in large, single subject data marts. We continue to innovate on many fronts to capitalize on the evolving landscape from big data to advanced analytics, to enterprise marketing management, to mobile intelligence. These innovations are translating into growth in our customer base and growth in the number of customers that Teradata serves. New customer wins year-to-date are at our highest levels in 6 years.
Turning to the regions, the Americas had strong growth again in Q3, with revenue of $292 million, which was up 18% over 2009. New account wins included a world leading manufacturer of aircraft engines, which will integrate and analyze large volumes of text analytics. This will enable them to quickly detect and react to changes that impact its forecasting and manufacturing schedules, which will in turn reduce inventory and service cost. 
Other new account wins included a major high-tech manufacturer and Procter & Gamble and a leading department store retailer as well as the top 2 banks in Mexico and one in Chile. Customer upgrades and expansions included WellPoint, which has added our solid-state drive appliance to deliver critical care alerts to hospital staff and physicians within seconds.
Our Extreme Performance data warehouse, the 4600 Appliance is enabling new time-sensitive, mission-critical, breakthrough applications that were not possible before. Additional upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Nationwide Insurance, Caterpillar Logistics and Enterprise Holdings, which includes Alamo, National and Enterprise Rent-A-Cars and one of the world's largest retailers and one of the world's largest manufacturers of phones and computers. Overall, the Americas is having an outstanding 2010 to date in terms of total revenue growth, product revenue growth and new customer wins. 
In EMEA, Q3 revenue of $109 million was equal to prior year, but it was up 7% in constant currency. New account wins included Unilever, a leading consumer packaged goods company. We are working with CPG manufacturers around the world to integrate, explore and analyze their consumer and retail point-of-sale information to better understand preferences and build brand loyalty. 
EMEA also had 4 government new account wins with 2 in Turkey and one each in Italy and Belarus.
The government sector, as you all know, is an under-penetrated vertical for Teradata and is a big opportunity for us. Upgrades and expansions in the quarter included Lufthansa, which is adding operational over active decision-making and is also redesigning their customer loyalty program and integrating it with partner airlines. And we had expansions at Lloyds, DHL, Telenor Pakistan, the Italian Tax Authority, COOP Norden, Mobinil in Egypt and at Chronopost International in France.
For the first 3 quarters of 2010, EMEA's revenue was flat with 2009 as reported and up 2% in constant currency. However, keep in mind, EMEA was going against the good prior year comparable when revenue grew 9% in constant currency through Q3 2009. EMEA's overall activity has been solid in 2010, and we expect good growth in Q4.
Asia Pacific Japan had an excellent quarter, generating $88 million of revenue in Q3, which was a 28% increase over the third quarter of 2009. In constant currency, APJ grew 19%. China is having a strong 2010, and we continue to see good growth in financial services there, our largest industry.
In Q3, we added Ping An Bank as a new customer, and they will be consolidating 26 data marts into our centralized EDW. Ping An Bank joins a growing number of financial services institutions relying on Teradata to provide a single view of the customer, reduce credit risk and drive top and bottom line results. 
During the third quarter, we also recognize significant expansions at several of China's top 5 banks, including ICBC, China Construction Bank and the Bank of Communications.
Across APJ, active EDW implementations are fulfilling mission-critical needs as well. A good example is the Australian border control, which is processing data from a wide range of sources, including near real-time data. The agency will utilize Teradata's event-triggering techniques to rapidly identify, analyze and respond to situations to ensure the safety of Australia's borders.
APJ also saw good growth from a number of other customers across the region in Q3, including the Australian tax authority; in Japan, Rakuten, Japan's largest online retailer; JCB; Mitsui Foods; and Sony Marketing and in the Philippines, Globe Telecom.
Overall, APJ has grown revenue 15% this year as reported and 7% in constant currency. Growth has been especially strong in the countries outside of Japan. Our Annual Partners Conference was held in San Diego last week with over 3,000 attendees and 169 customers presenting at various sessions there.
One of the common themes from customers in Teradata was how to innovate with the wave of new big data. In particular, how to leverage the big data being driven from weblogs, smartphones, social media, sensors, et cetera, together with what they already know such as customers, products and supply chains.
Organizations that move quickly and figure out how to leverage this new information will have a clear competitive advantage in the marketplace, and Teradata is helping them to do that. I'd like to highlight a few of our announcements from the conference.
We introduced Teradata database 13.10, which further extends our lead with temporal and compression capabilities among other things. Teradata's temporal software automatically timestamps data to allow customers to track and properly account through changes that evolve in their business over time. For example, manufacturers can obtain more meaningful sales performance reports that account for territory realignments or customer mergers and acquisitions that have occurred over the years. And retailers can get sales comparisons that reflect products changing the different categories.
The Teradata database 13.10 has enhanced compression technologies that enable customers to store more data. Customers are receiving up to 20x compression for select data types and up to 4x for overall compression.
We also released the next generation of our platform family of partners, which significantly boost performance across all models and reduces energy consumption as well. For example, our 5650 Active Enterprise Data Warehouse delivers a 43% performance boost over the previous generation and does this in the same-sized footprint, which reduces energy and floor space requirements.
In addition, we announced enhancements to our Customer Relationship Management application which we call TRM. New features include mobile intelligence capabilities, customized reporting and visualization tools. Now marketers and executives can visualize their data and access reports and dashboards across all medium channels from a variety of platforms, including mobile devices and iPads.
In summary, we see more opportunities than ever before to help customers drive value through data warehousing. And we remain confident in our ability to execute with customers and in the market with our best-in-class technology, solutions and the world's best data warehousing consulting practice.
Given our performance in Q3, we are increasing our guidance for 2010 revenue growth to be approximately 12%, and we're increasing our non-GAAP EPS guidance to the $1.80 to $1.83 range.
Now I'll turn the call over to Steve for more details. Steve?"

Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This quarter, we improved our revenue growth rates, expanded our gross and operating margins and increased our EPS.Now moving to our revenue details. Revenue of $489 million was up 15% from the thir",1742,"Thanks, Mike. Good morning, and thanks for joining us. This quarter, we improved our revenue growth rates, expanded our gross and operating margins and increased our EPS.
Now moving to our revenue details. Revenue of $489 million was up 15% from the third quarter of 2009 and also up 15% in constant currency. Revenue for the first 9 months of the year was up 14%, 13% in constant currency. Product revenue of $243 million was up 27% from the third quarter of 2009 and up 25% for the first 9 months.
Services revenue of $246 million was up 5% and 6% year-to-date. Within services, during Q3, consulting services revenue was up 6% and maintenance services revenue was up 5%.
Turning to our gross margin. Gross margin in the third quarter improved to 57.1% compared to 53.4% in the third quarter of 2009. Higher product gross margin and a more favorable mix of product revenue versus services revenue more than offset a lower services gross margin in the quarter. Prior gross margin of 70.4% increased from 62.3% in Q3, 2009. The increase was primarily driven by a positive deal mix, particularly in the Americas region.
Services gross margin in Q3 of 43.9% was lower than the strong services gross margin of 46.2% achieved in Q3 2009. Our consulting services business is expanding their headcount in response to growing business opportunities. As we've discussed in prior quarters, this new headcount can have a negative impact on margin, particularly while the new consultants are being trained and are not yet fully productive or chargeable.
Our data warehousing consulting capability is unmatched and a very important part of our business model. Not only does it enable us to grow services revenue, but it may open the door to future product revenue opportunities.
Moving to a geographical view of gross margin. In the Americas region, gross margin was 61.6%, an improvement from 55.9% in the third quarter of 2009, driven primarily by higher product margins as well as a higher proportion of product revenue as compared to services revenue.
Gross margin in the EMEA region of 51.4% was down from the 53.2% reported in the third quarter of 2009, driven by lower services margins, which were offset somewhat by the improved product margins. 
Gross margin in the APJ region was 48.9%, up from the 44.9% in Q3 2009. The increase was primarily driven by higher product margin as well as a greater proportion of product revenue as compared to the services revenue.
Turning to our expense structure. SG&A expense in Q3 2010 increased $20 million from a year ago. The increase was largely driven by increased selling expenses associated with our strategic initiatives of expanding our sales territories as well as higher variable incentive compensation across the company.
As we discussed last quarter, we expected this level of increase in SG&A expenses as the third quarter of 2009 was abnormally low due to timing, and we curtailed the expenses due to the economy downturn and the associated uncertainty.
R&D in the quarter was $40 million versus $26 million in the third quarter of 2009. As anticipated, we continue to invest in our market-leading technology. For the full year 2010, we expect R&D to be approximately $150 million. FAS 86 unfavorably impacted R&D expense $5 million in Q3 as compared to Q3 2009 and will have an anticipated nonfavorable impact of approximately $11 million for 2010 as compared to 2009.
As a result of all these items discussed, Teradata's operating margin in the third quarter increased to 21.7% versus 20.7% reported in Q3 2009. Increased investments in sales territories and R&D will create more of a headwind on operating margin and EPS in Q4.
That said, however, for the full year 2010, we now expect operating margin to be approximately 21%, higher than the 19% to 20% original guidance range we provided earlier this year below the operating income line. The effective income tax rate in the third quarter of 2010 was 29%, which compared to a 25% effective tax rate in the prior period, driven by an overall proportional increase in U.S. pre-tax earnings. For the full year, Teradata expects a higher proportion of its pre-tax income will be generated in the United States in 2010 as compared to 2009. As a result, we are anticipating the full year effective tax rate to be approximately 27%. However, if the U.S. federal R&D tax credit is not retroactively reinstated by Congress before year end, our full year effective tax rate for 2010 will increase to approximately 28%.
GAAP EPS in Q3 2010 was $0.44 versus $0.36 in Q3 2009. Noncash stock-based compensation expense is included in our EPS results. During the quarter, stock-based compensation expense was approximately $7 million or approximately $0.02 per share.
Non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter, excluding the stock-based compensation expense, was $0.46 in the third quarter of 2010. This compares to $0.40 in the third quarter of 2009, excluding stock-based compensation expense as well as an impairment charge that we took in the third quarter of 2009.
For the full year, we expect approximately the same amount of stock-based compensation expense in 2010 as we had in 2009, roughly $24 million, or approximately $0.09 per share for the full year. As a reminder, we have a table on the footnotes of our earnings release, as well as detailed schedules on our website that reconciles the differences between our GAAP and non-GAAP results and outlook.
Focusing on cash flow, cash from operating activities was $65 million in Q3 2010, versus a $96 million generated in the third quarter of 2009. When comparing to the prior year period, the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was principally driven by the anticipated increase in our receivables balance as well as the higher inventory levels, which are used as a working capital. After $18 million of capital expenditures versus $21 million of CapEx in the third quarter of 2009, we generated $47 million of free cash flow, down from the $75 million free cash flow in Q3 of 2009.
In Q3 2010, the timing of the meaningful revenue growth added to our receivables balance and increased our working capital needs as one would expect. In 2008 and 2009, free cash flow benefited from working down our receivables balance and improving our DSO. Our free cash flow is now expected to run in line with the plus or minus $25 million of net income annual guidance metric we talked about since the spin-off.
Teradata defines free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures for property and equipment and additions to capitalized software.
With respect to our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2010, we have $741 million of cash, a $17 million increase from the end of the second quarter of 2010. During the third quarter, we used $29 million for tuck-in technology investments and used approximately $17 million to repurchase 559,000 shares of our stock.
As we've said before, we expect that the rate of our buyback will continue to fluctuate each quarter, taking into account, among other things, our working capital needs, our stock price, potential alternative uses of cash such as acquisitions and economic and market conditions.
At the end of Q3 2010, approximately 67% of our cash was held outside the United States and in effect not available for share repurchases unless we repatriate the cash back to the U.S. and pay the corresponding taxes at a significant tax cost.
With respect to our receivables. Our day sales outstanding was 80 days as of September 30, 2010, compared to 70 days as of September 30, 2009. Again, we target approximately 75 to 85 as our DSO targets. To provide further transparency around our currency movement, we provided on our website additional detail regarding how currencies moved in Q3 2010, and how this movement is expected to impact our year over year revenue comparisons for the remainder of 2010, assuming the currency exchange rates as of the end of October.
As I mentioned earlier, our Q3 total company year over year revenue comparison was not impacted by currency translation, but EMEA region did see 7 points of currency headwind in the year-over-year revenue comparison in the quarter, while APJ benefited from 9 percentage points of currency tailwind. Currencies moved in the favorable directions since our last earnings call. As a result, we now expect 0% to 1% of currency benefit both in the fourth quarter and for the full year revenue comparison.
As Mike said earlier in the call, we are increasing our full year 2010 and EPS guidance ranges. We increased our expectation for revenue growth from the higher end of the 8% to 10% guidance range to approximately 12% and GAAP EPS from the $1.60 to $1.70 to the $1.71 to $1.74 range. Excluding stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP EPS is now expected to be in the $1.80 to $1.83 range.
As we discussed in the past and as we saw in Q3, some of our cost and expense lines continue to grow faster than normal due to increased investments in sales coverage and R&D along with a more normalized spending in 2010. As a result, we expect our EPS growth to be less than our long-term target of growing EPS at twice our revenue growth, probably more in the 1.5x range. Specifically, as we discussed last quarter and saw in Q3, we anticipate headwind in Q4 from the following factors.
R&D for the full year increasing to approximately $150 million, $11 million due to FAS 86 compared to the 2009 level of $117 million; annualized higher selling expense due to more sales territories and increased training costs associated with new territories and headcount; normal increases in G&A, such as base compensation increases and a return of expenses that were eliminated or reduced in 2009, including training and education; lower services gross margin, as we add to our consulting teams; and finally, potentially higher incentive compensation across the company as the company is performing better relative to key incentive plan metrics as compared to 2009.
That said, we are very pleased with our year-to-date performance, and we feel very good about our technology and competitive leadership positions, which is clearly reflected in our operating results. And consequently, we have increased our guidance for both revenue growth and EPS for 2010.
And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions."

On the DSO side, it's really the timing of the year transactions as they come through in the quarter. So if they're coming through later and they will line up, hit the receivable downside, I won't have the collections during the quarter, if they're earlier in the quarter. So as I said in the call, on the prepared remarks, I'm comfortable on a DSO range of 75 to 85, and we're right at 80. We're 70 last year.  So there's nothing that I saw unusual in the DSO with respect to any leading indicator. So nothing in there that would change my opinion on the quality of the activity going forward. On the inventory side, it's just normal fluctuation and when we do our pre- builds versus when we're completing the shipments. There is nothing unusual in that activity. I saw a buildup in the Americas on the finished goods inventory side, which when I worked through the deals is perfectly anticipated. So the inventory buildup, other than timing ahead proposed no -- created no concern to me. On the deferred revenue side, I'm still -- I follow this metric of over 70% of our deferred revenue balance in maintenance and subscriptions. That continues to hold true on 74% as of 9/30. And so that other percentage that fluctuates significantly between quarter is the transactional side. So that side still continues to be fluctuating more, but as long as I'm over that 70% of my total deferred revenue, I feel very comfortable on. And the decrease from Q3 to Q4 -- Q2 to Q3 last year and Q2 to Q3 this year, was reasonably in line, didn't concern me, a little bit more this year, maybe like $7 million more, that didn't bother me because my percentages are still holding with the total deferred revenue. I hope that answers those questions, Katy."

So we had a very favorable deal mix in the third quarter. I will say there is a slight benefit of having the appliance family in that, we're able to sell products that fit the opportunity as opposed to in previous years, we'd be selling the EDW or the 5,000 class into a lot of these opportunities. So there's a very -- it's a very minor benefit, but it's a benefit. But the one thing I'd like to add is, previously we've been saying the appliance product margins are similar to the EDW, and even though, keep in mind, long-term we see appliances 5% to 10% of our overall product revenue mix. But we're starting to see slightly lower margins on the appliances versus the EDW, okay? If you take a look at our appliances, they have -- overall, they have less software content than EDW, which makes them a little bit less positive in product margin, gross margin, and the 1000 class, that's that the big data, extreme data appliance, that has huge storage content. So you look at the mix of that product, the configuration, there's a lot more storage, and storage is a little lower margin. And then of course the 4000 class machine which uses the solid-state drives, that comes with a lower margin. And we're doing very well with the 1000 class series, lots of big implementations. We had one customer at our PARTNERS Conference last week that was talking about a 10 petabyte implementation, and it's a very effective solution for this big data analytic that's going on in the marketplace."

So that's kind of an overall weighting factor when we look at the second half of the year and as we go into the fourth quarter. Where we stand today, and I have to qualify this, that when you look at this on a region basis, you can get some pretty good swings going in one direction or another in a given quarter. And it's -- but where we stand today, APJ will be somewhat flat in the fourth quarter. Now that said, APJ is having a very, very strong year outside of Japan. We're just -- we've been experiencing softness in Japan, as well as other companies, and in Japan, doing business there. And Japan's our largest country in APJ. So in the fourth quarter and as we've seen for the year, we'll see very strong growth in APJ outside of Japan. So APJ will be flattish as we stand today. EMEA will be up double digits, we believe at this juncture. And the Americas, which really has been driving the growth all year long with incredible product revenue growth, we're looking at Americas to be mid-single digits. A minor thing about the Americas in the fourth quarter, but it is a factor, last year they grew 5% in the fourth quarter whereas previous quarters in 2009, they were going against declines. Not big declines, but declines. And this year, strength that the Americas had in product revenue in the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, it's just not going to continue in the fourth quarter at the rate it has. It's not a red flag, it's just timing. When you step back and look at the Americas, what a fantastic year. When you step back and look at our product revenue growth and what we're doing for the year, it's a tremendous year. But we see the Americas, as we stand today, in the mid-single digits range. So that's kind of the makeup of as you look at the implied revenue growth in the fourth quarter. It's a mix of APJ flattish, EMEA kicking in; they've had good activity all year and it's kicking in the fourth quarter, they'll be up double digits; and the Americas is in the mid-single digits range as we stand today."

You know we announced 13.1 at the PARTNERS Conference, and typically we'll have a point release right after a major release and then you will have another major release coming. So it really boils down to if the next one is going to be a major release and it comes down to when we can qualify for technological feasibility that will drive that capitalization and the corresponding increase on the balance sheet and the amortization coming through as product cost. So if the timing of that holds true, then what we're anticipating I would think R&D for 2011 will be more in line with 2010."

We still do have lots of interest and lots of opportunity from customers wanting to integrate both their BW analytics and their non-SAP analytics into a common platform, and we think Teradata will be the best at that. As it relates to SAS, we are seeing good momentum with SAS. We continue to build on our strategy there. We have a 3-pronged approach around the things we were reporting and going to market weighted and we are seeing good traction in our industry app. So we've got good examples of where incrementally we are able to pull SAS analytics onto Teradata and/or SAS applications onto Teradata, and we have several of our great customers showcased at PARTNERS talking about that. So we hope to get a chance to see some of those, but we've had any money laundering applications from SAS, that we've been ought to put on Teradata and of course what that does is, it allows us to leverage the EDW that's in place, the data that's in place, and add new business value to their enterprise.
