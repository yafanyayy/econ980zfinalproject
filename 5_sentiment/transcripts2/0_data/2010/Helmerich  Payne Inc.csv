Welcome to Helmerich and Payne's Conference Call and Webcast to discuss the company's first-quarter earnings. With us today are Hans Helmerich, President and CEO; John Lindsay, Executive Vice President; and",710,"Thank you, Shannon, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Helmerich and Payne's Conference Call and Webcast to discuss the company's first-quarter earnings. With us today are Hans Helmerich, President and CEO; John Lindsay, Executive Vice President; and Juan Pablo Tardio, Director of Investor Relations. And as you know, most and much of the information provided today involves risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected results and that are discussed in our more recent 10-K. We'll also be making references to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find a GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the last page of today's press release.Today, Helmerich and Payne reported net income just over $63 million, or $0.59 per diluted share from operating revenues of just short of $400 million for its first quarter ended December 31, 2009. This compares with net income of over $145 million or $1.36 from operating revenues of approximately $623 million during last year's first quarter. Included in both quarters, net income are less than $0.01 per share of gains from the sale of drilling equipment and involuntary conversion of long lived assets. As you might have noticed on the statement of cash flows our capital spending for the quarter was $64.8 million. We are still budgeting $265 million of capital expenditures for fiscal 2010.At December 31, 2009, our total debt was $485 million, and our debt-to-total capitalization was 15%. Our investment portfolio, primarily comprised of 8 million shares of Atwood Oceanics and                                                                                                       $967,500 shares of Schlumberger, currently has a pretax market value of just over $350 million.On the income statement, you'll notice that general and administrative expenses up by approximately $7.2 million compared to the previous quarter. Approximately $4.9 million of that increase was due to increased stock-option expense, a non-cash expense, most of which was a one-time adjustment relating to the continuation of stock option investing at retirement for employees who meet certain criteria, the age and length of service with the company. This new compensation policy was approved at the December Board of Directors meeting and the accounting adjustment was applied to all current employees who now meet the requirement, even though still employed.There was also a $1.3 million increase in bonus accrual for the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009. We expect the G&A expense to be approximately $17 million to $18 million per quarter for the remainder of the year.As reported in our press release dated January 12, 2010, the company expects the recent devaluation in Venezuela to result in a currency exchange loss of approximately $20 million to be recorded in our second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2010. This devaluation loss estimate is based on the balance of our believer [ph] [15:40] base net monetary asset position in that country at December 31. And our current understanding of how this new -- to exchange rate system will work with the oil service activity.This exchange loss is non-deductible for tax purposes, which results in a negative impact to our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year. In addition, we expect to incur some additional income taxes in Venezuela for our U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets, which will also increase our effective rate. There are plenty of other complexities involved, but we believe our effective rate could be in the 40% to 41% range for the remainder of each of the remaining quarters for our fiscal 2010. Successful collection of outstanding receivables could lower this effective tax rate.After the adjustments corresponding to the recent devaluation in Venezuela, the total invoice amount by the company that remains due from PDVSA as of January 12, 2010 is valued at approximately $57 million of U.S. dollar equivalent, which includes $46 million in invoices issued since the company changed its revenue recognition to cash basis for its Venezuela operations.Invoices issued under cash basis revenue recognition include $42 million of potential future revenue. And approximately $4 million of non-revenue billings. All 11 H&P rigs that formally worked for PDVSA have completed their contracts and are currently idle. I will now turn the call over to Hans Helmerich, President and CEO, and after Hans and John have made their comments, we'll open the call to questions. Hans?"

While we are encouraged by the improvement in the business during the quarter, clearly conditions compared to a year ago have substantially changed for the better. Last year, the industry suffered through what I hoped will be a one- and 25-year-plus event involving our credit crisis and energy price collapse was challenging for all. Allow me to mention some examples of how our company coped with these challenges and then identify some of the challenges we see ahead as the industry moves to through current recovery.We weathered the storm well. First, we were well-served by the land industry's strongest coverage of long-term contracts with over 50% of our U.S. fleet secured going into the downturn. We were also in a good position with a strong balance sheet. After three years of record growth and capital spending, we maintained the debt-to-total capital less than 20%. Doug just mentioned that number is now is 15%.We also committed a year ago to complete our entire new build order book. While others canceled orders, we managed to maintain the continuity of our unique integrated manufacturing effort. We are now positioned to potentially continue to roll off one new rig per month through September 30 of this year.We went to extensive efforts to maintain our organizational and systems strength. As we've said before, the toughest part of last year was forced field reductions that corresponded to reduced activity levels. All the while, we made every effort to keep our folks. We high-graded positions on active rigs to retain as many skilled positions as possible. Placing dislocated employees on 31 new builds during the year was part of that effort. By avoiding the more damaging personnel reduction sustained by our peers, we positioned ourselves to both maintain the highest rate at operating performance and to smoothly transition to crew up as the recovery unfolds. That position is further enhanced by providing customers the industry's youngest and most technologically advanced rig fleet.Today, we see customers responding to that combination of value, driven by our best in class people and iron [ph]. The number of new customers who have previously not used the FlexRigs has now risen to over 30, and of course each of those turned down available competitor rigs at lower day rates in order to pursue the value proposition and efficiencies offered by the FlexRigs.John Lindsay will give you more specifics about how these new customers will help improve our activity levels and now, with all of our larger FlexRigs fully engage, how we would expect to see some spot market rate improvements.With 2009 behind us, the challenges going forward will continue to center around energy supply and demand dynamics and the resulting oil and gas prices. Clearly, this winter's cold weather has made a positive impact on natural gas inventories. But uncertainty remains surrounding longer-term demand and future supply contributions from LNG, Resource Play and now an increasing industry rig count.We continue to expect to see some choppiness ahead. If natural gas prices find a trading range, between $4 and $7, we will benefit, as customers are more discriminating and value driven for a longer stretch of time. Rig counts may in fact not reach either the previous highs or hopefully the lows of the recent past. And while fewer overall rigs will likely be needed, the trend towards more complex and challenging wells will favor the most efficient providers that are able to offer customers a safe, consistent and measurable value proposition.That goal is what we continue to focus on. And our people's success in delivering on this effort should continue to serve our shareholders well. In closing, I'm pleased to note that with all of the challenges we faced last year, our people delivered the best safety performance we have had in our 90-year history. It's an accomplishment we're very proud of. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to John for his comments."

We are experiencing continued improvement in the overall H&P rig count. Spot market pricing is strengthening.

We are experiencing continued improvement in the overall H&P rig count. Spot market pricing is strengthening.  Some customers are beginning to ask for term contracts on FlexRigs signaling confidence for future activity. New customers continue to high grade their fleets with FlexRigs especially in the unconventional resource plays. So overall, we are pleased with first quarter results and the outlook for the second quarter. In the following comments, I will outline our three operating segments.In our U.S. Land segment, 148 existing U.S. Land rigs are contracted today as compared to the 127 rigs reported during our last conference call in November of '09. Included in the contract rigs are three completed new builds that are generating revenue, however, no revenue days before their initial field deployment. Activity in the spot market continues to improve as 45 of the 148 contracted rigs are currently operating on the spot market, including 42 FlexRigs.The remaining 103 active rigs, including 79 new build FlexRigs under their original contract, are under long term commitments. 62 of our Land rigs remain idle in the U.S., including 29 FlexRigs and 33 mobile or conventional rigs. The number of active rigs during the first fiscal quarter averaged 122.4 as compared to 107.6 during the previous quarter. This does not include approximately six new build rigs under term contracts that generated revenue during the first quarter and about eight in the previous quarter due to customer requested delivery delays and again, no revenue days.As expected, revenue related to early terminations and customer-requested new build delivery delays in the U.S. Land segment totaled approximately $16 million during the first fiscal quarter. We've been pleased to see several of the rigs that were experiencing delivery delays become active sooner than expected. Reducing our estimates for this type of revenue in the future.We currently estimate this type of revenue to total approximately $19 million during the remaining three quarters of fiscal 2010, about 50% of that should be expected during the second fiscal quarter. In U.S. Land, the company expects an average of approximately 102 rigs to remain under firm contracts during the second fiscal quarter of 2010, 97 during the third fiscal quarter and 87 during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010. The average revenue per day for agent fee rigs under term contract is expected to remain in the mid twenties. Spot pricing is beginning to improve in selected unconventional place for our large FlexRigs, which is expected to drive a slight quarter-to-quarter improvement in H%P's average day rate for rigs on the spot market. We expect to experience a 15% to 20% quarter-to-quarter increase in revenue days or average activity as we transition to the second fiscal quarter.A combination of flat term contract revenue and a steep increase in the number of active rigs in the spot market may cause the average rig margin per day for the segment to slightly decline when excluding the impact of early termination and delay revenues. The activity improvements have been mostly by our larger FlexRigs, Flex 1s, 2s and 3s, and as of today, all of those rigs are fully contracted with most of the demand coming from the Haynesville, the Eagle Ford and Woodford shales.New contract since our last webcast have allowed us to add eight rigs in the Eagle Ford and six rigs in the Haynesville. A recent analysis of publicly available rig count data leads us to believe that we are the most active driller in terms of total combined rig count in the eight primary unconventional resource plays in the country including the Haynesville, Eagle Ford, Barnett, Woodford, Bakken, Piceance, Fayetteville and Marcellus. We lead activity in the Eagle Ford Barnett, Woodford and Piceance.Recently, many of our customers have begun to expand or implement for the first time, their pad drilling operations, allowing H&P to contract many of the FlexRigs 4S model rigs and you may recall that these rigs are designed to drill up to 22 wells on a single location. The increased interest for these rigs has not only been in our traditional areas such as the Piceance, Pinedale and Barnett, but also in the Marcellus, Bakken and Haynesville shales. We believe multi-well pad drilling will be a long term trend by operators in the U.S. for environmental reasons, as well as drilling and production efficiencies.Now due to our Offshore segment and in Offshore Operations, average rig margin per day increased sequentially by $4,257 to $24,936. The average rig margin per day is expected to decline but remained strong at over $20,000 during the second fiscal quarter. Average activity in this segment during the first fiscal quarter was 85%. Today, seven of the company's nine offshore platform rigs are active. As we transition from the first to the second fiscal quarter, the number of revenue days for the segment is expected to decline by 5% to 10%. The two idle rigs currently do not have good work prospects for fiscal 2010. I've previously mentioned prospect has been delayed by the customer. We are now working on three platform rigs owned by customers under management contracts. Two in the U.S. and one in Equatorial Guinea. In the International segment, the number of active International Land rigs is currently at 20, including six in Mexico, five in Argentina, four in Columbia, four in Ecuador and one in Tunisia. 12 of the 20 active rigs are under long-term contracts for the duration of fiscal 2010 and beyond. In addition, one new build FlexRigs under a long-term contract is still in the U.S., earning delay revenue while waiting on a customer to determine his first international location. We expect quarterly activity or revenue days for the segment to sequentially increase by about 5% as we transition from the first to the second fiscal quarter.We experienced a steep quarter-to-quarter increase in operating income, which was primarily a result of the company's incremental activity in Mexico and Argentina, as well as a very successful short-term project executed in Africa during the first fiscal quarter of 2010.We expect however, our average rig margin per day to decline by up to 30%, as we transition from the first to the second fiscal quarter, primarily as a result of the completion of the mentioned project in Africa.In summary, we believe the FlexRigs offering and the organizational competency to efficiently operate advanced technology rigs positions H&P for long-term growth. Drilling is becoming more challenging today as 50% of oil wells drilled in the U.S. are horizontal, compared to approximately 30% to peak in 2008. And today, over 85% of active FlexRigs are on horizontal and directional wells.Not only are our operators drilling more horizontal wells today, but they're also lengthening the laterals to provide more exposure to the reservoir. That puts even greater pressure on the conventional rigs or lesser capable rigs in general and highlights the limitations on the legacy fleet capabilities. Remember in 2008, approximately 70% of the available fleet was mechanical. Finally, we believe our proven track record of delivering reduced well cycle times and consistently delivering best value wells is a major reason that H&P has been able to add 30 new FlexRigs customers during the down cycle, and increase our rig count in the unconventional resource plays. And now I'll turn the call back over to Doug."

But there are some opportunities in the Middle East. I would've thought that they would have happened by now. I do think there is some possibility that some of those could happen by the end of this fiscal year, but again, I would've thought that they would've already happened. There is some additional growth opportunities in our current operating areas as well. So I think overall, what we're encouraged by is the value proposition that the FlexRigs provides is being understood more every year. And with that, I think it offers us an opportunity. Now on the other hand, keep in mind, obviously the larger FlexRigs now are at 100% utilization. We don't have that available FlexRigs on the ground just waiting to go so that causes a little bit of a challenge. But new builds are also obviously an opportunity as well."

On the Flex 4S, I'd mentioned that we've seen some pick up in activity there and I want to say just ballpark, we had about 20 Flex 4S available and if all these contracts come through that we think will, we'll end up with around 14 or so available based on what we know today. The Flex 4Ms, I don't remember the exact number that we have available but there are some opportunities in West Texas for those. And that's really pretty much it.

So as we go forward and anticipate the market to continue to improve, that's something that we have to position ourselves now for obviously, if we would see a big pullback or disappointment, we could do what we've always said we will do, which is put that equipment into a capital spare category. And as you remember, as we did our new builds over the last couple, three years, we purposely didn't have capital spares.And we knew that at the end of the program, we were going to have to have some of those available. I think it's a positive that we have that type of flexibility to either keep on task with one rig per month or we could pullback and again, resort to those main capital spares."

I don't think we'll necessarily find ourselves back in a 1,500 plus rig count, or I think that will take long enough. So it's hard for me to guess what that impact has on some of your questions. You've heard us talk about bifurcated market, and I think we are seeing that now and we're seeing the rigs that has the performance and efficiency characteristics can be engaged and we're finding that to be true. On our county, I'm assuming it's happening with our peers as well. So when you look at the number of AC drive rigs in the marketplace, and the small percentage, that's a 14% of the available industry fleet. I still feel pretty good that the customers are going to keep those rigs engaged, that they're going to keep them on task. It's hard to know. The big question is, is there pricing contamination that kind of goes through even the lower performing rigs? We're not really seeing that. We really are seeing a distinct bifurcation. And when I say bifurcation, it's not necessarily just a bright line between two halves. I mean there are some refurbished SER-type rigs that will compete. Having said that, we take market away from those guys. But clearly, the customer is going to leave a lot of pressure and idle capacity on the low end and is going to keep the high end of the industry fleet engaged. So I mentioned earlier, we're very open and talking about longer-term contracts. In the past, we've wanted a percentage of the fleet exposed to a spot  that was also why we were much more engaged in our robust building efforts. So now, that kind of takes on a new look and we'll be open to various contracting based on what the customers' interest are. So I know that's not a lot of clarity, but I think we also see the pressure now that we're seeing at the high-end fleet engaged. There's going to be some pricing pressures so we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves contracting that. So that's just kind of our thinking around here."

And I will say this, Angie, in contrast to other cycles, we are having more customer interest in term contracts on their side than you typically see in an early cycle recovery. And I think that's a good thing, and it's always been a little frustrating for us but that long-term commitments often times weren't made until the latter stage of where the cycle was.

So what we would anticipate is, and we've seen it in the last 12 months, is there's flexibility for them to pull back and to kind of play where or what the market serves up and we would expect everybody to be doing that in a thoughtful way and kind of see where they are in the summer time and how aggressive they're going to be with their CapEx commitments and those could either go up from what's been talked about or I'm sure they could go down.

Welcome to Helmerich & Payne's Conference Call and Webcast to discuss our second quarter earnings. With us today are Hans Helmerich, President and CEO; Executive Vice President John Lindsay; and Juan Pablo Tardio, Director of Investor Relations and soon-to-be CFO. Also joining us today is Mike Drickamer, H&P's new Director of Investor Relations. So we welcome Mike to the call.
As most of you know, much of the information provided today involves risks and uncertainties that could significantly impact expected results and that are discussed in our most recent 10-K. We'll be making references to non-GAAP financial measures, such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You'll find those reconciliations and calculations on the last page of today's press release.
This morning, we announced net income of $0.43 per share for our second quarter ended March 31, compared with net income of $0.98 per share during last year's second quarter and $0.59 per share during this year's first quarter. Included in our second quarter fiscal results is $0.18 per share from a currency exchange loss in Venezuela. 
During the second quarter, capital spending totaled approximately $78 million. And as we revised our estimate in March, we expect our total capital spending to be $330 million for the year. During the quarter, total debt decreased by $45 million to $440 million, and thereby decreasing our debt-to-total-cap ratio of 13.6%. 
G&A expenses of 20.8 were flat sequentially, but did exceed our estimate of $17 million to $18 million that we talked about in our last conference call due to higher-than-expected accruals for compensation expenses. For the remainder of fiscal 2010, we expect the G&A expenses to be in that $19 million to $20 million range.
On the other hand, the tax rate of 38% during the quarter was lower than our expected 40% to 41%, primarily because assumptions regarding tax obligations corresponding to the devaluation of Venezuela and some other tax-related estimates proved to be too conservative. And as a result, we now expect tax rates to be in the 37% to 38% for the remaining two quarters of this fiscal year. 
The pretax value of the company's investment portfolio is approximately $380 million or about $250 million after tax. And as you all know, 90% of that value is in Atwood and Schlumberger shares. And on a personal note, and as we've previously announced, tomorrow, I'm retiring after 24 years at H&P, the last 22 of which were as CFO, and I feel so fortunate to have served such a great company and with people who are not only competent professionals but who constantly strive to do the right thing. You are great people. 
I believe that much of the success that we've had here is due to the culture that Walt and Hans Helmerich have established during the 60 years plus, and those two gentlemen have led the company. And I'm grateful for their leadership and example. For the first 17 years of my time as CFO, I was the Investor Relations contact for the company. Since 2005, Juan Pablo Tardio has taken that role to a new and higher level, and I believe he'll do the same as the new CFO for H&P. 
I consider one of the most enjoyable things about my job was the opportunity to work with you, the research analysts, the portfolio manager shareholders and bankers, some of whom are on this call. I want you to know that I truly enjoyed that aspect of my job and found it a pleasure to work with you and to know you through the years. I will miss and have missed our interactions, and I want to wish each one of you the very best. 
And tomorrow, I'll give my farewell speech to my H&P colleagues and have much more to say about them at that time, but just let me say now that how proud I am of them and proud that I have been part of their team and appreciate all they've done to make this such a great company. So now, I'd like to turn it over to Hans Helmerich, President and CEO. And after Hans and John had made their comments, we'll open up the call for questions. Hans?"

Thanks for those nice remarks.

I was going to say something at the end of my comments, but let me just respond now and say on behalf of the whole company, we want to really express our appreciation for your 24 years of service. 
Doug, as many of you know, is highly respected inside and outside of the company. In fact, he was just honored recently as the top CFO in our group by Institutional Investor Magazine, which was a nice recognition. On a personal note, I've enjoyed working closely together all these years and appreciate the leadership skills and personal integrity that you've provided in your role here. Thanks for your contribution to the company, and you will be missed. And if you find yourself missing these calls, we'll be able to make room at the table for you. But I think the heavy lifting is going to shift to Juan Pablo and Mike. 
So with that, let me turn to my comments. Since our last webcast, the Baker Hughes land rig count has increased by 12% or over 150 rigs, while natural gas prices during that time has actually fallen by 25%. Energy cycles typically don't follow that pattern. Usually, lower declining product inventories stimulate higher pricing, which then leads to higher activity levels. But these are not normal times, and the building inventory levels and the uncertainty associated with future natural gas prices will likely keep things volatile going forward in the near term. Our guess is the volatility will be somewhat range-bound by several factors. 
The mild spring had contributed to record natural gas inventory builds and investors' concerns over the softness in natural gas pricing. This morning's build of 83 Bcf will only add to add to their concerns. Many analysts are calling for this year's faster-than-expected domestic rig count climb to not only top out but give back somewhere between  100 and 200 rigs. 
We're not seeing a pullback from our customers as high-performing rigs remain in short supply. But we would not be surprised to see the overall industry count soften during the second half of the year. At the same time, several factors such as strong oil prices, customers drilling to hold valuable leases and hedges in place have locked in higher prices, should all act as a downward buffer to the rig count. 
In regards to attractive oil prices of the current shift from gas to oil drilling has driven the growth in oil-related activity to increase by 180%, which outpaced the natural gas-related activity improvement of 40% since the bottom last year in June of 2009.  Beyond just a general increase in the oil-related drilling activity, we are seeing this oil drilling become more complex across the industry. Directional or horizontal wells now account for almost 50% of total oil-related activity, up from 40% a year ago. 
At H&P, our exposure to this category, classified as complex oil wells, is even greater. With nearly 70% of our drilling rigs that are drilling for oil are, in fact, drilling either directional or horizontal wells. We expect our exposure to oil to continue to grow. Since our last call, we've extended contracts on six FlexRigs already in the Bakken, and signed contracts to send an incremental six FlexRigs, including two previously-announced new builds to this market. We expect that by the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter 2010, we will have 16 rigs active in the Bakken Shale. So if oil direct We will have 16 rigs active open in the Bakken shale. So if oil-directed drilling in liquid-rich gas focus helps to limit the downward pressure on the rig count, the same limitation can be argued on the other end of the cycle for the possibility of upward increases. A repeat of factors that converged to fuel the up cycle from 2002 to 2008 seem to be a remote possibility at this point. 
That cycle saw oil prices more than triple and the rig count increased threefold, all to be followed by crashing energy prices and rig count to fell by more than 50% during the most recent down cycle. We described this on our last call as a one-in-25-year event. True or not, a case can be made that a significant period of time where the energy cycle is better behaved or a range-bound will ensue. The implications of this for the oil and drilling industry would be profound and would offer us, we believe, potential market share opportunities. 
Not long ago, the drilling industry primarily paid attention to fleet size instead of asset quality. Large fleets were cobbled together from very old rigs of every make and model during the down cycle. And as the up cycle took hold, those assets provided operating leverage in an improving environment. 
As E&P spending increased, the customer bid up day rates or even this commodity rigs that emerged from the weeds. Several factors have shifted to impact this model. Our introduction of the high-efficiency rig class, the FlexRig, forever changed the perception that a rig is a rig. Differentiated performance and efficiency gains created a value proposition that was reflected in a range of pricing and day rates among different rig types. 
And now, increasingly, the customer began leveraging the expanded capabilities of these rigs into more complex and challenging drilling requirements, hastening the obsolescence or unsuitability of underperforming assets. Today, those efforts are yielding results, the most obvious, in terms of robust gas supply visibility that may reduce the volatility or the highs and lows in future cycles.
Within this potentially more limited range, customers will remain focused on performance and drilling efficiency as the means to maximize value. The steady march towards more complex and challenging wells will further encourage customers to be more discriminating among the various service providers. Pricing and margins will reflect the current range of asset quality in the marketplace. Our FlexRig activities levels are now approaching the mid-90% range, while utilization for older industry legacy assets language in the 40% range. 
All of this is to say, the advantage on the service side will continue to shift from sheer size to performance. In the field driven by a combination of the people and iron, and that is where we plan on continuing our efforts. 
So with those comments, John, I'll turn the call over to you."

We are pleased with the improvement in the business even with the uncertainty of natural gas prices. Operators are directing more dollars towards oil liquid-rich plays, and FlexRig's are in a high demand for both. New an",1585,"Thank you, Hans, and good morning. We are pleased with the improvement in the business even with the uncertainty of natural gas prices. Operators are directing more dollars towards oil liquid-rich plays, and FlexRig's are in a high demand for both. New and existing customers are hydrating their fleets with FlexRigs as they pursue more difficult wells than flowing horizontal and directional drilling to deliver better and more cost-effective reservoir performance in shales and other unconventional plays. 
The following comments will describe the performance and outlook for our three operating segments, and we'll start with U.S. Land. As of today, 160 existing U.S. Land rigs are contracted as compared to the 148 rigs reported during our last conference call in January. Included in the contracted rigs are five completed new builds that are not generating revenue days, but that are earning revenue before their initial field deployment. Activity in the spot market continues to improve as 51 of the 160 contracted rigs are currently operating in spot market, including 48 FlexRigs. The remaining 109 active rigs, including 77 new build FlexRigs under the original contract, are under long-term commitments. 
53 of our land rigs remain idle in the U.S., including 19 FlexRigs and 34 mobile or conventional rigs. All of these idle FlexRigs are FlexRig 4s, which target shallower wells. Six of the 19 are already contracted and expected to commence operations in the third quarter. 
The number of average active rigs during the second quarter increased to 145.7 from 122.4 rigs during the previous quarter. This does not include an average of approximately four new build rigs under terms contracts that generated revenue, but not revenue days, during the second fiscal quarter due to customer-requested delivery delays. 
Spot pricing continues to gradually improve, especially for larger FlexRigs and unconventional plays, which should drive modest improvement in H&P's average rig revenue per day for rigs in the spot market to the high teens. The average revenue per day for H&P rigs already under term contracts is now expected to remain in the mid-20s during the remainder of fiscal year. This average is expected to increase by about $1,000 per day in average during fiscal 2011 and by an additional $600 per day in average during fiscal 2012.
Considering only existing contractual commitments, the company now expects an average of approximately 107 rigs to remain under term contracts during the third fiscal quarter and 105 rigs during the fourth fiscal quarter. The corresponding annual averages for fiscal 2010, 2011 and fiscal 2012 are 102, 75 and 42 rigs, respectively. 
Improving activity is expected to increase the number of U.S. Land revenue days by 5% to 10% quarter-to-quarter. Excluding the impact of early termination revenues and customer-requested delays, average rig revenue per day in the third fiscal quarter is expected to be flat to slightly down sequentially. Early termination and delay revenues for the remainder of fiscal 2010 are now expected to be approximately $14 million, above previous expectations of approximately $10 million due to one incremental contract termination on a conventional rigs and extended contract delays on two new builds.
Revenues from early terminations and customer-requested new build delays are expected to be $8 million in the third fiscal quarter and $6 million in the fourth fiscal quarter. When comparing the second fiscal quarter of 2010 to the first quarter and excluding the favorable impact of compensation related to early terminations and customer-requested new build delivery delays for U.S. Land, average rig revenue per day for the second fiscal quarter decreased by $138 to $22,586. Average rig expense per day for the second quarter increased by $1,016 to $12,089. And average rig margin per day for the quarter decreased by $1,154 to $10,497. 
A large percentage of the increased expense per day from the first to the second fiscal quarter was a result of reactivating 18 rigs from stacked status during the second fiscal quarter and 12 rigs toward the end of the first quarter. The costs were comprised of maintenance and supply costs, training and labor costs. A strategic part of the H&P brand is using best practices for cost control, but an equally important part is making sure that the rig is mechanically sound, and the rig leadership and crews have undergone training as we endeavor to deliver value to our customers. The balancing act between cost controls and delivering customer satisfaction can result in somewhat higher costs during times of increasing a rig count. But we believe that long term, this also delivers value to our shareholders. 
As we look to the third fiscal quarter, we expect that cost should remain flat or slightly lower as we continue to bring rigs out of stack and add rigs to the active fleets. As previously announced, three new FlexRigs with multi-year term contracts in the Bakken and Haynesville are scheduled to be completed the end of the fiscal year. Depending upon whether or not we choose to proceed with the completion of the five previously-announced potential new builds, we could deliver these rigs at a rate of approximately one rig per month lasting into the first fiscal quarter of 2011.
Now talking about our Offshore Operations, as expected, the average offshore rig margin per day decreased sequentially from the first to the second fiscal quarter. The sequential decrease was due in part to higher than expected revenues in the first fiscal quarter related to compensation by a customer for improvements on a rig. Average rig margins per day are expected to decrease by 10% to 15%, as one of our rigs is expected to be subject to a lower day rate during a rig move taking place during the quarter. Average utilization during the second fiscal quarter was 81%, down sequentially from 85% in the first fiscal quarter. Today, seven of the company's nine offshore platform rigs are active. One of the two idle rigs has a prospect for work beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010. 
Third-quarter utilization is expected to slightly decrease from 81% experienced in the second quarter. We are now working on three platform rigs owned by customers under management contracts, including two in the U.S. and one in Equatorial Guinea. In the International segment, activity days grew 4.5% sequentially to 1,766 in the second fiscal quarter, essentially in-line with our estimates of 5% growth. However, margins were stronger than expected with per day margins improving almost $500 to $11,038, exceeding our expectation for the quarter. The better-than-expected margins were due to collections in Venezuela and a retroactive day rate adjustment in Argentina. We currently have four FlexRigs earning reduced stand-by rates in Argentina due to a strike. Unless further payments are received from Venezuela, averaged daily rig margins for the International segment are expected to decrease by close to 20% in the third fiscal quarter. All 11 rigs in Venezuela remain idle. And while we will continue to pursue future drilling opportunities in  Venezuela for these 11 conventional rigs, we do not expect to return to work in Venezuela until additional progress is made on pending receivable collections and on conversion of local currency U.S. dollars.
Today, we have 21 active rigs internationally, including 12 contracted under long-term commitments. The active rigs by country are six in Mexico, five in Argentina, four in Colombia, four in Ecuador and two in Tunisia. During the third fiscal quarter, activity days are expected to increase slightly over 5% as one additional FlexRig3 is working into Tunisia. 
As mentioned in previous webcasts, one new built FlexRig under a long-term contract for international work is still in the U.S. earning delay revenue. This rig is now expected to be deployed and become active in Bahrain during the first fiscal quarter of 2011. This is the first FlexRig contract for the Middle East and we're excited about the opportunity. 
In summary, with $4 natural gas and $80-plus oil prices, E&P companies are announcing plans to reduce dry gas directed capital spending to fund increased levels of oil-directed and liquids-rich capital spending, especially in areas like the Bakken and Eagle Ford shales. Our recent activity would suggest that as capital is redeployed to more oily and liquids-rich areas, H&P would benefit because of the FlexRigs ability to drill more complex wells, whether gas or oil. We have doubled our Bakken exposure to 16 rigs and added five additional rigs to the Eagle Ford, which should also total 16 rigs during the third quarter. We've been able to continue to grow the fleet in pure natural gas plays as well, and since the last call, we've added seven rigs to the Marcellus for a total of 11 rigs, and five rigs in the Haynesville for a total of 27 rigs.
Finally, we talked a lot about the quality of our rigs, but I would also like to reinforce the importance of a strong field organization. In addition to the drilling demands placed upon the rigs to drill more complex wells, quality personnel continue to be a strategically important advantage for H&P, and we believe we have the best people in the business. We've grown our fleet since 2002 by designing and building new advanced technology AC drive rigs, and it wouldn't have been possible without the commitment by our people to organizational excellence and executing on the value proposition to our customers. And Doug, I wanted to mention also, we're going to miss you and for the last time, I will turn the call back to Doug."

With us today are Hans Helmerich, President and CEO; John Lindsay, Executive Vice President of U.S. and International Operations; and Mike Drickamer, Director of Investor Relations. I will make some general introductory comments, and we'll then turn the call to Hans for his and John's comments. 
As usual, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements. We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the last page of today's press release. 
During the third fiscal quarter of 2010 and as announced in the press release, the company generated $0.61 in earnings per diluted share from continuing operations, which excludes the write-down related to the Venezuela expropriation. Our U.S. Land Operations segment continue to lead the way delivering significant sequential quarterly growth in segment revenue, operating income and revenue days.
Our Venezuela write-down of slightly over $100 million was included in the reported loss corresponding to discontinued operations during the quarter. The book value corresponding to the Venezuela fixed assets and warehouse inventories and our consolidated balance sheet was approximately $70 million prior to the write-off. Excluding restricted cash in Venezuela that is still included in our consolidated balance sheet and is expected to be used in covering local obligations, an amount in Venezuelan currency that is notionally equivalent to approximately $21 million, was also part of the total impairment. Although, it is still held by the company in Venezuela.
Furthermore, the portion of accounts receivable in Venezuela that was included in our consolidated balance sheet has been fully impaired. Although, a notional equivalent of approximately $42 million in local invoices remains unpaid by PDVSA. As you would expect, we are currently evaluating available remedies that may enable the company to be compensated for the seized assets and for the unpaid invoices. However, it is premature to speculate when and if such efforts will be successful. And therefore, we will limit our comments on Venezuela to those in our prepared statements and public filings.
On a more favorable note, the company's debt level declined by $50 million to $390 million by the end of the third fiscal quarter and the corresponding debt cap ratio declined to under 13%. The company expects to continue to use internally generated cash flow to fully fund the construction of the announced new FlexRigs. Our capital expenditures estimate for fiscal 2010 remains at $350 million, but the actual CapEx level will depend on the timing of rig component procurement related to the company's ongoing new build construction program.
During the next few months, we will be working on an estimate for the company's fiscal 2011 capital expenditures level. But at this time, it is expected to be similar to or greater than our mentioned estimate for fiscal 2010. 
Our investment portfolio, primarily comprise of 8 million shares of Atwood Oceanics and 967,500 shares of Schlumberger recently had a pretax market value of approximately $300 million, and an after-tax value of approximately $195 million.
The effective tax rate for continuing operations for the first nine months of the fiscal year was approximately 34% and is expected to be in the 35% to 36% range during the fourth fiscal quarter. The tax rate for continuing operations during fiscal 2011 is at this point expected to be in the 36% to 38% range. 
I will now turn the call to Hans Helmerich. And after Hans and John have made their comments, we'll open the call for questions."
278341,109136388,71129,"Helmerich & Payne Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Juan Pablo.

As everyone noted now, we are recognizing a significant charge relating to the nationalization of our rigs in Venezuela. While the final chapter of this story will be about pursuing compensation for those seized assets and payment for outstanding receivables and that work is ongoing. The larger part of this disappointing episode is behind us. And we are moving forward accordingly. And as we move ahead, our focus energy are really better captured by today's announcement of nine new builds that have been added to a similar announcement of seven new build made earlier this month. The conventional thinking would hold that we are too early in this recovery for new builds, after all our major competitors have activity rates that languish around 60% or less. 
Traditionally, improving industry activity rates are a result of rising commodity prices, tightening rig supplies are then accompanied by improving day rates. As those rates move toward replacement cost economics, then a brief window opens for new builds, sometimes after the cycle turns over and we wait to do it again. But consider what happened this time, commodity prices have recovered from their lows a year ago, but hardly the levels that would fuel a resurgent cycle. While natural gas prices have recovered from their springtime lows, they are still down 25% from where they were at the beginning of the year. Even with the summer, that is 25% hotter than average, supply and price concerns remain with natural gas. That's why we believe our current new builds are not a result of a traditional energy cycle dynamics, but instead, they reinforce our long-held conviction that a growing number of customers are increasingly shaping their efforts in the field around efficient high performing rigs. 
A year ago, this is what we hope would happen. We said then that we expected a recovery to show more pronounced bifurcation or segmentation of industry fleet. Clearly, two markets have now emerged. One is made up of high efficiency rigs, where customers have employed nearly all available rigs as they secure their current and future needs, for increased activity in selected plays. The other market, made up of older conventional rigs remains underutilized and underpriced. Future demand may disproportionately favor new builds. Our customers are increasingly engaged in more complex drilling targets for natural gas, liquids, rich gas and oil. The old conventional fleet becomes less and less suitable for the task. 
For a time a segment of refurbished SCR rigs, a subset of the conventional fleet will act as a buffer for a steadily rising U.S. Land rig count. Like others, we've been somewhat surprised to see about a dozen rigs per week added to the overall domestic count over the last nine months. It's difficult to predict how long this expansion will continue. What would surprise this is a repeat of 2006, or the first half of 2008, where a bullish rig count outlook was fueled by very strong natural gas prices. If gas prices remain more range bound, which is what see is the most likely case, and customers will continue to strongly prefer high efficiency rigs, turning to conventional SCR rigs as a place holder or buffer, while the supply and demand dynamics work themselves out.
That type of marketplace favors our company strengths and capabilities and presents the potential for us to capture additional market share. Stated more plainly, there's a shortage of high performing rigs and oversupply of older conventional rigs. In between the group of not so old SCR rigs representing about 1/3 of the domestic fleet will play a swing role. This confirms our expectations for a segment in market where high performing rigs and our FlexRigs in particular, will continue to experience better utilization and margins compared to the industry fleet and positions us well to satisfy our customers' future demand. 
And with that, I'll turn the call to John to make his comments."

Operators continue to direct more dollars for oil and liquid-rich plays and FlexRigs are in high demand for both. New and existing customers are high-grading their fleets with FlexRigs, as they pursue more unconventional resource plays. Unconventional wells require mostly horizontal and directional drilling, enabling better and more cost effective reservoir performance, and FlexRigs are a catalyst for better drilling and safe performance. 
The following comments will describe the third quarter results and the fourth quarter outlook for three operating segments and we'll start with U.S. Land. Total U.S. Land segment revenues increased 13% sequentially to $367 million due primarily to higher utilization. As a result, operating income increased 14% sequentially to $103.1 million. During the third fiscal quarter, the average number of rigs working increased by 12 to 158, including 106 rigs under term contract and 52 rigs in the spot market. Total revenue days increased 10% to 14,374 days. 
Excluding the favorable impact of revenues from early termination and new build delays during both quarters, average rig revenue per day for the fiscal third quarter increased over $400 sequentially to about $23,000 per day, as average day rates for rigs in the spot market increased by over $2,000 to about $20,000 per day. 
Average rig expenses per day increase slightly more than $400 sequentially to $12,539 for the third quarter. These cost increases are directly associated with 12 FlexRig4 reactivations during the quarter, and 14 FlexRig reactivations in the second fiscal quarter. Without going too deeply into the details, the best way to describe why cost increased during the third quarter is related to relocating FlexRigs from lower cost per day basins to higher cost per day basins.
During the third fiscal quarter, 2/3 of the rigs reactivated moved to new basins compared to the second quarter where only 1/3 of the rigs we reactivated moved to new basins. While these inter-basin moves were challenging in terms of the cost required to acquire and train the right personnel, and invest in rig modifications that better suit the rig to the basin, these long moves puts FlexRigs in strategic areas. 
The average rig expense per day during the fourth quarter is expected to be flat to slightly down from the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, fewer rigs should be reactivated as the remainder of the stacked Flex 4s return to work and fewer of the reactivated rigs will make inter-basin moves. It's worth repeating when I said on the last call, our customers have high expectations from H&P and it's important that the rig is in top shape and the rig leadership and crews have undergone proper training as we endeavor to deliver value to our customer.
Today, we have 177 contracted rigs working, including 121 rigs under term contracts, which includes two new builds on customer requested delivery delays. The delayed rigs generate revenue but do not generate revenue days. Additionally, we have 56 rigs in the spot market, including 53 FlexRigs. 
Demand for FlexRigs continue to be strong, which are quickly approaching 100% utilization. Of the 40 idle rigs in the segment, only six were FlexRigs and all of those are Flex 4s. Five of these idle Flex 4s are now contracted to return to work in the U.S. during the fiscal fourth quarter and one is expected to deploy to Bahrain during the first fiscal quarter of 2011. This represents our second FlexRig contracted for operations in Bahrain.
Accordingly, we expect the U.S. Land average of revenue days during the fiscal fourth quarter to increase by 10% or more sequentially. With the high levels of FlexRig utilization, our average day rate for rigs in the spot market has increased to the low $20,000 a day level, while the average day rate for rigs under term contract remain in the mid-$20,000 a day range.
Excluding the favorable impact from early termination and delay revenues in both fiscal third and fourth quarter, we're expecting an increase of several hundred dollars and total average revenue per day in the U.S. Land segment from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. Considering only existing contractual commitments, the company now expects an average of approximately 123 rigs to remain under term contracts during the fourth fiscal quarter. The corresponding annual averages for fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2012 have also increased to 99 and 60 rigs, respectively. 
The average rig revenue per day for H&P rigs already under term contracts is now expected to remain in the mid-20s for the fourth fiscal quarter. Considering only existing term contracts, the average day rate would increase by about $1,100 per day in average during fiscal 2011 and by an additional $700 per day during fiscal 2012. 
Today, we announced nine additional new builds all of which are under multi-year term contracts with favorable day rates and returns. These nine bring to a total of 19 new builds announced during fiscal 2010 and the 159 new rigs since 2005. The 19 new FlexRig3s announced this year for U.S. Land will be activated in some of the most prominent basins in the U.S. to include six in the Eagle Ford, three in the Haynesville, three in the Woodford and two on the Bakken. All of the rigs will be drilling more challenging horizontal directional wells and we believe will be potential for more new builds in many of the unconventional plays.
In our Offshore Operations, as expected, during the third fiscal quarter, the number of activity days decreased to 638 from 660 as compared to the second fiscal quarter. Average daily margins decreased about 10% to $20,782 as one of our rigs roll to a lower demobilization rate during the quarter. 
The impact of the government-imposed deepwater drilling moratorium on our Offshore segment, segment's fiscal third quarter average rig margin per day was approximately $600. We now expect that one rig will receive lower standby rates during the fiscal fourth quarter and one of the rigs that was previously expected to return to full working rate during the quarter will remain on a lower standby rate. We expect that activity days will remain flat sequentially during the quarter, while the average rig margin per day is expected to decrease by 15% to 20% from quarter-to-quarter.
In the International segment, excluding the 11 rigs in Venezuela, we had a total of 28 rigs assigned to the International segment, one of which was recently mobilized to Bahrain. The other active rigs by country are six in Mexico, five in Argentina, four in Colombia, four in Ecuador and two in Tunisia. 
Revenue days increased about 7% sequentially to 1,881 days during the third quarter. The average rig margin per day from continuing operations in the International segment decreased by $975 to $10,192 per day from $11,167. The decrease is primarily attributable with four rigs in Argentina that received standby rates due to a strike and to extraordinary items that favorably impacted the second quarter and did not impact the third quarter.
Given the significant and countercyclical decline in land drilling activity in Mexico, our customer has informed us that at least four of the six rigs that we have in that country may be stacked or relocated to other international markets. All six of our rigs, working in Mexico are FlexRig3s under two-year firm term contracts, due to expire during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2011 and during the first fiscal quarter of 2012. 
Our first FlexRig in the Middle East, which is in Bahrain is under a long-term contract, has spud its first well and is expected to generate about 30 revenue days in the fiscal fourth quarter. As previously mentioned, we have received a long-term contract to move a second FlexRig4 to Bahrain. Both rigs should be active in that country by the end of the first fiscal quarter of 2011. Considering the startup of the first rig in Bahrain, as well as the reactivation of a rig in Colombia, we expect our total revenue days in the International segment to increase by approximately 5%. We also expect the average rig margin per day to decrease by 5% to 10% from quarter-to-quarter.
In summary, with the nine additional new FlexRigs mentioned today, we've announced a total of 16 new build contracts in the last 30 days, a significant achievement considering we're only one year past the bottom of the cycle. Since the first fiscal quarter, we have tripled our exposure in the Marcellus Shale to 12 rigs and with commitments for 20 rigs in the Eagle Ford, 19 in the Bakken and 20 in the Permian, we have doubled our exposure to these markets. Customer demand for high performing rigs has provided H&P with 100% contract commitment for the FlexRig fleet today even with the industry conventional rig fleet today at slightly over 50% utilization. However, the FlexRig is only part of the solution. As we've said in the past, a key driver of our utilization and pricing premium is a result of having the best people in the business that our commitment to delivering safety and performance excellence in the field. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Juan Pablo."

We've mentioned some of the deliveries go out into the late spring of '11. To your question of as you increase your cadence and your throughput, what does it do to your cost? I think there's probably some economies of scale and kind of a sweet spot, if you will, that allows us to increase that throughput, with the effect actually doing quite well with costs.

I will make some general introductory comments, and we'll then turn the call over to Hans for his and John's comments.
As usual, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements.
We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the last page of today's press release.
Income from continuing operations during the fiscal year resulted in approximately $286 million, equivalent to $2.66 in diluted earnings per share. On a quarterly basis, income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter increased to $0.77 in diluted earnings per share from $0.61 during the third quarter. 
Once again, our U.S. Land Operations segment continue to drive our increasing quarterly earnings, delivering significant sequential growth in segment revenue, operating income and revenue base. The company's debt level continue to decline to $360 million at the end of the fiscal year, resulting in a debt-to-cap ratio of approximately 11%. Capital spending was approximately $330 million, and net cash provided from operating activities was approximately $460 million during the fiscal year.
Our fiscal 2011 capital spending level will be primarily driven by our new build construction program as it adapts to market demand for incremental FlexRigs during the year. Given the number of customer commitments that we already have for new FlexRigs to be completed during the fiscal year and the level of rig component orders that are required to ensure our ability to effectively respond to additional new FlexRig demand, our current capital spending estimate for fiscal 2011 is approximately $600 million.
Depreciation expense for the fourth quarter was reported at approximately $73 million, which included extraordinary adjustments of approximately $3 million that are not expected to recur during the following quarter. Given the continuing growth of our FlexRig fleet, we expect our total annual depreciation expense to increase to approximately $300 million during fiscal 2011.
General and administrative expenses are expected to total approximately $85 million, and interest expenses after capitalized interest are expected to total approximately $14 million during fiscal 2011. Our investment portfolio, primarily comprised of 8 million shares of Atwood Oceanics and 967,500 shares of Schlumberger, recently had a pretax market value of approximately $380 million and an after-tax value of approximately $240 million. Our tax rate for continuing operations during fiscal 2011 is, at this point, expected to be approximately 37%.
We have no additional news related to Venezuela. As reported last quarter, our Venezuelan business was classified as a discontinued operation after the property and equipment of our Venezuelan subsidiary was seized by the Venezuelan government. We will continue to evaluate and work on available remedies that may enable the company to be compensated for the seized assets on unpaid invoices. 
I will now turn the call to Hans Helmerich, President and CEO, and after Hans and John have made their comments, we will open the call for questions."

Let me take the opportunity to reflect on some of the milestones that stand out for 2010.Juan Pablo already mentioned Venezuela, which was certainly our most disappointing milestone of the year and perhaps rec",1112,"Thanks, Juan Pablo. Good morning, everyone. Let me take the opportunity to reflect on some of the milestones that stand out for 2010.
Juan Pablo already mentioned Venezuela, which was certainly our most disappointing milestone of the year and perhaps receiving more than its fair share of attention, it is now behind us, and we've moved forward. 2010 was the year of transition and recovery. The industry fought its way back from a dramatic once in a 30 year free fall that started in the early fall of 2008 and bottomed in June of 2009.
In terms of utilization, margins, operating income and returns, we outpaced our Land Drilling peers during the recovery that unfolded in the second half of 2009 and continued through our fiscal year 2010. Industry-wide activity steadily improved through the year as the U.S. Land count currently stands at 80% of the number of rigs that we're running in October of 2008. For the company's rig count, we've exceeded that percentage. During 2010, we reactivated nearly 90 rigs, our largest single-year effort ever. In fact, we recently crossed the threshold of running 190 rigs in the U.S., surpassing our previous record during the last cyclical peak and achieving the highest level of activity in the U.S. and the company's history.
In addition to better utilization levels, we outpaced our peers by maintaining significantly higher premiums in the average rig revenue and margins during all parts of the cycle. We ended our fiscal year with over $24,000 of average rig revenue per day and with an average spot market pricing reaching approximately $22,000 during the fourth quarter, a $2,000 sequential improvement over the prior quarter. 
Another milestone worthy of mention is our new build effort in 2010. In the year where natural gas prices have fallen in half, we are pleased to be able to secure 23 new FlexRig orders since March of 2010, all secured by long-term contracts at favorable returns. These new orders help us maintain our market leadership of providing customers AC-powered rigs. 
Here is a breakout. 3/4 of our U.S. fleet is AC power, compared to our largest and second-largest competitors at approximately 33% and 6%, respectively. Our experience gives us a simple but profound advantage that enables us to build rigs for a lower cost and contract them at higher dayrates than our peers. That experience represents more than the aggregated 560 rig years of running AC power technology in the field but also the captured learnings of more than 10 years of our own design and integrated manufacturing effort. Stated more directly, we keep getting better at what we do.
Earlier this month, we rolled off the line our 100th FlexRig3, the flagship of our fleet. We held a celebration at Greens Port, Texas, our assembly facility. It was a good day on several counts. First, when we read so much about the diminished level of manufacturing in our country today, it's nice to have the opportunity to recognize the efforts of our guys who have built over 200 FlexRigs in that facility. We've had barbecue to over 250 workers, handed each one of them a crisp $100 bill to commemorate the milestone, and thank them for doing what they do better than anybody in the world. The 100th Flex 3 on display contained multiple feature enhancements and improvements compared to its earliest counterpart. These improvements come from eating your own cooking and a company-wide focus from our design and engineering effort all the way through our field operations to constantly improve and drive innovations that enhance performance.
The leadership team involved in the design, coordination, assembly, training, safety, remote monitoring, marketing and actual operations and field execution were all well represented, save for one. Alan Orr wasn't able to attend for the same health considerations that prompted his early retirement since our last call in July. Many of you knew Alan, and it's appropriate to recognize and thank him on this call, not only for the lead role he played in the design of the FlexRig but for the host of innovations he and his team introduced to the Land Drilling business.
Alan joined H&P as a roughneck after graduating from West Point. He worked his way up through our field operations and held several leadership positions, culminating in his most recent role as Executive Vice President of Engineering and Development. Five years ago, he was named the Contractor of the Year by the International Association of Drilling Contractors for innovations in safety, efficiency and technical achievements. I'm proud to be able to express, on behalf of the whole company, our thanks to Alan for his 35 years of loyal service.
I'd be remiss not to mention two final milestones for 2010. The company celebrated its 90th year anniversary, and we recognize my dad, Walt Helmerich for his 60th year of involvement with H&P. He started fresh out of Harvard Business School in 1950 and continues today as the company's Chairman. We're very thankful for his leadership and hugely indebted to him and many other loyal employees, past and present, that have built the company's reputation the old-fashioned way, brick by brick, precept upon precept. 
Our job going forward is to vigorously defend and enhance a powerful combination, being the world's oldest and most experienced land contract driller and at the same time, the most innovative and forward thinking. That is the charge we embraced heading into 2011. As we look to next year, we expect the standard uncertainty that attends this business to prevail. That uncertainty today centers on short-term downward pressure on natural gas pricing and whether or not the long-awaited pullback in the gas-directed rig count finally occurs. 
We've already get strong on this score earlier this year as natural gas prices continue to fall, but our general thoughts really remain the same. The clear customer preference for high-performing rigs in a bifurcated market will leave the brunt of any pullback to be borne by older, lower-performing assets. Absent an unforeseen pullback in oil prices, the historically high oil-directed rig count will help buffer any overall downward adjustment. Should one occur, we still believe we have opportunities to continue to gain market share even if the overall rig count falls below the current level of 685 rigs in the U.S.
Our growth opportunities will be governed by a capital discipline that served our shareholders well. We will continue to focus on leveraging a unique set of organizational competencies to satisfy our customers as they pursue increasingly complex drilling targets for both oil and gas. 
At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to John for his comments."
278341,115363956,88676,"Helmerich & Payne Inc., Q4 2010 Earnings Call, Nov 18, 2010",2010-11-18,"Earnings Calls","Helmerich & Payne, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Hans, and good morning. We are encouraged about the opportunities ahead as our new and long-term customers continue to exploit oil and liquid-rich plays in a low natural gas price environment, and FlexRigs remain in high demand. As we've said i",1557,"Thank you, Hans, and good morning. We are encouraged about the opportunities ahead as our new and long-term customers continue to exploit oil and liquid-rich plays in a low natural gas price environment, and FlexRigs remain in high demand. As we've said in the past, the unconventional plays require mostly horizontal and/or directional drilling, enabling better and more cost-effective reservoir performance. 
More complex drilling favors FlexRigs as they are a catalyst for drilling efficiencies and safety performance. The following comments will describe the fourth quarter results and the first fiscal quarter 2011 outlook for our three operating segments, and I'll start with U.S. Land. Our fiscal fourth quarter U.S. Land results benefited from the last of our idle FlexRigs returning to work. During fiscal fourth quarter, the average number of rigs working increased by 19 rigs to 177, including an average of 120 under current contracts and 57 in the spot market. With the higher level of activity, total U.S. Land segment revenues increased 19% sequentially to $436 million. As a result, U.S. Land segment operating income increased 15% sequentially to $118.9 million. Excluding the favorable impact of revenues from early termination and the new build delays during both quarters, average rig revenue per day increased over $1,000 sequentially to about $24,000 per day as average dayrates for rigs in the spot market increased by over $2,000 to about $22,000 per day during the fourth quarter.
Average rig expense per day increased about $500 per day to slightly over $13,000, but about $350 per day of the increased expenses we do not expect to incur going forward. Excluding the favorable impact of revenues from early contract terminations, and customer-requested new build delivery delays, average rig margin per day increased over $500 per day to approximately $11,000.
Our fiscal first quarter of 2011 will benefit from a full quarter contribution from the FlexRigs that went back to work in the fourth quarter, continued growth from FlexRig new build deliveries and the return of rigs from Mexico. As of today, we have 190 contracted rigs, including 132 under term contracts and 58 in the spot market. Of the 58 rigs in the spot market, 54 are FlexRigs. As Hans mentioned, the 190 rigs surpassed our previous record during the last cyclical peak in October 2008 and represents the highest level of U.S. activity in the 90-year history of the company.
Of the 132 rigs currently under term contracts, 64 are scheduled to reprice during fiscal 2011. The repricing is expected to have a slightly favorable impact on our average daily revenue during the first fiscal quarter. The average dayrate per rigs under term contracts expiring after 2011 is about $1,200 a day, above the mentioned current average for all rigs under term contract.
Late in fiscal fourth quarter, two of the six rigs previously assigned to operations in Mexico return to the U.S. and are currently under contract. The remaining four rigs will be discussed in more detail in the International segment. We expect total revenue days for the U.S. Land segment to increase approximately 5% to 7%. Excluding the favorable impact of revenue in the fourth quarter from early contract terminations and customer-requested new build delivery delays, we expect average rig revenue per day to increase by over $500 per day in both the average term and the spot rates in the first fiscal quarter.
We do not expect significant revenues from early contract terminations in the next few quarters or customer-requested new build delivery delays. I'll talk briefly about our new builds. Today, we announced contract supporting the construction of four additional FlexRig3s, all with three-year firm term contracts. With these four rigs, we've announced 163 new build Flex 3s and 4s since 2005, including 23 Flex 3s since March of 2010. 12 of these rigs are currently under construction and are expected to be completed during the first three quarters of fiscal 2011. The 23 new FlexRig3s announced during the last eight months for U.S. Land are being activated in some of the most attractive basins in the U.S., including the Eagle Ford, Cana, Woodford, Bakken, Bone Spring and the Haynesville. All of the rigs we'll be drilling more complex horizontal and directional wells as customers extend laterals and drill more multilateral wells.
In our Offshore segment, the Offshore segment benefited from better-than-expected operating margins. Segment operating income for Offshore increased 17% sequentially to $13.1 million despite a 7% decrease in revenues. Total revenue days during the fiscal fourth quarter of 644 days were essentially flat sequentially. Average rig margin per day of $22,581 was positively impacted by approximately $2,000 due to a reduction of certain expenses in the quarter. Excluding this benefit, average rig margin per day was essentially flat sequentially.
Looking forward to the first fiscal quarter of 2011, two of the rigs that were on standby during the fourth quarter are expected to return to work toward the end of the first quarter. Rigs on standby still generate revenue days, so revenue days are expected to be flat sequentially. Additionally, excluding the $2,000 per day benefit during the fourth quarter, average rig margins per day are expected to decrease by less than 5% sequentially. The International Land segment benefited from about $6 million of early contract termination revenue from two rigs previously assigned to operations in Mexico, and this sets the stage for better-than-expected quarter. International Land segment revenues increased 16% sequentially to $69.8 million, and segment operating income increased almost 57% to $15.5 million. Total International Land revenue days increased 5% during the quarter to 1,976 days as we had an incremental rig go to work in Colombia, and our first FlexRig began operations in the Middle East.
Excluding the favorable impact from early termination revenues, average rig revenue per day decreased about $600 per day to a little over $30,000 per day, and the average rig margin per day declined by $664 to $9,528 from $10,192 during the third quarter. Going forward, our International segment will be positively impacted by the full quarter operations of the FlexRigs that started work during the fourth quarter in Bahrain, as well as the rig in Colombia. Our second FlexRig in Bahrain recently spud its first well, and we have now received a contract for a third FlexRig in Bahrain, which will transfer from the U.S. for a start-up expected during the third fiscal quarter. We currently have 28 rigs assigned to the International Land segment, including three FlexRigs for Bahrain and four remaining FlexRigs in Mexico. With the four rigs in Mexico now expected to return to the U.S. the first two quarters of fiscal 2011, total revenue days for the first quarter are expected to decrease by about 7% from the fourth quarter.
Including the favorable impact from the early termination revenues, average rig margin per day in the first quarter is expected to decrease by less than 5%. Excluding this favorable impact from early termination revenues, average rig margin per day is expected to increase a little over 5% sequentially. This increase in average rig margin per day is a combination of increased activity in the Middle East and decreased activity in Mexico where the rigs were contracted at lower dayrates in late 2009.
I should also mention the early success in our new operation in Bahrain. Since spud of the first well in July, the first FlexRig4 has drilled 13 wells, and the most recent was a record well, including the rig move of about four and a half days. For our first start-up in the Middle East, we're pleased with the early results. 
And in summary, it's clear that many of our competitors have now embraced AC-powered rigs, and we believe this supports our long-held position that AC-powered rigs could ultimately displace the majority of the old legacy mechanical fleet of rigs. Today, approximately 700 mechanical rigs are active in the U.S. And it's estimated that about half of those rigs may be drilling non-vertical, more complex wells whereas previously, those rigs may have been drilling vertical wells. This recent industry shift to drilling more complex wells and that's both oil and gas wells, long term, creates performance challenges and limitations for contractors with mechanical rigs with regard to drilling efficiency, environmental and safety performance. 
The industry is most likely going through a rig replacement phase not a rig retooling phase like the last five years, and that phase, clearly, favors H&P. H&P has been designing and building AC drive Flex 3s since 2002, and we believe our first mover advantage has enabled us to capture over 40% of the AC rig market share. Our experience and captured learnings should enable us to continue our market share growth of the AC fleet in the U.S. and international markets. 
Finally, our fiscal 2010 was another very good year with respect to our safety performance, especially considering we put nearly 90 rigs to work in 12 months in the U.S. and had two new start-ups in two countries. Of course, this achievement wouldn't have been possible without our long-term field employees, better coaching of many of our new rig employees and mentoring by our management teams to advance the H&P culture, and we want to thank all of those personnel that made a difference. 
And I'll turn the call back to JP."

We're really excited about that. The Permian has been one of the tougher areas for us to break into. Obviously, like you say, as the drilling gets more complex, more horizontal wells, longer laterals, it's going to favor FlexRigs. I think we'll continue to see rigs migrate in the Permian. But I also see -- I'm also encouraged by a smaller rig fleet, our Flex 4s. We're starting to see a lot of activity pick up in the Permian there, and some of that work is straight vertical wells that we're able to impact the cycle times pretty dramatically, and so that's causing a lot of demand for our Flex 4s. So we're excited about that. So it's really a combination. I think we could see more rigs working in the Sprayberry and the Wolfberry and then also seeing more rigs migrate to the Bone Spring and other areas that are going horizontal."

With us today are Hans Helmerich, President and CEO, John Lindsay, Executive Vice President in both U.S. and International Operations, and Mike Drickamer, Director of Investor Relations. I will make some general introductory comments and we’ll then turn the call to Hans, for his and John’s comments.
As usual, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The company’s actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements.
We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the last page of today’s press release.
Income from continuing operations during the fiscal year resulted approximately $286 million, equivalent to $2.66 in diluted earnings per share. On a quarterly basis, income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter increased to $0.77 in diluted earnings per share, from $0.61 during the third quarter.
Once again, our U.S. land operations segment continued to drive our increasing quarterly earnings, delivering significant sequential growth in segment revenue, operating income, and revenue days.
The company’s debt level continued to decline to $360 million at the end of the fiscal year, resulting in a debt-to-cap ratio of approximately 11%, capital spending was approximately $330 million, and net cash provided from operating activities worth approximately $460 million during the fiscal year.
Our fiscal 2011 capital spending level will be primarily driven by our new build construction program as it adapts to market demand for incremental FlexRigs during the year.
Given the number of customer commitments that we already have for new FlexRigs to be completed during the fiscal year and a level of a rig component orders that are required to ensure our ability to effectively respond to additional new FlexRig demand, our current capital spending estimate for fiscal 2011 is approximately $600 million.
Depreciation expense for the fourth quarter was reported at approximately $73 million, which included extraordinary adjustments of approximately $3 million that are not expected to recur during the following quarter.
Given the continuing growth of our FlexRig fleet, we expect our total annual depreciation expense to increase to approximately $300 million during fiscal 2011.
General and administrative expenses are expected to total approximately $85 million and interest expenses after capitalized interest are expected to total approximately $14 million during fiscal 2011.
Our investment portfolio primarily comprised of 8 million shares of Atwood Oceanics and 967,500 shares of Schlumberger, recently had a pre-tax market value of approximately $380 million and an after tax value of approximately $240 million. Our tax rate for continuing operations during fiscal 2011 is, at this point, expected to be approximately 37%.
We have no additional news related to Venezuela. As reported last quarter, our Venezuelan business was classified as a discontinued operation after the property and equipment of our Venezuelan subsidiary was ceased by the Venezuelan government. We will continue to evaluate and work on available remedies that may enable the company to be compensated for the ceased assets on unpaid invoices.
I will now turn the call to Hans Helmerich, President and CEO, and after Hans and John have made their comments, we will open the call for questions.

Good morning everyone. Let me take the opportunity to reflect on some of the milestones that standout for 2010.
Juan Pablo already mentioned Venezuela, which was certainly almost disappointing milestone of the year and while perhaps receiving more than its fair share attention, it is now behind us and we’ve moved forward.
2010 was the year of transition and recovery. The industry fought its way back from the dramatic once in a 30-year free fall that started in the early fall of 2008 and bottomed in the June of 2009. In terms of utilization, margins, operating income and returns, we outpaced our land drilling peers during the recovery that unfolded in the second half of 2009, and continued through our fiscal year 2010.
Industry-wide activity steadily improved through the year as the U. S. land count currently stands at 80% of the number of rigs that were running in October of 2008. For the company’s rig count, we have exceeded that percentage
During 2010, we reactivated nearly 90 rigs, our largest single year effort ever. In fact, we recently crossed the threshold of running a 190 rigs in the U.S., surpassing our previous record during the last cyclical peak and achieving the highest level of activity in the U.S. in the company’s history.
In addition to better utilization levels we outpaced our peers by maintaining significantly higher premiums in the average rig revenue and margins during all parts of this cycle. We ended our fiscal year with over $24,000 of average rig revenue per day, and with an average spot market pricing reaching approximately $22,000 during the fourth quarter, a $2,000 sequential improvement over the prior quarter.
Another milestone worthy of mention is our new build effort in 2010. In a year where natural gas prices have fallen in half, we’re pleased to be able to secure 23 new FlexRig orders since March of 2010, all secured by long-term contracts at favorable returns. These new orders help us maintain our market leadership of providing customers AC-powered rigs. Here is breakout. Three quarters of our U.S. fleet is AC-powered, compared to our largest and second largest competitors at approximately 33% and 6%, respectively.
Our experience gives us a simple, but profound advantage that enables us to build rigs for a lower cost and contract them at higher day rates than our peers. That experience represents more than the aggregated 560 rig years of running AC-powered technology in the field, but also the captured learnings of more than 10 years of our own design and integrated manufacturing effort. Stated more directly, we keep getting better at what we do.
Earlier this month, we rolled off the line our 100th FlexRig3, the flagship of our fleet. We held a celebration at Greens Port, Texas, our assembly facility. It was a good day on several counts.
First, when we read so much about the diminished level of manufacturing in our country today, it’s nice to have the opportunity to recognize the efforts of our guys who have built over 200 FlexRigs in that facility. We’ve had barbecued to over 250 workers, handed each of them a crisp $100 bill to commemorate the milestone, and thanked them for doing what they do better than anybody in the world.
The 100th FlexRig on display contained multiple feature enhancements and improvements compared to its earliest counterpart. These improvements come from eating your own cooking and a company-wide focus from our design and engineering effort all the way through our field operations to constantly improve and drive innovations that enhance performance.
The leadership team involved in the design, coordination, assembly, training, safety, remote monitoring, marketing and actual operations and field execution were all well represented, say for one. Alan Orr was unable to attend for the same health considerations that prompted his early retirement since our last call in July. Many of you knew Alan and it’s appropriate to recognize and thank him on this call, not only for the lead role played in the design of the FlexRig, but for the host of innovations he and his team introduced to the land drilling business.
Alan joined H&P as a roughneck after graduating from West Point. He worked his way up through our field operations and held several leadership positions, culminating in his most recent role as Executive Vice President of Engineering and Development. Five years ago, he was named the Contractor of the Year by the International Association of Drilling Contractors for innovations and safety, efficiency and technical achievements. I am proud to be able to express on behalf of the whole company, our thanks to Alan for his 35 years of loyal service.
I’d be remiss not to mention two final milestones for 2010. The company celebrated its 90th year anniversary and we recognize my dad Walt Helmerich for his 60th year of involvement with H&P. He started a fresher at Harvard Business School in 1950 and continues today as the company’s Chairman. We’re very thankful for his leadership and hugely indebted to him and many other loyal employees past and present that has built the company’s reputation the old fashion way, brick-by-brick, pre-set the pond pre-set.
Our job going forward is to vigorously defend and enhance a powerful combination being the world’s oldest and most experienced land contract driller and at the same time, the most innovative and forward-thinking. That is a charge we embrace heading into 2011.
As we look to next year, we expect the standard uncertainty that attends this business to prevail. That uncertainty today centers on short-term downward pressure on natural gas pricing and whether or not the long-awaited coal back in the gas directed rig count finally occurs.
We’ve already get strong on this score earlier this year as natural gas prices continue to fall, but our general thoughts really remain the same. The clear customer preference for high-performing rigs in a bifurcated market will leave the brunt of any pullback to be borne by older, lower-performing assets.
Absent and unforeseen pullback in oil prices at historically high oil directed rig count will help buffer any overall downward adjustment. Should one occur, we still believe we have opportunities to continue to gain market share even if the overall rig count falls below the current level of 685 rigs in the U.S.
Our growth opportunities will be governed by a capital discipline that served our shareholders well. We will continue to focus on leveraging the unique set of organizational competencies to set to our customers as they pursue increasingly complex drilling targets for both oil and gas.
At this point, I’d like to turn the call over to John for his comments.

We are encouraged by the opportunities ahead as our new and long-term customers continue to exploit oil and liquids-rich plays in a low natural gas price environment and FlexRigs remain in high demand.
As we have said in the past, the unconventional plays require mostly horizontal and/or directional drilling enabling better and more cost-effective reservoir performance. More complex drilling favors FlexRigs as they are a catalyst for drilling efficiencies and safety performance.
The following comments will describe the fourth quarter results and the first fiscal quarter 2011 outlook for our three operating segments. Now I’ll start with U.S. land. Our fiscal fourth quarter U.S. land results benefited from the last of our idle FlexRigs returning to work.
During fiscal fourth quarter, the average number of rigs working increased by 19 rigs to 177, including an average of 120 under current contracts and 57 in spot market. With the higher level of activity, total U.S. land segment revenues increased 19% sequentially to $436 million. As a result, U.S. land segment operating income increased 15% sequentially to $118.9 million.
Excluding the favorable impact of revenues from early termination and the new build delays during both quarters, average rig revenue per day increased over $1,000 sequentially to about $24,000 per day, as average day rates for rigs in the spot markets increased by over $2,000 to about $22,000 per day during the fourth quarter.
Average rig expense per day increased about $500 per day to slightly over $13,000, but about $350 per day of the increased expenses we do not expect to incur going forward. Excluding the favorable impact of revenues from early contract terminations and customer requested new build delivery delays, average rig margin per day increased over $500 per day to approximately $11,000.
Our fiscal first quarter of 2011 will benefit from our full quarter contribution from the FlexRigs that went back to work in the fourth quarter, continued growth from FlexRig new build deliveries and the return of rigs from Mexico.
As of today, we have 190 contracted rigs, including 132 under term contracts and 58 in spot market. Of the 58 rigs in the spot market, 54 FlexRigs. As Hans mentioned the 190 rigs surpass our previous record during the last cyclical peak in October 2008 and represent the highest level of U.S. activity in the 90-year history of the company.
At the 132 rigs currently under term contracts, 64 are scheduled to reprice during fiscal 2011. The repricing is expected to have a slightly favorable impact on our average daily revenue during the first fiscal quarter.
The average day rate for rigs under term contracts expiring after 2011 is about $1,200 a day above the mentioned current average for all rigs under term contract. Late in fiscal fourth quarter, two of the six rigs previously assigned to operations in Mexico returned to the U.S. and are currently under contracts. The remaining four rigs will be discussed in more detail in the international segment.
We expect total revenue days for the U.S. land segment to increase approximately 5% to 7%. Excluding the favorable impact of revenue in the fourth quarter from early contract terminations and customer requested new build delivery delays, we expect average rig revenue per day to increase by over $500 per day in both the average term and the spot rate in the first fiscal quarter. We do not expect significant revenues from early contract terminations in the next few quarters or customer requested new build delivery delays.
I’ll talk briefly about our new builds. Today, we announced contracts supporting the construction of four additional FlexRig3s, all with the three-year firm term contracts. With these four rigs, we’ve announced 163 new builds Flex3s and Flex4s since 2005, including 23 Flex3s since March of 2010. 12 of these rigs are currently under construction and are expected to be completed during the first three quarters of fiscal 2011.
The 23 new FlexRig3s announced during the last eight months for U.S. land are being activated in some of the most attractive basins in the U.S. including the Eagle Ford, Cana-Woodford, Bakken, Bone Spring and the Haynesville. All of the rigs will be drilling more complex horizontal and directional wells as customers extend laterals and drill more multilateral wells.
In our offshore segment, the offshore segment benefited from better than expected operating margins. Segment operating income for offshore increased 17% sequentially to $13.1 million despite a 7% decrease in revenues.
Total revenue days during the fiscal fourth quarter of 644 days were essentially flat sequentially. Average rig margin per day of $22,581 was positively impacted by approximately $2,000 due to a reduction of certain expenses in the quarter. Excluding this benefit, average rig margin per day was essentially flat sequentially.
Looking forward to the first fiscal quarter of 2011, two of the rigs that were on standby during the fourth quarter are expected to return to work toward the end of the first quarter
Rigs on standby still generate revenue days, so revenue days are expected to be flat sequentially. Additionally, excluding the $2,000 per day benefit during the fourth quarter, average rig margins per day are expected to decrease by less than 5% sequentially.
The international land segment benefited from about $6 million of early contract termination revenue from two rigs previously assigned to operations in Mexico, and this set the stage for a better than expected quarter. International land segment revenues increased 16% sequentially to $69.8 million and segment operating income increased almost 57% to $15.5 million.
Total international land revenue days increased 5% during the quarter to 1,976 days as we had an incremental rig go to work in Columbia and our first FlexRig began operations in the Middle East.
Excluding the favorable impact from early termination revenues, average rig revenue per day decreased about $600 per day to a little over $30,000 per day and the average rig margin per day declined by $664 to $9,528 from $10,192 during the third quarter.
Going forward, our international segment will be positively impacted by the full quarter operations at the FlexRig that started work during the fourth quarter in Bahrain, as well as the rig in Colombia.
Our second FlexRig in Bahrain recently spud its first well and we have now received the contract for a third FlexRig in Bahrain, which will transfer from the U.S. for start-up expected during third fiscal quarter.
We currently have 28 rigs assigned to the international land segment, including three FlexRigs for Bahrain and four remaining FlexRigs in Mexico. With the four rigs in Mexico now expected to return to the U.S. in first two quarters of fiscal 2011, total revenue days for the first quarter are expected to decrease by about 7% from the fourth quarter.
Including the favorable impact from the early termination revenues, average rig margin per day in the first quarter is expected to decrease by less than 5%. Excluding this favorable impact from early termination revenues, average rig margin per day is expected to increase a little over 5% sequentially. This increase in average rig margin per day is a combination of increased activity in the Middle East and decreased activity in Mexico where the rigs were contracted at lower day rates in late 2009.
I should also mention the early success in our new operation in Bahrain. Since start of the first well in July, the first FlexRig4 has drilled 13 wells and the most recent was a record well, including the rig move of about 4.5 days. For our first startup in the Middle East, we’re pleased with the early results.
In summary, it’s clear that many of our competitors have now embraced AC-powered rigs and we believe this supports our long-held position that AC-powered rigs could ultimately displace the majority of the old legacy mechanical fleet of rigs.
Today, approximately 700 mechanical rigs are active in the U.S. and it’s estimated that about half of those rigs maybe drilling non-vertical, more complex wells, whereas previously those rigs may have been drilling vertical wells.
This recent industry shift to drilling more complex wells, and that’s the oil and gas wells, long term creates performance challenges and limitations for contractors with mechanical rigs with regard to drilling efficiency, environmental and safety performance.
The industry is most likely going through a rig replacement phase, not a rig retooling phase like the last five years and that phase clearly favors H&P. H&P has been designing and building AC drive Flex 3 since 2002 and we believe our first mover advantage has enabled us to capture over 40% out of the AC rig market share.
Our experience in captured learning’s should enable us to continue our market share growth of the AC fleet in the U.S. and international markets.
Finally, our fiscal 2010 was another very good year with respect to our safety performance, especially considering we put nearly 90 rigs to work in 12 months in the U.S. and had two new startups in two countries.
Of course, this achievement wouldn’t have been possible without our long-term field employees. They are coaching many of our new rig employees and mentoring by our management teams to advance the H&P culture and we want to thank all of those personnel that that have made a difference. And I’ll turn the call back to J.P.

I’m also encouraged by our smaller rig fleet, our Flex 4s. We’re starting to see a lot of activity pick up in the Permian there and some of that work is straight vertical wells, but we’re able to impact the cycle times pretty dramatically and so that’s causing a lot of demand for our Flex 4s.

The other part of that is that oil-directed drilling is more complex, more challenging, first you have laterals involved, and second they are getting longer.

The problem is they’re still priced on pretty skinny margins and so will they play a larger role in terms of a head-to-head competition? I think it gets back to what we’ve seen over the months and years, which is certainly their performance is preferred to mechanical rigs performance, but it doesn’t match what the AC drive rigs can do. And we’ve seen this not just in this most recent uptick, but in the full cycle over a period of years, the customers gravitating to just the better performance and you can’t achieve that even with a refurbished, you’ve spent some money on an SCR rig.

With us today are Hans Helmerich, President and CEO; John Lindsay, Executive Vice President of U.S. and International Operations; and Mike Drickamer, Director of Investor Relations. I will make some general introductory comments, and we'll then turn the call over to Hans for his and John's comments.
As usual, all forward-looking statements made during this call are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties as discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The company's actual results may differ materially from those indicated or implied by such forward-looking statements.
We will also be making reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as segment operating income and operating statistics. You may find the GAAP reconciliation comments and calculations on the last page of today's press release.
Income from continuing operations during the fiscal year resulted in approximately $286 million, equivalent to $2.66 in diluted earnings per share. On a quarterly basis, income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter increased to $0.77 in diluted earnings per share from $0.61 during the third quarter. 
Once again, our U.S. Land Operations segment continue to drive our increasing quarterly earnings, delivering significant sequential growth in segment revenue, operating income and revenue base. The company's debt level continued to decline to $360 million at the end of the fiscal year, resulting in a debt-to-cap ratio of approximately 11%. Capital spending was approximately $330 million, and net cash provided from operating activities was approximately $460 million during the fiscal year.
Our fiscal 2011 capital spending level will be primarily driven by our new build construction program as it adapts to market demand for incremental FlexRigs during the year. Given the number of customer commitments that we already have for new FlexRigs to be completed during the fiscal year and the level of rig component orders that are required to ensure our ability to effectively respond to additional new FlexRig demand, our current capital spending estimate for fiscal 2011 is approximately $600 million.
Depreciation expense for the fourth quarter was reported at approximately $73 million, which included extraordinary adjustments of approximately $3 million that are not expected to recur during the following quarter. Given the continuing growth of our FlexRig fleet, we expect our total annual depreciation expense to increase to approximately $300 million during fiscal 2011.
General and administrative expenses are expected to total approximately $85 million, and interest expenses after capitalized interest are expected to total approximately $14 million during fiscal 2011. Our investment portfolio, primarily comprised of 8 million shares of Atwood Oceanics and 967,500 shares of Schlumberger, recently had a pretax market value of approximately $380 million and an after-tax value of approximately $240 million. Our tax rate for continuing operations during fiscal 2011 is, at this point, expected to be approximately 37%.
We have no additional news related to Venezuela. As reported last quarter, our Venezuelan business was classified as a discontinued operation after the property and equipment of our Venezuelan subsidiary was seized by the Venezuelan government. We will continue to evaluate and work on available remedies that may enable the company to be compensated for the seized assets on unpaid invoices. 
I will now turn the call to Hans Helmerich, President and CEO, and after Hans and John have made their comments, we will open the call for questions."

Good morning, everyone. Let me take the opportunity to reflect on some of the milestones that stand out for 2010.
Juan Pablo already mentioned Venezuela, which was certainly our most disappointing milestone of the year and while perhaps receiving more than its fair share of attention, it is now behind us, and we've moved forward. 2010 was the year of transition and recovery. The industry fought its way back from a dramatic once in a 30 year free fall that started in the early fall of 2008 and bottomed in June of 2009.
In terms of utilization, margins, operating income and returns, we outpaced our Land Drilling peers during the recovery that unfolded in the second half of 2009 and continued through our fiscal year 2010. Industry-wide activity steadily improved through the year as the U.S. Land count currently stands at 80% of the number of rigs that we're running in October of 2008. For the company's rig count, we've exceeded that percentage. During 2010, we reactivated nearly 90 rigs, our largest single-year effort ever. In fact, we recently crossed the threshold of running 190 rigs in the U.S., surpassing our previous record during the last cyclical peak and achieving the highest level of activity in the U.S. and the company's history.
In addition to better utilization levels, we outpaced our peers by maintaining significantly higher premiums in the average rig revenue and margins during all parts of the cycle. We ended our fiscal year with over $24,000 of average rig revenue per day and with an average spot market pricing reaching approximately $22,000 during the fourth quarter, a $2,000 sequential improvement over the prior quarter. 
Another milestone worthy of mention is our new build effort in 2010. In the year where natural gas prices have fallen in half, we are pleased to be able to secure 23 new FlexRig orders since March of 2010, all secured by long-term contracts at favorable returns. These new orders help us maintain our market leadership of providing customers AC-powered rigs. 
Here is a breakout. 3/4 of our U.S. fleet is AC powered, compared to our largest and second-largest competitors at approximately 33% and 6%, respectively. Our experience gives us a simple but profound advantage that enables us to build rigs for a lower cost and contract them at higher dayrates than our peers. That experience represents more than the aggregated 560 rig years of running AC power technology in the field but also the captured learnings of more than 10 years of our own design and integrated manufacturing effort. Stated more directly, we keep getting better at what we do.
Earlier this month, we rolled off the line our 100th FlexRig3, the flagship of our fleet. We held a celebration at Greens Port, Texas, our assembly facility. It was a good day on several counts. First, when we read so much about the diminished level of manufacturing in our country today, it's nice to have the opportunity to recognize the efforts of our guys who have built over 200 FlexRigs in that facility. We've had barbecue to over 250 workers, handed each one of them a crisp $100 bill to commemorate the milestone, and thank them for doing what they do better than anybody in the world. The 100th Flex 3 on display contained multiple feature enhancements and improvements compared to its earliest counterpart. These improvements come from eating your own cooking and a company-wide focus from our design and engineering effort all the way through our field operations to constantly improve and drive innovations that enhance performance.
The leadership team involved in the design, coordination, assembly, training, safety, remote monitoring, marketing and actual operations and field execution were all well represented, save for one. Alan Orr wasn't able to attend for the same health considerations that prompted his early retirement since our last call in July. Many of you knew Alan, and it's appropriate to recognize and thank him on this call, not only for the lead role he played in the design of the FlexRig but for the host of innovations he and his team introduced to the Land Drilling business.
Alan joined H&P as a roughneck after graduating from West Point. He worked his way up through our field operations and held several leadership positions, culminating in his most recent role as Executive Vice President of Engineering and Development. Five years ago, he was named the Contractor of the Year by the International Association of Drilling Contractors for innovations in safety, efficiency and technical achievements. I'm proud to be able to express, on behalf of the whole company, our thanks to Alan for his 35 years of loyal service.
I'd be remiss not to mention two final milestones for 2010. The company celebrated its 90th year anniversary, and we recognize my dad, Walt Helmerich for his 60th year of involvement with H&P. He started fresh out of Harvard Business School in 1950 and continues today as the company's Chairman. We're very thankful for his leadership and hugely indebted to him and many other loyal employees, past and present, that have built the company's reputation the old-fashioned way, brick by brick, precept upon precept. 
Our job going forward is to vigorously defend and enhance a powerful combination, being the world's oldest and most experienced land contract driller and at the same time, the most innovative and forward thinking. That is the charge we embraced heading into 2011. As we look to next year, we expect the standard uncertainty that attends this business to prevail. That uncertainty today centers on short-term downward pressure on natural gas pricing and whether or not the long-awaited pullback in the gas-directed rig count finally occurs. 
We've already get strong on this score earlier this year as natural gas prices continue to fall, but our general thoughts really remain the same. The clear customer preference for high-performing rigs in a bifurcated market will leave the brunt of any pullback to be borne by older, lower-performing assets. Absent an unforeseen pullback in oil prices, the historically high oil-directed rig count will help buffer any overall downward adjustment. Should one occur, we still believe we have opportunities to continue to gain market share even if the overall rig count falls below the current level of 685 rigs in the U.S.
Our growth opportunities will be governed by a capital discipline that served our shareholders well. We will continue to focus on leveraging a unique set of organizational competencies to satisfy our customers as they pursue increasingly complex drilling targets for both oil and gas. 
At this point, I'd like to turn the call over to John for his comments."

We are encouraged about the opportunities ahead as our new and long-term customers continue to exploit oil and liquid-rich plays in a low natural gas price environment, and FlexRigs remain in high demand. As we've said i",1557,"Thank you, Hans, and good morning. We are encouraged about the opportunities ahead as our new and long-term customers continue to exploit oil and liquid-rich plays in a low natural gas price environment, and FlexRigs remain in high demand. As we've said in the past, the unconventional plays require mostly horizontal and/or directional drilling, enabling better and more cost-effective reservoir performance. 
More complex drilling favors FlexRigs as they are a catalyst for drilling efficiencies and safety performance. The following comments will describe the fourth quarter results and the first fiscal quarter 2011 outlook for our three operating segments, and I'll start with U.S. Land. Our fiscal fourth quarter U.S. Land results benefited from the last of our idle FlexRigs returning to work. During fiscal fourth quarter, the average number of rigs working increased by 19 rigs to 177, including an average of 120 under current contracts and 57 in the spot market. With the higher level of activity, total U.S. Land segment revenues increased 19% sequentially to $436 million. As a result, U.S. Land segment operating income increased 15% sequentially to $118.9 million. Excluding the favorable impact of revenues from early termination and the new build delays during both quarters, average rig revenue per day increased over $1,000 sequentially to about $24,000 per day as average dayrates for rigs in the spot market increased by over $2,000 to about $22,000 per day during the fourth quarter.
Average rig expense per day increased about $500 per day to slightly over $13,000, but about $350 per day of the increased expenses we do not expect to incur going forward. Excluding the favorable impact of revenues from early contract terminations, and customer-requested new build delivery delays, average rig margin per day increased over $500 per day to approximately $11,000.
Our fiscal first quarter of 2011 will benefit from a full quarter contribution from the FlexRigs that went back to work in the fourth quarter, continued growth from FlexRig new build deliveries and the return of rigs from Mexico. As of today, we have 190 contracted rigs, including 132 under term contracts and 58 in the spot market. Of the 58 rigs in the spot market, 54 are FlexRigs. As Hans mentioned, the 190 rigs surpassed our previous record during the last cyclical peak in October 2008 and represents the highest level of U.S. activity in the 90-year history of the company.
Of the 132 rigs currently under term contracts, 64 are scheduled to reprice during fiscal 2011. The repricing is expected to have a slightly favorable impact on our average daily revenue during the first fiscal quarter. The average dayrate per rigs under term contracts expiring after 2011 is about $1,200 a day, above the mentioned current average for all rigs under term contract.
Late in fiscal fourth quarter, two of the six rigs previously assigned to operations in Mexico return to the U.S. and are currently under contract. The remaining four rigs will be discussed in more detail in the International segment. We expect total revenue days for the U.S. Land segment to increase approximately 5% to 7%. Excluding the favorable impact of revenue in the fourth quarter from early contract terminations and customer-requested new build delivery delays, we expect average rig revenue per day to increase by over $500 per day in both the average term and the spot rates in the first fiscal quarter.
We do not expect significant revenues from early contract terminations in the next few quarters or customer-requested new build delivery delays. I'll talk briefly about our new builds. Today, we announced contracts supporting the construction of four additional FlexRig3s, all with three-year firm term contracts. With these four rigs, we've announced 163 new build Flex 3s and 4s since 2005, including 23 Flex 3s since March of 2010. 12 of these rigs are currently under construction and are expected to be completed during the first three quarters of fiscal 2011. The 23 new FlexRig3s announced during the last eight months for U.S. Land are being activated in some of the most attractive basins in the U.S., including the Eagle Ford, Cana, Woodford, Bakken, Bone Spring and the Haynesville. All of the rigs we'll be drilling more complex horizontal and directional wells as customers extend laterals and drill more multilateral wells.
In our Offshore segment, the Offshore segment benefited from better-than-expected operating margins. Segment operating income for Offshore increased 17% sequentially to $13.1 million despite a 7% decrease in revenues. Total revenue days during the fiscal fourth quarter of 644 days were essentially flat sequentially. Average rig margin per day of $22,581 was positively impacted by approximately $2,000 due to a reduction of certain expenses in the quarter. Excluding this benefit, average rig margin per day was essentially flat sequentially.
Looking forward to the first fiscal quarter of 2011, two of the rigs that were on standby during the fourth quarter are expected to return to work toward the end of the first quarter. Rigs on standby still generate revenue days, so revenue days are expected to be flat sequentially. Additionally, excluding the $2,000 per day benefit during the fourth quarter, average rig margins per day are expected to decrease by less than 5% sequentially. The International Land segment benefited from about $6 million of early contract termination revenue from two rigs previously assigned to operations in Mexico, and this sets the stage for better-than-expected quarter. International Land segment revenues increased 16% sequentially to $69.8 million, and segment operating income increased almost 57% to $15.5 million. Total International Land revenue days increased 5% during the quarter to 1,976 days as we had an incremental rig go to work in Colombia, and our first FlexRig began operations in the Middle East.
Excluding the favorable impact from early termination revenues, average rig revenue per day decreased about $600 per day to a little over $30,000 per day, and the average rig margin per day declined by $664 to $9,528 from $10,192 during the third quarter. Going forward, our International segment will be positively impacted by the full quarter operations of the FlexRigs that started work during the fourth quarter in Bahrain, as well as the rig in Colombia. Our second FlexRig in Bahrain recently spud its first well, and we have now received a contract for a third FlexRig in Bahrain, which will transfer from the U.S. for a start-up expected during the third fiscal quarter. We currently have 28 rigs assigned to the International Land segment, including three FlexRigs for Bahrain and four remaining FlexRigs in Mexico. With the four rigs in Mexico now expected to return to the U.S. the first two quarters of fiscal 2011, total revenue days for the first quarter are expected to decrease by about 7% from the fourth quarter.
Including the favorable impact from the early termination revenues, average rig margin per day in the first quarter is expected to decrease by less than 5%. Excluding this favorable impact from early termination revenues, average rig margin per day is expected to increase a little over 5% sequentially. This increase in average rig margin per day is a combination of increased activity in the Middle East and decreased activity in Mexico where the rigs were contracted at lower dayrates in late 2009.
I should also mention the early success in our new operation in Bahrain. Since spud of the first well in July, the first FlexRig4 has drilled 13 wells, and the most recent was a record well, including the rig move of about four and a half days. For our first start-up in the Middle East, we're pleased with the early results. 
And in summary, it's clear that many of our competitors have now embraced AC-powered rigs, and we believe this supports our long-held position that AC-powered rigs could ultimately displace the majority of the old legacy mechanical fleet of rigs. Today, approximately 700 mechanical rigs are active in the U.S. And it's estimated that about half of those rigs may be drilling non-vertical, more complex wells whereas previously, those rigs may have been drilling vertical wells. This recent industry shift to drilling more complex wells and that's both oil and gas wells, long term, creates performance challenges and limitations for contractors with mechanical rigs with regard to drilling efficiency, environmental and safety performance. 
The industry is most likely going through a rig replacement phase, not a rig retooling phase like the last five years, and that phase, clearly, favors H&P. H&P has been designing and building AC drive Flex 3s since 2002, and we believe our first mover advantage has enabled us to capture over 40% of the AC rig market share. Our experience and captured learnings should enable us to continue our market share growth of the AC fleet in the U.S. and international markets. 
Finally, our fiscal 2010 was another very good year with respect to our safety performance, especially considering we put nearly 90 rigs to work in 12 months in the U.S. and had two new start-ups in two countries. Of course, this achievement wouldn't have been possible without our long-term field employees, their coaching of many of our new rig employees and mentoring by our management teams to advance the H&P culture, and we want to thank all of those personnel that made a difference. 
And I'll turn the call back to JP."

And it seems to me, at least it appears that our customers are just end drilling and trying to figure out how best to exploit the reservoir and how many rigs to add in the future. I really don't have any data points handy that would say how much growth there would be. It seems like again, same way with the Bone Spring that we don't hear a lot coming out of our customers. But when you look at the number of rigs working there compared to say six, nine, 12 months ago, it's a pretty dramatic increase in activity. We've recently moved a few rigs. I want to say we've moved one or two out of the Barnett. There may have been one out of the Haynesville, I'm trying to remember. But there's clearly a demand for additional rigs out there. And I get the impression that they're still trying to understand the reservoir and how best to drill it and what kind of lateral length and those types of things. But I really don't have any data points as far as how large either one of those plays could be."

It can be your operating guys, your field guys, feeding back small incremental improvements that when you aggregate those, they make a real difference. And I guess I would say we've captured that 30% and 40% leap, and now it's hand-to-hand combat to go 2%, 3%, 4% type efficiency gains, all of which still are important.
