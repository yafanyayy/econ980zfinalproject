We reported net earnings for the 2004 fourth quarter of $0.54 per share, compared to $0.72 per share reported for the same period the year before. Included in our fourth quarter results was a $0.05 per share charge for short staff reductions; a $0.02 per share charge for a partial, goodwill impairment of Osprey Lines. That's our container and barge operation; and a positive $0.02 per share net reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts. Norman will discuss each of these in more detail in a few minutes. Our announced earnings guidance for the fourth quarter was $0.57 to $0.62 per share. For the year, we earned $2.34 per share, which compares to $2.91 for 2008. During the fourth quarter, our Marine Transportation volumes were slightly lower than the third quarter volumes and remained well below prior-year levels. Our barge utilization for the fourth quarter, which was impacted by weather, bounced in the range of the 80% to 85%. During the fourth quarter, the term contract portion of our revenue mix declined to approximately 75% from 80% reported for most of last year. Time charter's declined to approximately 50% of total term contracts. This was anticipated, as customers in some cases, switched to lower spot rate contract opportunities as their term contracts expired. Barging rates remained under pressure throughout the year. In the 2009 first quarter, first quarter of last year, we said that we were generally able to renew our contracts at flat rates. And in the cases that we reduced rates we traded rate per comp. Our second quarter, that was over. Term contracts were just down. Best case flat to 8% lower. Spot rates during that quarter declined in a range of 10% to 15% on a year-over-year basis. Spot rates include fuel. In the third quarter, contract rates renewed 7% to 15% lower. And spot rates continued to deteriorate in the 10% to 20% range on a year-over-year basis. In the last quarter, the fourth quarter, term contracts renewed again in the 7% to 15% range. But spot rates continue to decline and/or 20% to 30% below to where they were the prior year. We do sense that we're close to the bottom of pricing in our markets. But there is some further risk of erosion, and we are likely to experience continued rate pressure on term contract renewals at least for the first half of this year.While our Marine Transportation revenues declined $49 million during the fourth quarter and $214 million for the year when compared to 2008, approximately $16 million or 33% of the fourth quarter revenue decline, and $79 million or 37% of the year-revenue decline can be explained by lower fuel prices, which are passed through to the customer using fuel escalation and de-escalation causes in term contracts. And at least with respect to the 2009 year, those contracts have de-escalated.Delay days during the quarter increased about over 160%, compared to the third quarter. But we're in line with the delay days recorded in the same period a year before. 2009, with the exception of last quarter, was really a very good year for weather delays. Typically, we see more weather delays during the year. During 2009, we took the liberty of 43 new Kirby-owned tank barges and in addition to seven chartered barges. With the industry excess barge capacity and utilization issue, utilization in the range of 80% to 85%, with respect to Kirby, we retired 101 of our tank barges which resulted in approximately 5.5% reduction in our barge fleet. As of the end of 2009, we were operating 863 tank barges. That compares to the beginning of the year when we had 914 barges operating. The tank barge industry still has excess capacity. We've noted that throughout last year. The strong demand experienced in the previous years encouraged the industry to build new equipment, but also to keep older equipment in service to meet higher demand levels. In early 2008, the industry was fully utilized and shipyards were fully booked through 2008 and 2009. Approximately 180 to 200 tank barges were delivered last year in an environment of falling demand. These were barges that were ordered in the 2007-early 2008 timeframe. These new barges have further increased industry capacity and have contributed to the pressure of term and spot contract rates. However, as we've indicated before, the industry's overcapacity problem, in our view, should be a short-lived problem. Because over 500 barges in the industry fleet are over 35 years old, and approximately 250 of those are actually over 40 years old. All inland tank barges must pass Coast Guard inspections, and older barges typically cost more to maintain and are likely to be retired at an accelerated pace in a weak market. That's what Kirby did last year and will continue to do this year unless the market improves appreciably.During the fourth quarter -- this is turning to our Diesel Engine business. Our Diesel Engine Service segment demand levels for service and direct parts remained under stress, as both our medium-speed and high-speed offshore service customers, as well as our Marine Transportation customers and real customers deferred maintenance and idled equipment in response to lower utilization. We're able to partially offset these weak markets by continuing to take operating cost out of the business. Medium-speed Power Generation market was stable for most of the year. We think that, again, we're close to the bottom, if not on the bottom, in this business and anticipate some improvement latter part of 2010.On January 23 this year, Kirby was involved in an incident in the Port Arthur area which resulted in a spill that closed the gulf and that closed the waterway. This was a collision between a ship and one of our tows. We do not believe that we're at fault here. This has not, however, stop movement of a number of tows as well as some ships. Over 40 tows that Kirby operates were affected and about 30 ships were also affected. These tows and ships are beginning to move again. The cost to Kirby at this point is unknown and will depend on when the waterway is returned to full operation, the mix of tows that we have involved with respect to time charters versus freightment and the effect of any pent-up demand, which is really unclear at this point. We do think that over the next couple of weeks, it'll be clear. I'll come back at the end of this call and talk about 2010. But let me now turn the call over to Norman."

As we discussed in our press release, we had three adjustments, two of which had a negative impact and one, a positive impact on our 2009 fourth quarter and year end. The first negative adjustment was a $4.8 million pretax charge for reductions in our Marine Transportation, Diesel Engine Services and corporate shore staff personnel. These actions were taken to enable us to remain competitive in the Marine Transportation and Diesel Engine Services markets and to better position the company to weather this continuing economic downturn. The second negative adjustment was a $1.9 million charge for the partial impairment of Osprey Lines goodwill. Osprey had a two-thirds-owned cargo container and private cargo inland waterways operator. The impairment of Osprey's goodwill reflected current market conditions, not the abandonment of this market. We continue to believe that the water transportation of containers is part of the answer to highway and railroad congestion and positive for the environment. But the recent focus has been on the more profitable Project Cargo business. The positive adjustment for the fourth quarter was a $2 million net reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts. Last year in the fourth quarter, we increased our allowance by $6 million, the result of deteriorating U.S. and global economic environment and the impact the recession was having on several of our customers in the petrochemical industry. The $2 million reduction of the allowance this year reflects the improvement in the financial health and creditworthiness of these same customers as they weather the economic downturn. Although Kirby's Marine Transportation operating income was 18% below the 2008 fourth quarter, the operating margin of 23.6%, was in line with the 2008 fourth quarter of 23.4%. And if you adjust for the staff reduction charge and the positive impact of the reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts, our 2009 fourth quarter margin was 24%. The higher margin resulted in the impact of lower fuel prices, the first quarter staff reductions, fewer charter boats, reduced maintenance on laid-up equipment, ongoing cost reduction and efficiency initiatives and more efficient operations. The Diesel Engine Services operating income and operating margin was lower than last year and the corresponding quarter. Adjusted for the staff reduction charge and a $500,000 increase in Diesel's allowance for doubtful accounts, the fourth quarter margin was 12.2%. Continued customer deferral of the Diesel Engine Maintenance project resulted in lower labor utilization in most areas, but especially in the domestic offshore oil services market. We had another very strong cash flow quarter with EBITDA of $74 million. At December 31, we had $98 million of cash and cash equivalents. As of yesterday, our cash voucher's $140 million, and we had no outstanding balance on our $250 million revolving credit facility. Our capital spending for 2009 totaled $193 million, which included $142 million for new tank barges and towboats. Our capital spending guidance for 2010 is a range of $125 million to $135 million, which includes approximately $60 million for new tank barge and towboat construction which Berdon will discuss. I'll now turn the call over to Berdon."

Based on current market conditions and fleet utilization, as Joe stated earlier, we have accelerated the retirement schedule of some of our older, active tank barges. As of December 31, we owned or operated 863 active tank barges with a capacity of 16.7 million barrels. This compares with 914 tank barges owned and operated as of December 31, 2008, with a capacity of 17.5 million barrels. For 2010, to take advantage of attractive barge constructive prices and to continue to upgrade our fleet and to provide our customers new equipment to move their cargos, we contracted for the construction of 50 10,000-barrel and five 30,000-barrel tank barges, all for delivery in 2010. Based on current economic conditions, we are forecasting that at the end of 2010, our barge count and capacity will decline slightly, as we continue to remove older barges from the fleet.

Our 2010 first quarter guidance is $0.42 to $0.47, compared with $0.52 per share earned in the 2009 first quarter. This guidance also includes an estimated $0.04 per share first quarter 2010 charge for further staff reductions, which were implemented in early January this year. Since our peak headcount in October of 2008, which was about the beginning of this recession, through early retirements, staff reductions accretion, we've reduced our company-wide short staff by 21%. We've also taken a number of other cost out of our business including a significant reduction in the number of charter boats we're operating from a high of 104 beginning in 2008 to where it is today, 61.  A number of boats have come out of our business model. We've also laid up the company-owned boats. We've reduced maintenance on laid-up equipment, as well as our other ongoing cost-reduction initiatives. We've also reduced our barge fleet by 51 barges. Our 2010 guidance of $1.85 to $2.20 per share is what we published yesterday. Frankly, this is based on our best information as of today. As we know more, we'll continue to confirm or update our estimates. We've debated whether it's prudent even to give guidance included that we're closer to our business than our investors. And we think that there's some benefit of sharing with you what we think as of today. Our Marine Transportation and Diesel Engine Service markets remain under pressure. However, we do believe that we're close to the bottom, as I said earlier and in the Engine business and in the Marine Transportation business. The question is, when are the markets going to recover? Barging rates were under pressure throughout last year, and we do believe that they remain under pressure until at least mid-2010. To achieve pricing power, barge capacity will need to be removed from the industry fleet or volumes will need to improve to absorb the existing capacity. I suspect that we'll see some of both later this year. So here we are at 2010. Although we'd like to be forecasting better earnings, it is what it is. Kirby is in excellent shape, however. We've taken a significant amount of cost out of our business. We have a strong balance sheet, low debt levels at favorable interest rates and cash on our balance sheet, which will continue to build throughout the year. Norman told you, as of yesterday, we have $114 million of cash on our balance sheet. Industry stress and the current economic environment aren't necessarily bad for Kirby long term. Our businesses will recover, stress creates opportunities to grow either through acquisition or through internal growth opportunities. It allows us to take advantage of favorable shipyard pricing and should encourage the industry to reduce barge capacity. Earlier this month, we filed an 8-K announcing Norman's retirement at the end of the first quarter. Norman's been Kirby's CFO since February of 1999 and has helped [indiscernible] the company through a number of acquisitions as well as Sarbanes-Oxley.  We noted on our press release that we've hired David Grzebinski to replace Norman as Kirby's CFO. David brings with him a lot of experience, and I look forward to working with David as we continue to manage Kirby and create value for shareholders. And we're going to miss Norman. Norman has been a friend and a partner. He's been a superb CFO. He has agreed to continue to be involved with Kirby on a consulting basis available to the management team at Kirby's Board at least through April of 2011. We also announced yesterday the appointment of Renato Castro as the Treasurer for Kirby. Now operator, I think we'll now open the call up for questions."

In a falling market, of course, it means that you're exposed more to spot rates, which typically leap contract rates in a negative way. They're typically lower than contract rates. It's positive because our systems and sales team and operating team really can accommodate the flexibility and respond to spot market opportunities as well as anybody in the business. So we're in a very good position to capture Spot business, and hold utilization rates may be better than certainly some of our competitors can. We've always maintained an element of our business that spot where some competitors are more contract based.

Late yesterday, we reported net earnings for the 2010 first quarter of $0.46 per share, compared with $0.52 per share reported for the 2009 first quarter. Included in our first quarter results was a previously announced $0.05 per share",973,"Thank you, Steve. Late yesterday, we reported net earnings for the 2010 first quarter of $0.46 per share, compared with $0.52 per share reported for the 2009 first quarter. 
Included in our first quarter results was a previously announced $0.05 per share charge for retirements and shore staff reductions. Our 2009 first quarter results also included a $0.05 per charge for early retirements and shore staff reductions. 
Announced earnings guidance for the first quarter was $0.42 to $0.47 per share and included an estimated $0.04 per share costs for shore staff redundancies. The actual charge that we incurred in the first quarter was slightly higher, a $0.05 charge. 
During the 2010 first quarter, our Marine Transportation volumes improved, compared to both the 2009 first and fourth quarters. Our barge utilization for the first quarter, which is always impacted by weather, averaged in the mid-80s to high-80 range, above all four 2009 quarter levels and frankly, better than forecasted. 
In addition to increased petrochemical production, the improvement in our barge utilization level was also helped by some supply-chain disruptions caused by petrochemical and refraining plant turnarounds, as well as some unscheduled plant maintenance. Our higher volumes were also driven by improved demand for exported petrochemicals. 
U.S. petrochemical complex is enjoying a feedstock advantage today due to a relatively low natural gas costs in the U.S. compared to current crude oil prices. During the first quarter, the term contract portion of our revenue mix remained at about 75% contract, 25% spot. 
Our time charters represented a little less than 50% of total term contracts, compared to the 52% time charter mix we reported in the fourth quarter. While some customers have switched to spot freight in the contracts when their time charters have expired, others have just taken shorter charters of equipment as they're not ready to commit longer-term positions at this point. 
With improved volumes and resulting higher barge utilization rates during the first quarter, we did see pricing stabilize. Term contracts that were renewed during the first quarter generally decreased on average approximately 10% when compared with the term contracts that were renewed first quarter of 2009, with some firming in the contract areas as the quarter progressed. 
Spot contract rates for the first quarter, which of course include fuel and fuel was higher, were down 15% to 25% compared with first quarter spot pricing. But when compared to the fourth quarter, were up 3% to 6%. Again, this represents, I think, the stabilization of pricing in our business. 
With respect to the multi-year contracts that were typically renewed first of the year and escalated first of the year, these are contracts that don't expire in any given year. They're escalated for labor and either the producer price index or the consumer price index. The pricing was neutral for 2010. Typically in previous years, we've gotten anywhere from a 3% to 5% increase. 
The tank barge industry still has some excess capacity. Certainly, the demand that was experienced 2007, 2008, encouraged the industry to build new equipment. But also it encouraged the industry to keep older equipment and service, which typically would've been retired, to meet the higher demand levels. 
In 2009, 192 tank barges were delivered. We estimate about 140 barges were retired in 2009 for a net addition to the industry of about 50 barges. As of the beginning of 2010, we estimate there are approximately 3,150 tank barges in the industry, of which 500 are 35 years old and approximately 250 are 40 years old. 
For 2010, we believe that less than 100 barges will be constructed. Of those less than 100 barges, 58 are going to be ordered by Kirby. With respect to the barges that Kirby isn't building, a number of the barges being built in 2010 were in fact ordered for delivery in 2009 deferred into 2010. And the shipper is also building nine barges for his proprietary fleet serving his internal needs. 
Given the Asia profile of the industry fleet, we continue to expect older barges to be removed from service, and the industry supply versus demand will continue to move closer to balance. We're certainly encouraged by our improved utilization and the pricing stabilization that we're seeing. Demand is better as measured by the volumes that were moving. 
Certainly, demand is better than it was in 2009, and a little better than we thought it would be. However, we do expect our utilization to decline somewhat as weather improves and the supply chain becomes more efficient. This is not untypical in usual years, in late spring and in the summer, you typically see the industry utilization decline a little bit. 
The difference in 2007, 2008 was that there was so much demand that the industry was just fully utilized the entire year. During the 2010 first quarter, this is -- I'm talking about the Diesel Engine business, that segment demand levels for service and direct part sales generally remained weak across the majority of its markets, particularly, the high-speed oil service market. 
We did benefit from some first quarter seasonal work that we generally see in the Midwest and Great Lakes area for medium-speed marine customers. Our service customers continue to defer major maintenance, and this is in the oil service area. The medium-speed power generation market remained healthy, and our medium-speed railroad market benefited from improved direct part sales, as the utilization level for our railroad customers' equipment slowly improved, really reflecting improvements in demand for what they're producing. We do believe demand has bottomed out, but we still haven't seen any consistent signs of improvement in this business segment yet.  I'll come back and talk more about this, as well as the outlook for the Inland Tank Barge business later in this call, but first, let me turn the call over to David."
283986,100480359,63636,"Kirby Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Good morning, everyone. Thank you Joe. As we disclosed in our press release, we continue to focus our attention on operating as prudently and as efficiently as possible. We did this by further reducing our cost in order to remain competitive as we try and",577,"Good morning, everyone. Thank you Joe. As we disclosed in our press release, we continue to focus our attention on operating as prudently and as efficiently as possible. We did this by further reducing our cost in order to remain competitive as we try and emerge from this economic downturn. 
In January 2010, we further reduced our Marine Transportation and corporate staffs through retirements and reductions, and we took a $4.1 million before-tax charge or $0.05 per share charge in the quarter. We took a similar early retirement and reduction charge in 2009 first quarter. Since our peak headcount in October 2008, we've reduced our shore staff headcount by 22% through early retirements, staff reductions and attritions. 
Kirby's Marine Transportation operating income was 8% below the 2009 first quarter and the operating margin of 19.3% was below the 2009 first quarter margin of 21%. Adjusting for the staff reduction charges in both quarters, the first quarter margin for this quarter would've been 20.5% compared with 22.3% for the first quarter in 2009. 
The lower margin reflected the impact of lower-term and spot-contract pricing throughout the last three quarters of 2009, some higher fuel prices and some more difficult operating conditions with weather and whatnot, partially offset by the benefit of the cost reductions from the headcount reductions that we initiated. The Diesel Engine Services operating income was in line with last year's first quarter. The operating margin was 10.4%. 
This compared with 8.7% reported for the 2009 first quarter or 11.1% adjusted for early retirements and staff reductions taken in the first quarter of 2009. Customers continue to defer their diesel engine maintenance projects, resulting in continued low labor utilization for the business. 
We have a strong cash flow generation quarter. EBITDA was $66 million in the quarter, and as of quarter end at March 31, we had $121 million in cash or in cash equivalents. Our capital spending for the first quarter totaled $34 million, which included $21 million for new tank barges and towboats and $13 million, primarily for capital upgrades to the existing fleet. 
Our capital spending guidance for 2010 remains in the range of $125 million to $135 million, which includes approximately $60 million for new tank barges and towboat construction. During the 2010 first quarter, we took delivery of 16 new 10,000-barrel and two 30,000-barrel tank barges, which added about 226,000 barrels of capacity. 
However, we also retired tank barges in the quarter, 20. And that reduced our overall capacity by 365,000 barrels. So net-net our capacity declined about 139,000 barrels during the quarter. As of March 31, we operated 861 tank barges with the total capacity of 16.6 million barrels. This compares with our peak tank barge count of 918 back in June 30 of 2008, and a peak capacity of about 17.5 million barrels. 
So this reflects a 6% reduction from the peak number of tank barges we operate and about a 5% reduction from our peak tank barge capacity. For the remainder of 2010, as we have stated before, to take advantage of attractive barge construction prices and to continue to upgrade our fleet and provide our customers with newer equipment, we will take delivery of 37 new 10,000-barrel barges, three 30,000-barrel barges and five new 10,000-barrel chartered barges, which will add about 530,000 barrels of capacity. 
However, we will continue to retire older tank barges from the fleets. So with that now, I'll turn it back to Joe."
283986,100480359,63636,"Kirby Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thank you, David. I'll turn to the outlook for the second quarter and the year. Yesterday afternoon, we announced our second quarter guidance of $0.52 to $0.57 per share, which compares to $0.63 per share earned in the second quarter of last year. If you",660,"Thank you, David. I'll turn to the outlook for the second quarter and the year. Yesterday afternoon, we announced our second quarter guidance of $0.52 to $0.57 per share, which compares to $0.63 per share earned in the second quarter of last year. If you take the $0.46 per share, first quarter earnings, which reflected some modest improvement in volumes, add back the $0.05 per share staff reduction charge and look for some improvement in weather and operating conditions, you're basically at the low end of our range, the $0.52 level. 
The $0.57 high end of the range assumes that we continue to see Transportation volumes improve somewhat. We're forecasting for the Diesel Engine business kind of flat operating results, similar to other results in the first quarter. 
As for the full year, based on a more positive outlook for the balance of the year, we're raising our low-end guidance to $2, up from the $1.85 that we put out at the beginning of the year. And we're maintaining our high-end guidance of $2.20 per share. 
Our previous $1.85 low-end guidance assumed 2010 volumes would be consistent with volumes in 2009, and continued downward pressure on term contract renewals and spot contract pricing, at least, through the first half of the year. Fortunately, during the first quarter, volumes improved at contract and spot market pricing stabilized. And with respect to spot prices, we're, in fact, up a little. 
Therefore, the new $2 low-end guidance assumes volumes are going to be stable for the remainder of 2010, and that pricing is going to remain about where it is. Our $2.20 high-end guidance assumes continued modest improvement in volumes as the year progresses and a continued reduction in the current number of tank barges, a reduction in capacity.  These all combining to lead to some modest improvement in term and spot pricing in the second half of the year. 
As we stated in last quarter's call, to achieve pricing power, barge capacity will need to be removed from the industry fleet or volumes will need to improve to absorb existing capacity or a combination of both will need to happen. We did see some improvement in volumes during the quarter. And time will tell whether, frankly, these volumes are sustainable. If they are sustainable, we suspect that we will see some modest pricing power in the second half of 2010. 
Now Kirby is in great financial shape. We've taken significant amount of cost out of our business last year, early this year. We have a very strong balance sheet, low level of debt, favorable interest rates and cash on our balance sheet that should continue to build. In March of this year, S&P increased our credit rating from a BBB+ to a investment grade rated A-. 
So we remain in excellent position to execute our objective of making strategic acquisitions as they become available. Also I want to comment, before we open the call up to questions, on for the retirement of Berdon Lawrence, Kirby's Chairman of the Board since 1999. 
Yesterday, Berdon retired. He had announced that he was going to retire on October of last year. I would like to thank Berdon, publicly, for his service not only to Kirby, but to the inland tank barge industry. He has truly been a leader of this industry and has helped guide Kirby to its success while serving as Kirby's Chairman. I have enjoyed working with Berdon over the past 10 years, beginning with the integration of Hollywood into Kirby and continuing over those years with Kirby's strategy of enhancing and growing our core businesses through synergistic acquisitions, and also creating enhanced earnings and value for our shareholders. 
Fortunately, Berdon is not going to go far. He is going to serve on Kirby's board. He's going to be Kirby's Chairman Emeritus and we'll still have access to his wisdom. Operator, I think we're now ready to open the call up for questions."

Now I think the dilemma is, do you believe it's sustainable? If it's sustainable then I would expect pricing actually to recover going forward a little quicker than it did in the last recession, the 2000 to 2003 recession. Spot prices are a leading indicator of contract pricing and today, spot pricing is actually slightly better than contracts as they're renewed. Now of course, contracts are renewed at lower rates. We said on average about 10% lower this quarter than last year's first quarter. But I think if you get spot pricing somewhere in the 5% to 10% range above contracts, they'll pull the contract pricing up. We're not there yet. I would say that -- when I say modestly above contract pricing, you're talking 3%, 4%. And you're also talking in an environment where they jump around a lot. There may be days where positioning drive spot pricing a little higher and other days where it depresses it."

Obviously volumes was part of it but then another big part of it was the removal of excess capacity in the market. As the volumes have recovered, and I would probably guess it's sentiment across the industry, just as it has across the broader economy has improved over the last several months, do you think that people may hold on to their older barges a bit longer in the hopes to get one more strong pricing environment and that might put a ceiling on any pricing recovery, if the excess barge capacity isn't eliminated?"

But of course, you just don't know. I think it's going to be driven by how quickly it firms up. There are all kinds of use of where this is all going but from our perspective, we continue to see over the year, a pretty low GDP growth kind of environment. And that is going to put a damper on a lot more volume. The only thing that I think that might change that is that if we are experiencing in the petrochemical area, a pretty significant feedstock advantage with natural gas around $4 and crude oil around $85, and that disadvantages at petrochemicals and a lot of other areas in the world. So we're kind of coming -- well, we are globally competitive so the Export business is pretty firm. And that's a business that's very important to Kirby. It's less important to some of the other operators. It's hard to see how some of the other trades really enjoy significant volume improvements. I'm giving you kind of our view of how the economy drives volumes. And I think consistent with that view, I think that you'll see retirements. The older equipments are just expensive to operate, frankly. There are a number of customers, if they have a choice between a barge that's less than 20 years old versus a barge that's 35 years or older, they're going to prefer the younger barges. So there's kind of a natural selection process going on also. And the fact that this older equipment hang on was more driven by a pricing environment that I'd think we're ways away from getting to."

Now, I'll also add that I think for companies that have significant amount of leverage, I think it's going to be very difficult to add more debt.

Truthfully, I don't think we know. The Export business has traditionally been 10% to 12% of the U.S. petrochemical volume. It got as low as 4% to 6%. We sense it's probably over the high end of the range as we speak and that's partly because of low feedstock cost. It's also partly because the dollar is okay, strengthening a little bit but still not to the point where it's disadvantaging exports. Now exports drive our business a lot less than domestic consumption. So even with a higher exports, the domestic consumption is going to be kind of our key driver. Jimmy, that's probably a good question to ask towards the middle of the year, because we'll see how volumes do over the quarter. And I think we'll have a better sense for how much of it is truly improved demand. We couldn't tell you if you ask this question in January that there was good demand.

Late yesterday, we reported net earnings for the 2010 first quarter of $0.46 per share, compared with $0.52 per share reported for the 2009 first quarter. Included in our first quarter results was a previously announced $0.05 per share",973,"Thank you, Steve. Late yesterday, we reported net earnings for the 2010 first quarter of $0.46 per share, compared with $0.52 per share reported for the 2009 first quarter. 
Included in our first quarter results was a previously announced $0.05 per share charge for retirements and shore staff reductions. Our 2009 first quarter results also included a $0.05 per charge for early retirements and shore staff reductions. 
Announced earnings guidance for the first quarter was $0.42 to $0.47 per share and included an estimated $0.04 per share costs for shore staff redundancies. The actual charge that we incurred in the first quarter was slightly higher, a $0.05 charge. 
During the 2010 first quarter, our Marine Transportation volumes improved, compared to both the 2009 first and fourth quarters. Our barge utilization for the first quarter, which is always impacted by weather, averaged in the mid-80s to high-80 range, above all four 2009 quarter levels and frankly, better than forecasted. 
In addition to increased petrochemical production, the improvement in our barge utilization level was also helped by some supply-chain disruptions caused by petrochemical and refraining plant turnarounds, as well as some unscheduled plant maintenance. Our higher volumes were also driven by improved demand for exported petrochemicals. 
U.S. petrochemical complex is enjoying a feedstock advantage today due to a relatively low natural gas costs in the U.S. compared to current crude oil prices. During the first quarter, the term contract portion of our revenue mix remained at about 75% contract, 25% spot. 
Our time charters represented a little less than 50% of total term contracts, compared to the 52% time charter mix we reported in the fourth quarter. While some customers have switched to spot freight in the contracts when their time charters have expired, others have just taken shorter charters of equipment as they're not ready to commit longer-term positions at this point. 
With improved volumes and resulting higher barge utilization rates during the first quarter, we did see pricing stabilize. Term contracts that were renewed during the first quarter generally decreased on average approximately 10% when compared with the term contracts that were renewed first quarter of 2009, with some firming in the contract areas as the quarter progressed. 
Spot contract rates for the first quarter, which of course include fuel and fuel was higher, were down 15% to 25% compared with first quarter spot pricing. But when compared to the fourth quarter, were up 3% to 6%. Again, this represents, I think, the stabilization of pricing in our business. 
With respect to the multi-year contracts that were typically renewed first of the year and escalated first of the year, these are contracts that don't expire in any given year. They're escalated for labor and either the producer price index or the consumer price index. The pricing was neutral for 2010. Typically in previous years, we've gotten anywhere from a 3% to 5% increase. 
The tank barge industry still has some excess capacity. Certainly, the demand that was experienced 2007, 2008, encouraged the industry to build new equipment. But also it encouraged the industry to keep older equipment and service, which typically would've been retired, to meet the higher demand levels. 
In 2009, 192 tank barges were delivered. We estimate about 140 barges were retired in 2009 for a net addition to the industry of about 50 barges. As of the beginning of 2010, we estimate there are approximately 3,150 tank barges in the industry, of which 500 are 35 years old and approximately 250 are 40 years old. 
For 2010, we believe that less than 100 barges will be constructed. Of those less than 100 barges, 58 are going to be ordered by Kirby. With respect to the barges that Kirby isn't building, a number of the barges being built in 2010 were in fact ordered for delivery in 2009 deferred into 2010. And the shipper is also building nine barges for his proprietary fleet serving his internal needs. 
Given the Asia profile of the industry fleet, we continue to expect older barges to be removed from service, and the industry supply versus demand will continue to move closer to balance. We're certainly encouraged by our improved utilization and the pricing stabilization that we're seeing. Demand is better as measured by the volumes that were moving. 
Certainly, demand is better than it was in 2009, and a little better than we thought it would be. However, we do expect our utilization to decline somewhat as weather improves and the supply chain becomes more efficient. This is not untypical in usual years, in late spring and in the summer, you typically see the industry utilization decline a little bit. 
The difference in 2007, 2008 was that there was so much demand that the industry was just fully utilized the entire year. During the 2010 first quarter, this is -- I'm talking about the Diesel Engine business, that segment demand levels for service and direct part sales generally remained weak across the majority of its markets, particularly, the high-speed oil service market. 
We did benefit from some first quarter seasonal work that we generally see in the Midwest and Great Lakes area for medium-speed marine customers. Our service customers continue to defer major maintenance, and this is in the oil service area. The medium-speed power generation market remained healthy, and our medium-speed railroad market benefited from improved direct part sales, as the utilization level for our railroad customers' equipment slowly improved, really reflecting improvements in demand for what they're producing. We do believe demand has bottomed out, but we still haven't seen any consistent signs of improvement in this business segment yet. I'll come back and talk more about this, as well as the outlook for the Inland Tank Barge business later in this call, but first, let me turn the call over to David."
283986,100480359,67680,"Kirby Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Good morning, everyone. Thank you Joe. As we disclosed in our press release, we continue to focus our attention on operating as prudently and as efficiently as possible.

As we disclosed in our press release, we continue to focus our attention on operating as prudently and as efficiently as possible. We did this by further reducing our cost in order to remain competitive as we try and emerge from this economic downturn. 
In January 2010, we further reduced our Marine Transportation and corporate staffs through retirements and reductions, and we took a $4.1 million before-tax charge or $0.05 per share charge in the quarter. We took a similar early retirement and reduction charge in 2009 first quarter. Since our peak headcount in October 2008, we've reduced our shore staff headcount by 22% through early retirements, staff reductions and attritions. 
Kirby's Marine Transportation operating income was 8% below the 2009 first quarter and the operating margin of 19.3% was below the 2009 first quarter margin of 21%. Adjusting for the staff reduction charges in both quarters, the first quarter margin for this quarter would've been 20.5% compared with 22.3% for the first quarter in 2009. 
The lower margin reflected the impact of lower-term and spot-contract pricing throughout the last three quarters of 2009, some higher fuel prices and some more difficult operating conditions with weather and whatnot, partially offset by the benefit of the cost reductions from the headcount reductions that we initiated. The Diesel Engine Services operating income was in line with last year's first quarter. The operating margin was 10.4%. 
This compared with 8.7% reported for the 2009 first quarter or 11.1% adjusted for early retirements and staff reductions taken in the first quarter of 2009. Customers continue to defer their diesel engine maintenance projects, resulting in continued low labor utilization for the business. 
We have a strong cash flow generation quarter. EBITDA was $66 million in the quarter, and as of quarter end at March 31, we had $121 million in cash or in cash equivalents. Our capital spending for the first quarter totaled $34 million, which included $21 million for new tank barges and towboats and $13 million, primarily for capital upgrades to the existing fleet. 
Our capital spending guidance for 2010 remains in the range of $125 million to $135 million, which includes approximately $60 million for new tank barges and towboat construction. During the 2010 first quarter, we took delivery of 16 new 10,000-barrel and two 30,000-barrel tank barges, which added about 226,000 barrels of capacity. 
However, we also retired tank barges in the quarter, 20. And that reduced our overall capacity by 365,000 barrels. So net-net our capacity declined about 139,000 barrels during the quarter. As of March 31, we operated 861 tank barges with the total capacity of 16.6 million barrels. This compares with our peak tank barge count of 918 back in June 30 of 2008, and a peak capacity of about 17.5 million barrels. 
So this reflects a 6% reduction from the peak number of tank barges we operate and about a 5% reduction from our peak tank barge capacity. For the remainder of 2010, as we have stated before, to take advantage of attractive barge construction prices and to continue to upgrade our fleet and provide our customers with newer equipment, we will take delivery of 37 new 10,000-barrel barges, three 30,000-barrel barges and five new 10,000-barrel chartered barges, which will add about 530,000 barrels of capacity. 
However, we will continue to retire older tank barges from the fleets. So with that now, I'll turn it back to Joe."

I'll turn to the outlook for the second quarter and the year. Yesterday afternoon, we announced our second quarter guidance of $0.52 to $0.57 per share, which compares to $0.63 per share earned in the second quarter of last year. If you",661,"Thank you, David. I'll turn to the outlook for the second quarter and the year. Yesterday afternoon, we announced our second quarter guidance of $0.52 to $0.57 per share, which compares to $0.63 per share earned in the second quarter of last year. If you take the $0.46 per share, first quarter earnings, which reflected some modest improvement in volumes, add back the $0.05 per share staff reduction charge and look for some improvement in weather and operating conditions, you're basically at the low end of our range, the $0.52 level. 
The $0.57 high end of the range assumes that we continue to see Transportation volumes improve somewhat. We're forecasting for the Diesel Engine business kind of flat operating results, similar to other results in the first quarter. 
As for the full year, based on a more positive outlook for the balance of the year, we're raising our low-end guidance to $2, up from the $1.85 that we put out at the beginning of the year. And we're maintaining our high-end guidance of $2.20 per share. 
Our previous $1.85 low-end guidance assumed 2010 volumes would be consistent with volumes in 2009 and continued downward pressure on term contract renewals and spot contract pricing, at least, through the first half of the year. Fortunately, during the first quarter, volumes improved at contract and spot market pricing stabilized. And with respect to spot prices, we're, in fact, up a little. 
Therefore, the new $2 low-end guidance assumes volumes are going to be stable for the remainder of 2010, and that pricing is going to remain about where it is. Our $2.20 high-end guidance assumes continued modest improvement in volumes as the year progresses and a continued reduction in the current number of tank barges, a reduction in capacity. This all combining to lead to some modest improvement in term and spot pricing in the second half of the year. 
As we stated in last quarter's call, to achieve pricing power, barge capacity will need to be removed from the industry fleet where volumes will need to improve to absorb existing capacity or a combination of both will need to happen. We did see some improvement in volumes during the quarter. And time will tell whether, frankly, these volumes are sustainable. If they are sustainable, we suspect that we will see some modest pricing power in the second half of 2010. 
Now Kirby is in great financial shape. We've taken significant amount of cost out of our business last year, early this year. We have a very strong balance sheet, low level of debt, favorable interest rates and cash on our balance sheet that should continue to build. In March of this year, S&P increased our credit rating from a BBB+ to a investment grade rated A-. 
So we remain in excellent position to execute our objective of making strategic acquisitions as they become available. Also I want to comment, before we open the call up to questions, on -- for the retirement of Berdon Lawrence, Kirby's Chairman of the Board since 1999. 
Yesterday, Berdon retired. He has announced that he was going to retire on October of last year. I would like to thank Berdon, publicly, for his service not only to Kirby, but to the inland tank barge industry. He has truly been a leader of this industry and has helped guide Kirby to its success while serving as Kirby's Chairman. I have enjoyed working with Berdon over the past 10 years, beginning with the integration of Hollywood into Kirby and continuing over those years with Kirby's strategy of enhancing and growing our core businesses through synergistic acquisitions, and also creating enhanced earnings and value for our shareholders. 
Fortunately, Berdon is not going to go far. He is going to serve on Kirby's board. He's going to be Kirby's Chairman Emeritus and we'll still have access to his wisdom. Operator, I think we're now ready to open the call up for questions."

Now I think the dilemma is, do you believe it's sustainable? If it's sustainable then I would expect pricing actually to recover going forward a little quicker than it did in the last recession, the 2000 to 2003 recession. Spot prices are a leading indicator of contract pricing and today, spot pricing is actually slightly better than contracts as they're renewed. Now of course, contracts are renewed at lower rates. We said on average about 10% lower this quarter than last year's first quarter. But I think if you get spot pricing somewhere in the 5% to 10% range above contracts, they'll pull the contract pricing up. We're not there yet. I would say that -- when I say modestly above contract pricing, you're talking 3%, 4%. And you're also talking in an environment where they jump around a lot. There may be days where positioning drives spot pricing a little higher and other days where it depresses it."

As the volumes have recovered, and I would probably guess it's sentiment across the industry, just as it has across the broader economy has improved over the last several months, do you think that people may hold on to their older barges a bit longer in the hopes to get one more strong pricing environment and that might put a ceiling on any pricing recovery, if the excess barge capacity isn't eliminated?"

And that is going to put a damper on a lot more volume. The only thing that I think that might change that is that if we are experiencing in the petrochemical area, a pretty significant feedstock advantage with natural gas around $4 and crude oil around $85, and that disadvantages at petrochemicals and a lot of other areas in the world. So we're kind of coming -- well, we are globally competitive so the Export business is pretty firm. And that's a business that's very important to Kirby. It's less important to some of the other operators. It's hard to see how some of the other trades really enjoy significant volume improvements. I'm giving you kind of our view of how the economy drives volumes. And I think consistent with that view, I think that you'll see retirements. The older equipments are just expensive to operate, frankly. There are a number of customers, if they have a choice between a barge that's less than 20 years old versus a barge that's 35 years or older, they're going to prefer the younger barges. So there's kind of a natural selection process going on also. And the fact that this older equipment hang on was more driven by a pricing environment that I'd think we're ways away from getting to."

You pull the trigger when the asset values are right. I think that the depth of the recession that we were thinking of clearly --  when we got there, we weren't there long, so recovery has helped. But I also think that in low-growth environment, some of the enthusiasm for companies that have significant capital decisions in front of them or a lot of debt gets diminished and that there are going to be opportunities. I think that patience is in order. Back in the 90s were Kirby was pretty active from an acquisition perspective, that was the environment. It was a low-growth environment. So we're not less optimistic that there are going to be opportunities. We think that this is a business that is going to consolidate, and we think we're going to play a role in that consolidation.

Truthfully, I don't think we know. The export business has traditionally been 10% to 12% of the U.S. petrochemical volume. It got as low as 4% to 6%. We sense it's probably over the high end of the range as we speak and that's partly because of low feedstock cost. It's also partly because the dollar is okay, strengthening a little bit but still not to the point where it's disadvantaging exports. Now exports drive our business a lot less than domestic consumption. So even with the higher exports, the domestic consumption is going to be kind of our key driver. Jimmy [ph], that's probably a good question to ask towards the middle of the year, because we'll see how volumes do over the quarter.

Late yesterday, we reported net earnings for the 2010 first quarter of $0.46 per share, compared with $0.52 per share reported for the 2009 first quarter. Included in our first quarter results was a previously announced $0.05 per share",973,"Thank you, Steve. Late yesterday, we reported net earnings for the 2010 first quarter of $0.46 per share, compared with $0.52 per share reported for the 2009 first quarter. 
Included in our first quarter results was a previously announced $0.05 per share charge for retirements and shore staff reductions. Our 2009 first quarter results also included a $0.05 per charge for early retirements and shore staff reductions. 
Announced earnings guidance for the first quarter was $0.42 to $0.47 per share and included an estimated $0.04 per share costs for shore staff redundancies. The actual charge that we incurred in the first quarter was slightly higher, a $0.05 charge. 
During the 2010 first quarter, our Marine Transportation volumes improved, compared to both the 2009 first and fourth quarters. Our barge utilization for the first quarter, which is always impacted by weather, averaged in the mid-80s to high-80 range, above all four 2009 quarter levels and frankly, better than forecasted. 
In addition to increased petrochemical production, the improvement in our barge utilization level was also helped by some supply-chain disruptions caused by petrochemical and refraining plant turnarounds, as well as some unscheduled plant maintenance. Our higher volumes were also driven by improved demand for exported petrochemicals. 
U.S. petrochemical complex is enjoying a feedstock advantage today due to a relatively low natural gas costs in the U.S. compared to current crude oil prices. During the first quarter, the term contract portion of our revenue mix remained at about 75% contract, 25% spot. 
Our time charters represented a little less than 50% of total term contracts, compared to the 52% time charter mix we reported in the fourth quarter. While some customers have switched to spot freight in the contracts when their time charters have expired, others have just taken shorter charters of equipment as they're not ready to commit longer-term positions at this point. 
With improved volumes and resulting higher barge utilization rates during the first quarter, we did see pricing stabilize. Term contracts that were renewed during the first quarter generally decreased on average approximately 10% when compared with the term contracts that were renewed first quarter of 2009, with some firming in the contract areas as the quarter progressed. 
Spot contract rates for the first quarter, which of course include fuel and fuel was higher, were down 15% to 25% compared with first quarter spot pricing. But when compared to the fourth quarter, were up 3% to 6%. Again, this represents, I think, the stabilization of pricing in our business. 
With respect to the multi-year contracts that were typically renewed first of the year and escalated first of the year, these are contracts that don't expire in any given year. They're escalated for labor and either the producer price index or the consumer price index. The pricing was neutral for 2010. Typically in previous years, we've gotten anywhere from a 3% to 5% increase. 
The tank barge industry still has some excess capacity. Certainly, the demand that was experienced 2007, 2008, encouraged the industry to build new equipment. But also it encouraged the industry to keep older equipment and service, which typically would've been retired, to meet the higher demand levels. 
In 2009, 192 tank barges were delivered. We estimate about 140 barges were retired in 2009 for a net addition to the industry of about 50 barges. As of the beginning of 2010, we estimate there are approximately 3,150 tank barges in the industry, of which 500 are 35 years old and approximately 250 are 40 years old. 
For 2010, we believe that less than 100 barges will be constructed. Of those less than 100 barges, 58 are going to be ordered by Kirby. With respect to the barges that Kirby isn't building, a number of the barges being built in 2010 were in fact ordered for delivery in 2009 deferred into 2010. And the shipper is also building nine barges for his proprietary fleet serving his internal needs. 
Given the Asia profile of the industry fleet, we continue to expect older barges to be removed from service, and the industry supply versus demand will continue to move closer to balance. We're certainly encouraged by our improved utilization and the pricing stabilization that we're seeing. Demand is better as measured by the volumes that were moving. 
Certainly, demand is better than it was in 2009, and a little better than we thought it would be. However, we do expect our utilization to decline somewhat as weather improves and the supply chain becomes more efficient. This is not untypical in usual years, in late spring and in the summer, you typically see the industry utilization decline a little bit. 
The difference in 2007, 2008 was that there was so much demand that the industry was just fully utilized the entire year. During the 2010 first quarter, this is -- I'm talking about the Diesel Engine business, that segment demand levels for service and direct part sales generally remained weak across the majority of its markets, particularly, the high-speed oil service market. 
We did benefit from some first quarter seasonal work that we generally see in the Midwest and Great Lakes area for medium-speed marine customers. Our service customers continue to defer major maintenance, and this is in the oil service area. The medium-speed power generation market remained healthy, and our medium-speed railroad market benefited from improved direct part sales, as the utilization level for our railroad customers' equipment slowly improved, really reflecting improvements in demand for what they're producing. We do believe demand has bottomed out, but we still haven't seen any consistent signs of improvement in this business segment yet. I'll come back and talk more about this, as well as the outlook for the Inland Tank Barge business later in this call, but first, let me turn the call over to David."
283986,100480359,67685,"Kirby Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Good morning, everyone. Thank you Joe. As we disclosed in our press release, we continue to focus our attention on operating as prudently and as efficiently as possible.

As we disclosed in our press release, we continue to focus our attention on operating as prudently and as efficiently as possible. We did this by further reducing our cost in order to remain competitive as we try and emerge from this economic downturn. 
In January 2010, we further reduced our Marine Transportation and corporate staffs through retirements and reductions, and we took a $4.1 million before-tax charge or $0.05 per share charge in the quarter. We took a similar early retirement and reduction charge in 2009 first quarter. Since our peak headcount in October 2008, we've reduced our shore staff headcount by 22% through early retirements, staff reductions and attritions. 
Kirby's Marine Transportation operating income was 8% below the 2009 first quarter and the operating margin of 19.3% was below the 2009 first quarter margin of 21%. Adjusting for the staff reduction charges in both quarters, the first quarter margin for this quarter would've been 20.5% compared with 22.3% for the first quarter in 2009. 
The lower margin reflected the impact of lower-term and spot-contract pricing throughout the last three quarters of 2009, some higher fuel prices and some more difficult operating conditions with weather and whatnot, partially offset by the benefit of the cost reductions from the headcount reductions that we initiated. The Diesel Engine Services operating income was in line with last year's first quarter. The operating margin was 10.4%. 
This compared with 8.7% reported for the 2009 first quarter or 11.1% adjusted for early retirements and staff reductions taken in the first quarter of 2009. Customers continue to defer their diesel engine maintenance projects, resulting in continued low labor utilization for the business. 
We have a strong cash flow generation quarter. EBITDA was $66 million in the quarter, and as of quarter end at March 31, we had $121 million in cash or in cash equivalents. Our capital spending for the first quarter totaled $34 million, which included $21 million for new tank barges and towboats and $13 million, primarily for capital upgrades to the existing fleet. 
Our capital spending guidance for 2010 remains in the range of $125 million to $135 million, which includes approximately $60 million for new tank barges and towboat construction. During the 2010 first quarter, we took delivery of 16 new 10,000-barrel and two 30,000-barrel tank barges, which added about 226,000 barrels of capacity. 
However, we also retired tank barges in the quarter, 20. And that reduced our overall capacity by 365,000 barrels. So net-net our capacity declined about 139,000 barrels during the quarter. As of March 31, we operated 861 tank barges with the total capacity of 16.6 million barrels. This compares with our peak tank barge count of 918 back in June 30 of 2008, and a peak capacity of about 17.5 million barrels. 
So this reflects a 6% reduction from the peak number of tank barges we operate and about a 5% reduction from our peak tank barge capacity. For the remainder of 2010, as we have stated before, to take advantage of attractive barge construction prices and to continue to upgrade our fleet and provide our customers with newer equipment, we will take delivery of 37 new 10,000-barrel barges, three 30,000-barrel barges and five new 10,000-barrel chartered barges, which will add about 530,000 barrels of capacity. 
However, we will continue to retire older tank barges from the fleets. So with that now, I'll turn it back to Joe."
283986,100480359,67685,"Kirby Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-29-2010",2010-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thank you, David. I'll turn to the outlook for the second quarter and the year. Yesterday afternoon, we announced our second quarter guidance of $0.52 to $0.57 per share, which compares to $0.63 per share earned in the second quarter of last year. If you",661,"Thank you, David. I'll turn to the outlook for the second quarter and the year. Yesterday afternoon, we announced our second quarter guidance of $0.52 to $0.57 per share, which compares to $0.63 per share earned in the second quarter of last year. If you take the $0.46 per share, first quarter earnings, which reflected some modest improvement in volumes, add back the $0.05 per share staff reduction charge and look for some improvement in weather and operating conditions, you're basically at the low end of our range, the $0.52 level. 
The $0.57 high end of the range assumes that we continue to see Transportation volumes improve somewhat. We're forecasting for the Diesel Engine business kind of flat operating results, similar to other results in the first quarter. 
As for the full year, based on a more positive outlook for the balance of the year, we're raising our low-end guidance to $2, up from the $1.85 that we put out at the beginning of the year. And we're maintaining our high-end guidance of $2.20 per share. 
Our previous $1.85 low-end guidance assumed 2010 volumes would be consistent with volumes in 2009 and continued downward pressure on term contract renewals and spot contract pricing, at least, through the first half of the year. Fortunately, during the first quarter, volumes improved at contract and spot market pricing stabilized. And with respect to spot prices, we're, in fact, up a little. 
Therefore, the new $2 low-end guidance assumes volumes are going to be stable for the remainder of 2010, and that pricing is going to remain about where it is. Our $2.20 high-end guidance assumes continued modest improvement in volumes as the year progresses and a continued reduction in the current number of tank barges, a reduction in capacity. This all combining to lead to some modest improvement in term and spot pricing in the second half of the year. 
As we stated in last quarter's call, to achieve pricing power, barge capacity will need to be removed from the industry fleet where volumes will need to improve to absorb existing capacity or a combination of both will need to happen. We did see some improvement in volumes during the quarter. And time will tell whether, frankly, these volumes are sustainable. If they are sustainable, we suspect that we will see some modest pricing power in the second half of 2010. 
Now Kirby is in great financial shape. We've taken significant amount of cost out of our business last year, early this year. We have a very strong balance sheet, low level of debt, favorable interest rates and cash on our balance sheet that should continue to build. In March of this year, S&P increased our credit rating from a BBB+ to a investment grade rated A-. 
So we remain in excellent position to execute our objective of making strategic acquisitions as they become available. Also I want to comment, before we open the call up to questions, on -- for the retirement of Berdon Lawrence, Kirby's Chairman of the Board since 1999. 
Yesterday, Berdon retired. He has announced that he was going to retire on October of last year. I would like to thank Berdon, publicly, for his service not only to Kirby, but to the inland tank barge industry. He has truly been a leader of this industry and has helped guide Kirby to its success while serving as Kirby's Chairman. I have enjoyed working with Berdon over the past 10 years, beginning with the integration of Hollywood into Kirby and continuing over those years with Kirby's strategy of enhancing and growing our core businesses through synergistic acquisitions, and also creating enhanced earnings and value for our shareholders. 
Fortunately, Berdon is not going to go far. He is going to serve on Kirby's board. He's going to be Kirby's Chairman Emeritus and we'll still have access to his wisdom. Operator, I think we're now ready to open the call up for questions."

If you go back to the last recession, which began in 2000 through 2003, we really didn't see any recovery until the end of 2003. Today, we're seeing a pretty sharp recovery. Now I think the dilemma is, do you believe it's sustainable? If it's sustainable then I would expect pricing actually to recover going forward a little quicker than it did in the last recession, the 2000 to 2003 recession. Spot prices are a leading indicator of contract pricing and today, spot pricing is actually slightly better than contracts as they're renewed. Now of course, contracts are renewed at lower rates. We said on average about 10% lower this quarter than last year's first quarter. But I think if you get spot pricing somewhere in the 5% to 10% range above contracts, they'll pull the contract pricing up. We're not there yet. I would say that -- when I say modestly above contract pricing, you're talking 3%, 4%. And you're also talking in an environment where they jump around a lot. There may be days where positioning drives spot pricing a little higher and other days where it depresses it."

Obviously volumes was part of it but then another big part of it was the removal of excess capacity in the market. As the volumes have recovered, and I would probably guess it's sentiment across the industry, just as it has across the broader economy has improved over the last several months, do you think that people may hold on to their older barges a bit longer in the hopes to get one more strong pricing environment and that might put a ceiling on any pricing recovery, if the excess barge capacity isn't eliminated?"

But of course, you just don't know. I think it's going to be driven by how quickly it firms up. There are all kinds of use of where this is all going but from our perspective, we continue to see over the year, a pretty low GDP growth kind of environment. And that is going to put a damper on a lot more volume. The only thing that I think that might change that is that if we are experiencing in the petrochemical area, a pretty significant feedstock advantage with natural gas around $4 and crude oil around $85, and that disadvantages at petrochemicals and a lot of other areas in the world. So we're kind of coming -- well, we are globally competitive so the Export business is pretty firm. And that's a business that's very important to Kirby. It's less important to some of the other operators. It's hard to see how some of the other trades really enjoy significant volume improvements. I'm giving you kind of our view of how the economy drives volumes. And I think consistent with that view, I think that you'll see retirements. The older equipments are just expensive to operate, frankly. There are a number of customers, if they have a choice between a barge that's less than 20 years old versus a barge that's 35 years or older, they're going to prefer the younger barges. So there's kind of a natural selection process going on also. And the fact that this older equipment hang on was more driven by a pricing environment that I'd think we're ways away from getting to."

We sense it's probably over the high end of the range as we speak and that's partly because of low feedstock cost. It's also partly because the dollar is okay, strengthening a little bit but still not to the point where it's disadvantaging exports. Now exports drive our business a lot less than domestic consumption. So even with the higher exports, the domestic consumption is going to be kind of our key driver.

Because typically, as we look at the first quarter, that's the seasonally low point for operating margins as well. So I'm just trying to think through, if we get a faster acceleration in pricing this cycle and we're starting at a 20% operating margin, where does this thing go in the next cycle?"

So we're getting higher highs now and we'll have higher lows going forward, I think, because of the rightsizing of the organization. So you could expect an upward trend on margins if things stabilize and pricing improves. But to add to what Joe said, fuel does impact it. We don't make margin on it. It's kind of a pass-through. So it dilutes the margins a little bit, so you got to watch the fuel."

Late yesterday, we reported net earnings for the 2010 first quarter of $0.46 per share, compared with $0.52 per share reported for the 2009 first quarter. Included in our first quarter results was a previously announced $0.05 per share",973,"Thank you, Steve. Late yesterday, we reported net earnings for the 2010 first quarter of $0.46 per share, compared with $0.52 per share reported for the 2009 first quarter. 
Included in our first quarter results was a previously announced $0.05 per share charge for retirements and shore staff reductions. Our 2009 first quarter results also included a $0.05 per charge for early retirements and shore staff reductions. 
Announced earnings guidance for the first quarter was $0.42 to $0.47 per share and included an estimated $0.04 per share costs for shore staff redundancies. The actual charge that we incurred in the first quarter was slightly higher, a $0.05 charge. 
During the 2010 first quarter, our Marine Transportation volumes improved, compared to both the 2009 first and fourth quarters. Our barge utilization for the first quarter, which is always impacted by weather, averaged in the mid-80s to high-80 range, above all four 2009 quarter levels and frankly, better than forecasted. 
In addition to increased petrochemical production, the improvement in our barge utilization level was also helped by some supply-chain disruptions caused by petrochemical and refraining plant turnarounds, as well as some unscheduled plant maintenance. Our higher volumes were also driven by improved demand for exported petrochemicals. 
U.S. petrochemical complex is enjoying a feedstock advantage today due to a relatively low natural gas costs in the U.S. compared to current crude oil prices. During the first quarter, the term contract portion of our revenue mix remained at about 75% contract, 25% spot. 
Our time charters represented a little less than 50% of total term contracts, compared to the 52% time charter mix we reported in the fourth quarter. While some customers have switched to spot freight in the contracts when their time charters have expired, others have just taken shorter charters of equipment as they're not ready to commit longer-term positions at this point. 
With improved volumes and resulting higher barge utilization rates during the first quarter, we did see pricing stabilize. Term contracts that were renewed during the first quarter generally decreased on average approximately 10% when compared with the term contracts that were renewed first quarter of 2009, with some firming in the contract areas as the quarter progressed. 
Spot contract rates for the first quarter, which of course include fuel and fuel was higher, were down 15% to 25% compared with first quarter spot pricing. But when compared to the fourth quarter, were up 3% to 6%. Again, this represents, I think, the stabilization of pricing in our business. 
With respect to the multi-year contracts that were typically renewed first of the year and escalated first of the year, these are contracts that don't expire in any given year. They're escalated for labor and either the producer price index or the consumer price index. The pricing was neutral for 2010. Typically in previous years, we've gotten anywhere from a 3% to 5% increase. 
The tank barge industry still has some excess capacity. Certainly, the demand that was experienced 2007, 2008, encouraged the industry to build new equipment. But also it encouraged the industry to keep older equipment and service, which typically would've been retired, to meet the higher demand levels. 
In 2009, 192 tank barges were delivered. We estimate about 140 barges were retired in 2009 for a net addition to the industry of about 50 barges. As of the beginning of 2010, we estimate there are approximately 3,150 tank barges in the industry, of which 500 are 35 years old and approximately 250 are 40 years old. 
For 2010, we believe that less than 100 barges will be constructed. Of those less than 100 barges, 58 are going to be ordered by Kirby. With respect to the barges that Kirby isn't building, a number of the barges being built in 2010 were in fact ordered for delivery in 2009 deferred into 2010. And the shipper is also building nine barges for his proprietary fleet serving his internal needs. 
Given the Asia profile of the industry fleet, we continue to expect older barges to be removed from service, and the industry supply versus demand will continue to move closer to balance. We're certainly encouraged by our improved utilization and the pricing stabilization that we're seeing. Demand is better as measured by the volumes that were moving. 
Certainly, demand is better than it was in 2009, and a little better than we thought it would be. However, we do expect our utilization to decline somewhat as weather improves and the supply chain becomes more efficient. This is not untypical in usual years, in late spring and in the summer, you typically see the industry utilization decline a little bit. 
The difference in 2007, 2008 was that there was so much demand that the industry was just fully utilized the entire year. During the 2010 first quarter, this is -- I'm talking about the Diesel Engine business, that segment demand levels for service and direct part sales generally remained weak across the majority of its markets, particularly, the high-speed oil service market. 
We did benefit from some first quarter seasonal work that we generally see in the Midwest and Great Lakes area for medium-speed marine customers. Our service customers continue to defer major maintenance, and this is in the oil service area. The medium-speed power generation market remained healthy, and our medium-speed railroad market benefited from improved direct part sales, as the utilization level for our railroad customers' equipment slowly improved, really reflecting improvements in demand for what they're producing. We do believe demand has bottomed out, but we still haven't seen any consistent signs of improvement in this business segment yet. I'll come back and talk more about this, as well as the outlook for the Inland Tank Barge business later in this call, but first, let me turn the call over to David."

Kirby's Marine Transportation operating income was 8% below the 2009 first quarter and the operating margin of 19.3% was below the 2009 first quarter margin of 21%. Adjusting for the staff reduction charges in both quarters, the first quarter margin for this quarter would've been 20.5% compared with 22.3% for the first quarter in 2009. 
The lower margin reflected the impact of lower-term and spot-contract pricing throughout the last three quarters of 2009, some higher fuel prices and some more difficult operating conditions with weather and whatnot, partially offset by the benefit of the cost reductions from the headcount reductions that we initiated. The Diesel Engine Services operating income was in line with last year's first quarter. The operating margin was 10.4%. 
This compared with 8.7% reported for the 2009 first quarter or 11.1% adjusted for early retirements and staff reductions taken in the first quarter of 2009. Customers continue to defer their diesel engine maintenance projects, resulting in continued low labor utilization for the business. 
We have a strong cash flow generation quarter. EBITDA was $66 million in the quarter, and as of quarter end at March 31, we had $121 million in cash or in cash equivalents. Our capital spending for the first quarter totaled $34 million, which included $21 million for new tank barges and towboats and $13 million, primarily for capital upgrades to the existing fleet. 
Our capital spending guidance for 2010 remains in the range of $125 million to $135 million, which includes approximately $60 million for new tank barges and towboat construction. During the 2010 first quarter, we took delivery of 16 new 10,000-barrel and two 30,000-barrel tank barges, which added about 226,000 barrels of capacity. 
However, we also retired tank barges in the quarter, 20. And that reduced our overall capacity by 365,000 barrels. So net-net our capacity declined about 139,000 barrels during the quarter. As of March 31, we operated 861 tank barges with the total capacity of 16.6 million barrels. This compares with our peak tank barge count of 918 back in June 30 of 2008, and a peak capacity of about 17.5 million barrels. 
So this reflects a 6% reduction from the peak number of tank barges we operate and about a 5% reduction from our peak tank barge capacity. For the remainder of 2010, as we have stated before, to take advantage of attractive barge construction prices and to continue to upgrade our fleet and provide our customers with newer equipment, we will take delivery of 37 new 10,000-barrel barges, three 30,000-barrel barges and five new 10,000-barrel chartered barges, which will add about 530,000 barrels of capacity. 
However, we will continue to retire older tank barges from the fleets. So with that now, I'll turn it back to Joe."

I'll turn to the outlook for the second quarter and the year. Yesterday afternoon, we announced our second quarter guidance of $0.52 to $0.57 per share, which compares to $0.63 per share earned in the second quarter of last year. If you",661,"Thank you, David. I'll turn to the outlook for the second quarter and the year. Yesterday afternoon, we announced our second quarter guidance of $0.52 to $0.57 per share, which compares to $0.63 per share earned in the second quarter of last year. If you take the $0.46 per share, first quarter earnings, which reflected some modest improvement in volumes, add back the $0.05 per share staff reduction charge and look for some improvement in weather and operating conditions, you're basically at the low end of our range, the $0.52 level. 
The $0.57 high end of the range assumes that we continue to see Transportation volumes improve somewhat. We're forecasting for the Diesel Engine business kind of flat operating results, similar to other results in the first quarter. 
As for the full year, based on a more positive outlook for the balance of the year, we're raising our low-end guidance to $2, up from the $1.85 that we put out at the beginning of the year. And we're maintaining our high-end guidance of $2.20 per share. 
Our previous $1.85 low-end guidance assumed 2010 volumes would be consistent with volumes in 2009 and continued downward pressure on term contract renewals and spot contract pricing, at least, through the first half of the year. Fortunately, during the first quarter, volumes improved at contract and spot market pricing stabilized. And with respect to spot prices, we're, in fact, up a little. 
Therefore, the new $2 low-end guidance assumes volumes are going to be stable for the remainder of 2010, and that pricing is going to remain about where it is. Our $2.20 high-end guidance assumes continued modest improvement in volumes as the year progresses and a continued reduction in the current number of tank barges, a reduction in capacity. This all combining to lead to some modest improvement in term and spot pricing in the second half of the year. 
As we stated in last quarter's call, to achieve pricing power, barge capacity will need to be removed from the industry fleet where volumes will need to improve to absorb existing capacity or a combination of both will need to happen. We did see some improvement in volumes during the quarter. And time will tell whether, frankly, these volumes are sustainable. If they are sustainable, we suspect that we will see some modest pricing power in the second half of 2010. 
Now Kirby is in great financial shape. We've taken significant amount of cost out of our business last year, early this year. We have a very strong balance sheet, low level of debt, favorable interest rates and cash on our balance sheet that should continue to build. In March of this year, S&P increased our credit rating from a BBB+ to a investment grade rated A-. 
So we remain in excellent position to execute our objective of making strategic acquisitions as they become available. Also I want to comment, before we open the call up to questions, on -- for the retirement of Berdon Lawrence, Kirby's Chairman of the Board since 1999. 
Yesterday, Berdon retired. He has announced that he was going to retire on October of last year. I would like to thank Berdon, publicly, for his service not only to Kirby, but to the inland tank barge industry. He has truly been a leader of this industry and has helped guide Kirby to its success while serving as Kirby's Chairman. I have enjoyed working with Berdon over the past 10 years, beginning with the integration of Hollywood into Kirby and continuing over those years with Kirby's strategy of enhancing and growing our core businesses through synergistic acquisitions, and also creating enhanced earnings and value for our shareholders. 
Fortunately, Berdon is not going to go far. He is going to serve on Kirby's board. He's going to be Kirby's Chairman Emeritus and we'll still have access to his wisdom. Operator, I think we're now ready to open the call up for questions."

Now I think the dilemma is, do you believe it's sustainable? If it's sustainable then I would expect pricing actually to recover going forward a little quicker than it did in the last recession, the 2000 to 2003 recession. Spot prices are a leading indicator of contract pricing and today, spot pricing is actually slightly better than contracts as they're renewed. Now of course, contracts are renewed at lower rates. We said on average about 10% lower this quarter than last year's first quarter. But I think if you get spot pricing somewhere in the 5% to 10% range above contracts, they'll pull the contract pricing up. We're not there yet. I would say that -- when I say modestly above contract pricing, you're talking 3%, 4%. And you're also talking in an environment where they jump around a lot. There may be days where positioning drives spot pricing a little higher and other days where it depresses it."

Obviously volumes was part of it but then another big part of it was the removal of excess capacity in the market. As the volumes have recovered, and I would probably guess it's sentiment across the industry, just as it has across the broader economy has improved over the last several months, do you think that people may hold on to their older barges a bit longer in the hopes to get one more strong pricing environment and that might put a ceiling on any pricing recovery, if the excess barge capacity isn't eliminated?"

But of course, you just don't know. I think it's going to be driven by how quickly it firms up. There are all kinds of use of where this is all going but from our perspective, we continue to see over the year, a pretty low GDP growth kind of environment. And that is going to put a damper on a lot more volume. The only thing that I think that might change that is that if we are experiencing in the petrochemical area, a pretty significant feedstock advantage with natural gas around $4 and crude oil around $85, and that disadvantages at petrochemicals and a lot of other areas in the world. So we're kind of coming -- well, we are globally competitive so the Export business is pretty firm. And that's a business that's very important to Kirby. It's less important to some of the other operators. It's hard to see how some of the other trades really enjoy significant volume improvements. I'm giving you kind of our view of how the economy drives volumes. And I think consistent with that view, I think that you'll see retirements. The older equipments are just expensive to operate, frankly. There are a number of customers, if they have a choice between a barge that's less than 20 years old versus a barge that's 35 years or older, they're going to prefer the younger barges. So there's kind of a natural selection process going on also. And the fact that this older equipment hang on was more driven by a pricing environment that I'd think we're ways away from getting to."

It's also partly because the dollar is okay, strengthening a little bit but still not to the point where it's disadvantaging exports. Now exports drive our business a lot less than domestic consumption. So even with the higher exports, the domestic consumption is going to be kind of our key driver.

Yesterday, we reported 2010 second quarter net earnings of $0.54 a share compared to our 2009 second quarter net earnings of $0.63 per share. Our announced earnings guidance for the second quarter was $0.52 to $0.57 per share. For",868,"Okay. Thank you, Steve. Yesterday, we reported 2010 second quarter net earnings of $0.54 a share compared to our 2009 second quarter net earnings of $0.63 per share. Our announced earnings guidance for the second quarter was $0.52 to $0.57 per share. For the first six months of 2010, we earned $1 per share compared to $1.15 per share, same period a year before.
During the second quarter, our Marine Transportation demand and barge utilization were in line with the first quarter, above the comparable levels in 2009 and above frankly what we anticipated at the beginning of this year. Our barge utilization for the second quarter averaged in the mid to high-80% range, remaining above all four 2009 quarter levels. And we suspect our utilization level is, on average, better than the industry average. This improvement in demand and utilization was driven by modestly higher refinery and petrochemical outlet. The higher volumes were also driven by improved demand for export petrochemicals. U.S. petrochemicals continued to enjoy a feedstock advantage due to their relatively low natural gas costs compared to higher crude-based systems.
Increase in the second quarter Marine Transportation revenue was primarily due to higher diesel fuel prices, averaging 60% higher than the 2009 second quarter, as the higher fuel price is passed to customers through fuel escalation and de-escalation causes which are embedded in our term agreements. 
During the 2010 second quarter, the term contract portion of our revenue mix remained at 75%. That's 75% contracts, 25% in the spot market. Time charters represented a little better than 50% of total of term contracts during the quarter compared to about the same number last quarter. While some customers have switched to spot affreightment agreements when the time charter contracts expire, others have shortened their charter exposure, as we're not ready to take longer-term position on equipment at this time.
With modestly improved volumes and resulting higher barge utilization rates during the first half of the year, pricing has stabilized. This is encouraging. Unfortunately, there is still uncertainty with respect to the economy, sustainability of demand and equipment utilization, which is affecting the industry's appetite to test raising rates. 
Consequently, term contracts that were renewed during the second quarter were relatively flat with the first quarter renewals, but decreased, on average, 10% to 12% when compared with term contract rate renewals, second quarter of last year. Spot contract rates for the second quarter, which include the price of fuel, were up 2% to 3% compared with the first quarter, but down 10% to 15% when you compare them to the same period last year. 
With respect to our annual renewals effective January 1, 2010, on our multiyear issued contracts of over a year, the escalators were essentially neutral, not positive or negative. 
During the second quarter, our Diesel Engine Service segment saw continued weak service and parts sales and some pricing pressure, principally in the high-speed market, across marine markets, again, principally in the Gulf Coast area servicing the Oil Service business. 
As customers continued to defer major maintenance projects, our Gulf Coast high-speed market did see some modest benefit during the quarter from acquired repair service for customer's equipment involved in the Gulf Coast cleanup effort. But customers are generally just patching. They're not doing the kind of the long-term overhauls that really drive this business. 
The medium-speed power generation market continued to remain stable, but our second quarter results were impacted by fewer generator engine set upgrade projects and lower direct part sales. Pricing in this business continues to remain stable. 
Our Medium-speed Railroad business benefited from improved direct part sales, as utilization levels for our railroad customers improved slightly over the first half of the year.
With respect to the BP oil spill and its effect on our transportation sector, it really has been minimal. We have cleaned oil from only one tow operating in the inland waterwaste (sic) [wastewater] system since the beginning of the spill. And in our offshore operations, at most, we've sustained only minor increased transit times as we avoided oil slicks during Gulf crossings between Louisiana and Florida. We are aware of several of our competitors using some inland tank barges in the cleanup efforts. This certainly has helped the industry tank parts utilization during the quarter, but it hasn't been enough to improve pricing. 
Our Diesel Engine Service segment high-speed Gulf Coast operations, as I mentioned earlier, did benefit from required repairs to equipment used in the cleanup efforts. However, the moratorium on the deepwater drilling will impact companies servicing the Gulf Coast Oil and Gas business. Currently, about 20% to 25% of our Diesel Engine Service revenues are associated with the Gulf Coast Oil and Gas Drilling business, including both the shallow water and deepwater drilling. 
At this point, it's very difficult to know the future financial impact of this moratorium or, frankly, the effect of new regulations on drilling operators and what that effect is going to mean for diesel engine service sector. 
I'll come back at the end of our prepared remarks and talk about our forecast for the third quarter and the full year outlook. But I'll now turn the call over to David."
283986,109027371,76532,"Kirby Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Joe. Let me provide a few more details on the quarter. Kirby's Marine Transportation revenue was 6% above and operating income 7% below the second quarter of 2009. The segment's operating margin was 21.6% compared with 24.4% from the prior year",670,"Thank you, Joe. Let me provide a few more details on the quarter. Kirby's Marine Transportation revenue was 6% above and operating income 7% below the second quarter of 2009. The segment's operating margin was 21.6% compared with 24.4% from the prior year period. The lower margin reflected the impact of lower term and spot contract pricing throughout the last three quarters of 2009 and the first half of 2010. Higher fuel prices and increased delay days also impacted margins. Partially offsetting this was the benefit of the ongoing cost-reduction efforts and efficiency initiatives that we implemented throughout 2009 and the early part of 2010. So year-over-year, pricing and margins are down, but pricing is stabilizing, as Joe mentioned, and margins have improved sequentially from the first quarter. 
In the Diesel Engine Services business, revenue was 21%, income 45% below last year's second quarter. The operating margin was 9.5% compared with 13.6% reported in the second quarter of last year. The lower results in margins primarily reflected the continued weak Gulf Coast oil service high-speed markets, as Joe mentioned, as customers defer major maintenance projects. 
We were also affected by fewer engine generator set upgrades and lower direct parts sales in the Power Generation market. The lower industry-wide business activity is placing some downward pressure on pricing. With the lower labor utilization, lower pricing, the results are impacting Diesel Engine Services operating margins.
We continue to generate significant cash during the second quarter. Our EBITDA was $73 million for the quarter, and for the first six months were at $139 million. At June 30, we had $141 million in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. Our capital spending for the first six months has totaled $68 million, which includes $35 million for new tank barge and towboat construction and $33 million primarily for capital upgrades to the existing fleet. 
We did raise our capital spending guidance for 2010 to a range of $135 million to $145 million, and this includes $70 million for new tank barge and towboat construction. The increased capital spending guidance was primarily due to expected prepayments for 2011 new barge construction. 
In June, we contracted for the construction of 25 new 30,000-barrel barges for delivering in 2011. Our current plans are not to expand the fleet and to use these new barges to replace older equipment, which we will remove from service. New construction capital expenditures for 2011 are currently projected to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million, and that's based on the current commitments and current steel prices and current delivery schedules.
During the first half of 2010, we took delivery of 29 new 10,000-barrel tank barges, three 30,000-barrel barges and five new 10,000-barrel chartered tank barges. This added 462,000 barrels of new capacity. However, offsetting that, during the first half, we retired 40 tank barges, which reduced our overall capacity by 643,000 barrels. So net-net, our capacity declined 181,000 barrels during the first half. As of June 30, we operated 860 barges with a capacity of 16.5 million barrels, and this compares to our peak back in June of 2008 of 918 barges and a capacity of 17.5 million barrels. For the remainder of 2010, we will take delivery of 24 new 10,000-barrel barges and three 30,000-barrel barges which will add 336,000 barrels of new capacity. However, again, we continue and will continue to retire older tank barges from the fleet. 
During June 2010 and through the day before yesterday, we've purchased 171,000 shares of Kirby common stock at an average price of $39.30, and we did this under a 10b5-1 stock trading plan. The 10b5-1 program is applicable for our second, third and year end Kirby imposed blackout periods, and we currently have 1,230,000 shares remaining under our previously authorized share repurchase authorization. However, in July of this year, the board approved an additional 2 million share repurchase authorization, and that brings our total repurchase authorization to 3,230,000 shares. 
I'll now turn the call back to Joe."

Yesterday afternoon, we announced our 2010 third quarter guidance of $0.52 to $0.57 per share compared with $0.65 per share earned the same period the year before. For the year, we updated our guidance to $2.03 to $2.13. Our low end $0.52 per share third quarter guidance and the $2.03 per share year guidance assumes volumes and equipment utilization will remains stable with the volumes and utilization during the first half of this year, and term and spot contract rates will remain relatively flat. Now the high end of our guidance of $0.57 per share and for the third quarter and a $2.13 for the year assumes a modest improvement in volumes in the second half of the year and a continued reduction in the industry-wide excess tank barge capacity, leading to some improvement in pricing for both the term and contracts.
Both our low-end and high-end guidance assumes our Diesel Engine Service operation will continue to face challenges, particularly in that part of the business that services Gulf Coast Oil business. Now our challenge is to move pricing. Frankly, it's not so much volumes. It's the price that we can charge to move those volumes, that is the issue today. 
If utilization remains at current levels and the industry remains disciplined with respect to capacity and the market regains some confidence, pricing will occur. Confidence will be driven by seeing the economies stabilize during the second half of the year and when more clarity is seen with respect to the legislative and regulatory environment in Washington.  
Kirby remains in excellent financial shape. We've taken a significant amount of cost out of our business. We have a every strong balance sheet, low debt levels, favorable interest rates and cash on our balance sheet which should continue throughout this year. We remain in an excellent position to take advantage of both synergistic acquisitions, should they become available, and to repurchase our stock. We find ourselves in the enviable position of having a balance sheet fully capable of doing both, buying assets and buying stock.

Has something structurally changed with that business? Or is this just a function of the slowdown in the broader economy?

The moratorium on Gulf drilling is something that has to concern us. But even before that, there were declines. And the declines were principally in the high-speed business, which are more focused on the Oil service business. So you really saw a deterioration in drilling that was occurring even before the moratorium. Now what gave us hope was that most of our customers were forecasting increased levels of drilling in and around the Gulf Coast; principally because until the BP spill, the political environment was much more stable, and the ability to make money in drilling per -- the drilling in the Gulf of Mexico was more predictable. So the though was that, that part of the business would get stronger in the latter part of the year and continue to improve, which led us to assume that there really wasn't anything structurally going wrong. It was just really more of a matter of timing. Having said that, the moratorium clearly changes that, and we have to kind of step back and say, ""Where is that business going?"" One of the things that we are positioning ourselves to do, and we have done to a certain extent before, is to follow our customers overseas. That's going to be an important component to reverse the negative trends in that business. We have already reduced staffing in that business. We're down in excess of 20% in terms of headcount from the high several years ago. But to get it going back on track, something has to happen in the Oil Service business; either the moratorium gets lifted, we start drilling again; or we leverage our position in that business to move offshore."

There's certainly been other periods where you're concerned about going into a recession. But here, we're reportedly coming out of a recession. But we're just looking at so many changes that we really don't understand the implications to. And you have, coming out of this recession, very high unemployment. All of the traditional vehicles that were used to stimulate the economy have already been used. I don't want to play economist, but in kind of our simple world, the barge world, I think that the industry kind of looks at all this stuff and says, ""We don't know what's going to happen."" And when you don't have clarity with respect to what's going to happen, I think you tend to be more conservative. I actually think it's as simple as that. I think if we could get some clarity with respect to what's going to happen if utilization rates remain at these levels, that we should get some pricing. And you're seeing that in other parts of the economy. It just hasn't got to us yet. Now I'll also tell you that I think, at least with respect to Kirby, if you look at our performance over this period, it's been pretty stable. And the other thing to just remind the listeners is that our operating margins are north of 20%, and that in itself probably is remarkable. You would typically see more stress with respect to operating margins. We've been able to cost controls, just working hard to service our customers in a really flat-rate environment to continue hold the margins up. So to me, that's pretty positive. The last recession that we went into, the 2000 recession, I think the margins were down in the 14% range."

Yesterday, we reported 2010 second quarter net earnings of $0.54 a share compared to our 2009 second quarter net earnings of $0.63 per share.

Yesterday, we reported 2010 second quarter net earnings of $0.54 a share compared to our 2009 second quarter net earnings of $0.63 per share. Our announced earnings guidance for the second quarter was $0.52 to $0.57 per share. For the first six months of 2010, we earned $1 per share compared to $1.15 per share, same period a year before.
During the second quarter, our Marine Transportation demand and barge utilization were in line with the first quarter, above the comparable levels in 2009 and above frankly what we anticipated at the beginning of this year. Our barge utilization for the second quarter averaged in the mid to high-80% range, remaining above all four 2009 quarter levels. And we suspect our utilization level is, on average, better than the industry average. This improvement in demand and utilization was driven by modestly higher refinery and petrochemical outlet. The higher volumes were also driven by improved demand for export petrochemicals. U.S. petrochemicals continued to enjoy a feedstock advantage due to their relatively low natural gas costs compared to higher crude-based systems.
Increase in the second quarter Marine Transportation revenue was primarily due to higher diesel fuel prices, averaging 60% higher than the 2009 second quarter, as the higher fuel price is passed to customers through fuel escalation and de-escalation causes which are embedded in our term agreements. 
During the 2010 second quarter, the term contract portion of our revenue mix remained at 75%. That's 75% contracts, 25% in the spot market. Time charters represented a little better than 50% of total of term contracts during the quarter compared to about the same number last quarter. While some customers have switched to spot affreightment agreements when the time charter contracts expire, others have shortened their charter exposure, as we're not ready to take longer-term position on equipment at this time.
With modestly improved volumes and resulting higher barge utilization rates during the first half of the year, pricing has stabilized. This is encouraging. Unfortunately, there is still uncertainty with respect to the economy, sustainability of demand and equipment utilization, which is affecting the industry's appetite to test raising rates. 
Consequently, term contracts that were renewed during the second quarter were relatively flat with the first quarter renewals, but decreased, on average, 10% to 12% when compared with term contract rate renewals, second quarter of last year. Spot contract rates for the second quarter, which include the price of fuel, were up 2% to 3% compared with the first quarter, but down 10% to 15% when you compare them to the same period last year. 
With respect to our annual renewals effective January 1, 2010, on our multiyear issued contracts of over a year, the escalators were essentially neutral, not positive or negative. 
During the second quarter, our Diesel Engine Service segment saw continued weak service and parts sales and some pricing pressure, principally in the high-speed market, across marine markets, again, principally in the Gulf Coast area servicing the Oil Service business. 
As customers continued to defer major maintenance projects, our Gulf Coast high-speed market did see some modest benefit during the quarter from acquired repair service for customer's equipment involved in the Gulf Coast cleanup effort. But customers are generally just patching. They're not doing the kind of the long-term overhauls that really drive this business. 
The medium-speed power generation market continued to remain stable, but our second quarter results were impacted by fewer generator engine set upgrade projects and lower direct part sales. Pricing in this business continues to remain stable. 
Our Medium-speed Railroad business benefited from improved direct part sales, as utilization levels for our railroad customers improved slightly over the first half of the year.
With respect to the BP oil spill and its effect on our transportation sector, it really has been minimal. We have cleaned oil from only one tow operating in the inland waterwaste (sic) [wastewater] system since the beginning of the spill. And in our offshore operations, at most, we've sustained only minor increased transit times as we avoided oil slicks during Gulf crossings between Louisiana and Florida. We are aware of several of our competitors using some inland tank barges in the cleanup efforts. This certainly has helped the industry tank parts utilization during the quarter, but it hasn't been enough to improve pricing. 
Our Diesel Engine Service segment high-speed Gulf Coast operations, as I mentioned earlier, did benefit from required repairs to equipment used in the cleanup efforts. However, the moratorium on the deepwater drilling will impact companies servicing the Gulf Coast Oil and Gas business. Currently, about 20% to 25% of our Diesel Engine Service revenues are associated with the Gulf Coast Oil and Gas Drilling business, including both the shallow water and deepwater drilling. 
At this point, it's very difficult to know the future financial impact of this moratorium or, frankly, the effect of new regulations on drilling operators and what that effect is going to mean for diesel engine service sector. 
I'll come back at the end of our prepared remarks and talk about our forecast for the third quarter and the full year outlook. But I'll now turn the call over to David."

Let me provide a few more details on the quarter. Kirby's Marine Transportation revenue was 6% above and operating income 7% below the second quarter of 2009. The segment's operating margin was 21.6% compared with 24.4% from the prior year",670,"Thank you, Joe. Let me provide a few more details on the quarter. Kirby's Marine Transportation revenue was 6% above and operating income 7% below the second quarter of 2009. The segment's operating margin was 21.6% compared with 24.4% from the prior year period. The lower margin reflected the impact of lower term and spot contract pricing throughout the last three quarters of 2009 and the first half of 2010. Higher fuel prices and increased delay days also impacted margins. Partially offsetting this was the benefit of the ongoing cost-reduction efforts and efficiency initiatives that we implemented throughout 2009 and the early part of 2010. So year-over-year, pricing and margins are down, but pricing is stabilizing, as Joe mentioned, and margins have improved sequentially from the first quarter. 
In the Diesel Engine Services business, revenue was 21%, income 45% below last year's second quarter. The operating margin was 9.5% compared with 13.6% reported in the second quarter of last year. The lower results in margins primarily reflected the continued weak Gulf Coast oil service high-speed markets, as Joe mentioned, as customers defer major maintenance projects. 
We were also affected by fewer engine generator set upgrades and lower direct parts sales in the Power Generation market. The lower industry-wide business activity is placing some downward pressure on pricing. With the lower labor utilization, lower pricing, the results are impacting Diesel Engine Services operating margins.
We continue to generate significant cash during the second quarter. Our EBITDA was $73 million for the quarter, and for the first six months were at $139 million. At June 30, we had $141 million in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. Our capital spending for the first six months has totaled $68 million, which includes $35 million for new tank barge and towboat construction and $33 million primarily for capital upgrades to the existing fleet. 
We did raise our capital spending guidance for 2010 to a range of $135 million to $145 million, and this includes $70 million for new tank barge and towboat construction. The increased capital spending guidance was primarily due to expected prepayments for 2011 new barge construction. 
In June, we contracted for the construction of 25 new 30,000-barrel barges for delivering in 2011. Our current plans are not to expand the fleet and to use these new barges to replace older equipment, which we will remove from service. New construction capital expenditures for 2011 are currently projected to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million, and that's based on the current commitments and current steel prices and current delivery schedules.
During the first half of 2010, we took delivery of 29 new 10,000-barrel tank barges, three 30,000-barrel barges and five new 10,000-barrel chartered tank barges. This added 462,000 barrels of new capacity. However, offsetting that, during the first half, we retired 40 tank barges, which reduced our overall capacity by 643,000 barrels. So net-net, our capacity declined 181,000 barrels during the first half. As of June 30, we operated 860 barges with a capacity of 16.5 million barrels, and this compares to our peak back in June of 2008 of 918 barges and a capacity of 17.5 million barrels. For the remainder of 2010, we will take delivery of 24 new 10,000-barrel barges and three 30,000-barrel barges which will add 336,000 barrels of new capacity. However, again, we continue and will continue to retire older tank barges from the fleet. 
During June 2010 and through the day before yesterday, we've purchased 171,000 shares of Kirby common stock at an average price of $39.30, and we did this under a 10b5-1 stock trading plan. The 10b5-1 program is applicable for our second, third and year end Kirby imposed blackout periods, and we currently have 1,230,000 shares remaining under our previously authorized share repurchase authorization. However, in July of this year, the board approved an additional 2 million share repurchase authorization, and that brings our total repurchase authorization to 3,230,000 shares. 
I'll now turn the call back to Joe."

Yesterday afternoon, we announced our 2010 third quarter guidance of $0.52 to $0.57 per share compared with $0.65 per share earned the same period the year before. For the year, we updated our guidance to $2.03 to $2.13. Our low end $0.52 per share third quarter guidance and the $2.03 per share year guidance assumes volumes and equipment utilization will remains stable with the volumes and utilization during the first half of this year, and term and spot contract rates will remain relatively flat. Now the high end of our guidance of $0.57 per share and for the third quarter and a $2.13 for the year assumes a modest improvement in volumes in the second half of the year and a continued reduction in the industry-wide excess tank barge capacity, leading to some improvement in pricing for both the term and contracts.
Both our low-end and high-end guidance assumes our Diesel Engine Service operation will continue to face challenges, particularly in that part of the business that services Gulf Coast Oil business. Now our challenge is to move pricing. Frankly, it's not so much volumes. It's the price that we can charge to move those volumes, that is the issue today. 
If utilization remains at current levels and the industry remains disciplined with respect to capacity and the market regains some confidence, pricing will occur. Confidence will be driven by seeing the economies stabilize during the second half of the year and when more clarity is seen with respect to the legislative and regulatory environment in Washington.  
Kirby remains in excellent financial shape. We've taken a significant amount of cost out of our business. We have a every strong balance sheet, low debt levels, favorable interest rates and cash on our balance sheet which should continue throughout this year. We remain in an excellent position to take advantage of both synergistic acquisitions, should they become available, and to repurchase our stock. We find ourselves in the enviable position of having a balance sheet fully capable of doing both, buying assets and buying stock.

The moratorium on Gulf drilling is something that has to concern us. But even before that, there were declines. And the declines were principally in the high-speed business, which are more focused on the Oil service business. So you really saw a deterioration in drilling that was occurring even before the moratorium. Now what gave us hope was that most of our customers were forecasting increased levels of drilling in and around the Gulf Coast; principally because until the BP spill, the political environment was much more stable, and the ability to make money in drilling per -- the drilling in the Gulf of Mexico was more predictable. So the though was that, that part of the business would get stronger in the latter part of the year and continue to improve, which led us to assume that there really wasn't anything structurally going wrong. It was just really more of a matter of timing. Having said that, the moratorium clearly changes that, and we have to kind of step back and say, ""Where is that business going?"" One of the things that we are positioning ourselves to do, and we have done to a certain extent before, is to follow our customers overseas. That's going to be an important component to reverse the negative trends in that business. We have already reduced staffing in that business. We're down in excess of 20% in terms of headcount from the high several years ago. But to get it going back on track, something has to happen in the Oil Service business; either the moratorium gets lifted, we start drilling again; or we leverage our position in that business to move offshore."

Yesterday, we reported 2010 second quarter net earnings of $0.54 a share compared to our 2009 second quarter net earnings of $0.63 per share. Our announced earnings guidance for the second quarter was $0.52 to $0.57 per share. For",867,"Okay. Thank you, Steve. Yesterday, we reported 2010 second quarter net earnings of $0.54 a share compared to our 2009 second quarter net earnings of $0.63 per share. Our announced earnings guidance for the second quarter was $0.52 to $0.57 per share. For the first six months of 2010, we earned $1 per share compared to $1.15 per share, same period the year before.
During the second quarter, our Marine Transportation demand and barge utilization were in line with the first quarter, above the comparable levels in 2009 and above frankly what we anticipated at the beginning of this year. Our barge utilization for the second quarter averaged in the mid- to high-80% range, remaining above all four 2009 quarter levels. And we suspect our utilization level is, on average, better than the industry average. This improvement in demand and utilization was driven by modestly higher refinery and petrochemical outlet. The higher volumes were also driven by improved demand for export petrochemicals. U.S. petrochemicals continued to enjoy a feedstock advantage due to their relatively low natural gas costs compared to higher crude-based systems.
Increase in the second quarter Marine Transportation revenue was primarily due to higher diesel fuel prices, averaging 60% higher than the 2009 second quarter, as the higher fuel price is passed to customers through fuel escalation and de-escalation clauses which were embedded in our term agreements. 
During the 2010 second quarter, the term contract portion of our revenue mix remained at 75%. That's 75% contracts, 25% in the spot market. Time charters represented a little better than 50% of total term contracts during the quarter compared to about the same number last quarter. While some customers have switched to spot affreightment agreements when the time charter contracts expire, others have shortened their charter exposure, as they're not ready to take longer-term position on equipment at this time.
With modestly improved volumes and resulting higher barge utilization rates during the first half of the year, pricing has stabilized. This is encouraging. Unfortunately, there is still uncertainty with respect to the economy, sustainability of demand and equipment utilization, which is affecting the industry's appetite to test raising rates. 
Consequently, term contracts that were renewed during the second quarter were relatively flat with the first quarter renewals, but decreased, on average, 10% to 12% when compared with term contract rate renewals, second quarter of last year. Spot contract rates for the second quarter, which include the price of fuel, were up 2% to 3% compared with the first quarter, but down 10% to 15% when you compare them to the same period last year. 
With respect to our annual renewals effective January 1, 2010, on our multiyear contracts – these are contracts of over a year, the escalators were essentially neutral, not positive or negative. 
During the second quarter, our Diesel Engine Services segment saw continued weak service and parts sales and some pricing pressure, principally in the high-speed market, across marine markets, again, principally in the Gulf Coast area servicing the Oil Service business. 
As customers continued to defer major maintenance projects, our Gulf Coast high-speed market did see some modest benefit during the quarter from acquired repair service for customer's equipment involved in the Gulf Coast cleanup effort. But customers are generally just patching. They're not doing the, kind of, the long-term overhauls that really drive this business. 
The medium-speed power generation market continued to remain stable, but our second quarter results were impacted by fewer generator engine set upgrade projects and lower direct part sales. Pricing in this business continues to remain stable. 
Our medium-speed railroad business benefited from improved direct part sales, as utilization levels for our railroad customers improved slightly over the first half of the year.
With respect to the BP oil spill and its effect on our transportation sector, it really has been minimal. We have cleaned oil from only one tow operating in the inland waterway system since the beginning of the spill. And in our offshore operations, at most, we've sustained only minor increased transit times as we avoided oil slicks during Gulf crossings between Louisiana and Florida. We are aware of several of our competitors using some inland tank barges in the cleanup efforts. This certainly has helped industry tank parts utilization during the quarter, but it hasn't been enough to improve pricing. 
Our Diesel Engine Services segment high-speed Gulf Coast operations, as I mentioned earlier, did benefit from required repairs to equipment used in the cleanup efforts. However, the moratorium on the deepwater drilling will impact companies servicing the Gulf Coast oil and gas business. Currently, about 20% to 25% of our Diesel Engine Services revenues are associated with the Gulf Coast oil and gas drilling business, including both the shallow water and deepwater drilling. 
At this point, it's very difficult to know the future financial impact of this moratorium or, frankly, the effect of new regulations on drilling operators and what that effect is going to mean for Diesel Engine Services sector. 
I'll come back at the end of our prepared remarks and talk about our forecast for the third quarter and the full year outlook. But I'll now turn the call over to David."

Let me provide a few more details on the quarter. Kirby's Marine Transportation revenue was 6% above and operating income 7% below the second quarter of 2009. The segment's operating margin was 21.6% compared with 24.4% from the prior year",668,"Thank you, Joe. Let me provide a few more details on the quarter. Kirby's Marine Transportation revenue was 6% above and operating income 7% below the second quarter of 2009. The segment's operating margin was 21.6% compared with 24.4% from the prior year period. The lower margin reflected the impact of lower term and spot contract pricing throughout the last three quarters of 2009 and the first half of 2010. Higher fuel prices and increased delay days also impacted margins. Partially offsetting this was the benefit of the ongoing cost-reduction efforts and efficiency initiatives that we implemented throughout 2009 and the early part of 2010. So year-over-year, pricing and margins are down, but pricing is stabilizing, as Joe mentioned, and margins have improved sequentially from the first quarter. 
In the Diesel Engine Services business, revenue was 21%, income 45% below last year's second quarter. The operating margin was 9.5% compared with 13.6% reported in the second quarter of last year. The lower results in margins primarily reflected the continued weak Gulf Coast oil service high-speed markets, as Joe mentioned, as customers defer major maintenance projects. 
We were also affected by fewer engine generator set upgrades and lower direct parts sales in the Power Generation market. The lower industry-wide business activity is placing some downward pressure on pricing. With the lower labor utilization, lower pricing, the results are impacting Diesel Engine Services’ operating margins.
We continue to generate significant cash during the second quarter. Our EBITDA was $73 million for the quarter, and for the first six months we’re at $139 million. At June 30, we had $141 million in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. Our capital spending for the first six months has totaled $68 million, which includes $35 million for new tank barge and towboat construction and $33 million primarily for capital upgrades to the existing fleet. 
We did raise our capital spending guidance for 2010 to a range of $135 million to $145 million, and this includes $70 million for new tank barge and towboat construction. The increased capital spending guidance was primarily due to expected prepayments for 2011 new barge construction. 
In June, we contracted for the construction of 25 new 30,000-barrel barges for delivery in 2011. Our current plans are not to expand the fleet and to use these new barges to replace older equipment, which we will remove from service. New construction capital expenditures for 2011 are currently projected to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million, and that's based on the current commitments and current steel prices and current delivery schedules.
During the first half of 2010, we took delivery of 29 new 10,000-barrel tank barges, three 30,000-barrel barges and five new 10,000-barrel chartered tank barges. This added 462,000 barrels of new capacity. However, offsetting that, during the first half, we retired 40 tank barges, which reduced our overall capacity by 643,000 barrels. So net-net, our capacity declined 181,000 barrels during the first half. As of June 30, we operated 860 barges with a capacity of 16.5 million barrels, and this compares to our peak back in June of 2008 of 918 barges and a capacity of 17.5 million barrels. For the remainder of 2010, we will take delivery of 24 new 10,000-barrel barges and three 30,000-barrel barges which will add 336,000 barrels of new capacity. However, again, we continue and will continue to retire older tank barges from the fleet. 
During June 2010 and through the day before yesterday, we've purchased 171,000 shares of Kirby common stock at an average price of $39.30, and we did this under a 10b5-1 stock trading plan. The 10b5-1 program is applicable for our second, third and year-end Kirby-imposed blackout periods, and we currently have 1,230,000 shares remaining under our previously authorized share repurchase authorization. However, in July of this year, the board approved an additional 2 million share repurchase authorization, and that brings our total repurchase authorization to 3,230,000 shares. 
I'll now turn the call back to Joe."

Yesterday afternoon, we announced our 2010 third quarter guidance of $0.52 to $0.57 per share compared with $0.65 per share earned same period the year before. For the year, we updated our guidance to $2.03 to $2.13. Our low-end $0.52 per share third quarter guidance and the $2.03 per share year guidance assumes volumes and equipment utilization will remain stable with the volumes and utilization during the first half of this year, and term and spot contract rates will remain relatively flat. The high end of our guidance of $0.57 per share for the third quarter and the $2.13 for the year assumes a modest improvement in volumes in the second half of the year and a continued reduction in the industry-wide excess tank barge capacity, leading to some improvement in pricing for both the term and contracts.
Both our low-end and high-end guidance assumes our Diesel Engine Services operation will continue to face challenges, particularly in that part of the business that services Gulf Coast oil business. Now our challenge is to move pricing. Frankly, it's not so much volumes. It's the price that we can charge to move those volumes, that is the issue today. 
If utilization remains at current levels and the industry remains disciplined with respect to capacity and the market regains some confidence, pricing will occur. Confidence will be driven by seeing the economies stabilize during the second half of the year and when more clarity is seen with respect to the legislative and regulatory environment in Washington.  
Kirby remains in excellent financial shape. We've taken a significant amount of cost out of our business. We have a very strong balance sheet, low debt levels, favorable interest rates and cash on our balance sheet, which should continue throughout this year. We remain in an excellent position to take advantage of both synergistic acquisitions, should they become available, and to repurchase our stock. We find ourselves in the enviable position of having a balance sheet fully capable of doing both, buying assets and buying stock.

The moratorium on Gulf drilling is something that has to concern us. But even before that, there were declines. And the declines were principally in the high-speed business, which are more focused on the oil service business. So you really saw a deterioration in drilling that was occurring even before the moratorium. Now what gave us hope was that most of our customers were forecasting increased levels of drilling in and around the Gulf Coast; principally because until the BP spill, the political environment was much more stable, and the ability to make money drilling for -- drilling in the Gulf of Mexico was more predictable. So the thought was that, that part of the business would get stronger in the latter part of the year and continue to improve, which led us to assume that there really wasn't anything structurally going wrong. It was just really more of a matter of timing. Having said that, the moratorium clearly changes that, and we have to kind of step back and say, ""Where is that business going?"" One of the things that we are positioning ourselves to do, and we have done to a certain extent before, is to follow our customers overseas. That's going to be an important component to reverse the negative trends in that business. We have already reduced the staffing in that business. We're down in excess of 20% in terms of headcount from the high several years ago. But to get it going back on track, something has to happen in the oil service business; either the moratorium gets lifted, we start drilling again; or we leverage our position in that business to move offshore."

Yesterday, we reported 2010 second quarter net earnings of $0.54 a share compared to our 2009 second quarter net earnings of $0.63 per share. Our announced earnings guidance for the second quarter was $0.52 to $0.57 per share. For",867,"Okay. Thank you, Steve. Yesterday, we reported 2010 second quarter net earnings of $0.54 a share compared to our 2009 second quarter net earnings of $0.63 per share. Our announced earnings guidance for the second quarter was $0.52 to $0.57 per share. For the first six months of 2010, we earned $1 per share compared to $1.15 per share, same period the year before.
During the second quarter, our Marine Transportation demand and barge utilization were in line with the first quarter, above the comparable levels in 2009 and above frankly what we anticipated at the beginning of this year. Our barge utilization for the second quarter averaged in the mid- to high-80% range, remaining above all four 2009 quarter levels. And we suspect our utilization level is, on average, better than the industry average. This improvement in demand and utilization was driven by modestly higher refinery and petrochemical outlet. The higher volumes were also driven by improved demand for export petrochemicals. U.S. petrochemicals continued to enjoy a feedstock advantage due to their relatively low natural gas costs compared to higher crude-based systems.
Increase in the second quarter Marine Transportation revenue was primarily due to higher diesel fuel prices, averaging 60% higher than the 2009 second quarter, as the higher fuel price is passed to customers through fuel escalation and de-escalation clauses which were embedded in our term agreements. 
During the 2010 second quarter, the term contract portion of our revenue mix remained at 75%. That's 75% contracts, 25% in the spot market. Time charters represented a little better than 50% of total term contracts during the quarter compared to about the same number last quarter. While some customers have switched to spot affreightment agreements when the time charter contracts expire, others have shortened their charter exposure, as they're not ready to take longer-term position on equipment at this time.
With modestly improved volumes and resulting higher barge utilization rates during the first half of the year, pricing has stabilized. This is encouraging. Unfortunately, there is still uncertainty with respect to the economy, sustainability of demand and equipment utilization, which is affecting the industry's appetite to test raising rates. 
Consequently, term contracts that were renewed during the second quarter were relatively flat with the first quarter renewals, but decreased, on average, 10% to 12% when compared with term contract rate renewals, second quarter of last year. Spot contract rates for the second quarter, which include the price of fuel, were up 2% to 3% compared with the first quarter, but down 10% to 15% when you compare them to the same period last year. 
With respect to our annual renewals effective January 1, 2010, on our multiyear contracts – these are contracts of over a year, the escalators were essentially neutral, not positive or negative. 
During the second quarter, our Diesel Engine Services segment saw continued weak service and parts sales and some pricing pressure, principally in the high-speed market, across marine markets, again, principally in the Gulf Coast area servicing the Oil Service business. 
As customers continued to defer major maintenance projects, our Gulf Coast high-speed market did see some modest benefit during the quarter from acquired repair service for customer's equipment involved in the Gulf Coast cleanup effort. But customers are generally just patching. They're not doing the, kind of, the long-term overhauls that really drive this business. 
The medium-speed power generation market continued to remain stable, but our second quarter results were impacted by fewer generator engine set upgrade projects and lower direct part sales. Pricing in this business continues to remain stable. 
Our medium-speed railroad business benefited from improved direct part sales, as utilization levels for our railroad customers improved slightly over the first half of the year.
With respect to the BP oil spill and its effect on our transportation sector, it really has been minimal. We have cleaned oil from only one tow operating in the inland waterway system since the beginning of the spill. And in our offshore operations, at most, we've sustained only minor increased transit times as we avoided oil slicks during Gulf crossings between Louisiana and Florida. We are aware of several of our competitors using some inland tank barges in the cleanup efforts. This certainly has helped industry tank parts utilization during the quarter, but it hasn't been enough to improve pricing. 
Our Diesel Engine Services segment high-speed Gulf Coast operations, as I mentioned earlier, did benefit from required repairs to equipment used in the cleanup efforts. However, the moratorium on the deepwater drilling will impact companies servicing the Gulf Coast oil and gas business. Currently, about 20% to 25% of our Diesel Engine Services revenues are associated with the Gulf Coast oil and gas drilling business, including both the shallow water and deepwater drilling. 
At this point, it's very difficult to know the future financial impact of this moratorium or, frankly, the effect of new regulations on drilling operators and what that effect is going to mean for Diesel Engine Services sector. 
I'll come back at the end of our prepared remarks and talk about our forecast for the third quarter and the full year outlook. But I'll now turn the call over to David."

Kirby's Marine Transportation revenue was 6% above and operating income 7% below the second quarter of 2009. The segment's operating margin was 21.6% compared with 24.4% from the prior year period.

Higher fuel prices and increased delay days also impacted margins. Partially offsetting this was the benefit of the ongoing cost-reduction efforts and efficiency initiatives that we implemented throughout 2009 and the early part of 2010. So year-over-year, pricing and margins are down, but pricing is stabilizing, as Joe mentioned, and margins have improved sequentially from the first quarter. 
In the Diesel Engine Services business, revenue was 21%, income 45% below last year's second quarter. The operating margin was 9.5% compared with 13.6% reported in the second quarter of last year. The lower results in margins primarily reflected the continued weak Gulf Coast oil service high-speed markets, as Joe mentioned, as customers defer major maintenance projects. 
We were also affected by fewer engine generator set upgrades and lower direct parts sales in the Power Generation market. The lower industry-wide business activity is placing some downward pressure on pricing. With the lower labor utilization, lower pricing, the results are impacting Diesel Engine Services’ operating margins.
We continue to generate significant cash during the second quarter. Our EBITDA was $73 million for the quarter, and for the first six months we’re at $139 million. At June 30, we had $141 million in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. Our capital spending for the first six months has totaled $68 million, which includes $35 million for new tank barge and towboat construction and $33 million primarily for capital upgrades to the existing fleet. 
We did raise our capital spending guidance for 2010 to a range of $135 million to $145 million, and this includes $70 million for new tank barge and towboat construction. The increased capital spending guidance was primarily due to expected prepayments for 2011 new barge construction. 
In June, we contracted for the construction of 25 new 30,000-barrel barges for delivery in 2011. Our current plans are not to expand the fleet and to use these new barges to replace older equipment, which we will remove from service. New construction capital expenditures for 2011 are currently projected to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million, and that's based on the current commitments and current steel prices and current delivery schedules.
During the first half of 2010, we took delivery of 29 new 10,000-barrel tank barges, three 30,000-barrel barges and five new 10,000-barrel chartered tank barges. This added 462,000 barrels of new capacity. However, offsetting that, during the first half, we retired 40 tank barges, which reduced our overall capacity by 643,000 barrels. So net-net, our capacity declined 181,000 barrels during the first half. As of June 30, we operated 860 barges with a capacity of 16.5 million barrels, and this compares to our peak back in June of 2008 of 918 barges and a capacity of 17.5 million barrels. For the remainder of 2010, we will take delivery of 24 new 10,000-barrel barges and three 30,000-barrel barges which will add 336,000 barrels of new capacity. However, again, we continue and will continue to retire older tank barges from the fleet. 
During June 2010 and through the day before yesterday, we've purchased 171,000 shares of Kirby common stock at an average price of $39.30, and we did this under a 10b5-1 stock trading plan. The 10b5-1 program is applicable for our second, third and year-end Kirby-imposed blackout periods, and we currently have 1,230,000 shares remaining under our previously authorized share repurchase authorization. However, in July of this year, the board approved an additional 2 million share repurchase authorization, and that brings our total repurchase authorization to 3,230,000 shares. 
I'll now turn the call back to Joe."

Yesterday afternoon, we announced our 2010 third quarter guidance of $0.52 to $0.57 per share compared with $0.65 per share earned same period the year before. For the year, we updated our guidance to $2.03 to $2.13. Our low-end $0.52 per share third quarter guidance and the $2.03 per share year guidance assumes volumes and equipment utilization will remain stable with the volumes and utilization during the first half of this year, and term and spot contract rates will remain relatively flat. The high end of our guidance of $0.57 per share for the third quarter and the $2.13 for the year assumes a modest improvement in volumes in the second half of the year and a continued reduction in the industry-wide excess tank barge capacity, leading to some improvement in pricing for both the term and contracts.
Both our low-end and high-end guidance assumes our Diesel Engine Services operation will continue to face challenges, particularly in that part of the business that services Gulf Coast oil business. Now our challenge is to move pricing. Frankly, it's not so much volumes. It's the price that we can charge to move those volumes, that is the issue today. 
If utilization remains at current levels and the industry remains disciplined with respect to capacity and the market regains some confidence, pricing will occur. Confidence will be driven by seeing the economies stabilize during the second half of the year and when more clarity is seen with respect to the legislative and regulatory environment in Washington.  
Kirby remains in excellent financial shape. We've taken a significant amount of cost out of our business. We have a very strong balance sheet, low debt levels, favorable interest rates and cash on our balance sheet, which should continue throughout this year. We remain in an excellent position to take advantage of both synergistic acquisitions, should they become available, and to repurchase our stock. We find ourselves in the enviable position of having a balance sheet fully capable of doing both, buying assets and buying stock.

The moratorium on Gulf drilling is something that has to concern us. But even before that, there were declines. And the declines were principally in the high-speed business, which are more focused on the oil service business. So you really saw a deterioration in drilling that was occurring even before the moratorium. Now what gave us hope was that most of our customers were forecasting increased levels of drilling in and around the Gulf Coast; principally because until the BP spill, the political environment was much more stable, and the ability to make money drilling for -- drilling in the Gulf of Mexico was more predictable. So the thought was that, that part of the business would get stronger in the latter part of the year and continue to improve, which led us to assume that there really wasn't anything structurally going wrong. It was just really more of a matter of timing. Having said that, the moratorium clearly changes that, and we have to kind of step back and say, ""Where is that business going?"" One of the things that we are positioning ourselves to do, and we have done to a certain extent before, is to follow our customers overseas. That's going to be an important component to reverse the negative trends in that business. We have already reduced the staffing in that business. We're down in excess of 20% in terms of headcount from the high several years ago. But to get it going back on track, something has to happen in the oil service business; either the moratorium gets lifted, we start drilling again; or we leverage our position in that business to move offshore."

All of the traditional vehicles that were used to stimulate the economy have already been used. I don't want to play economist, but in kind of our simple world, the barge world, I think that the industry kind of looks at all this stuff and says, ""We don't know what's going to happen."" And when you don't have clarity with respect to what's going to happen, I think you tend to be more conservative. I actually think it's as simple as that.

Now I'll also tell you that I think, at least with respect to Kirby, if you look at our performance over this period, it's been pretty stable. And the other thing to just remind the listeners is that our operating margins are north of 20%, and that in itself probably is remarkable. You would typically see more stress with respect to operating margins. We've been able through cost controls and just working hard to service our customers in a really flat-rate environment to continue to hold our margins up. So to me, that's pretty positive.

As Steve noted, Greg is the President of Kirby Inland Marine, our tank barge company. Greg will give you some additional color on the transportation sector. Yesterday evening, we reported our third quarter results earning $0.57 per share compared to the third quarter of 2009 net earnings of $0.65 per share. 
For the first nine months of this year, we earned $1.56 per share compared with $1.79 per share for the first nine months of last year. The $0.57 per share third quarter results were it was at the high end of our guidance range, which we published at the beginning of the quarter, $0.52 to $0.57. 
Since the beginning of 2010, the U.S. petrochemical industry has seen a steady improvement in production. This improvement and the U.S refinery anomalies, we'll come back and talk about those a little later, had allowed Kirby to maintain equivalent utilization levels in the high 80% range in our petrochemical and black oil markets during the second and third quarters of this year. These two markets comprise approximately 87% of what we do, and it's good to have them strong.
As anticipated in our third quarter guidance, our diesel engine service segment results continued to struggle a little bit with weak service in direct port sales in the majority of our Marine markets particularly in the Gulf Coast oil service market. This was partially offset by a good third quarter in the Power Generation business. I'm going now turn the call over to Greg to recap the Marine sector for the third quarter"

During the 2010 third quarter, our overall Marine Transportation demand was stable and barge utilization levels remained n the 85% to 90% range above all four 2009 quarters and above what we anticipated at the beginning of 2010. We continue to believe that, on the average, our utilization is slightly better than the industry's average. Low domestic natural gas prices have improved the global competitiveness for your U.S. petrochemical producers. This has increased transportation volumes for basic petrochemicals to both domestic consumers and internationals. Volumes helped to maintain our petrochemical fleet at high 80% utilization levels. Additionally, a heavy refinery maintenance in the third quarter, which required an additional shipments between refineries was coupled with exportation of heavy fuel oil to South America and the Pacific Rim, which helped to maintain our black oil fleet also at 80% utilization levels.
Revenue from term contracts delivered approximately 75% of third quarter revenue, consistent with the second quarter and as previously noted, during 2009, some customers switched from time charters to a freight contracts as our time charters expired. This shift stabilized during the first quarter of 2010. And during the third quarter, revenue from time charter was consistent with the first two quarters of the year at approximately 50%. With respect to pricing, Kirby's term contract renewals bottomed out in the third quarter of 2009 and have remained flat since. Accordingly, renewals in the 2010 third quarter was consistent with our second quarter renewals. Spot contract rates for the third quarter, which included the price of fuel, were flat to slightly positive when compared with the 2010 second quarter. And as previously stated, our annual escalators, effective January 1, 2010, for labor and EPI producer price index on our multiyear contracts were neutral. I'll now turn the call back to Joe to discuss the Diesel Engine Services operation."

Now the thin",321,"Thank you, Greg. With respect to the diesel engine side of our business, this segment saw soft service and direct port sales across the majority of our Marine transportation markets, as customers continued to defer major maintenance projects. Now the thing about deferred maintenance is that ultimately it represents a pretty good backlog, so it's going to need to be done at some point. Our Gulf Coast high-speed market continued to see lower utilization and some pricing pressure as a result of a number of things that were occurring along the Gulf Coast but principally the moratorium. As in the second quarter, the high-speed market did benefit modestly from required repair work to customers' equipment involved in the cleanup effort, but the more extensive overhauls were deferred. Moratorium on deep border drilling negatively impacted the company's business in this area both for the high-speed side of the business and the medium-speed side of the business.  
Historically, 20% to 25% of the business that this engine group performs is associated with the Gulf Coast Oil Service business and that includes both the shallow water side and the deep water side. Even though the moratorium was lifted in mid-October, new safety regulations that affect the drilling operations are being issued or in some cases not issued yet and it's going to take some time to digest them and to understand how it affects the business. 
Having said that, the business, we believe, should begin a slow process of returning to normal levels once these new rules are understood. 
During the third quarter, the medium-speed power generation market benefited from a generator set upgrade projects and higher engine and parts sales. I'm going to come back at the end of our prepared remarks and talk about our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year. But first I want to turn the call over to David to go over the financial results."

Let me provide a few details on margins and CapEx and a number of other items. Kirby's Marine Transportation revenue was 2% above and operating income 11% below the 2009 third quarter. The segment's operating margin",778,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Let me provide a few details on margins and CapEx and a number of other items. Kirby's Marine Transportation revenue was 2% above and operating income 11% below the 2009 third quarter. The segment's operating margin was 22.1% compared with 25.3% for the 2009 third quarter. The lower margin reflected the continued impact of lower term and spot contract pricing that has rolled through. The lower margin also reflects the effective higher fuel prices and increased delay base, which we saw in the quarter. These were partially offset with the ongoing cost-reduction efforts and efficiency efforts that we started throughout 2009 and part of 2010.
So year-over-year, margins are down but both term and spot contract pricing have stabilized and the 2010 margins have continued to improve. They were 19.3% in the first quarter, 21.6% in the second quarter and then 22.1% in this quarter. However, the margin in the fourth quarter will likely be down slightly from this quarter due to the normal seasonal impact related to weather and some scheduled lock repairs.
On the Diesel Engine Service side, revenue was 9% above and operating income was 3% below last year's third quarter. The operating margin was 9.3% compared with 10.4% reported in the 2009 third quarter. The higher revenue reflected stronger power generation market, partially offset by the weakness in the Gulf Coast oil services market that Joe mentioned. The 3% decrease in operating income was a result of lower service and direct part sales in the marine markets, some lower pricing in the high-speed marine market related to the oil service environment and lower overall labor utilization.
On the corporate side, we continue to generate significant cash during the 2010 third quarter and the first nine months with EBITDA at $77 million for the quarter and $216 million for the first nine months. At September 30, we had $149 million in cash on the balance sheet. Our capital spending for the first nine months totaled $108 million, which included $60 million for new tank barges and towboats and $48 million for capital upgrades to the existing fleet. During the 2010 first nine months, we took delivery of 45 new 10,000-barrel tank barges, three 30,000-barrel tank barges and five new 10,000-barrel chartered barges, adding about 637,000 barrels of new capacity. However, also during this same time period, we retired 64 tank barges and returned a couple chartered barges, which reduced our overall capacity about 1,014,000. So net-net, our capacity declined 377,000 barrels during the first nine months of this year. 
As of September 30, we now operate 850 tank barges with a capacity of 16.4 million barrels and this compares to the peak back in 2008 of 918 barges and 17.5 million barrels of capacity. 
During the fourth quarter, we plan to take delivery of eight new 10,000-barrel barges and two 30,000-barrel barges, adding 140,000 barrels of new capacity. But we'll continue to retire older tank barges from the fleet. Our capital spending guidance for 2010 remains unchanged at $135 million to $145 million. It includes approximately $70 million for construction of 58 tank barges, three towboats and some prepayments on 2011 barge construction. New construction capital expenditures for 2011 are currently projected in the $50 million to $60 million range and that's on top of our normal $70 million maintenance CapEx. The $50 million to $60 million amount for 2011 is based on our current commitments for 31 new tank barges that should be delivered throughout 2011. Our current plans are not to expand the fleet and to use these new barges to replace older equipment that we plan to remove from service. So going forward, we expect our barrel capacity to remain flat with additions equaling retirements. However, this replacement program has had a good impact on our fleet age and since the end of 2007 through today, our average fleet age has fallen around 3.5 years. The fleet age should continue to improve as we continue our replacement program.
Moving out to share repurchases. Through June, from June to October 26, we repurchased 615,000 shares of Kirby stock at an average price of $38.47. The shares were purchased through a combination of open market purchases and a stock trading plan that we entered into with a brokerage firm pursuant to Rule 10b5-1. The 10b5-1 program is applicable for our 2010 second, third and year-end Kirby-imposed blackout periods that usually precede our earnings press releases. Effective November 1, at the end of our third quarter blackout period, we will have 2,086,000 shares remaining under our share authorization. That concludes my comments. I'll turn the call back to Joe."

Yesterday afternoon, we announced our 2010 fourth quarter guidance range of $0.52 to $0.57 per share. This compares with $0.54 per share we reported same period last year but those results included a $0.5 per share charge for a combination of things: shore staff reductions, an impairment charge and adding back a previously booked reserve for a doubtful account. For the year, for this year, we updated our guidance to $2.08 to $2.13 a share. For the fourth quarter, we're forecasting that overall equipment utilization levels will remain consistent with the third quarter, in the mid- to high-80% range. And pricing will also remain in line with the third quarter. Our guidance assumes that the petrochemical market will continue to remain strong based on low natural gas prices as they compare with other feedstock prices. In addition, our guidance assumes that the Gulf Coast refinery utilization will also be stable during the quarter. That being said, the difference between the low end of the guidance and the high end is principally whether we have other navigating delays. As those who have listened to our calls for a number of years know that the fourth quarter is the most weather-impacted quarter, the upper river system is impacted typically by ice and sometimes low water conditions. On the lower end of the system and in the Canal, it's impacted by frontal systems that cause high winds and fog. There are also several scheduled lock repairs during the quarter which will have some impact on efficiency. Both the high-end and low-end guidance assumes that the Diesel Engine business is going to be about the same as it was in the third quarter.
Briefly looking into next year, I think that Kirby and frankly the industry challenges to be able to move pricing forward. Based on the current strength of the petrochemical industry, what we believe are higher industry utilization levels and continued industry discipline with respect to tank barge capacity, we do believe that the environment for better pricing is better today than certainly it was in the last six months. We think there are some modest improvement in the industry's view of 2011. I think there was a general kind of umbrella concern for maybe negative GDP growth in 2011. I think that this is diminishing. And as it diminishes, I think it improves confidence levels. This, combined with what we typically see in the fourth quarter, the higher utilization driven by weather, principally should all help the pricing environment. Kirby, I want to make I guess a general comment on just Kirby, Kirby is in excellent financial shape. We've taken some significant costs out of our business model. Our transportation margins remain above 20%, which in itself is quite an accomplishment. The Diesel business is under some pressure but operating margins even there are in the 10% range. And we think that as we get a little more clarity in the Gulf Coast Oil Service business that, that business will continue to improve.
We have strong consistent cash flow. We have a great balance sheet, a very low level of debt, good interest rates. Currently today, we have $160 million in cash on our balance sheet. We think we're in a great position to acquire companies in both our core businesses, build equipment and continue to repurchase our stock when appropriate. All of this I think puts us in a great position as we go into 2011. Operator, I think we'll now open the call up for questions."

I think the dollar also helps. The weaker dollar helps. It's difficult to quantify the effect of exports because we touch the chemicals as they move from process-to-process. And when we deliver them to a terminal, you don't really know where they're ultimately going to end up. I think maybe another way to answer this question is if you look at what typically drives the Chemical business, 70% of it is consumer non-durables. When you look at the durables, which are driven by housing and automobiles and other things, the durables are down. And typically when you're in that kind of environment, you would expect the volumes to be down. But because of our price advantage on a global basis, I think that what we would typically be losing in weaknesses in the durable area, we're picking up in exports. And that's really driving, frankly, better utilization than I think anybody expected in our business and also in the chemical business. As you listen to our customers' public statements on a global chemical environment, all of them are saying that exports really are driving the business incrementally."

There's a little less uncertainty out there today. All of that should help begin the process of moving pricing a little bit.

And I think what's happening is that, that confidence level is building and it's building not only with us but I think it's building with others in the business.

I think we've taken delivering all the vessels that we have are order. Having said that, you can expect some modest towboat construction program from Kirby going forward just because the age of our fleet is getting older. But it's going to be modest with respect to tied up power. There may be some tied up power but in our operation, the quality of power has to matter just because of what we do. So we're going to be much more attentive. If we charter a vessel, the quality of the management team we got them very carefully. They're inspected. We have people aboard those vessels on a consistent basis. We know who's aboard them on a daily basis. Any time we charter a vessel we accept the fact that, that vessel is ours and it needs to meet the same standards that we have internally. That's just something that we take responsibility for. So you can have power that's available but if it doesn't meet our standards, therefore we can't use it."

But the one I think unique thing about this business is the age profile of the fleet is mature. I like that word better than old and over 1/3 of it is over 30 years old and that is expensive tonnage to operate. The market particularly when there's excess capacity is biased against that older tonnage and there's a natural attrition as you make maintenance position with respect to it. So you will get a clearing in a no volume growth environment of capacity. And we think that, that in fact is happening. What is also happened is that volumes have increased, so when we were talking about industry excess barges a year ago, we were saying that they were somewhere between I think 400 to 500 excess barges that had to come out to get balanced. That number is lower today because volumes are up. And if you look at our feet, our fleet is in the high 80% utilization levels, has been for the last few quarters, is currently and there's just less barges now that have to come out to get it to balance, which is I think one of the factors that suggest that the environment for pricing should get better."

As Steve noted, Greg is the President of Kirby Inland Marine, our tank barge company. Greg will give you some additional color on the transportation sector. Yesterday evening, we reported our third quarter results, earning $0.57 per share compared to the third quarter of 2009 net earnings of $0.65 per share. 
For the first nine months of this year, we earned $1.56 per share compared with $1.79 per share for the first nine months of last year. The $0.57 per share third quarter results was at the high end of our guidance range, which we published at the beginning of the quarter, $0.52 to $0.57. 
Since the beginning of 2010, the U.S. petrochemical industry has seen a steady improvement in production. This improvement and U.S refinery anomalies, we'll come back and talk about those a little later, have allowed Kirby to maintain equivalent utilization levels in the high 80% range in our petrochemical and black oil markets during the second and third quarters of this year. These two markets comprise approximately 87% of what we do, and it's good to have them strong.
As anticipated in our third quarter guidance, our diesel engine service segment results continued to struggle a little bit with weak service in direct parts sales in the majority of our Marine markets, particularly in the Gulf Coast oil service market. This was partially offset by a good third quarter in the Power Generation business. I'm going now turn the call over to Greg to recap the Marine sector for the third quarter"

During the 2010 third quarter, our overall Marine Transportation demand was stable and barge utilization levels remained n the 85% to 90% range above all four 2009 quarters and above what we anticipated at the beginning of 2010. We continue to believe that, on the average, our utilization is slightly better than the industry's average. Low domestic natural gas prices have improved the global competitiveness for U.S. petrochemical producers. This has increased transportation volumes for basic petrochemicals to both domestic consumers and export terminals [ph] (16:04). These volumes helped to maintain our petrochemical fleet at high 80% utilization levels. Additionally, a heavy refinery maintenance in the third quarter, which required an additional black oil shipments between refineries, was coupled with exportation of heavy fuel oil to South America and the Pacific Rim, which helped to maintain our black oil fleet also at 80% utilization levels.
Revenue from term contracts delivered approximately 75% of third quarter revenue, consistent with the second quarter and as previously noted, during 2009, some customers switched from time charters to affreightment contracts as their time charters expired. This shift stabilized during the first quarter of 2010. And during the third quarter, revenue from time charter was consistent with the first two quarters of the year at approximately 50%. With respect to pricing, Kirby's term contract renewals bottomed out in the third quarter of 2009 and have remained flat since. Accordingly, renewals in the 2010 third quarter was consistent with our second quarter renewals. Spot contract rates for the third quarter, which included the price of fuel, were flat to slightly positive when compared with the 2010 second quarter. And as previously stated, our annual escalators, effective January 1, 2010, for labor and PPI, producer price index, on our multiyear contracts were neutral. I'll now turn the call back to Joe to discuss the Diesel Engine Services operation."

Now the thi",320,"Thank you, Greg. With respect to the diesel engine side of our business, this segment saw soft service and direct parts sales across the majority of our Marine transportation markets, as customers continued to defer major maintenance projects. Now the thing about deferred maintenance is that ultimately it represents a pretty good backlog, so it's going to need to be done at some point. Our Gulf Coast high-speed market continued to see lower utilization and some pricing pressure as a result of a number of things that were occurring along the Gulf Coast but principally the moratorium. As in the second quarter, the high-speed market did benefit modestly from required repair work to customers' equipment involved in the cleanup effort, but the more extensive overhauls were deferred. Moratorium on deep border drilling negatively impacted the company's business in this area both for the high-speed side of the business and the medium-speed side of the business.  
Historically, 20% to 25% of the business that this engine group performs is associated with the Gulf Coast Oil Service business and that includes both the shallow water side and the deep water side. Even though the moratorium was lifted in mid-October, new safety regulations that affect drilling operations are being issued, or in some cases not issued yet, and it's going to take some time to digest them and to understand how it affects the business. 
Having said that, the business, we believe, should begin a slow process of returning to normal levels once these new rules are understood. 
During the third quarter, the medium-speed power generation market benefited from a generator set upgrade projects and higher engine and parts sales. I'm going to come back at the end of our prepared remarks and talk about our outlook for the fourth quarter and for the full year. But first I want to turn the call over to David to go over the financial results."
283986,114225023,83153,"Kirby Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2010",2010-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Let me provide a few details on margins and CapEx and a number of other items. Kirby's Marine Transportation revenue was 2% above and operating income 11% below the 2009 third quarter. The segment's operating margin",777,"Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone. Let me provide a few details on margins and CapEx and a number of other items. Kirby's Marine Transportation revenue was 2% above and operating income 11% below the 2009 third quarter. The segment's operating margin was 22.1% compared with 25.3% for the 2009 third quarter. The lower margin reflected the continued impact of lower term and spot contract pricing that has rolled through. The lower margin also reflects the effective higher fuel prices and increased delay days, which we saw in the quarter. These were partially offset with the ongoing cost-reduction efforts and efficiency efforts that we started throughout 2009 and part of 2010.
So year-over-year, margins are down but both term and spot contract pricing have stabilized and the 2010 margins have continued to improve. They were 19.3% in the first quarter, 21.6% in the second quarter and then 22.1% in this quarter. However, the margin in the fourth quarter will likely be down slightly from this quarter due to the normal seasonal impact related to weather and some scheduled lock repairs.
On the Diesel Engine Service side, revenue was 9% above and operating income was 3% below last year's third quarter. The operating margin was 9.3% compared with 10.4% reported in the 2009 third quarter. The higher revenue reflected stronger power generation market, partially offset by the weakness in the Gulf Coast oil services market that Joe mentioned. The 3% decrease in operating income was a result of lower service and direct parts sales in the marine markets, some lower pricing in the high-speed marine market related to the oil service environment and lower overall labor utilization.
On the corporate side, we continued to generate significant cash during the 2010 third quarter and the first nine months with EBITDA at $77 million for the quarter and $216 million for the first nine months. At September 30, we had $149 million in cash on the balance sheet. Our capital spending for the first nine months totaled $108 million, which included $60 million for new tank barges and towboats and $48 million for capital upgrades to the existing fleet. During the 2010 first nine months, we took delivery of 45 new 10,000-barrel tank barges, three 30,000-barrel tank barges and five new 10,000-barrel chartered barges, adding about 637,000 barrels of new capacity. However, also during this same time period, we retired 64 tank barges and returned a couple chartered barges, which reduced our overall capacity about 1,014,000. So net-net, our capacity declined 377,000 barrels during the first nine months of this year. 
As of September 30, we now operate 850 tank barges with a capacity of 16.4 million barrels and this compares to the peak back in 2008 of 918 barges and 17.5 million barrels of capacity. 
During the fourth quarter, we plan to take delivery of eight new 10,000-barrel barges and two 30,000-barrel barges, adding 140,000 barrels of new capacity. But we'll continue to retire older tank barges from the fleet. Our capital spending guidance for 2010 remains unchanged at $135 million to $145 million. It includes approximately $70 million for construction of 58 tank barges, three towboats and some prepayments on 2011 barge construction. New construction capital expenditures for 2011 are currently projected in the $50 million to $60 million range and that's on top of our normal $70 million maintenance CapEx. The $50 million to $60 million amount for 2011 is based on our current commitments for 31 new tank barges that should be delivered throughout 2011. Our current plans are not to expand the fleet and to use these new barges to replace older equipment that we plan to remove from service. So going forward, we expect our barrel capacity to remain flat with additions equaling retirements. However, this replacement program has had a good impact on our fleet age and since the end of 2007 through today, our average fleet age has fallen around 3.5 years. The fleet age should continue to improve as we continue our replacement program.
Moving to share repurchases. Through June, from June to October 26, we repurchased 615,000 shares of Kirby stock at an average price of $38.47. The shares were purchased through a combination of open market purchases and a stock trading plan that we entered into with a brokerage firm pursuant to Rule 10b5-1. The 10b5-1 program is applicable for our 2010 second, third and year-end Kirby-imposed blackout periods that usually precede our earnings press releases. Effective November 1, at the end of our third quarter blackout period, we will have 2,086,000 shares remaining under our share authorization. That concludes my comments. I'll turn the call back to Joe."

Yesterday afternoon, we announced our 2010 fourth quarter guidance range of $0.52 to $0.57 per share. This compares with $0.54 per share we reported same period last year but those results included a $0.5 per share charge for a combination of things: shore staff reductions, an impairment charge and adding back a previously booked reserve for a doubtful account. For the year, for this year, we updated our guidance to $2.08 to $2.13 a share. For the fourth quarter, we're forecasting that overall equipment utilization levels will remain consistent with the third quarter, in the mid- to high-80% range. And pricing will also remain in line with the third quarter. Our guidance assumes that the petrochemical market will continue to remain strong based on low natural gas prices as they compare with other feedstock prices. In addition, our guidance assumes that the Gulf Coast refinery utilization will also be stable during the quarter. That being said, the difference between the low end of the guidance and the high end is principally weather and other navigating delays. As those who have listened to our calls for a number of years know that the fourth quarter is the most weather-impacted quarter, the upper river system is impacted typically by ice and sometimes low water conditions. On the lower end of the system and in the Canal, it's impacted by frontal systems that cause high winds and fog. There are also several scheduled lock repairs during the quarter which will have some impact on efficiency. Both the high-end and low-end guidance assumes that the Diesel Engine business is going to be about the same as it was in the third quarter.
Briefly looking into next year, I think that Kirby and frankly, the industry challenges to be able to move pricing forward. Based on the current strength of the petrochemical industry, what we believe are higher industry utilization levels and continued industry discipline with respect to tank barge capacity, we do believe that the environment for better pricing is better today than certainly it was in the last six months. We think there is some modest improvement in the industry's view of 2011. There, I think, was a general kind of umbrella concern for maybe negative GDP growth in 2011. I think that this is diminishing. And as it diminishes, I think it improves confidence levels. This, combined with what we typically see in the fourth quarter, the higher utilization, driven by weather principally, should all help the pricing environment. Kirby, I want to make I guess, a general comment on just Kirby. Kirby is in excellent financial shape. We've taken some significant costs out of our business model. Our transportation margins remain above 20%, which in itself is quite an accomplishment. The Diesel business is under some pressure, but operating margins even there are in the 10% range. And we think that as we get a little more clarity in the Gulf Coast Oil Service business that, that business will continue to improve.
We have strong, consistent cash flow. We have a great balance sheet, a very low level of debt, good interest rates. Currently today, we have $160 million in cash on our balance sheet. We think we're in a great position to acquire companies in both our core businesses, build equipment and continue to repurchase our stock when appropriate. All of this I think puts us in a great position as we go into 2011. Operator, I think we'll now open the call up for questions."

I think the dollar also helps. The weaker dollar helps. It's difficult to quantify the effect of exports because we touch the chemicals as they move from process-to-process. And when we deliver them to a terminal, you don't really know where they're ultimately going to end up. I think maybe another way to answer this question is if you look at what typically drives the Chemical business, 70% of it is consumer non-durables. When you look at the durables, which are driven by housing and automobiles and other things, the durables are down. And typically when you're in that kind of environment, you would expect the volumes to be down. But because of our price advantage on a global basis, I think that what we would typically be losing in weaknesses in the durable area, we're picking up in exports. And that's really driving, frankly, better utilization than I think anybody expected in our business and also in the chemical business. As you listen to our customers' public statements on the global chemical environment, all of them are saying that exports really are driving the business incrementally."

We're enjoying margins we think that they're higher than most, if not all, of the companies in the business. And where there are companies that are struggling, we're actually doing pretty well and that we can support in the next cycle higher margins without the concern you raise, which is a good concern, which is the attraction of additional capacity. Now having said that, at some point, we all know that you can get rates and returns to the point where you do attract additional capital. But I think that we're a ways away from that."

Along with utilization there's another intangible factor, which is business confidence. To move rates, you have to have the confidence that business levels are going to be sustainable. And I think what's happening is that, that confidence level is building and it's building not only with us, but I think it's building with others in the business. I think that part of the issue with us not being able to drive rates really had to do with our utilization being generally higher than others in the business. I'm not saying higher than all but on average probably a little higher. And also that our customers, for a host of reasons, continue to work with us and maybe in some cases pay us a little more and when you go to -- when you go to the customer and say, hey, I'd like a rate increase and he reminds you that he's already paying you a little more. And the other anomaly that's kind of interesting that I haven't seen here. Typically in a stable environment, spot prices are higher than your contract prices. That's in kind of a normal /stable market. In this case, our spot prices and our contract prices were about the same. Another thing that's encouragin,g and Greg talked about this in his section of the call, that spot prices very modestly are a little better in the third quarter than they were in the second quarter.

But one of the, I think, unique things about this business is the age profile of the fleet is mature. I like that word better than old and over 1/3 of it is over 30 years old and that is expensive tonnage to operate. The market, particularly when there's excess capacity, is biased against that older tonnage and there's a natural attrition as you make maintenance decisions with respect to it. So you will get a clearing, in a no volume growth environment, of capacity. And we think that, that in fact is happening. What is also happened is that volumes have increased. So when we were talking about industry excess barges a year ago, we were saying that there were somewhere between I think 400 to 500 excess barges that had to come out to get balanced. That number is lower today because volumes are up. And if you look at our fleet, our fleet is in the high 80% utilization levels, has been for the last few quarters, is currently and there's just less barges now that have to come out to get it to balance, which is I think one of the factors that suggests that the environment for pricing should get better."
