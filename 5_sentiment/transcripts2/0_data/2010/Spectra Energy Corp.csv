We appreciate you joining us today and I'm pleased that we've got good result to share with you. 2009 was indeed a good year for Spectra Energy and our investors. As you've seen, we reported ongoing fourth quarter net income of $217 million compared with $197 million in 2008 or about a 10% increase. And for all of 2009, we earned $1.18 per share beating our original forecast of $1.60 per share, even in light of lower NGL prices and an equity offering early in the year. The composition of our 2009 earnings underlines the power and resiliency of our diversified portfolio. Our investors benefited from 10 projects we placed into service in 2009. Projects that are earning returns above our targeted level both today and I expect for the longer-term. We began seeing improved commodity prices during the fourth quarter for Western Canada in Field Services, and we are pleased that, that momentum is continuing into 2010. We also took steps during 2009 to position our company for continued success over the longer term. Earlier in the year, we bolstered our financial flexibility, and we've consistently maintained adequate liquidity to fund all of our activities. We're achieving good growth, sustainable growth from our core businesses. And we've financed strategic acquisitions through our MLPs [master limited partnership], Spectra Energy partners and DCP Midstream Partners. So, 2009 was a good year in and of itself, and an even better year in terms of positive positioning it provided for consistent earnings growth. During the year of uncertainty and economic downturn, Spectra Energy was able to rely upon its core strengths. A resilient forward-looking business model, financial strength and flexibility, diversity of robust sector-leading businesses and operational excellence. Consider the almost $3 billion in capital projects we signed in 2009, including the New Jersey/New York expansion, TIME III, TEMAX, TEAM 2012 and the Fort Nelson Expansions. All of these projects are underpinned by long-term binding-fee based contracts that will provide attractive returns. In fact, last year, we signed more contracts for new major and natural gas infrastructure projects than any other company. That says a lot about our responsiveness to growing demand markets, our ability to expand our asset footprint and our commitment to grow value for investors and customers alike, even in challenging economic times. Let's take a look now at what we're doing to ensure we deliver on our plan. We're very clear on our long-term purpose and milestones needed to lead our sector as the company of choice and the investment opportunity of choice. We share this slide with you on January 22, but want to reiterate it. This year, we'll deliver $1.42 in ongoing fully diluted earnings per share based on an average oil price of $80 a barrel, an NGL price of $0.95 a gallon and a natural gas price of $5.50. We provided you with our sensitivities to these factors so that you can insert your own commodity assumptions. For example, all things being equal, if commodity prices and the Canadian dollar were to remain unchanged all year from about where they are today, then our $1.42 EPS could move to the mid $1.50 range. We will, of course, maintain our annual dividend of at least $1 per share. We'll continue to effectively execute on our 2010 to 2012 capital expansion plan, placing some $900 million of projects in the service in 2010, projects that will deliver returns on capital in excess of 12%. And as you can see, we're focused on superior execution in 2010. But we're also focused our sights on long-term success and achievement. We're looking at opportunities beyond 2012 and well into the future. Some of those are regional opportunities like those we're acting upon in the Marcellus, in the Horn River Basin and others are demand-related, like power conversions in the in the Southeast, similar to our Northeastern Tennessee project where we're working with TVA [Tennessee Valley Authority] to provide about $150 million cubic feet a day of firm capacity on East Tennessee to a TVA generating facility. As this project will be completed at SEP [Spectra Energy Partners], I expect they'll provide more details on the project during their call tomorrow. We also have a slate of excellent projects self financed at DCP. We'll continue to use our MLPs, as appropriate, to take advantage of acquisition opportunities as they come along, as we did just like last week at DCP Midstream's MLP. Over the next five years, we see growth opportunities on of at least $1 billion per year, with returns on capital averaging 12% to 14%. These growth projects provide us with the confidence to tell our shareholders to expect a strong, sustainable level of earnings growth, this year and into the future. We expect our compound annual EPS growth rate between 2010 and 2012 to be in the 8% to 10% range. That kind of EPS growth, coupled with our attractive dividend, should give investors the opportunity to realize annual total shareholder returns in the range of 12% to 14%. That's the value proposition I believe our shareholders should find compelling today and over the longer term. Let's take a look at our record of project execution. You'll recall that when we launched Spectra Energy back in 2007, we committed to you to invest about $1 billion per year in fee-based businesses at an attractive return in the 10% to 12% range. Well we're not only meeting those commitments, we're actually exceeding them. Between 2007 and 2009, we placed into service 42 fee-based expansion projects totaling more than $3 billion, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet and improving credit metrics. And, as I said earlier, going forward, we see opportunities of at least $1 billion a year. In the next five years, between 2010 and 2014, that implies that we could invest about $5 billion in expansion growth. Realizing incremental annual EBIT of $600 million to $700 million for return on capital in the 12% to 14% range. By the end of 2014, we will have created incremental EBIT from our expansion capital program of well over $1 billion a year. Our focus on results, strategic growth and long-term positioning continues to yield results for our investors, our customers and the markets we serve. With that, let me turn things over to Pat and more detail about the results from each of our business segment, and provide some context around those results and how they bridge to 2010."

As Greg told you, it's been a good year for us, a year of hard work, significant challenges and attractive returns. Let's take a look.As you've seen in our earnings release, Spectra Energy reported fourth quarter net income of $219 million, or $0.34 per diluted share. After removing the effect of discontinued operations, our ongoing earnings were $217 million or $0.33 per share. For the year, we delivered ongoing earnings of $758 million or $1.18 per share. The annual results reflects solid performance from our fee-based businesses. The company benefited from expansion project placed into service in both 2008 and 2009. And while commodity prices didn't meet the level included in our $1.15 per share guidance for the year, they did recover nicely toward the end of year, and as Greg mentioned, that momentum gives us a positive start to 2010. Let's review the results for each business segment in a little more detail beginning with our U.S. Transmission operations. U.S. Transmission reported fourth quarter 2009 EBIT of $204 million compared with $161 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The 2008 period included a $44 million special item for an impairment of the Islander East project. Ongoing EBIT for fourth quarter 2009 was $204 million, essentially flat with the prior year's quarter. This segment benefited by $34 million from EBITDA on expansion projects like our J2 [ph] expansion, Steckman Ridge, Moss Bluff and Egan. These earnings were offset by the timing of O&M expenses, including pipeline integrity and lower capitalized cost, as well as a favorable customer settlement in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to our maritimes in Northeast based by projects. Now let's turn to our distribution segment.  Distribution reported fourth quarter 2009 EBIT of $96 million, compared with $90 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Excluding the effect of a stronger Canadian dollar, earnings were $7 million lower than in the 2008 quarter, primarily the results of warmer weather. Despite a challenging economic year, Union's customer base grew at just over 1%, adding a little more than 15,000 customers. And the team did a great job in managing bad debt to keep it within our rate allowance.Let's now look at our results in Western Canada. Western Canada Transmission and Processing reported fourth quarter 2009 EBIT of $120 million compared with $65 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Beyond the effect of the stronger Canadian dollar, which added $16 million to earnings this quarter compared with last year, the increase was due mainly to higher frac spread affecting our Empress natural gas liquids revenues. The Empress frac spread for the quarter was $7.55 per MMBtu compared to $3.11 last year. This segment also had improved sustainable results in the base gathering and processing business, primarily driven by higher contracted volumes and revenues from expansions. This quarter's results reflect the resurgence of the BC [British Columbia] gathering and processing business, a positive trend that has just gotten started and should manifest itself through significant growth in this segment in 2010 and beyond.Now let me turn to our Field Services business. Our Field Services segment, which segments Spectra Energy's 50% interest in DCP Midstream had a solid quarter, reporting EBIT of $77 million compared with $69 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Prior to the effects of the change in DCP Midstream partners mark-to-market results, we saw an almost 77% increase in our half of DCP Midstream's net income, from $47 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 to $83 million in the fourth quarter of 2009.The increase in earnings was driven by higher commodity prices. During the fourth quarter of 2009, crude oil averaged about $76 per barrel compared with $59 per barrel in the prior quarter, and the NGL accrued relationship averaged 53% up from about 46% last year.While volumes were lower for the quarter, we're seeing a positive turnaround on that front with natural gas rigs within DCP's footprint, up about 65% from the lows that we saw in early 2009. As we've mentioned many times, Spectra Energy uses the cash it receives from DCP Midstream to help fund it's fee-based capital expansions. We received distributions of $70 million in the fourth quarter and $100 million for the full year and in January, we received an additional distribution of $75 million. Now let's look at our Other segment, which is primarily comprised of our corporate governance cost and captive insurance and a few additional items.  For the fourth quarter, other reported ongoing net cost of $28 million compared with net cost of $21 million in the previous year's quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher benefits cost. Interest expense for the quarter was $154 million compared with $166 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the benefit of lower realized interest rates and lower Commercial Paper balances, partially offset by the effects of a stronger Canadian dollar during the 2009 quarter. The fourth quarter's effective tax rate was 28% compared with 19% last year. The Canadian currency changed from $1.21 last year to about $1.6 this year, increasing fourth quarter after-tax earnings by about $12 million. As of December 31, 2009, our debt-to-total capitalization ratio stood 55.7%. We fully expect to be able to fund our CapEx program through a combination of internally generated funds and debt, while staying within the 55% to 60% range that we've committed to. As of December 31, we had total capacity under our credit facility of $2.7 billion and available liquidity of $2.3 billion. So that's an overview of our fourth quarter results, and as you can see, we've had a solid quarter and year. So now let's review quickly our earnings expectations for 2010.So here are the components of our 2010 plan. This is the chart we shared with you recently and it provides our projected EBIT and EBITDA detail for each of our business segments, and all the information you need to see how we arrive at our EPS number of $1.42. We're confident that we'll see solid performance in each of our businesses this year and on into the future.You're aware that traditionally, the first and fourth quarters had been our biggest, delivering about 60% of our actual EBIT, and that trend continues to apply to 2010. However, when we look at the earnings split between the first half and the second half of the year, in 2010, we expect slightly stronger earnings in the second half, largely driven by new projects coming online later in the year and importantly, volumes increasing at DCP Midstream towards the back end of the year. So that should help you understand our quarterly distribution of our $1.42 per share. Our next slide will show you how we get from our ongoing net income in 2009 to our forecast net income in 2010.We begin with actual 2009 ongoing net income of $758 million, which supports our $1.18 earnings per share, and we then reconcile it to our 2010 projected net income of $925 million or $1.42 per share. First item is our 50% share of DCP Midstream earnings, which is expected to be $195 million higher than last year, primarily as a result of higher commodity prices in 2010. Next, we expect projects placed into service in 2009 and '10 to provide 2010 incremental EBIT of about $130 million. This increase is roughly split, 50/50, between U.S. Transmission and Western Canada.We also expect to see an EBIT increase of about $35 million as a result of the stronger Canadian dollar. These commodity, expansion and currency items represent the significant drivers of our projected earnings increase in 2010. The next bar shows a decrease of $40 million related to development cost at U.S. Transmission. Last year, we recorded a $40 million increase to earnings as a result of capitalizing project development cost, which have previously been expensed. In 2010, we've improved our processes around the evaluation, our project development status, which should result in earlier capitalization of development cost. Therefore, there are no significant expense or income amounts related to development cost forecast for 2010. So you'll see less year-over-year earnings volatility caused by these cost going forward. Next, our 2010 forecast includes additional pension expense of almost $30 million. This expense represents the accounting amortization of the effect of the significant declines in the market value of our pension assets over the last couple of years. Our interest expense, net of interest income, is expected to increase by $20 million due to higher average debt balances in 2010. As you would expect, our higher estimated pretax earnings in 2010 produce additional income tax expense of $85 million. And finally, we had numerous other items totaling $18 million, that take us to net income of $925 million or $1.42 per share. During our recent meeting in New York, we had a question on why our EBIT for U.S. Transmission for 2010 did not appear to be growing much. So let me provide a little more detail to show you that we are experiencing positive growth in that segment.This chart shows U.S. transmission EBIT for 2007 to 2010, adjusted for a couple of items, project development cost and processing revenues on Texas Eastern. We're adjusting for these items to more clearly show that we're realizing good growth from the expansion projects we placed in service. Let me explain these adjustments a little bit further. As discussed earlier, we expect less income and expense effects from our project development cost going forward. So we prepared this graph, as if prior year's development cost had all been capitalized to an incurred and not run to the income statement. We've also adjusted our processing revenue. As a result of increased volumes, due to hurricanes and relatively high commodity prices, 2007 and 2008 included much higher than normal processing revenues. So in order to see a better comparison of EBIT growth for 2007 to 2010, we have adjusted processing revenue to a more normalized level of about $80 million per year, which is the amount in our 2010 guidance based on our commodity assumptions. As you can see, we realized growth of 4.8% over the 2007 to 2010 period in our core U.S. transmission business after adjusting for these items. This growth primarily reflects EBIT from new expansion projects, placed in service over the last few years. Now let's take a closer look at distributions growth. We invest in and finance our Canadian businesses using Canadian dollars and we earned Canadian returns. But as you know, the earnings from our Canadian businesses are converted to U.S. dollars for U.S. financial reporting purposes. This conversion, at fluctuating FX rates, can make comparisons challenging. So we've shown distribution and Western Canada's earnings for 2007, 2008 and 2009, along with their estimate for 2010, on the Canadian dollar basis. As you can see here, we're experiencing real growth at distribution on a Canadian dollar basis with EBIT increasing 4.2% from 2007 to 2010. That level of growth is more attractive than you would normally expect to see in an LDC, and is attributable to the fact that Union Gas finally operates a successful Distribution business, but also a leading Storage and Transmission business.Finally, let's look at our growth in Western Canada. Again, when you look at the underlying fee-based businesses in Canadian dollars, represented by the blue section of the bars on this page, you see strong growth in our Western Canada segment. On a Canadian dollar basis, the fee-based businesses grow at an impressive 12.2% from 2007 to 2010, reflecting strong contracted growth in the Horn River and Montney regions. We've been layered on the Empress EBIT in Canadian dollars. And we expect the growth in gathering and processing to continue beyond 2010 to increase utilization of existing facilities, and the build out of new facilities that served the long-term contracts we've recently signed as a result of increased drilling in the Montney/Doig and Horn River basin areas. Doug Bloom discussed these growth opportunities with you in detail when we rolled out our 2010 plan.So as you've seen, with a solid fourth quarter that capped a good year of respect for energy. Given these results, we feel confident in our ability to deliver 2010 through 2012 EBIT growth in our Spectra Energy Transmission business in a 7% to 9% range. And we likewise feel confident in our 2010 plan, and in the fact that we have the financial capacity to execute that plan and deliver enhanced value to our shareholders this year and well into the future. So with that, let me turn things back over to Greg to wrap up before we move on to your questions."

And here's really what makes Spectra Energy such a compelling investment opportunity. We have an unbeatable track record of delivering results in a strong growth outlook. We all know that 2009 was a challenging year, yet Spectra Energy is starting 2010 with much better growth prospects than we had at the beginning of 2008. That's right, not 2009, but 2008. That positioning and the ability to excel and grow across market and economic cycles is fundamental to our success. We have the advantage of the most strategically situated natural gas infrastructure assets in North America. We see it serve four of the five fastest growing demand markets in North America and we're located in the midst of both expanding shale plays and conventional supply. You can't beat that positioning, and you definitely couldn't build it today. We have an abundance of expansion opportunities. Over the next several years, we'll invest at least $1 billion annually in new growth projects, that are manageable in size and aligned with our execution strength, and we'll deliver those projects with returns above our 10% to 12% range. We see low risk, steady growth momentum from our core fee-based businesses. On January 22, you heard directly from two of those growth businesses, our Northeast U.S. and Western Canadian operation. So you know that we have excellent long-standing and productive relationships with our customers. Relationships that have resulted in firm contract and exceptionally high renewal rates. This core business was profitable steady growth, which produces stable cash flow, enables us to pay an attractive dividend, which we expect to grow over time with earnings. We're well positioned financially too. The strong cash flow and investment-grade balance sheet, ample liquidity and excellent access to capital. Investors are also poised to reap the rewards of further commodity strengthening we see on the horizon. And I'll remind you again, that the improving commodity prices at DCP Midstream bolsters an already reliable source of cash to help fund Spectra Energy's growth prospects. And finally, natural gas is uniquely positioned to help address North America's energy and environmental challenges, clean, abundant, reliable and domestically available. And it will be vital to the improvement in North America's carbon footprint and the economy overall. Bottom line, we're executing on our plan and we will continue to deliver the operational and financial targets we've committed to achieve. When considering Spectra Energy, investors can reasonably expect to earn an annual total shareholder return in the 12% to 14% range, from a company that's almost 80% of its EBIT coming from low-risk, fee-based businesses. That's good value. With that, I'll turn the things back over to John, so we can talk with you."

So today I would argue that I think it's fair to say that SEP, they have a lower cost of capital today, given where it is have split, et cetera. But longer term, and I think you see that across the MLP market, that in fact you see a convergence of cost of capital. So we've set up SEP to be a financing node and just like any other financing element inside the company, to utilize it to grow the overall company. And I think you've seen that through some of our acquisitions and the organic growth there, what is that is preferring time or lower cost or capital. Now as we grow the company overall, obviously we're going to be spending a lot of capital. And when you retain a lot of capital and you're obviously not paying out all your cash flow, that's better to do that a corporate level, and we see that through 2014. Now somewhere down the road, and 2014 is a long ways away, you didn't have any growth prospects all you're going to do is generate cash, which is not a bad thing. Then you might think of structures at that point in time. But I would -- both DPM, SEP are very complimentary to SC overall. They are used in excellent news for good acquisition vehicles up to a size -- remember there's only so much capital you could issue out of an MLP. Even the large MLPs have proven that you can't go out and issue $1 billion of equity out of the large MLP today. And I think you could do that if you wanted to at a large C corp. So I think they are very complimentary. I think it's a timing issue of who's got the best cost of capital at any point in time, and I could just assure you that we will take advantage of the best cost of capital inside the corporation each and everyday."

Remember, well we had sent a lot of money in the Montney so a lot of those western projects have kicked in. But also let's remember that we're starting to see the front end of the Fort Nelson projects come in. And the front end has some restart of existing assets. So obviously, it's a much better return in the front end. And then as we move out to 2011 and 2012 and build the bigger new processing plants, those returns are quite as robust. So you kind of get a little bit of front end loading with respect to the results in Western Canada, and you start to see that in 2010, which is great, right? More cash earlier is always good. So I think you would probably see close to $60 million of uptick just from expansion projects. That's something that's I'll said you have a little bit like turnaround and things like that. But really, a big pick up is just from the expansion projects. So you know the other thing is producers I think are being quite by contracting up volumes and you even saw that in the fourth quarter. So as you know while it may not be fully utilized yet, once they're contracted, people are paying a reservation charges and that's obviously very beneficial for us as opposed to these people picking up interruptible.

But it's actually how that plays out. You've got to figure out: A, does the Canadian government with that because they got deficits as well; and B, how exactly do our earnings break down.

I have to start by saying that I'm indeed pleased with our first quarter results.

I have to start by saying that I'm indeed pleased with our first quarter results. Not only did our core fee-based businesses ran very well and meet our earnings expectations, but as anticipated, in fact, probably a little better than anticipated, we saw the benefit of increased commodity prices, which created a very nice improvement in our DCP Midstream earnings. 
And with the successful completion of two expansion projects coming into service in the quarter, I believe investors are getting a very clear picture of the robust benefits of Spectra Energy's portfolio of natural gas businesses. 
Now low commodity prices have moderated somewhat and are now very much in line with our full-year expectations, which we laid out for you in January. The riding start we've achieved in the first quarter bolsters our confidence in meeting, and potentially exceeding, our 2010 earnings expectations. No doubt, this won't crystallize until well into the fourth quarter. As you know, second and third quarter earnings combined, typically account for only about 35% to 40% of our annual results. So it's a good start to 2010, and it's a start contrast to what we saw a year ago, and supports our expectations of 20% or so EPS growth this year over 2009 results.
Key drivers for the quarter included the following. First, the core fee-based businesses; Storage, Transmission, Distribution and Canadian Gathering and Processing performed well. You'll hear the details from Pat shortly, but the businesses are experiencing steady, profitable growth that serves customers and enables us to pay an attractive dividend.  As you recall, the vast majority of our 2010 EBIT will come from these fee-based businesses. 
Second, as I mentioned, strong commodity prices during most of the quarter, benefited not only Field Services segment, but also our Empress business. Third, we're ideally positioned in terms of expansion opportunities and realizing substantial growth. We're investing about $1 billion annually for the next several years as we've done for the last few years, and our projects are delivering returns above 12%. We'll place some $900 million of projects into service this year, significant projects that take natural gas to market and serve customers.  We're moving the projects forward on a fast path, too. 
In Canada, we completed our T-North project in January, which have compression at our Gordondale compressor site. We also placed into service the first of the Fort Nelson series of projects, the North Maxhamish Loop. And this project allows for timely transportation of incremental gas production from the Horn River Basin to our existing Fort Nelson processing plant. 
Another important milestone for this BC expansion was the approval by the National Energy Board for our new Fort Nelson North Processing Facility. This 250 million cubic feet per day plant is a key component of the overall Fort Nelson area expansion, which will provide significant new EBIT to our Western Canadian businesses. 
You'll recall that last fall, we signed contracts with producers for about 800 million cubic feet per day of gathering and processing capacity at our Fort Nelson facility. Above and beyond that expansion, we have two open seasons now underway. We're assessing interest in expanding the transportation service on our T-North system, which will provide additional take away capacity from the area, as well as additional gas gathering and processing service in the Fort Nelson area. While the open seasons don't conclude until later this week, ongoing producer interest could result in another significant wave of infrastructure investment in various convier [ph](13:02) by Spectra Energy.
Good things are happening down south as well. In March, we signed a 25-year contract with TVA for an extension of our East Tennessee Natural Gas System. This expansion, the Northeast Tennessee project, or NET as we call it, will benefit both Spectra Energy and our MLP, Spectra Energy Partners.  The $135 million project will provide transportation service to TVA's new gas-fired power plant, and is slated to be in service during the second half of 2011. 
With a lot of expansion efforts underway in the Northeast U.S., and our most recent accomplishment was the execution of another contract on our Texas Eastern Appalachian Market supply, or TEAM 2012 project. Chesapeake Utilities signed a 15-year agreement for 40 million cubic per day. And this contract, when we combine it with the anchor contract we signed late last year with Range Resources, brings the TEAM 2012 capacity to 190 million cubic feet per day. 
As you might recall, this approximately $200 million expansion allows us to access Marcellus Shale gas in Southwestern Pennsylvania and transport it to market. And then finally, DCP Midstream is also pursuing a number of great opportunities. You might recall, that when we shared our 2010 outlook with you in January, our DCP Midstream slide had an unchecked box to South Texas opportunities, particularly around the Eagle Ford. Well, you can check that one up. I'm pleased to report that our project in Eagle Ford will begin flowing gas any day now, which will contribute to continued growth at DCP Midstream.
The momentum we experienced across our business segments gives us confidence in Spectra Energy's ability to deliver on our 2010 to 2012 compound annual growth rate in the 8% to 10% range. And we're continuing to build upon our successful record of project execution. Here's the bottom line. For over the next five years, we fully expect to invest about $5 billion in expansion capital, realize incremental annual EBIT of $600 million to $700 million, for a return on that capital in the 12% to 14% range. So by the end of 2014, we will have created incremental EBIT from capital expansions of more than $1 billion since Spectra Energy launched in '07. This growth is what's fueling the EPS CAGR of 8% to 10% I just mentioned.  With that, I'm going to turn things over to Pat, who will take you through the numbers."

As announced earlier today, Spectra Energy reported first quarter 2010 earnings of $358 million or $0.55 per share, compared with $298 million or $0.47 per share in the first quarter of 2009. There were",1120,"Well, thank you, Greg, and good morning, everybody. As announced earlier today, Spectra Energy reported first quarter 2010 earnings of $358 million or $0.55 per share, compared with $298 million or $0.47 per share in the first quarter of 2009. There were no special items in the 2010 quarter, but you'll recall that the 2009 first quarter included an $85 million after-tax special item gain at Field Services. After removing the effect of discontinued operations and special items, ongoing earnings for the quarter were $342 million or $0.53 per share, compared with $210 million or $0.33 per share last year.
We know that many of you focused on EBITDA, so the next slide provides a summary. As you can see here, ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $863 million, compared with $663 million in the first quarter of 2009, a 30% increase year-over-year. That increase reflects the strong cash generation capacity of our business, with every segment posting year-over-year improvement for the quarter.
Let's now take a look at our performance by business segment, beginning with our U.S. Transmission. U.S. Transmission reported first quarter EBIT of $247 million compared with $217 million in the first quarter of 2009. The second benefited from business expansion projects previously placed on this service, projects like Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline Phase IV, Steckman Ridge storage, Northern Bridge, Algonquin J-2 Expansion and our Moss Bluff in Egan Storage projects. Combined, these projects added about $25 million in earnings during the quarter, a significant contribution that serves our investors well, both now and over the long term. Now let's turn to distribution.
Distribution reported first quarter EBIT of $146 million compared with $152 million in the first quarter of 2009. The decrease is mainly due to lower customer usage, primarily driven by weather, which is more than 10% warmer than the same period last year, as well as by higher operating costs. The decrease was substantially offset by the effect of a stronger Canadian dollar.  
And notwithstanding the effects of a slowed economy, we're pleased that we continue to add customers. In the first quarter, Union Gas realized customer growth of close to 1%. Let's now look at Western Canada Transmission and Processing.
Western Canada reported first quarter EBIT of $119 million compared with $81 million in the first quarter of 2009. The segment benefited from improved results in the base Gathering and Processing business, primarily driven by higher contracted volumes from expansion projects, including West Doe, South Peace Pipeline and Fort Nelson. 
The segment also benefited from higher frac spreads at Empress, as well as the effect of a stronger Canadian dollar. The Empress frac spread for the quarter averaged $8.99 compared with $3.40 during last year's quarter. However, the benefit of this higher frac spread were offset somewhat by higher extraction costs. Because lower volumes are flowing east bound from Alberta, we're having to pay higher premiums to producers to attract gas into our Empress plant. 
I also want to make you aware that we expect to have two major plant turnaround during the second quarter. One at our Empress plant, and another at one of our Grizzly Valley gathering and processing plants, both about three weeks in duration. You'll see the effect of these budgeted turnarounds next quarter in volumes, revenues and O&M costs. These turnarounds will affect EBIT by about $20 million next quarter, but we're taking into account when we put together our 2010 forecast. 
Let's now turn to Field Services. Field Services reported first quarter ongoing EBIT of $99 million compared with $15 million in the first quarter of 2009. The increase in ongoing earnings was primarily driven by higher commodity prices. 
During the first quarter of 2010, crude oil averaged $79 per barrel, compared with $43 in the prior-year quarter. And NYMEX natural gas averaged $5.30 per MMBtu versus $4.89 during the same period in 2009. And the NGL to crude relationship averaged 58% this quarter versus 56% last year. 
While natural gas liquids prices started out relatively higher early in the quarter, by the end of the quarter, they had come back to the $0.95 level we estimated for the year in our January outlook. It's a little early to know where liquids prices will settle out for the year, but right now, our 2010 curve indicates they'll remain close to our $0.95 estimate.
Like Western Canada, DCP Midstream will have some third-party plant turnarounds during the second quarter, which will affect their volumes next quarter. DCP Midstream paid distributions of $75 million to Spectra Energy during the quarter. And just last week, we received an additional $112 million in distributions, which underscores DCP's excellent first quarter performance. That brings our year-to-date DCP Midstream cash contribution to nearly $190 million.
Now let me turn to additional items for the quarter. Our other category reported net cost of $14 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared with net cost of $24 million in last year's quarter, reflecting lower corporate cost so far this year. Our interest expense was $159 million compared with $150 million in the first quarter of 2009.
The first quarter's effective tax rate was 21% compared with 31% last year. We had favorable audit settlements this quarter in Canada, which reduced the income tax expense by $24 million. After the effect of these settlements and with the benefit of lower Canadian tax rates this year, we now expect our annual effective rate to be in the 27% to 28% range.
I would note that given our significant Canadian presence and a substantial difference between tax rates in the U.S. and Canada, Spectra Energy generally have to lower effective tax rate compared with those in our industry who only have U.S. operations. And you can expect that trend to continue since we are making significant investments in Canada. 
The favorable Canadian currency change increased first quarter 2010 after-tax earnings by about $18 million. At the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-total capitalization ratio stood at 54.5%. We expect to be able to fund our CapEx program through a combination of internally-generated funds and debt, while staying within the 55% to 60% range that we've targeted for debt. 
And at the quarter's close, we had total capacity  under our credit facilities of $2.7 billion and available liquidity of $2.3 billion. So that's an overview of our first quarter results. Needless to say, we feel good about where we are today and where we're headed. Our solid financial position allows us to execute on our 2010 business and operational plans, and keeps us on track to deliver a year-over-year 20% increase in 2010 earnings. 
So with that, Greg and I would be happy to take your questions."

610501,100781584,67357,"Spectra Energy Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 04, 2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Spectra Energy Corp","Executives","Thanks very much, John, and good morning everybody. I have to start by saying that I'm indeed pleased with our first quarter results. Not only did our core fee-based businesses ran very well and meet our earnings expectations, but as anticipated, in fact,",992,"Thanks very much, John, and good morning everybody. I have to start by saying that I'm indeed pleased with our first quarter results. Not only did our core fee-based businesses ran very well and meet our earnings expectations, but as anticipated, in fact, probably a little better than anticipated, we saw the benefit of increased commodity prices, which created a very nice improvement in our DCP Midstream earnings. 
And with the successful completion of two expansion projects coming into service in the quarter, I believe investors are getting a very clear picture of the robust benefits of Spectra Energy's portfolio of natural gas businesses. 
Now low commodity prices have moderated somewhat and are now very much in line with our full-year expectations, which we laid out for you in January. The riding start we've achieved in the first quarter bolsters our confidence in meeting, and potentially exceeding, our 2010 earnings expectations. No doubt, this won't crystallize until well into the fourth quarter. As you know, second and third quarter earnings combined, typically account for only about 35% to 40% of our annual results. So it's a good start to 2010, and it's a start contrast to what we saw a year ago, and supports our expectations of 20% or so EPS growth this year over 2009 results.
Key drivers for the quarter included the following. First, the core fee-based businesses; Storage, Transmission, Distribution and Canadian Gathering and Processing performed well. You'll hear the details from Pat shortly, but the businesses are experiencing steady, profitable growth that serves customers and enables us to pay an attractive dividend.  As you recall, the vast majority of our 2010 EBIT will come from these fee-based businesses. 
Second, as I mentioned, strong commodity prices during most of the quarter, benefited not only Field Services segment, but also our Empress business. Third, we're ideally positioned in terms of expansion opportunities and realizing substantial growth. We're investing about $1 billion annually for the next several years as we've done for the last few years, and our projects are delivering returns above 12%. We'll place some $900 million of projects into service this year, significant projects that take natural gas to market and serve customers.  We're moving the projects forward on a fast path, too. 
In Canada, we completed our T-North project in January, which have compression at our Gordondale compressor site. We also placed into service the first of the Fort Nelson series of projects, the North Maxhamish Loop. And this project allows for timely transportation of incremental gas production from the Horn River Basin to our existing Fort Nelson processing plant. 
Another important milestone for this BC expansion was the approval by the National Energy Board for our new Fort Nelson North Processing Facility. This 250 million cubic feet per day plant is a key component of the overall Fort Nelson area expansion, which will provide significant new EBIT to our Western Canadian businesses. 
You'll recall that last fall, we signed contracts with producers for about 800 million cubic feet per day of gathering and processing capacity at our Fort Nelson facility. Above and beyond that expansion, we have two open seasons now underway. We're assessing interest in expanding the transportation service on our T-North system, which will provide additional take away capacity from the area, as well as additional gas gathering and processing service in the Fort Nelson area. While the open seasons don't conclude until later this week, ongoing producer interest could result in another significant wave of infrastructure investment in various convier [ph](13:02) by Spectra Energy.
Good things are happening down south as well. In March, we signed a 25-year contract with TVA for an extension of our East Tennessee Natural Gas System. This expansion, the Northeast Tennessee project, or NET as we call it, will benefit both Spectra Energy and our MLP, Spectra Energy Partners.  The $135 million project will provide transportation service to TVA's new gas-fired power plant, and is slated to be in service during the second half of 2011. 
With a lot of expansion efforts underway in the Northeast U.S., and our most recent accomplishment was the execution of another contract on our Texas Eastern Appalachian Market supply, or TEAM 2012 project. Chesapeake Utilities signed a 15-year agreement for 40 million cubic per day. And this contract, when we combine it with the anchor contract we signed late last year with Range Resources, brings the TEAM 2012 capacity to 190 million cubic feet per day. 
As you might recall, this approximately $200 million expansion allows us to access Marcellus Shale gas in Southwestern Pennsylvania and transport it to market. And then finally, DCP Midstream is also pursuing a number of great opportunities. You might recall, that when we shared our 2010 outlook with you in January, our DCP Midstream slide had an unchecked box to South Texas opportunities, particularly around the Eagle Ford. Well, you can check that one up. I'm pleased to report that our project in Eagle Ford will begin flowing gas any day now, which will contribute to continued growth at DCP Midstream.
The momentum we experienced across our business segments gives us confidence in Spectra Energy's ability to deliver on our 2010 to 2012 compound annual growth rate in the 8% to 10% range. And we're continuing to build upon our successful record of project execution. Here's the bottom line. For over the next five years, we fully expect to invest about $5 billion in expansion capital, realize incremental annual EBIT of $600 million to $700 million, for a return on that capital in the 12% to 14% range. So by the end of 2014, we will have created incremental EBIT from capital expansions of more than $1 billion since Spectra Energy launched in '07. This growth is what's fueling the EPS CAGR of 8% to 10% I just mentioned.  With that, I'm going to turn things over to Pat, who will take you through the numbers."

As announced earlier today, Spectra Energy reported first quarter 2010 earnings of $358 million or $0.55 per share, compared with $298 million or $0.47 per share in the first quarter of 2009. There were no special items in the 2010 quarter, but you'll recall that the 2009 first quarter included an $85 million after-tax special item gain at Field Services. After removing the effect of discontinued operations and special items, ongoing earnings for the quarter were $342 million or $0.53 per share, compared with $210 million or $0.33 per share last year.
We know that many of you focused on EBITDA, so the next slide provides a summary. As you can see here, ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $863 million, compared with $663 million in the first quarter of 2009, a 30% increase year-over-year. That increase reflects the strong cash generation capacity of our business, with every segment posting year-over-year improvement for the quarter.
Let's now take a look at our performance by business segment, beginning with our U.S. Transmission. U.S. Transmission reported first quarter EBIT of $247 million compared with $217 million in the first quarter of 2009. The second benefited from business expansion projects previously placed on this service, projects like Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline Phase IV, Steckman Ridge storage, Northern Bridge, Algonquin J-2 Expansion and our Moss Bluff in Egan Storage projects. Combined, these projects added about $25 million in earnings during the quarter, a significant contribution that serves our investors well, both now and over the long term. Now let's turn to distribution.
Distribution reported first quarter EBIT of $146 million compared with $152 million in the first quarter of 2009. The decrease is mainly due to lower customer usage, primarily driven by weather, which is more than 10% warmer than the same period last year, as well as by higher operating costs. The decrease was substantially offset by the effect of a stronger Canadian dollar.  
And notwithstanding the effects of a slowed economy, we're pleased that we continue to add customers. In the first quarter, Union Gas realized customer growth of close to 1%. Let's now look at Western Canada Transmission and Processing.
Western Canada reported first quarter EBIT of $119 million compared with $81 million in the first quarter of 2009. The segment benefited from improved results in the base [ph] Gathering and Processing business, primarily driven by higher contracted volumes from expansion projects, including West Doe, South Peace Pipeline and Fort Nelson. 
The segment also benefited from higher frac spreads at Empress as well as the effect of a stronger Canadian dollar. The Empress frac spread for the quarter averaged $8.99 compared with $3.40 during last year's quarter. However, the benefits of this higher frac spread were offset somewhat by higher extraction costs. Because lower volumes are flowing eastbound from Alberta, we're having to pay higher premiums to producers to attract gas into our Empress plant. 
I also want to make you aware that we expect to have two major plant turnarounds during the second quarter. One at our Empress plant, and another at one of our Grizzly Valley gathering and processing plants, both about three weeks in duration. You'll see the effect of these budgeted turnarounds next quarter in volumes, revenues and O&M costs. These turnarounds will affect EBIT by about $20 million next quarter, but we're taking into account when we put together our 2010 forecast. 
Let's now turn to Field Services. Field Services reported first quarter ongoing EBIT of $99 million compared with $15 million in the first quarter of 2009. The increase in ongoing earnings was primarily driven by higher commodity prices. 
During the first quarter of 2010, crude oil averaged $79 per barrel, compared with $43 in the prior-year quarter. And NYMEX natural gas averaged $5.30 per MMBtu versus $4.89 during the same period in 2009. And the NGL to crude relationship averaged 58% this quarter versus 56% last year. 
While natural gas liquids prices started out relatively higher early in the quarter, by the end of the quarter, they had come back to the $0.95 level we estimated for the year in our January outlook. It's a little early to know where liquids prices will settle out for the year, but right now, our 2010 curve indicates they'll remain close to our $0.95 estimate.
Like Western Canada, DCP Midstream will have some third-party plant turnarounds during the second quarter, which will affect their volumes next quarter. DCP Midstream paid distributions of $75 million to Spectra Energy during the quarter. And just last week, we received an additional $112 million in distributions, which underscores DCP's excellent first quarter performance. That brings our year-to-date DCP Midstream cash contribution to nearly $190 million.
Now let me turn to additional items for the quarter. Our other category reported net cost of $14 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared with net cost of $24 million in last year's quarter, reflecting lower corporate costs so far this year. Our interest expense was $159 million compared with $150 million in the first quarter of 2009.
The first quarter's effective tax rate was 21% compared with 31% last year. We had favorable audit settlements this quarter in Canada, which reduced the income tax expense by $24 million. After the effect of these settlements and with the benefit of lower Canadian tax rates this year, we now expect our annual effective rate to be in the 27% to 28% range.
I would note that given our significant Canadian presence and a substantial difference between tax rates in the U.S. and Canada, Spectra Energy generally have to lower effective tax rate compared with those in our industry who only have U.S. operations. And you can expect that trend to continue since we are making significant investments in Canada. 
The favorable Canadian currency change increased first quarter 2010 after-tax earnings by about $18 million. At the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-total capitalization ratio stood at 54.5%. We expect to be able to fund our CapEx program through a combination of internally generated funds and debt, while staying within the 55% to 60% range that we've targeted for debt. 
And at the quarter's close, we had total capacity  under our credit facilities of $2.7 billion and available liquidity of $2.3 billion. So that's an overview of our first quarter results. Needless to say, we feel good about where we are today and where we're headed. Our solid financial position allows us to execute on our 2010 business and operational plans, and keeps us on track to deliver a year-over-year 20% increase in 2010 earnings. 
So with that, Greg and I would be happy to take your questions."

And so you'll see the volume increases that we forecasted for you in January come back. Obviously, again, that's back-end loaded for the year."

But you're mentioning, at the same time, that you have to give some additional premiums to producers to attract volumes.

From a long-term perspective, again, it's probably in that $80 million range. Some of the years, we do a little bit better, when the frac gets going, that's exactly what the volume impact is going to be.

And obviously that creates a good opportunity for us from the Gulfstream project, which as you know has a joint venture with us and Williams. And we'll definitely look at that opportunity."

610501,100781584,67359,"Spectra Energy Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 04, 2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Spectra Energy Corp","Executives","Thanks very much, John, and good morning everybody. I have to start by saying that I'm indeed pleased with our first quarter results. Not only did our core fee-based businesses ran very well and meet our earnings expectations, but as anticipated, in fact,",992,"Thanks very much, John, and good morning everybody. I have to start by saying that I'm indeed pleased with our first quarter results. Not only did our core fee-based businesses ran very well and meet our earnings expectations, but as anticipated, in fact, probably a little better than anticipated, we saw the benefit of increased commodity prices, which created a very nice improvement in our DCP Midstream earnings. 
And with the successful completion of two expansion projects coming into service in the quarter, I believe investors are getting a very clear picture of the robust benefits of Spectra Energy's portfolio of natural gas businesses. 
Now low commodity prices have moderated somewhat and are now very much in line with our full-year expectations, which we laid out for you in January. The riding start we've achieved in the first quarter bolsters our confidence in meeting, and potentially exceeding, our 2010 earnings expectations. No doubt, this won't crystallize until well into the fourth quarter. As you know, second and third quarter earnings combined, typically account for only about 35% to 40% of our annual results. So it's a good start to 2010, and it's a start contrast to what we saw a year ago, and supports our expectations of 20% or so EPS growth this year over 2009 results.
Key drivers for the quarter included the following. First, the core fee-based businesses; Storage, Transmission, Distribution and Canadian Gathering and Processing performed well. You'll hear the details from Pat shortly, but the businesses are experiencing steady, profitable growth that serves customers and enables us to pay an attractive dividend.  As you recall, the vast majority of our 2010 EBIT will come from these fee-based businesses. 
Second, as I mentioned, strong commodity prices during most of the quarter, benefited not only Field Services segment, but also our Empress business. Third, we're ideally positioned in terms of expansion opportunities and realizing substantial growth. We're investing about $1 billion annually for the next several years as we've done for the last few years, and our projects are delivering returns above 12%. We'll place some $900 million of projects into service this year, significant projects that take natural gas to market and serve customers.  We're moving the projects forward on a fast path, too. 
In Canada, we completed our T-North project in January, which have compression at our Gordondale compressor site. We also placed into service the first of the Fort Nelson series of projects, the North Maxhamish Loop. And this project allows for timely transportation of incremental gas production from the Horn River Basin to our existing Fort Nelson processing plant. 
Another important milestone for this BC expansion was the approval by the National Energy Board for our new Fort Nelson North Processing Facility. This 250 million cubic feet per day plant is a key component of the overall Fort Nelson area expansion, which will provide significant new EBIT to our Western Canadian businesses. 
You'll recall that last fall, we signed contracts with producers for about 800 million cubic feet per day of gathering and processing capacity at our Fort Nelson facility. Above and beyond that expansion, we have two open seasons now underway. We're assessing interest in expanding the transportation service on our T-North system, which will provide additional take away capacity from the area, as well as additional gas gathering and processing service in the Fort Nelson area. While the open seasons don't conclude until later this week, ongoing producer interest could result in another significant wave of infrastructure investment in various convier [ph](13:02) by Spectra Energy.
Good things are happening down south as well. In March, we signed a 25-year contract with TVA for an extension of our East Tennessee Natural Gas System. This expansion, the Northeast Tennessee project, or NET as we call it, will benefit both Spectra Energy and our MLP, Spectra Energy Partners.  The $135 million project will provide transportation service to TVA's new gas-fired power plant, and is slated to be in service during the second half of 2011. 
With a lot of expansion efforts underway in the Northeast U.S., and our most recent accomplishment was the execution of another contract on our Texas Eastern Appalachian Market supply, or TEAM 2012 project. Chesapeake Utilities signed a 15-year agreement for 40 million cubic per day. And this contract, when we combine it with the anchor contract we signed late last year with Range Resources, brings the TEAM 2012 capacity to 190 million cubic feet per day. 
As you might recall, this approximately $200 million expansion allows us to access Marcellus Shale gas in Southwestern Pennsylvania and transport it to market. And then finally, DCP Midstream is also pursuing a number of great opportunities. You might recall, that when we shared our 2010 outlook with you in January, our DCP Midstream slide had an unchecked box to South Texas opportunities, particularly around the Eagle Ford. Well, you can check that one up. I'm pleased to report that our project in Eagle Ford will begin flowing gas any day now, which will contribute to continued growth at DCP Midstream.
The momentum we experienced across our business segments gives us confidence in Spectra Energy's ability to deliver on our 2010 to 2012 compound annual growth rate in the 8% to 10% range. And we're continuing to build upon our successful record of project execution. Here's the bottom line. For over the next five years, we fully expect to invest about $5 billion in expansion capital, realize incremental annual EBIT of $600 million to $700 million, for a return on that capital in the 12% to 14% range. So by the end of 2014, we will have created incremental EBIT from capital expansions of more than $1 billion since Spectra Energy launched in '07. This growth is what's fueling the EPS CAGR of 8% to 10% I just mentioned.  With that, I'm going to turn things over to Pat, who will take you through the numbers."

As announced earlier today, Spectra Energy reported first quarter 2010 earnings of $358 million or $0.55 per share, compared with $298 million or $0.47 per share in the first quarter of 2009. There were",1120,"Well, thank you, Greg, and good morning, everybody. As announced earlier today, Spectra Energy reported first quarter 2010 earnings of $358 million or $0.55 per share, compared with $298 million or $0.47 per share in the first quarter of 2009. There were no special items in the 2010 quarter, but you'll recall that the 2009 first quarter included an $85 million after-tax special item gain at Field Services. After removing the effect of discontinued operations and special items, ongoing earnings for the quarter were $342 million or $0.53 per share, compared with $210 million or $0.33 per share last year.
We know that many of you focused on EBITDA, so the next slide provides a summary. As you can see here, ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $863 million, compared with $663 million in the first quarter of 2009, a 30% increase year-over-year. That increase reflects the strong cash generation capacity of our business, with every segment posting year-over-year improvement for the quarter.
Let's now take a look at our performance by business segment, beginning with our U.S. Transmission. U.S. Transmission reported first quarter EBIT of $247 million compared with $217 million in the first quarter of 2009. The second benefited from business expansion projects previously placed on this service, projects like Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline Phase IV, Steckman Ridge storage, Northern Bridge, Algonquin J-2 Expansion and our Moss Bluff in Egan Storage projects. Combined, these projects added about $25 million in earnings during the quarter, a significant contribution that serves our investors well, both now and over the long term. Now let's turn to distribution.
Distribution reported first quarter EBIT of $146 million compared with $152 million in the first quarter of 2009. The decrease is mainly due to lower customer usage, primarily driven by weather, which is more than 10% warmer than the same period last year, as well as by higher operating costs. The decrease was substantially offset by the effect of a stronger Canadian dollar.  
And notwithstanding the effects of a slowed economy, we're pleased that we continue to add customers. In the first quarter, Union Gas realized customer growth of close to 1%. Let's now look at Western Canada Transmission and Processing.
Western Canada reported first quarter EBIT of $119 million compared with $81 million in the first quarter of 2009. The segment benefited from improved results in the base Gathering and Processing business, primarily driven by higher contracted volumes from expansion projects, including West Doe, South Peace Pipeline and Fort Nelson. 
The segment also benefited from higher frac spreads at Empress as well as the effect of a stronger Canadian dollar. The Empress frac spread for the quarter averaged $8.99 compared with $3.40 during last year's quarter. However, the benefits of this higher frac spread were offset somewhat by higher extraction costs. Because lower volumes are flowing eastbound from Alberta, we're having to pay higher premiums to producers to attract gas into our Empress plant. 
I also want to make you aware that we expect to have two major plant turnarounds during the second quarter. One at our Empress plant, and another at one of our Grizzly Valley gathering and processing plants, both about three weeks in duration. You'll see the effect of these budgeted turnarounds next quarter in volumes, revenues and O&M costs. These turnarounds will affect EBIT by about $20 million next quarter, but we're taking into account when we put together our 2010 forecast. 
Let's now turn to Field Services. Field Services reported first quarter ongoing EBIT of $99 million compared with $15 million in the first quarter of 2009. The increase in ongoing earnings was primarily driven by higher commodity prices. 
During the first quarter of 2010, crude oil averaged $79 per barrel, compared with $43 in the prior-year quarter. And NYMEX natural gas averaged $5.30 per MMBtu versus $4.89 during the same period in 2009. And the NGL to crude relationship averaged 58% this quarter versus 56% last year. 
While natural gas liquids prices started out relatively higher early in the quarter, by the end of the quarter, they had come back to the $0.95 level we estimated for the year in our January outlook. It's a little early to know where liquids prices will settle out for the year, but right now, our 2010 curve indicates they'll remain close to our $0.95 estimate.
Like Western Canada, DCP Midstream will have some third-party plant turnarounds during the second quarter, which will affect their volumes next quarter. DCP Midstream paid distributions of $75 million to Spectra Energy during the quarter. And just last week, we received an additional $112 million in distributions, which underscores DCP's excellent first quarter performance. That brings our year-to-date DCP Midstream cash contribution to nearly $190 million.
Now let me turn to additional items for the quarter. Our other category reported net cost of $14 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared with net cost of $24 million in last year's quarter, reflecting lower corporate costs so far this year. Our interest expense was $159 million compared with $150 million in the first quarter of 2009.
The first quarter's effective tax rate was 21% compared with 31% last year. We had favorable audit settlements this quarter in Canada, which reduced the income tax expense by $24 million. After the effect of these settlements and with the benefit of lower Canadian tax rates this year, we now expect our annual effective rate to be in the 27% to 28% range.
I would note that given our significant Canadian presence and a substantial difference between tax rates in the U.S. and Canada, Spectra Energy generally have to lower effective tax rate compared with those in our industry who only have U.S. operations. And you can expect that trend to continue since we are making significant investments in Canada. 
The favorable Canadian currency change increased first quarter 2010 after-tax earnings by about $18 million. At the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-total capitalization ratio stood at 54.5%. We expect to be able to fund our CapEx program through a combination of internally generated funds and debt, while staying within the 55% to 60% range that we've targeted for debt. 
And at the quarter's close, we had total capacity  under our credit facilities of $2.7 billion and available liquidity of $2.3 billion. So that's an overview of our first quarter results. Needless to say, we feel good about where we are today and where we're headed. Our solid financial position allows us to execute on our 2010 business and operational plans, and keeps us on track to deliver a year-over-year 20% increase in 2010 earnings. 
So with that, Greg and I would be happy to take your questions."

So people are paying for a reservation charge through the plant. So you may see some volumes move up and down, and still expect them to grow over time. But you'll still bring in revenue. So our contracted revenue moved up, just like it would in the pipeline in Western Canada. And that's why the volume look is different than what you'd see in the United States. With respect to Empress, no doubt, has -- the less gas coming out of Alberta, if you will, that can have some impacts on Empress' operations. But they're doing a good job attracting gas to our plant. As Pat mentioned, we're paying some higher premiums. But with what I think is a long term trend to see a significant difference in the value of oil versus natural gas, which is domestic, you're going to see strong frac spreads there. And obviously, that's beneficial to the company."

610501,100781584,67378,"Spectra Energy Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, May 04, 2010",2010-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Spectra Energy Corp","Executives","Thanks very much, John, and good morning everybody. I have to start by saying that I'm indeed pleased with our first quarter results. Not only did our core fee-based businesses ran very well and meet our earnings expectations, but as anticipated, in fact,",992,"Thanks very much, John, and good morning everybody. I have to start by saying that I'm indeed pleased with our first quarter results. Not only did our core fee-based businesses ran very well and meet our earnings expectations, but as anticipated, in fact, probably a little better than anticipated, we saw the benefit of increased commodity prices, which created a very nice improvement in our DCP Midstream earnings. 
And with the successful completion of two expansion projects coming into service in the quarter, I believe investors are getting a very clear picture of the robust benefits of Spectra Energy's portfolio of natural gas businesses. 
Now low commodity prices have moderated somewhat and are now very much in line with our full-year expectations, which we laid out for you in January. The riding start we've achieved in the first quarter bolsters our confidence in meeting, and potentially exceeding, our 2010 earnings expectations. No doubt, this won't crystallize until well into the fourth quarter. As you know, second and third quarter earnings combined, typically account for only about 35% to 40% of our annual results. So it's a good start to 2010, and it's a start contrast to what we saw a year ago, and supports our expectations of 20% or so EPS growth this year over 2009 results.
Key drivers for the quarter included the following. First, the core fee-based businesses; Storage, Transmission, Distribution and Canadian Gathering and Processing performed well. You'll hear the details from Pat shortly, but the businesses are experiencing steady, profitable growth that serves customers and enables us to pay an attractive dividend.  As you recall, the vast majority of our 2010 EBIT will come from these fee-based businesses. 
Second, as I mentioned, strong commodity prices during most of the quarter, benefited not only Field Services segment, but also our Empress business. Third, we're ideally positioned in terms of expansion opportunities and realizing substantial growth. We're investing about $1 billion annually for the next several years as we've done for the last few years, and our projects are delivering returns above 12%. We'll place some $900 million of projects into service this year, significant projects that take natural gas to market and serve customers.  We're moving the projects forward on a fast path, too. 
In Canada, we completed our T-North project in January, which have compression at our Gordondale compressor site. We also placed into service the first of the Fort Nelson series of projects, the North Maxhamish Loop. And this project allows for timely transportation of incremental gas production from the Horn River Basin to our existing Fort Nelson processing plant. 
Another important milestone for this BC expansion was the approval by the National Energy Board for our new Fort Nelson North Processing Facility. This 250 million cubic feet per day plant is a key component of the overall Fort Nelson area expansion, which will provide significant new EBIT to our Western Canadian businesses. 
You'll recall that last fall, we signed contracts with producers for about 800 million cubic feet per day of gathering and processing capacity at our Fort Nelson facility. Above and beyond that expansion, we have two open seasons now underway. We're assessing interest in expanding the transportation service on our T-North system, which will provide additional take away capacity from the area, as well as additional gas gathering and processing service in the Fort Nelson area. While the open seasons don't conclude until later this week, ongoing producer interest could result in another significant wave of infrastructure investment in various convier [ph](13:02) by Spectra Energy.
Good things are happening down south as well. In March, we signed a 25-year contract with TVA for an extension of our East Tennessee Natural Gas System. This expansion, the Northeast Tennessee project, or NET as we call it, will benefit both Spectra Energy and our MLP, Spectra Energy Partners.  The $135 million project will provide transportation service to TVA's new gas-fired power plant, and is slated to be in service during the second half of 2011. 
With a lot of expansion efforts underway in the Northeast U.S., and our most recent accomplishment was the execution of another contract on our Texas Eastern Appalachian Market supply, or TEAM 2012 project. Chesapeake Utilities signed a 15-year agreement for 40 million cubic per day. And this contract, when we combine it with the anchor contract we signed late last year with Range Resources, brings the TEAM 2012 capacity to 190 million cubic feet per day. 
As you might recall, this approximately $200 million expansion allows us to access Marcellus Shale gas in Southwestern Pennsylvania and transport it to market. And then finally, DCP Midstream is also pursuing a number of great opportunities. You might recall, that when we shared our 2010 outlook with you in January, our DCP Midstream slide had an unchecked box to South Texas opportunities, particularly around the Eagle Ford. Well, you can check that one up. I'm pleased to report that our project in Eagle Ford will begin flowing gas any day now, which will contribute to continued growth at DCP Midstream.
The momentum we experienced across our business segments gives us confidence in Spectra Energy's ability to deliver on our 2010 to 2012 compound annual growth rate in the 8% to 10% range. And we're continuing to build upon our successful record of project execution. Here's the bottom line. For over the next five years, we fully expect to invest about $5 billion in expansion capital, realize incremental annual EBIT of $600 million to $700 million, for a return on that capital in the 12% to 14% range. So by the end of 2014, we will have created incremental EBIT from capital expansions of more than $1 billion since Spectra Energy launched in '07. This growth is what's fueling the EPS CAGR of 8% to 10% I just mentioned.  With that, I'm going to turn things over to Pat, who will take you through the numbers."

As announced earlier today, Spectra Energy reported first quarter 2010 earnings of $358 million or $0.55 per share, compared with $298 million or $0.47 per share in the first quarter of 2009. There were",1120,"Well, thank you, Greg, and good morning, everybody. As announced earlier today, Spectra Energy reported first quarter 2010 earnings of $358 million or $0.55 per share, compared with $298 million or $0.47 per share in the first quarter of 2009. There were no special items in the 2010 quarter, but you'll recall that the 2009 first quarter included an $85 million after-tax special item gain at Field Services. After removing the effect of discontinued operations and special items, ongoing earnings for the quarter were $342 million or $0.53 per share, compared with $210 million or $0.33 per share last year.
We know that many of you focused on EBITDA, so the next slide provides a summary. As you can see here, ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $863 million, compared with $663 million in the first quarter of 2009, a 30% increase year-over-year. That increase reflects the strong cash generation capacity of our business, with every segment posting year-over-year improvement for the quarter.
Let's now take a look at our performance by business segment, beginning with our U.S. Transmission. U.S. Transmission reported first quarter EBIT of $247 million compared with $217 million in the first quarter of 2009. The second benefited from business expansion projects previously placed on this service, projects like Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline Phase IV, Steckman Ridge storage, Northern Bridge, Algonquin J-2 Expansion and our Moss Bluff in Egan Storage projects. Combined, these projects added about $25 million in earnings during the quarter, a significant contribution that serves our investors well, both now and over the long term. Now let's turn to distribution.
Distribution reported first quarter EBIT of $146 million compared with $152 million in the first quarter of 2009. The decrease is mainly due to lower customer usage, primarily driven by weather, which is more than 10% warmer than the same period last year, as well as by higher operating costs. The decrease was substantially offset by the effect of a stronger Canadian dollar.  
And notwithstanding the effects of a slowed economy, we're pleased that we continue to add customers. In the first quarter, Union Gas realized customer growth of close to 1%. Let's now look at Western Canada Transmission and Processing.
Western Canada reported first quarter EBIT of $119 million compared with $81 million in the first quarter of 2009. The segment benefited from improved results in the base Gathering and Processing business, primarily driven by higher contracted volumes from expansion projects, including West Doe, South Peace Pipeline and Fort Nelson. 
The segment also benefited from higher frac spreads at Empress as well as the effect of a stronger Canadian dollar. The Empress frac spread for the quarter averaged $8.99 compared with $3.40 during last year's quarter. However, the benefits of this higher frac spread were offset somewhat by higher extraction costs. Because lower volumes are flowing eastbound from Alberta, we're having to pay higher premiums to producers to attract gas into our Empress plant. 
I also want to make you aware that we expect to have two major plant turnarounds during the second quarter. One at our Empress plant, and another at one of our Grizzly Valley gathering and processing plants, both about three weeks in duration. You'll see the effect of these budgeted turnarounds next quarter in volumes, revenues and O&M costs. These turnarounds will affect EBIT by about $20 million next quarter, but we're taking into account when we put together our 2010 forecast. 
Let's now turn to Field Services. Field Services reported first quarter ongoing EBIT of $99 million compared with $15 million in the first quarter of 2009. The increase in ongoing earnings was primarily driven by higher commodity prices. 
During the first quarter of 2010, crude oil averaged $79 per barrel, compared with $43 in the prior-year quarter. And NYMEX natural gas averaged $5.30 per MMBtu versus $4.89 during the same period in 2009. And the NGL to crude relationship averaged 58% this quarter versus 56% last year. 
While natural gas liquids prices started out relatively higher early in the quarter, by the end of the quarter, they had come back to the $0.95 level we estimated for the year in our January outlook. It's a little early to know where liquids prices will settle out for the year, but right now, our 2010 curve indicates they'll remain close to our $0.95 estimate.
Like Western Canada, DCP Midstream will have some third-party plant turnarounds during the second quarter, which will affect their volumes next quarter. DCP Midstream paid distributions of $75 million to Spectra Energy during the quarter. And just last week, we received an additional $112 million in distributions, which underscores DCP's excellent first quarter performance. That brings our year-to-date DCP Midstream cash contribution to nearly $190 million.
Now let me turn to additional items for the quarter. Our other category reported net cost of $14 million in the first quarter of 2010, compared with net cost of $24 million in last year's quarter, reflecting lower corporate costs so far this year. Our interest expense was $159 million compared with $150 million in the first quarter of 2009.
The first quarter's effective tax rate was 21% compared with 31% last year. We had favorable audit settlements this quarter in Canada, which reduced the income tax expense by $24 million. After the effect of these settlements and with the benefit of lower Canadian tax rates this year, we now expect our annual effective rate to be in the 27% to 28% range.
I would note that given our significant Canadian presence and a substantial difference between tax rates in the U.S. and Canada, Spectra Energy generally have to lower effective tax rate compared with those in our industry who only have U.S. operations. And you can expect that trend to continue since we are making significant investments in Canada. 
The favorable Canadian currency change increased first quarter 2010 after-tax earnings by about $18 million. At the end of the first quarter, our debt-to-total capitalization ratio stood at 54.5%. We expect to be able to fund our CapEx program through a combination of internally generated funds and debt, while staying within the 55% to 60% range that we've targeted for debt. 
And at the quarter's close, we had total capacity  under our credit facilities of $2.7 billion and available liquidity of $2.3 billion. So that's an overview of our first quarter results. Needless to say, we feel good about where we are today and where we're headed. Our solid financial position allows us to execute on our 2010 business and operational plans, and keeps us on track to deliver a year-over-year 20% increase in 2010 earnings. 
So with that, Greg and I would be happy to take your questions."

That being said, at the wellhead, we saw about a 1% increase quarter-over-quarter, and we would expect that to improve as we go through the latter half of the year and be in that 2% range. And again, it depends on the regions, places like Weld County, as we said, Permian, Port Arthur, et cetera, doing very well, other places where you actually do see declines. Obviously, if you compared our Q1 2010 with Q1 2009, up a little bit. And our '10 average, we'd expect to increase further.

As you have seen from our earnings release this morning, Spectra Energy delivered ongoing second quarter results of $174 million dollars or $0.27 per share.As you know, we only provide annual EPS guida",1554,"Thanks very much, John, and good morning everybody. As you have seen from our earnings release this morning, Spectra Energy delivered ongoing second quarter results of $174 million dollars or $0.27 per share.
As you know, we only provide annual EPS guidance but I can tell you that our second quarter performance exceeded our expectations and we're nicely ahead of where we thought we would be at this point in the year. We feel positive about the remainder of 2010, particularly with our typically strong fourth quarter yet to come.
In addition to meeting our earnings targets, we have been busy executing on future growth plans and delivering value. Key drivers for the quarter included, first, our core fee-based businesses, U.S. Transmission and Storage, Distribution, and Canadian Gathering and Processing performed well, up more than 10% from last year's second quarter.
You will hear the details from Pat shortly but the businesses are experiencing steady, profitable growth from expansion projects. You'll also recall that the vast majority of our 2010 EBIT will come from these fee-based businesses which support our dividend.
Second, commodity prices have improved significantly from the lows we saw in the second quarter of 2009, and our Field Services segment benefited from that improvement with earnings up significantly. Third, during the quarter we continued to actively execute on our growth plan through a strategic acquisition, project expansions at our fee-based businesses as well as growing the footprint at DCP Midstream.
I'll provide more detail on these in a moment, but will point out here that in sum they affirm the compelling earnings potential and strength of our portfolio of businesses. Spectra Energy continues to be ideally positioned in terms of expansion opportunities and we're realizing substantial growth.
I'd like to talk about one of those opportunities in development, our Bobcat Storage acquisition. In mid July we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire 100% of the Bobcat Storage assets and development project for $540 million. In addition to the $540 million, we expect to invest another 400 to 450 million to fully develop the Bobcat assets. Operating capacity for the two caverns currently in service stands at 18 Bcf.
Cavern 3 is under construction and expected to be in service in 2012 and we expect the project's full capacity to grow to 46 Bcf by 2015 when all five salt domes are fully developed. As you'd expect, the incremental returns in the final two caverns developed will be substantially higher than the first three and that supports the value of this project.
Caverns 1 and 2 are operational with about 85% of their capacity contracted and we'll contract the capacity of caverns 3, 4 and 5 closer to their in-service dates consistent with how storage in this market is typically contracted. We plan to finance this acquisition and development through a combination of cash and debt and expect to close the transaction by year end, subject to Hart Scott Rodino approval.
We're extremely pleased with this opportunity which supports our goal of deploying at least $1 billion a year in gross CapEx and which, upon completion should offer returns on capital employed in the 10% to 12% range.
Here is what drew us to the Bobcat acquisition and why it will deliver premium value to our customers and investors. Natural gas storage is key to our business and this project, once complete, will ensure Spectra Energy's position as one of the largest salt dome storage providers in the Southeast.
These assets are high deliverability facilities which offer the advantage of high withdrawal and injection rates. As we've seen this summer, power producers and marketers need and value the flexibility and rapid responsiveness of salt dome storage.
We're providing customers with a lot more flexibility here. The Bobcat assets are ideally positioned in proximity to our existing storage and pipeline infrastructure and can be easily integrated into our Gulf Coast storage and pipeline assets.
The Bobcat facility is likewise well situated to serve expanding Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast gas fired power generation requirements. As you can see on the map, Bobcat interconnects with our Texas Eastern system and with other major interstate pipelines like Transco and Gulf South, allowing Spectra Energy to provide customers with improved access to key U.S. markets.
Finally, the need for natural gas storage is apparent given the abundance of shale gas, the continued conversion of coal and oil fired electric generation to natural gas and future LNG imports. With the Bobcat completion, Spectra Energy will own almost 100 Bcf of Gulf Coast salt dome storage capacity and we expect to realize approximately $100 million of EBIT annually from the Bobcat storage assets, beginning in 2015.
Now let me move on to another significant project that we also announced in the second quarter, this one in Western Canada. In June we announced plans to meet customer demand in the Montney play of Northeast British Columbia by building a new 200 million cubic feet a day gas plant west of Dawson Creek.
The Dawson project, which is fully contracted on a fixed fee basis, is an important part of our growth strategy. It will be built in two phases with the first 100 million a day of capacity expected to be available in late 2011 and the remaining capacity in early 2013. We anticipate this project will provide returns on capital employed at the high-end of our 10 to 12% range.
The Dawson project extends our asset base in the Montney play. The Montney expansions, coupled with our significant Horn River projects, bring our investment underway in Northeast British Columbia to about $1.5 billion.
DCP Midstream also continues to move forward on a number of expansions to meet growth and customer drilling initiatives around its liquids rich footprint. So let's take a quick look at a few opportunities that they're pursuing.
In the Eagleford, DCP is laying additional pipe to connect producers to nearly 250 million cubic feet a day of its existing processing capacity which will be available, beginning in 2011. In the Permian Basin DCP is restarting and expanding its Roberts Ranch processing facility to provide up to 70 million a day of capacity for the Wolfberry region beginning in September. And they're adding new gathering and processing capacity for Avalon Shale volumes being developed now in southeast New Mexico.
In the DJ Basin just north of Denver, DCP's 125 million cubic feet a day of capacity expansion is proceeding well and should be in service by January. And in May, DCP signed a letter of intent to form a natural gas processing and liquids infrastructure joint venture to serve EQT and third party customers in the Marcellus and Huron plays. Once completed, the JV will be the preferred processor for EQT's natural gas in those areas. We expect to complete the JV agreement sometime in the third quarter.
EQT has an industry leading E&P position in the Appalachian basin with more than 3 million firmly held acres, an established cost structure and expanding gas production profile. Given DCP Midstream's strong financial position, they're able to fund growth from their own balance sheet and continue to provide us with healthy distributions that we in turn invest in our own fee-based expansion projects.
As we've mentioned many times before, Spectra Energy expects to invest at least $1 billion annually over the next several years in fee- based expansion projects. We have a great backlog of these projects. So let's take a look at some of those.
I won't go through this map in detail, but we like to share it with you regularly as it provides a clear view of the projects we have in execution as well as future opportunities for ongoing growth. In addition to the projects I just mentioned, we're making good progress on our full expansion roster. We have added a new project in Ontario, the Jacob Storage project, expected to be in service by the second half of 2012.
The Hot Spring lateral in Arkansas is an expansion of our Texas Eastern system and will provide firm capacity to KGen's Hot Spring power plant. In April our board approved the Northeastern Tennessee Project or NET. So we've moved that one into execution.
NET will provide transportation service to TVA's new gas-fired power plant and is slated to be in service during the second half of 2011. We've talked in previous quarters about the growth potential associated with our Fort Nelson projects. As we forecasted in January, these projects should begin contributing significant earnings in the fourth quarter.
That's a quick snapshot, but I think it gives you a sense of the momentum we're experiencing across all segments as well as confidence in our ability to deliver 2010 to 2012 compound annual EPS growth in the 8 to 10% range.
I'm pleased with the quarter and where we stand at the half year mark. We're in line with, and frankly ahead of where we thought we would be on all fronts -- financial, strategic, safety and operational. We still of course have our important fourth quarter ahead of us, but we are in a great place to deliver on expectations for the year.
So with that let me turn things over to Pat who will walk you through the numbers for the quarter.

As we announced earlier today, Spectra Energy reported second quarter 2010 ongoing earnings of $174 million or $0.27 per share compared with 141 million or $0.22 per share in the second quarter of 2009.And as",1443,"Thank you, Greg, and good morning everyone. As we announced earlier today, Spectra Energy reported second quarter 2010 ongoing earnings of $174 million or $0.27 per share compared with 141 million or $0.22 per share in the second quarter of 2009.
And as Greg told you, this year-over-year increase of more than 20% reflects the solid progress we have made on executing our growth projects, a more favorable Canadian exchange rate and improved commodity prices this year as compared to last year.
We're very pleased with this progress in the first six months of 2010. While we benefited from macro factors like higher commodity prices and a stronger Canadian dollar, we also continue to focus on factors that we can influence.
For example, we continue to see increases in EBIT from projects previously placed into service and we expect to place six projects totaling 900 million of investment in full or partial service by year end generating ROCE's greater than 12%.
We've controlled our operating and maintenance expenses to levels consistent with our previous guidance and we've been opportunistic in financing the business by timing our debt issuances to capture historically low interest rates.
Our core fee-based businesses performed in line with our expectations and we expanded our gathering and processing contracted volumes in Western Canada. At the same time we maintained our balance sheet strength and improved our debt coverage ratios since the end of 2009. These accomplishments helped us to buffer certain headwinds in the first six months and position us to meet or slightly exceed our expectations for the full year.
We know many of you focus on EBITDA. So the next slide provides this information by business segment. Ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $657 million, compared with 579 million in the second quarter of 2009. The year-to-date increase of almost $300 million reflects the strong cash generation capacity of our business with every segment delivering solid results.
Let's now take a look at our performance by business segment beginning with U.S. Transmission. U.S. Transmission reported second quarter EBIT of $223 million, compared with 234 million in the second quarter of 2009. Second quarter 2009 results included a net $24 million benefit related to project development costs. Before the effect of this 2009 item, EBIT increased by over 6% compared with last year's quarter.
During the 2010 quarter the segment benefited from business expansion projects previously placed into service including GulfStream Phase III, Algonquin J-2 and Northern Bridge. In addition, the segment benefited from higher processing revenues as a result of higher prices.
Now let's move onto Distribution. Even in these challenging economic times Union Gas continues to make solid contributions to our earnings and to grow their customer base. Distribution reported second quarter EBIT of $73 million, compared with 40 million in 2009.
This improvement is primarily due to a stronger Canadian dollar and lower operating fuel costs. In addition, the second quarter 2009 results included an $11 million charge for a cumulative adjustment to the 2008 earnings sharing required under Union Gas's incentive rate making methodology.
So let me now turn to Western Canada. Western Canada Transmission and Processing reported second quarter EBIT of $69 million, compared with 58 million in 2009. The segment benefited from improved results in the base gathering and processing business, primarily driven by additional contracted volumes from expansions including Fort Nelson, South Peace Pipeline and West Doe. The segment also benefited from the effect of a stronger Canadian dollar.
These improvements were partially offset by lower earnings at Empress due to a scheduled maintenance shutdown that kept the plant out of service for most of the month of May. The Empress frac spread for the quarter averaged $8.03, compared with $4.98 during last year's quarter.
However, we experienced higher extraction premiums paid to shippers this quarter which dampened the effects of the increased frac spread. Indeed we continue to see much higher than historical extraction premiums at Empress.
Let's turn now to Field Services. Our Field Services segment, which represents Spectra Energy's 50% interest in DCP Midstream reported second quarter EBIT of $58 million, compared with 24 million in the second quarter of 2009. The increase in ongoing earnings was primarily driven by higher commodity prices.
During the second quarter of 2010 both higher crude oil prices and the NGL to oil relationship produced an NGL average price of $0.91 per gallon, versus $0.62 last year and NYMEX natural gas averaged $4.09 per MMBtu, versus $3.50 during the same period in 2009.
Second quarter results also reflect the benefit of non-cash mark-to-market gains on hedges used to protect distributable cash flow at DCP Midstream's master limited partnership. The increase in earnings was partially offset by lower marketing results and the timing of higher planned, repair and maintenance costs this year.
DCP Midstream paid distributions of $112 million to Spectra Energy during the second quarter and we're on track to receive the anticipated 300 million of total distributions for the full year. In the first six months we've seen NGL prices average $1.03.
With the recent softening we have seen, it looks like the full year price will be close to our forecast of $0.95 a gallon and at this point in time it appears that DCP Midstream's 2010 EBIT contribution will be about where we forecasted it when we had our meetings with you in January.
Now let me turn to additional items for the quarter. Other reported net costs of $16 million in the second quarter of 2010 compared with net costs of 12 million in last year's quarter. Interest expense was 158 million, compared with 146 million in the second quarter of 2009. This increase is primarily the result of a stronger Canadian dollar.
The second quarter's effective tax rate was 29%, compared with 30% last year. In terms of the stronger Canadian currency and its positive effect on our Canadian businesses during the quarter, I'll remind you that FX also affects interest expense and income taxes. The after tax currency effect on all of these factors provide an increase to second quarter net income of about $8 million, compared with the second quarter of last year.
At the end of the second quarter our debt to total capitalization ratio stood at 55.2%. We expect to be able to fund our CapEx program through a combination of internally generated funds and debt while staying within the 55 to 60% leverage range that we targeted. And at the quarter's close we had total capacity under our credit facilities of $2.7 billion and available liquidity of nearly 2 billion.
Just last month we executed two very successful debt issuances at our Canadian businesses. At West Coast we issued C$250 million of 10-year notes at a coupon of 4.57% and at Union Gas we issued 250 million of 30-year notes at 5.2% which represents the lowest 30 year coupon in Union's history. The proceeds of these issuances will be used to refinance current maturities and to fund expansion of our Canadian businesses.
Both Moody's and S&P affirmed our investment grade ratings this quarter. Our strong financial position provides us with tremendous flexibility and reach and we can choose between a number of financing options including, when appropriate, using our equity at Spectra Energy Partners to finance growth. So we've a lot of arrows in our financing quiver and we'll be sure to use the best ones at the right time.
So just to wrap up, Spectra Energy delivered a second quarter of solid results from all of our business segments. We're comfortable with where we are at mid-year which is actually a bit ahead of where we'd expected to be. Although our fourth quarter earnings will depend on both weather and commodity prices, we feel very good about being in a position to exceed our EPS guidance for the year.
We've made good progress on our capital expansion plans. Our core businesses delivered admirable performance and we captured the positive effects of higher commodity prices at our DCP Midstream business. We described for you how well positioned we are in terms of expansion opportunities; real, substantial, fee-based growth that affirms the strength of our diverse and robust portfolio.
We're equally well positioned financially with strong cash flow, stable investment grade credit ratings, ample liquidity, and excellent access to capital needed to fund our growth. Again, Spectra Energy delivered a great first half of the year and we have every confidence that we'll have a solid second half as we continue to focus on strategic execution, expansion and earnings growth.
So with that, Greg and I would now be happy to take your questions.

Obviously we've come back a long way from the last year. I think in the second quarter you're contrasting against what was a very strong first quarter and I think there were some factors that may have pushed it down.
Obviously people were more concerned about the economy. People weren't sure where autos, et cetera, were going. We had a number of the steam crackers that had outages that lasted longer which allowed for a build up in inventories which kept prices down.
But I see things like increases in auto sales up 5%. That's important for plastics. That's good for NGLs. Obviously we're going to head into the winter and crop drying and exports. So I think we feel very comfortable about our $0.95 overall forecast for the year.
Longer term I think the big driver is how the economy moves forward, frankly and what I see is the chance of a double dip probably declining. It's still out there. I would suggest that bodes well for liquids prices even with the new supplies coming on.

In January, when we gave our guidance, we mentioned that we do an internal three-year plan that goes out through 2012. And that plan showed that even with incremental growth CapEx each year of at least $1 billion that we wouldn't need to issue equity to preserve our credit metrics and our credit rating. And as we looked at the Bobcat acquisition, that really doesn't change. For a Company with $24 billion in assets and little bit about 9.8 billion in debt today, targeting around 11 billion of debt by year end, an acquisition in the $0.5 billion range really doesn't move the needle much on our FFO to debt or FFO to interest.
And so we can, and expect to, finance the acquisition with a combination of internally generated cash and debt. And then the other 400 to 450 million for buildout CapEx comes over a period of four to five years, and it is something that we think we can absorb, again with debt, particularly as we're seeing such attractive interest rates.
With respect to Spectra Energy Partners, it is always a possibility and it is something that we look at concerning the attractiveness of dropping down assets and using their currency. And then, frankly, taking those proceeds to reduce debt at Spectra Energy and to issue some equity at Spectra Energy Partners which improves our balance sheet overall. So, while we don't have anything to announce today or any immediate plans, that is part of what we'll look at between now and year end.

So, it really shows the beauty of the portfolio where one element may be down but we've got other levers to pull.

I think right now, as you know, there is a number of proposals being kicked around, some bringing the liquids back to Belvieu. There is going to the East Coast and then shipping to Belvieu some going to Sarnia and then others going back further west.
At this point we're in a mode more of evaluating on the front end what do we think the liquids production is going to be and the timing of the need for an NGL solution out of the Marcellus. I think it is early on that, and I think the opportunity is going to be there, I think the need is going to be there, but we're at this point trying to evaluate the timing vis-à-vis what the drilling expectations are, what the quality of the gas is, so what the overall need will be.
And then we're at this point I think pretty flexible on where we think the ultimate solution is going to be. The good news is that there are several, or at least a few, opportunities which appear to be economic and realistic. And from our standpoint through our joint venture opportunity with EQT we expect to be handling a significant amount of liquids, so we think we can influence what ultimately gets done and at the end of the day would like to participate in the build-out of that solution.

You hear about lots of announcements. Obviously two critical components. One is it's salt dome storage which is what this is that we bought that has high deliverability, high flexibility, injection and withdrawal rates which is so critical to gas fired generation which is going to be increasing. And then you have the other kind of storage which is reservoir storage which is what would be like our Union Gas storage which is obviously valuable, particularly given its location closer to the market typically. but very different dynamics, as well. I think what you'll continue to see, and the value proposition, you will continue to see volatility, season-to-season, basis-to-basis around natural gas and that's where the real value opportunity exists. On top of that you see an increasing amount of gas-fired generation which is going to demand that type of high deliverability type service. So if you look in the Gulf Coast region where the Bobcat asset is, call it five years out, a T-and-a- half of storage of which we'd make up, call it 75 Bcf, so we're still a pretty small component of the storage piece.

As you’ve seen from our earnings release this morning, Spectra Energy delivered ongoing third quarter results of $201 million or $0.31 per share.We are pleased with the performance for the quarter an",1323,"Thanks very much, John, and good morning, everyone. As you’ve seen from our earnings release this morning, Spectra Energy delivered ongoing third quarter results of $201 million or $0.31 per share.
We are pleased with the performance for the quarter and feeling confident as we close in on year end. As you know the fourth quarter is typically strong for us and I would expect no less this year. If we experience normal weather during the fourth quarter and commodity prices remain consistent with where they are to-date, we expect to exceed our 20% earnings growth expectations for the year and our 2010 $1.42 in ongoing per share target.
We’ve been busy executing on the growth plan and there are a number of key drivers for the third quarter. First, our core fee based businesses, U.S. Transmission and Storage, Distribution and Western Canada performed well, up about 3.5% from last year. You’ll hear the details from Pat shortly, but the businesses are experiencing steady profitable growth from expansion projects.
As we’ve mentioned to you many times before, the vast majority of our 2010 EBIT will come from these fee based businesses. Second, our Field Services segment experienced significantly improved earnings, thanks primarily to commodity prices being more favorable than what we saw in the third quarter of 2009.
A note on the commodities, well NGL prices have been very much in line or plan. Natural gas prices are considerably lower than our assumptions for 2010. We’re watching natural gas price movement closely as we finalize our 2011 plan.
Third, we’ve maintained our steady focus on executing an attractive growth plan during the quarter through strategic acquisition, project expansions at our fee based business, as well as growing the footprint at DCP Midstream. Together they affirm the earnings and cash generation potential of our businesses.
We’ll walk through some of the projects that drive our growth beginning with those already in service. This year we’ve placed five projects with $900 million of investment in full or partial service. These projects will realize $200 million in annual EBIT in 2011, generating returns well above our targeted range. So let’s look at a few of these.
The Algonquin East-to-West project uses existing infrastructure on the Algonquin system to offer shippers the opportunity to reach growing Northeast markets by moving new sources of supply into existing delivery points throughout the region. A unique aspect of this project is the fact that it moves gas from east to west opposite the traditional flow pattern.
This capacity supports the delivery of LNG from facilities recently added to the Eastern portion of our system. We broke ground this spring on TEMAX TIME III and just days ago brought into service the first phase of this $700 million expansion. The second phase is scheduled to come into service in the last half of 2011.
The project will allow shippers to receive new natural gas supplies from western basins at various points along Texas Eastern through enhancement of the existing mainline as well as incremental expansion.
In Western Canada, we’re making great progress on our multiphase Fort Nelson expansion project, which is increasing capacity in Fort Nelson BC to accommodate Horn River gas.
We recently brought back into service almost 0.5 billion cubic feet a day of previously laid up capacity at our Fort Nelson plant. Other facets of this project include looping of area, gathering pipelines, the installation of new compression, and the construction of a new processing facility.
As a reminder, we’ve signed long-term contracts for the projects capacity of nearly 800 million cubic feet a day and we’ll bring the projects into service incrementally through 2012. I’d also note that we’re making progress on expansion projects in the Montney region. Our new Dawson plant will process raw gas from the South Peace region and is targeted to go into service in 2013.
We got a great backlog of projects in various stages of execution. So, let’s also take a look at some of those. I won’t go through this map in full detail, but we’d like to share this map with you as we do regularly. As it provides a clear view of the projects we have in execution.
So let’s begin by looking at two that are new to this map. Looking first at the Southeast, we closed this quarter on the acquisition of Bobcat Storage assets and the development project. In addition to the purchase price, we expect to invest an additional $400 million to $450 million to fully develop the facility by the end of 2015.
Moving to the Northeast, we are excited about our Texas Eastern Appalachian to Market project or TEAM 2012. This $200 million expansion of the Texas Eastern system will move customers’ gas supplies from the Marcellus region to premium Northeast markets.
TEAM 2012 is noteworthy in it represents our first expansion fully dedicated to moving Marcellus supply to market. Range Resources and Chesapeake Utilities have fully contracted this project, which is scheduled to go under service in November 2012.
We are continuing with the development of our New Jersey-New York Expansion of our Texas Eastern and Algonquin systems. This is an important project for customers in New Jersey and New York, and yet another segment of infrastructure that will connect new supply with increasing demand. We are on track with this project and moving forward with plans to file our FERC certificate in December. That’s a quick look at some of our most significant projects currently in execution.
Our other projects are progressing nicely as well and we’re achieving the expected returns on capital employed. We also see a number of other opportunities on the horizon to serve customers and create shareholder value, so let’s take a look at a couple of those.
Again, I won’t go into each element on this map, but rather point out some positive developments we’re pursuing. We see additional expansion opportunities in British Columbia beyond 2012-’13.
The Horn River Basin is estimated to contain some 500 trillion cubic feet of gas and the Montney is estimated to contain 450 Tcf, so combined we expect gathering, processing, and pipeline growth opportunities well into the future.
We continue to see growth opportunities along our system related to the planned conversion of coal and oil power generation to natural gas in the Southeast U.S., particularly in Florida.
The push for conversion to clean burning natural gas is also prevalent in the Midwestern states that have long relied on coal-based power production, so we see good opportunities related to power gen conversion along our Texas Eastern and the East Tennessee pipelines.
We also see opportunities for both Spectra Energy and DCP Midstream in the Marcellus region. Just last week you would have seen that Spectra Energy announced an Memorandum of Understanding to jointly develop the proposed Marcellus Ethane Pipeline System Project or MEPS with El Paso Midstream.
The MEPS project would transport ethane from fractionation plants in the Marcellus region to serve the nation’s largest petrochemical industry in the Gulf Coast area. This is an exciting additional opportunity for us.
In September, DCP Midstream and its master limited partnership, DPM, entered into an agreement with Magnum Hunter Resources to gather natural gas production in the Marcellus. DCP Midstream also continues to pursue attractive opportunities in both the Eagle Ford and in the Permian basins.
And it’s worth noting that DCP Midstream is able to fund growth from its own balance sheet and continue to provide Spectra Energy and Conoco with healthy cash contributions that we at Spectra in turn invest in our fee based expansion projects.
Again, we’re seeing excellent momentum in growth across all of our segments, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver strong shareholder value through a combination of earnings growth and dividends.
With that, let me turn things over to Pat, who will walk you through the numbers for the quarter.

As we announced earlier today, Spectra Energy reported third quarter 2010 ongoing earnings of $201 million compared with $190 million in the third quarter of 2009.Our earnings this quarter are consiste",1268,"Well, thank you, Greg, and good morning, everybody. As we announced earlier today, Spectra Energy reported third quarter 2010 ongoing earnings of $201 million compared with $190 million in the third quarter of 2009.
Our earnings this quarter are consistent with our expectations and equally important our year-to-date performance reflects solid progress on our capital expansion plans. As Greg mentioned, our core fee based businesses performed in line with our expectations. And we are continuing to realize earnings growth from expansion projects placed in service.
We know many of you focus on EBITDA, so the next slide provides this information by business segment. Ongoing EBITDA for the quarter was $695 million compared with $645 million in the third quarter of 2009, an increase of 8% quarter-over-quarter, and 17% year-over-year. That increase reflects the strong cash generation capacity of our business, with every segment delivering solid results.
Now, we’ll take a look at our performance by business segment beginning with U.S. Transmission. Third quarter 2009 results included a $21 million net benefit related to the capitalization of previously expensed project development costs, partially offset by $11 million charge from a non-cash regulatory accounting adjustment related to our Southeast Supply Header pipeline.
Consistent with our expectations, this segment benefited from business expansion projects like Northern Bridge, Market Hub Partners Egan Storage and Algonquin J-2. These benefits were partly offset by higher operating cost, primarily timing related. Now let’s turn to our distribution operations.
Distribution reported third quarter EBIT of $63 million compared with $48 million in 2009. This improvement is primarily due to increased usage by industrial customers, largely gas-fired power generation facilities; growth in the number of residential customers served; lower operating fuel costs; and a stronger Canadian dollar.
Of all of our business segments, Union Gas is most sensitive to weather impacts. As you know, the fourth quarter accounts for a significant portion of the full year’s earnings on average about 30% assuming normal winter weather.
Let’s turn now to Western Canada Transmission and Processing, which reported third quarter EBIT of $90 million compared with $84 million in 2009. The segment benefited from improved results in the base gathering and processing business, primarily driven by higher contracted volumes from expansions in non-conventional supply areas, including Fort Nelson, South Peace Pipeline and West Doe, partially offset by declines in conventional supply areas. The segment also benefited from the effect of a stronger Canadian dollar.
For the quarter Empress earnings are down just slightly with higher frac spreads being offset by rising extraction premiums. We will take the effect of higher extraction premiums into account as we develop our 2011 plan.
I’ll turn to Field Services. Our Field Services segment, which represents Spectra Energy’s 50% interest and DCP Midstream reported third quarter EBIT of $70 million compared with $45 million in the third quarter of 2009.
The increase in ongoing earnings was primarily driven by higher commodity prices, and an $11 million pre-tax gain associated with ongoing unit issuances by DCP Midstream’s master limited partnership. These increase and earnings were partially offset by reduced volumes in the Mid-Continent region.
Looking at commodity prices, during the third quarter crude oil averaged about $76 per barrel compared with $68 in the third quarter of last year. NGL prices per gallon averaged $0.87 compared with $0.69 in the third quarter of 2009, and NYMEX natural gas average $4.38 per million BTUs compared with $3.39 during the 2009 period.
Today however, natural gas prices are much closer to the third quarter 2009 levels with prompt month prices and the $3.50 to $4 range, and the current 12 months strip for natural gas is in the $4.25 to $4.50 range, significantly below the $5.50 price we use in developing our 2010 plan.
So, we are watching gas prices closely as we prepare our 2011 plan. We received $41 million of cash distributions from DCP Midstream during the third quarter, bring distributions to $228 million year-to-date, and we expect to receive distributions of about $300 million for the full year consistent with our 2010 plan.
Now let me turn to additional items for the quarter. Other reported net costs of $23 million in the third quarter of 2010 excluding $7 million charge we took for the resolution of a corporate litigation matter that arose prior to the 2007 spin-off of Spectra Energy from Duke.
Ongoing net costs were $16 million compared with $10 million in the third quarter of 2009. The stronger Canadian dollar increased third quarter 2010 net income by $5 million compared with the third quarter of 2009.
Interest expense was $159 million for our third quarter compared with $160 million in last year’s third quarter. Third quarter 2010 income tax expense from continuing operations was $69 million compared with $54 million reported last year.
The increase resulted from higher earnings and a slightly higher effective tax rate during the quarter compared with last year’s quarter. At the end of the third quarter our debt-to-total capitalization ratio stood at 57%.
We continued to expect to be able to fund our ongoing CapEx program through a combination of internally generated funds and debt, while maintaining our current investment-grade credit ratings. At the quarter’s close we had total capacity under our credit facilities of $2.7 billion, and available liquidity of about $1.5 billion. So, overall a good quarter with solid results from all of our business segments.
Before we wrap up, I want to mention that we’re in process of finishing our 2011 plan which we will review with our Board of Directors in December and in detail with you early in the New Year.
Now I want to share some early thoughts related to one key input to our 2011 plan, commodity prices. Following our past practice we had developed a preliminary budget for 2011, which we reviewed with our Board in October.
Using forward curves in effect at that time, oil was in the $80 range for next year, with an NGL to crude relationship of about 50%. This equates to $0.95 per gallon for NGLs which is in line with where we’ve seen the composite NGL price for 2010, but a little below current prices.
And as I mentioned earlier, the natural gas strip has average prices in the $4.25 to $4.50 range for next year. The Canadian dollar exchange rate has been around $1.05, and there are of course a number of additional factors that affect our forecast, but these commodity assumptions have the greatest impact.
We’re watching the forward curves and other indicators as to our commodity prices and exchange rates might be headed and we may update these assumptions prior to reviewing our formal plan with the Board in December. We look forward to sharing more details with you early in 2011.
So in closing, we’ve made good progress on our capital expansion plans, our core businesses delivered solid performance and we captured the positive effects of higher commodity prices at our DCP Midstream business.
We’ve described for you how well positioned we are in terms of expansion opportunities, reflecting substantial, contracted growth that builds upon the strength of our diverse portfolio and our expanding footprint. We’re equally well positioned financially, with strong cash flows, investment-grade credit ratings, excellent access to the capital needed to fund our growth and attractive conditions in the financial markets.
As we move through the fourth quarter, assuming normal other and commodity prices at current levels, we feel very good about exceeding our EPS guidance of $1.42 and so with that Greg and I will be happy to answer any questions that you may have.

And then again, back in that Midcontinent region, where there is a lot of coal power, some of it old, I think regardless of what happens with policy, given the really substantial increases in supply and what I would say modest prices for gas, the economics are really compelling for LDCs to make those changes, and it’s not just carbon, it’s about fly ash and all the other type issues, and we’re going to get our share of our that stuff, I think if you take those power plants that are coal based along Texas Eastern, if they are within a few miles, we should be the all time favorite to get those and that’s what we are chasing.

It’s about $3 million for every $0.10 change in gas prices. This year we said 5.50, was gas and obviously gas is lower than that, so it was probably more of an indication on this year. As we look out to next year we see NGL prices look like they’re going to be about the same if not a little bit better, gas prices are but that’s the bigger.
So look, more development of natural gas is a big winner for Spectra Energy, no matter how you look at it. But obviously, there is just a little bit of a balance more with respect to DCP. Obviously, you’re right. We continue to see great development going on in the Horn River. We’ve just been out to open seasons for a new pipeline capacity and processing, and I fully expect that those create more projects. You’ll see that balancing if gas prices come back, so really we’re just trying to give you a little heads up on next year. Tom, did you want to say something?

Our portfolio contracts on the key pole side which does directly benefit from the frac spread widening is probably down around 10% of our revenue contribution. So, predominately we’re POPs, so we do have an impact from the lower gas prices.
The good side of this from our standpoint is, if you look at our footprint, we have a very liquid centric footprint and so this pushed to drill up some of the higher liquids areas, we’re directly benefiting from and it is supporting the types of expansion projects that Greg, referred to in this comments.
As far as at Marcellus, just to go back on that for a second, I’m pretty much where Greg was is that and we’ve seen this in a number of different plays around our footprint. There is generally an over estimation of how quickly things can go. We generally tend to be more in the middle of the road from our experience, we haven’t seen how long it takes to get things done. So, we are about in the timeframe that we thought it would be with new processing capacity being needed somewhere in that 2012 timeframe.

So there is a lot of projects out there going one way or another way or North, East, West. That’s just not where the market really is as far as I am concerned.
So, I think between El Paso and ourselves, we’ve got a really great opportunity to do the logical thing from a market perspective. We are sure there is going to probably be a couple hundred miles of Greenfield, but there are many existing right of ways and pipe corridors that we will be able to use. I would expect the projects to be in the more typical 10% to 12% type range, and this project is probably in the billion dollar range.
Early days, this is just an MOU, but I would argue as people look at both Spectra and El Paso, and our ability, Spectra’s ability to deliver on projects over the last five years. This should give a lot of comfort to producers and then obviously on the consuming end, give a lot of comfort to the petrochem industry that they can continue to utilize ethane and continue to have a good supply in ethane to make them as competitive, increasingly competitive as they are doing so today.

And so, I think we’ll be able to absorb this capacity.
We’ve gone to a situation where we were importing a lot of projects, a lot of NGLs, not just ethane, but propane to actually exporting. So, I think the market suggests that we’re going to continue to find a market. In fact, even see inventories starting to decline.
The way we look at, you’re probably only going to have 20 days of coverage. In the last 10 years, the average has been more like 30 days for ethane. And don’t forget there’s a decline in the traditional volumes that are out there, probably 2%, 2.5% a year. So, I think all that leads to a pretty nice market from our perspective, and of course, Tom’s assets are very well placed for all of that. And Tom, did you want to add anything to that?

Drilling in liquids rich areas sort of overwhelmed the ability to consume ethane. But at the end of the day some of the weakness we saw in NGL pricing in the second quarter was really due to a number of outages both planned and unplanned.
As Greg mentioned, as we’ve come through this third quarter, and beginning with July, we have seen cracker rates very, very high, and the consumption of ethane significantly above 900,000 barrels a day. Now as you know, we’re not producing that much, so what has happened is that storage has gotten drawn quite heavily. There is a lag on the reporting of storage, but we saw a significant drop in the latest Hudson [ph] report.
Pricing has responded accordingly. Belvieu ethane is up very significantly in the last couple of months. You’ve also seen propane similarly rebound from its seasonal lows. That’s primarily driven off. We’re getting into the winter weather, but exports have remained very strong as we move throughout the year.
So as I sit here this year, looking at the balance of the year, I actually become concerned that prices on ethane in particular run up to a point where it start influencing the cracking and we start seeing that become back in, that’s how strong I believe the cracking will be over the next few months and how much I believe we’re going to get a price response on ethane.
Longer term, as Greg said, we’ve seen the crackers take their ability up significantly. We think they can get to 1 million barrels. We’re not alone in that thinking, there is a few prognosticators out there who think that’s also capable. They’ve been able to compete internationally with their product. If you look at the supply stack going forward, the U.S. is very well positioned.
At the end of the day, we can probably see on the supply side, getting to a point of about 950,000 barrels or so. So for the next few years at least we think we’ll be consuming more than we’re producing, and that should create a pretty good environment for ethane pricing. Now, there will be blips from time to time, like we saw earlier this year and the system has the ability to balance the sell-through rejection.
But overall, I think we’re constructive on ethane, and on the heavier end of the barrel, the correlations tend to be better to crude. If you believe in crude above $80, than that end of the barrel will be held up pretty well, so overall we are very constructive on NGL prices for the next several years.

I would tell you that you saw some level of ethane rejection this summer, and the production of ethane dropped from the low 800s down into about the mid 700s. Back in 2009 at the beginning of the year when there was a negative frac spread on ethane you saw quite a bit of rejection, again taking it down, I believe into the mid 700s. So, it’s significant, but is very localized. The thing I would ask you to remember is it corrects fairly quickly as they do go into rejection.

I think you’re going to see demand continue to pick up and particularly on gas fired generation, and that was an important element for us as we consider Bobcat, it definitely in the southeast, you see the biggest conversion of other fuels to natural gas on the side of going to more gas fire generation.
That needs salt dome storage where you’ve got the quick injection and raw capabilities, reliability capabilities and obviously, the interconnects to all the various pipelines that both Bobcat and Egan and Moss have, we think that puts very premium value on our storage capability. No doubt, storage has been low right now. As we build out that project over the next five years, the gas power conversion occurs, we think we’re going to be in the sweet spot to be able to do that.

Patty has moved on to work in other areas of the company. So, I’d like to introduce Roni to you. She previously had a leadership role in our strategic planning function at Spectra Energy and so brings a great perspective to her new role in Investor Relations, and welcome Roni.
And then I’d also like to remind you that on Wednesday, November 17, we’ll be in New York for breakfast and Boston for lunch, and if you haven’t already done so, please sign up and we’d love to have you attend one of those. So with that, thanks again for your participation today and if you have any additional questions please feel free to call either Roni or me. Thank you.
