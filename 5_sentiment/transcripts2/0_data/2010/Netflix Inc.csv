But with Warner Bros., they wanted to create a window to improve sell through. As you all know in the book industry, there's hardcover books for sale for a while and then, paperback. And that's a proper profit maximization strategy than they asking quite reasonably, would like to have DVDs for sale at Amazon, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, et cetera, for some period of time before they're available for rental. We were willing to agree with them to work within that system which we hope and they hope will improve the DVD profits in the DVD ecosystem. And for us, most consumers, they're not sure if DVDs come 90 days after the theatrical release, 120 days, 150, 180, it's all over the map. It constantly not only between studios, but also between specific releases. So there's not a high expectation of any perfect day when it's supposed to be out. There is potentially competitive risk if Redbox and others continue to be able to have availability day and date. It certainly appears that Warner is going to try to do and the other studios, is to have us and the kiosks fundamentally at the 28th day which creates the window for the studios. Video stores, we're not sure what will happen there, but they're closing so quickly. It may not be that relevant in the next couple of years. And that kiosks and rental-by-mail together could create that window. The advantage to us in doing the deals is cost savings. Warner has given us a huge number of copies at the 29th day at a very attractive price, so we're able to fulfill all of the consumer demand. And then, we're able to use those savings to pour that in a more streaming content. So it's really a win all around in terms of what we're doing, and that's why we're looking forward to expanding that with other studios over the next two years as our deals come up."

And that's true for frankly any subscription service including HBO, Starz etc. And so the big advantage that Netflix has competitively, is we can offer this incredible subscription with the new releases on DVD, and the vast catalog is potentially available for streaming. We fit in to the subscription TV window in studio parlance which is the same window with HBO, Starz and others. And within that, there's a lot more content that we can get that we haven't yet licensed, which is fundamentally us writing bigger and bigger checks to be able to purchase more and more content which is coming along nicely. So I would say the strategy is not particularly focused on how do we break through to get the newest new releases on streaming, it's much more how do we get every TV episode, every movie ever made, vast catalog and incredibly rich catalog and then to use our personalized merchandising to figure out which parts of that are relevant to each consumer, so that when they turn on their TV, or do they go to the Netflix website, the 20 or so movies listed are 20 movies that, that consumer is just dying to watch."

In terms of the substitution question that you asked, you know our long-term model is to be able as a percentage of our cost, to pay a little bit less each year on DVD and Blu-ray as a percentage and to put more and more money into streaming. And that's where you'll eventually see the substitution. We're not able, at this point, to be conclusive about any substitution that exists because we don't have a good control set of subscribers that don't get streaming. So when we look at it, we're very happy with the effect streaming is having, but it's mostly coming in terms of additional growth. That's the one, we see it directly which is -- where it gets lower SAC and lower churn. More than it is a cost substitution.

In one quarter, we went from 41% to 48% of our subscribers and remember, the subscriber base is growing over that time also. So I know we don't have everything that we want, but we got a ton of content for subscribers and they're super happy with it. And again, as we write checks, and are able with a larger P&L to write larger checks, we'll get more and more content. In terms of Starz specifically in Starz/Disney, we don't have any reason to believe there's going to be any change in that in the short-term. That's working well for us. We've got a good agreement in place. In terms of the long-term, we're not dependent on any one content source particularly. The strength of Netflix is to have a very broad range of content.

And within two or three years, my sense is Wi-Fi is so inexpensive to add to TVs that they'll be in every screen. And we believe that Netflix will be part of that. So long-term picture, really driven by TVs, Blu-rays, but in the short term, video game and laptops are a big contributors also."

But with Warner Bros., they wanted to create a window to improve sell through. As you all know, in the book industry, there's hardcover books for sale for a while and then paperback. And that's a proper profit maximization strategy, than they asking quite reasonably, would like to have DVDs for sale at Amazon, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, et cetera, for some period of time before they're available for rental. We were willing to agree with them to work within that system, which we hope and they hope will improve the DVD profits in the DVD ecosystem. And for us, most consumers, they're not sure if DVDs come 90 days after the theatrical release, 120 days, 150, 180, it's all over the map. It constantly changes not only between studios, but also between specific releases. So there's not a high expectation of any perfect day when it's supposed to be out. There is potentially competitive risk if Redbox and others continue to be able to have availability day and date. It certainly appears that Warner is going to try to do and the other studios, is to have us and the kiosks fundamentally at the 28th day, which creates the window for the studios. Video stores, we're not sure what will happen there, but they're closing so quickly. It may not be that relevant in the next couple of years. And that kiosks and rental-by-mail together could create that window. The advantage to us in doing the deals is cost savings. Warner has given us a huge number of copies at the 29th day at a very attractive price, so we're able to fulfill all of the consumer demand. And then we're able to use those savings to pour that in a more streaming content. So it's really a win all around, in terms of what we're doing. And that's why we're looking forward to expanding that with other studios over the next two years as our deals come up."

And that's true for frankly any subscription service including HBO, Starz etc. And so the big advantage that Netflix has competitively, is we can offer this incredible subscription with the new releases on DVD, and the vast catalog is potentially available for streaming. We fit in to the subscription TV window in studio parlance which is the same window with HBO, Starz and others. And within that, there's a lot more content that we can get that we haven't yet licensed, which is fundamentally us writing bigger and bigger checks to be able to purchase more and more content which is coming along nicely. So I would say the strategy is not particularly focused on how do we break through to get the newest new releases on streaming, it's much more how do we get every TV episode, every movie ever made, vast catalog and incredibly rich catalog and then to use our personalized merchandising to figure out which parts of that are relevant to each consumer, so that when they turn on their TV, or do they go to the Netflix website, the 20 or so movies listed are 20 movies that, that consumer is just dying to watch."

And that's where you'll eventually see the substitution. We're not able, at this point, to be conclusive about any substitution that exists because we don't have a good control set of subscribers that don't get streaming. So when we look at it, we're very happy with the effect streaming is having, but it's mostly coming in terms of additional growth. That's the one, we see it directly which is -- where it gets lower SAC and lower churn. More than it is a cost substitution.

We're very happy with the content we've been acquiring. It's a small part of the content for streaming we eventually want to have, but it's enough content that the percentage of subscribers viewing or streaming has significantly increased. In one quarter, we went from 41% to 48% of our subscribers. And remember, the subscriber base is growing over that time also. So I know we don't have everything that we want, but we got a ton of content for subscribers and they're super happy with it. And again, as we write checks, and are able with a larger P&L to write larger checks, we'll get more and more content. In terms of Starz specifically in Starz/Disney, we don't have any reason to believe there's going to be any change in that in the short-term. That's working well for us. We've got a good agreement in place. In terms of the long term, we're not dependent on any one content source particularly. The strength of Netflix is to have a very broad range of content. So we're not particularly troubled by those press reports."

When we look at the three or five-year picture being built into the TV, it's an obvious winner. We think that most TVs -- almost all Blu-ray players sold next year, but this year, 2010, we'll have internet connectivity and Netflix. A substantial fraction of TVs will have Internet connectivity in almost all of those will have Netflix. And within two or three years, my sense is Wi-Fi is so inexpensive to add to TVs that they'll be in every screen. And we believe that Netflix will be part of that. So long-term picture, really driven by TVs, Blu-rays, but in the short term, video game and laptops are a big contributors also."

But with Warner Bros., they wanted to create a window to improve sell through. As you all know in the book industry, there's hardcover books for sale for a while and then, paperback. And that's a proper profit maximization strategy than they asking quite reasonably, would like to have DVDs for sale at Amazon, Wal-Mart, Best Buy, et cetera, for some period of time before they're available for rental. We were willing to agree with them to work within that system which we hope and they hope will improve the DVD profits in the DVD ecosystem. And for us, most consumers, they're not sure if DVDs come 90 days after the theatrical release, 120 days, 150, 180, it's all over the map. It constantly not only between studios, but also between specific releases. So there's not a high expectation of any perfect day when it's supposed to be out. There is potentially competitive risk if Redbox and others continue to be able to have availability day and date. It certainly appears that Warner is going to try to do and the other studios, is to have us and the kiosks fundamentally at the 28th day which creates the window for the studios. Video stores, we're not sure what will happen there, but they're closing so quickly. It may not be that relevant in the next couple of years. And that kiosks and rental-by-mail together could create that window. The advantage to us in doing the deals is cost savings. Warner has given us a huge number of copies at the 29th day at a very attractive price, so we're able to fulfill all of the consumer demand. And then, we're able to use those savings to pour that in a more streaming content. So it's really a win all around in terms of what we're doing, and that's why we're looking forward to expanding that with other studios over the next two years as our deals come up."

And that's true for frankly any subscription service including HBO, Starz etc. And so the big advantage that Netflix has competitively, is we can offer this incredible subscription with the new releases on DVD, and the vast catalog is potentially available for streaming. We fit in to the subscription TV window in studio parlance which is the same window with HBO, Starz and others. And within that, there's a lot more content that we can get that we haven't yet licensed, which is fundamentally us writing bigger and bigger checks to be able to purchase more and more content which is coming along nicely. So I would say the strategy is not particularly focused on how do we break through to get the newest new releases on streaming, it's much more how do we get every TV episode, every movie ever made, vast catalog and incredibly rich catalog and then to use our personalized merchandising to figure out which parts of that are relevant to each consumer, so that when they turn on their TV, or do they go to the Netflix website, the 20 or so movies listed are 20 movies that, that consumer is just dying to watch."

In terms of the substitution question that you asked, you know our long-term model is to be able as a percentage of our cost, to pay a little bit less each year on DVD and Blu-ray as a percentage and to put more and more money into streaming. And that's where you'll eventually see the substitution. We're not able, at this point, to be conclusive about any substitution that exists because we don't have a good control set of subscribers that don't get streaming. So when we look at it, we're very happy with the effect streaming is having, but it's mostly coming in terms of additional growth. That's the one, we see it directly which is -- where it gets lower SAC and lower churn. More than it is a cost substitution.

So I know we don't have everything that we want, but we got a ton of content for subscribers and they're super happy with it. And again, as we write checks, and are able with a larger P&L to write larger checks, we'll get more and more content. In terms of Starz specifically in Starz/Disney, we don't have any reason to believe there's going to be any change in that in the short-term. That's working well for us.

When we look at the three or five-year picture being built into the TV, it's an obvious winner. We think that most TVs -- almost all Blu-ray players sold next year, but this year, 2010, we'll have internet connectivity and Netflix. A substantial fraction of TVs will have internet connectivity in almost all of those will have Netflix. And within two or three years, my sense is Wi-Fi is so inexpensive to add to TVs that they'll be in every screen. And we believe that Netflix will be part of that.

So back end loaded in Q4 and front-end loaded in Q1 and then growth during Q2 was back-end loaded and during Q3 it is pretty linear across the quarter.  
Our growth patterns this quarter were less pronounced, with the growth in partners and the appeal of streaming.  With the launch of Wii, we’ve seen sort of the non-traditional growth pattern during the 2nd quarter and incremental marketing spending around that growth as well.

Our focus is on subscription and it is hard and it takes us a lot of work.  That is probably the main reason that we don’t do the selling of DVDs. 
In terms of Pay-Per-View, then there is a very specific thing, which is, for example Xbox has for years had a big Pay-Per-View business.  If we had also had Pay-Per-View as part of our service, it would have been a lot harder to get distribution on the Xbox.  Similarly with PS3, then of course you see now with Wal-Mart entering the Pay-Per-View market online with Voodoo that many of those firms want to go after that business.  So it is really much smarter for us, we think, to be out of that and not in a position of conflict and just to be focused on our subscription business.

Your premises that video services such as HBO and Starz need original content to differentiate, and I’m not in disagreement with that part, but what Netflix has to differentiate is the user interface, personalization on demand aspect of the internet, and [lab].
Our view is that we can remain a packager and be significantly differentiated from other services because our value add is not just the content, it’s all of the recommendations, how people interact with them, helping them match with content they’re going to end up loving.
So our view is that we won’t ever need to go into original series.  I would certainly say that if we ever did, we would probably have the wrong CEO and we shouldn’t be based in [Silicon] Valley and there’s a number of other things that make that an unpromising avenue.
So instead what we’re focused on is can we license the content as we have with Starz?  We have some content from Showtime.  Not yet anything from FX or HBO, and as those firms look at us, they can look at us two ways.  One is geez, we’re another packager of movies and another potential competitor, or they can look at it as we’re a natural distributor for their original series.
When you see the enormous success that Starz is having with Spartacus, that Showtime has had with Weeds, Californication and others, and of course HBO has for many years.  You can see that those services are differentially good at the original series and so we’ll be hopeful these lines of partnership will be us as a great distributor writing them big checks for their original content.

There are people who, because of the 28-day, are turned to buying the DVDs, first because it's widely promoted at Wal-Mart and other places. There are some that take pay-per-view because Warner Bros. is aggressive on the pay-per-view licensing, and that's really the intent of the deal. In terms of the backlog, once it comes to the 28-day, we try to target to have enough DVDs to clear that backlog pretty quickly.

And then, of course, you've seen now with Wal-Mart entering the pay-per-view market online with voodoo that many of those firms want to go after that business.

And your premise is that video services such as HBO and Starz need original content to differentiate, and I'm not in disagreement with that part. But what Netflix has to differentiate is the user-interface personalization on-demand aspect of the Internet and lap [ph 41:43]. And our view is that we can remain a packager and be significantly differentiated from other services because our value add is not just the content, it's all of the recommendations, how people interact with them, helping them match with content they're going to end up loving. So our view is we won't ever need to go into original series. I would certainly say if we ever did, we probably have the wrong CEO, and we shouldn't be based in Silicon Valley, and there's a number of other things that make that an unpromising avenue. So instead, what we're focused on is can we license the content as we have with Starz. We have some content from Showtime, not yet anything from FX or HBO. And as those firms look at us, they can look at us two ways. One is, geez, we’re another packager of movies and a potential competitor, or they can look at it as we're a natural distributor for their original series. And when you see the enormous success that Starz is having with Spartacus, that Showtime has had with Weeds, Californication and others and, of course, HBO has for many years, you can see that those services are differentially good at the original series. And so we'll be hopeful these alliances and partnerships will view us as a great distributor writing them big checks for their original content.

The first is a long-term content question. As Netflix subscriber base grows and seemingly gets closer and closer to total subscribers for premium pay-TV network, like HBO, Showtime and Starz, does the company ever need to think about borrowing a page from their strategy and investing in unique original content? Over the long term, it seems that for a video network to remain relevant to consumers and ward off competition, it needs unique content. Otherwise, the checkbook becomes the main barrier to entry, which is not sustainable. Do you agree or disagree with that thought?"

And your premise is that video services such as HBO and Starz need original content to differentiate, and I'm not in disagreement with that part. But what Netflix has to differentiate is the user-interface personalization on-demand aspect of the Internet and lap [ph]. And our view is that we can remain a packager and be significantly differentiated from other services because our value add is not just the content, it's all of the recommendations, how people interact with them, helping them match with content they're going to end up loving. So our view is we won't ever need to go into original series. I would certainly say if we ever did, we probably have the wrong CEO, and we shouldn't be based in Silicon Valley, and there's a number of other things that make that an unpromising avenue. So instead, what we're focused on is can we license the content as we have with Starz. We have some content from Showtime, not yet anything from FX or HBO. And as those firms look at us, they can look at us two ways. One is, geez, we’re another packager of movies and a potential competitor, or they can look at it as we're a natural distributor for their original series. And when you see the enormous success that Starz is having with Spartacus, that Showtime has had with Weeds, Californication and others and, of course, HBO has for many years, you can see that those services are differentially good at the original series. And so we'll be hopeful these alliances and partnerships will view us as a great distributor writing them big checks for their original content. We focus on packaging and they focus on the original series."

And your premise is that video services such as HBO and Starz need original content to differentiate, and I'm not in disagreement with that part. But what Netflix has to differentiate is the user-interface personalization on-demand aspect of the Internet and lap [ph]. And our view is that we can remain a packager and be significantly differentiated from other services because our value add is not just the content, it's all of the recommendations, how people interact with them, helping them match with content they're going to end up loving. So our view is we won't ever need to go into original series. I would certainly say if we ever did, we probably have the wrong CEO, and we shouldn't be based in Silicon Valley, and there's a number of other things that make that an unpromising avenue. So instead, what we're focused on is can we license the content as we have with Starz. We have some content from Showtime, not yet anything from FX or HBO. And as those firms look at us, they can look at us two ways. One is, geez, we’re another packager of movies and a potential competitor, or they can look at it as we're a natural distributor for their original series. And when you see the enormous success that Starz is having with Spartacus, that Showtime has had with Weeds, Californication and others and, of course, HBO has for many years, you can see that those services are differentially good at the original series. And so we'll be hopeful these alliances and partnerships will view us as a great distributor writing them big checks for their original content.

And then you ask about the top 500, I'm not sure how to answer that exactly. But I would say that the power of Netflix is to take a lot of content, it may not be the hottest content and make it feel like it's an incredible service to subscribers. That's where we add value as a service and that one is nearly carrying the hottest content on the planet. There is not as much of a profit opportunity in that, because you got to pay the content owner. Well the content owner has earned most of the value generated as you extract that. So our key is not around top 500, our key is direct, and what percent of our subscribers are streaming. We keep them actively streaming because if they are actively streaming and taking DVDs, then they will be paying better and you can see that in the year-over-year improvements in the tension that we have generated.

I don't expect to see continuing improvements in gross margin and I think we would probably do ourselves a disservice and slow our growth if we were to stop the content spend and in order to manage the gross margin in the business to a higher level. So in lieu of gross margin I encourage you to think about operating margins as we're clearly making trade-offs between.
And we have through our entire history on SAC churn in gross margins offer the purpose of managing our sales to an operating margin that strikes the right balance between growth and profit. So a right example, we saw last quarter, I told you'd expect us to manage the business at 1% operating margin for the year.
Now we're going faster and having more success doing it than we imagined and to the mid-point of guidance our net income implies an operating margin of about 12.5%. So clearly business is running, at least year-to-date more profitably than we expected and at least in the current quarter on gross margin both because of plan mix shift and because of substitution behavior is more profitable than we had expected. Now in a perfect world that we can time content spending and marketing spending and align it with perfect four side in our forecast, that wouldn't have happened and we would have reinvested that money and had factors of growth still.

And then you ask about the top 500. I'm not sure how to answer that exactly, but I would say that the power of Netflix is to take a lot of content. It may not be the hottest content, and make it feel like it's an incredible service to subscribers. That's where we add value as a service, and that one is nearly carrying the hottest content on the planet. There's not as much of a trough of opportunity in that, because you'd have to pay the content owner, well, the content owner has earned most of the value generated to extract that. So our key is not around top 500, our key is breadth and what percent of our subscribers are streaming. Can we keep them actively streaming? Because if they're actively streaming, and taking DVDs, then they'll retain better. And you can see that in the year-over-year improvements in retention that we generated."

That's great news for the business, because it means that streaming is resonating with consumers and likely, we will see accelerating growth, and in fact we are seeing accelerated growth. So if you're doing a year-over-year comp, it helps to remember that we initiated, in part, of Blu-ray price increase in Q2 a year ago for two months of the quarter and then three months of the quarter in Q3, and so that really dampens the effect of the shift towards the 1-out plan.

I don't expect to see continued improvements in gross margin, and I think we would probably do ourselves a disservice and slow our growth if we were to starve the content spend in order to manage the gross margin in the business to a higher level. So in lieu of gross margin, I encourage you to think about operating margins as we're clearly making trade-offs between, as we have through our entire history, SAC, churn and gross margin all for the purpose of managing ourselves to an operating margin that strikes the right balance between growth and profit. So by way of example, last quarter, I told you to expect us to manage the business to 1% operating margin for the year. Now we're growing faster and having more success doing it than we imagined and to the midpoint of guidance, our net income implies an operating margin of about 12.5%. So clearly, business is running, at least year-to-date, more profitably than we expected. And at least in the current quarter, gross margin, both because of planned mix shift and because of substitution behavior, is more profitable than we had expected. Now in a perfect world, if we could time content spending and marketing spending and align it with perfect foresight in our forecast, that wouldn't have happened, and we would have reinvested that money and had faster sub growth still."

So it's as you would expect in that way, so there's an indirect influence around our revenue or our content spending budget. The larger that it is, the more effective we can be. And then you ask about the top 500. I'm not sure how to answer that exactly, but I would say that the power of Netflix is to take a lot of content. It may not be the hottest content, and make it feel like it's an incredible service to subscribers. That's where we add value as a service, and that one is nearly carrying the hottest content on the planet. There's not as much of a trough of opportunity in that, because you'd have to pay the content owner, well, the content owner has earned most of the value generated to extract that. So our key is not around top 500, our key is breadth and what percent of our subscribers are streaming. Can we keep them actively streaming? Because if they're actively streaming, and taking DVDs, then they'll retain better. And you can see that in the year-over-year improvements in retention that we generated."

I don't expect to see continued improvements in gross margin, and I think we would probably do ourselves a disservice and slow our growth if we were to starve the content spend in order to manage the gross margin in the business to a higher level. So in lieu of gross margin, I encourage you to think about operating margins as we're clearly making trade-offs between, as we have through our entire history, SAC, churn and gross margin all for the purpose of managing ourselves to an operating margin that strikes the right balance between growth and profit. So by way of example, last quarter, I told you to expect us to manage the business to 1% operating margin for the year. Now we're growing faster and having more success doing it than we imagined and to the midpoint of guidance, our net income implies an operating margin of about 12.5%. So clearly, business is running, at least year-to-date, more profitably than we expected. And at least in the current quarter, gross margin, both because of planned mix shift and because of substitution behavior, is more profitable than we had expected. Now in a perfect world, if we could time content spending and marketing spending and align it with perfect foresight in our forecast, that wouldn't have happened, and we would have reinvested that money and had faster sub growth still."

And then you ask about the top 500. I'm not sure how to answer that exactly, but I would say that the power of Netflix is to take a lot of content. It may not be the hottest content, and make it feel like it's an incredible service to subscribers. That's where we add value as a service, and that one is nearly carrying the hottest content on the planet. There's not as much of a trough of opportunity in that, because you'd have to pay the content owner, well, the content owner has earned most of the value generated to extract that. So our key is not around top 500, our key is breadth and what percent of our subscribers are streaming. Can we keep them actively streaming?

That's great news for the business, because it means that streaming is resonating with consumers and likely, we will see accelerating growth, and in fact we are seeing accelerated growth. So if you're doing a year-over-year comp, it helps to remember that we initiated, in part, of Blu-ray price increase in Q2 a year ago for two months of the quarter and then three months of the quarter in Q3, and so that dampens the effect of the shift towards the 1-out plan.

What could cause this not to happen?"

I don't expect to see continued improvements in gross margin, and I think we would probably do ourselves a disservice and slow our growth if we were to starve the content spend in order to manage the gross margin in the business to a higher level. So in lieu of gross margin, I encourage you to think about operating margins as we're clearly making trade-offs between, as we have through our entire history, SAC, churn and gross margin all for the purpose of managing ourselves to an operating margin that strikes the right balance between growth and profit. So by way of example, last quarter, I told you to expect us to manage the business to 1% operating margin for the year. Now we're growing faster and having more success doing it than we imagined and to the midpoint of guidance, our net income implies an operating margin of about 12.5%. So clearly, business is running, at least year-to-date, more profitably than we expected. And at least in the current quarter, gross margin, both because of planned mix shift and because of substitution behavior, is more profitable than we had expected. Now in a perfect world, if we could time content spending and marketing spending and align it with perfect foresight in our forecast, that wouldn't have happened, and we would have reinvested that money and had faster sub growth still."

There is public performance rights required from one of three right societies, ASCAP, SESAC, BMI. Two of those ASCAP and BMI involve rate courts for the setting of rates. Rates are in dispute and so as a consequence, we, through time, have made estimates about that relates to our expectations for license fees associated with the public performance of the music and that get some recent decisions in the courts which have caused us to rethink the amount of money we had set aside for the public performance rates. So it's a monthly accrual. And then eventually when license deals struck, they'll be an exchange of moneys and we'll move on. But right now, it's a hanging accrual in the balance sheet."

So there are two cohorts essentially to focus on with respect to churn to the free trials subscribers as you referred to. And we see slightly lower -- well, we anticipate we are seeing slightly lower conversion rates in Canada and mix in the U.S. So let me just focus on the U.S. where we have a rich history. And we said repeatedly through time and it remains true today, but that nine and 10 subscribers who take a free trial become a paying subscriber. So great conversion rate, but that implies one in 10 free trial subscribers dropout, that's a 10% churn rate. So point one, as it relates to the paying subscribers, a churn declines over time. And if you'd been here for 12 months or longer and more than half of subscribers have been here for more than 12 months, then your churn rate is in the 2% range or lower. So not terribly dissimilar from churn rates for basic cable, which is in the 1.5% range. And of course, whether or not that churn rate is sustainable from a financial perspective, also depends on what the acquisition cost is. And of course, we're at historical low acquisition cost because of investment we've made in improving the quality service and streaming. And then I suppose the follow-up question might be well, how does retention rate for streaming customers compare with retention rates on DVD-only customers? And because of the improvements we've made in the quarter with streaming service, we're going to have to say that actually retention for streaming customers has just crossed over the retention for DVD-only customers, so it's actually better now for streaming only.

I want to remind everyone on the call that earnings is a managed outcome. And so there had been many quarters in the past, by way of example, to support quarter of last year, if memory serves me, during the quarter, because the business was much more profitable than we forecast, it were going to be -- we allocated during the quarter an additional spending to marketing in something like $6 million. We delivered earnings that where we'd forecast we were going to deliver and we will able to deliver more growth in part because we hurdled and invest in more marketing dollars. So if as Q4 unfolds similar dynamic occurs relative to our forecast, and we have the wind in our back and we would be anxious to invest additional money in marketing because it will further accelerate our growth. But based on our plan, we're expecting the answer I gave which is an decrease both on a percentage basis and a decrease Q-over-Q in terms of absolute dollars spent on marketing."

We track how many DVDs we shipped and we track that one length, and we make an assumption that each DVD is watched once. So you could say some are never watched and some are watched twice, but we assume watched once. And then we look at the streaming hours that we're delivering and compare those. So we're saying two things which are independent. One is that the total number of minutes of entertainment delivered by Netflix is higher on streaming than on DVD. Second, majority of our members, so more than 50% in Q4, will watch a majority of their content by minutes on streaming than on DVD, which basically gets you a distribution measure. It says that it's not that say, 10% of the streamers are watching an enormous amount of content and everyone else is majority DVD. So it's two views. Total view we’re more streaming, and from a subscriber view, the majority of our subscribers, consume majority of their content on streaming than DVD."

Asked another way, how low is your churn rate on core Netflix subscribers? Say those two have been subscribers for over three months or six months or one year, however you measure it. The obvious reason for the question is we do not typically see consumer subscriber businesses grow so fast while sustaining such a high churn rate.

So there are two cohorts essentially to focus on with respect to churn. There are the free trial subscribers you referred to. And we see slightly lower -- well, we anticipate we are seeing slightly lower conversion rates in Canada than we’d see in the U.S. So let me just focus on the U.S. where we have a rich history. And we said repeatedly through time and it remains true today, but about nine in 10 subscribers who take a free trial become a paying subscriber. So great conversion rate, but that implies one in 10 free trial subscribers dropout, that's a 10% churn rate. So point one, as it relates to the paying subscribers, a churn declines over time. And if you'd been here for 12 months or longer and more than half of subscribers have been here for more than 12 months, then your churn rate is in the 2% range or lower. So not terribly dissimilar from churn rates for basic cable, which is in the 1.5% range. And of course, whether or not that churn rate is sustainable from a financial perspective, also depends on what the acquisition cost is. And of course, we're at historical low acquisition costs because of investment we've made in improving the quality service and streaming. And then I suppose the follow-up question might be well, how does retention rates for streaming customers compare with retention rates on DVD-only customers? And because of the improvements we've made in the quality of the streaming service, we're going to have to say that actually retention for streaming customers has just crossed over the retention for DVD-only customers, so it's actually better now for streaming only. And that's important, of course, because the majority of the growth is streaming related."

We delivered the earnings number we’d forecast we were going to deliver and we were also able to deliver more growth in part because we were able to invest more marketing dollars.

So, there are two cohorts essentially to focus on with respect to churn that free trials is kind of gives you a fair deal. And you see a slightly lower - well we anticipate we are seeing slightly lower conversion rates in Canada than we see in the U.S. so let me just tell this one on the U.S. where we have a rich history and we said repeatedly through time and it remains true today that that nine in 10 subscribers who take a free trial become a paying subscriber.
So, great conversion rate. But that implies one in 10 free trial subscribers drop out. That’s a 10% churn rate. And so point one.
As it relates to the paying subscribers, the churn declines over time and as you’ve been here for 12 months or longer and more than half of the subscribers have been here for more than 12 months and your churn rate is in the 2% range or lower.
So, not terribly dissimilar from churn rates for basic cable, which is in the what, 1.5% range. And, of course, whether or not that churn rate is substantial from a financial perspective also depends on what the acquisition cost is and of course we are at historical low acquisition cost because investments we’ve made in improving the quality of service in streaming. And then I suppose (inaudible) IP well how does retention rates for streaming customers compare with retention rates on DVD only customers. And because of the improvements we’ve made in the quality of the streaming service, we can now say that actually retention for streaming customers has just crossed over the retention for - I am using the word, yes, retention, has just crossed over retention for DVD only customers. So, it’s actually better now for streaming only and that’s important of course because the majority of the growth is streaming related.

Marketing spending as a percent of revenue was up slightly on Q-over-Q basis and on a year-over-year basis. And the decrease in SAC reflects the increase in the organic growth, which is a function of the increased investment we’ve been making in the licensing of streamed content. So, historically, you have heard me talk about the inter-relationship between gross margin SAC and churn and the way in which we play one off against the other in order to increase the overall growth rate and enterprise value associated with the growth in subscriber and that’s what you see at play here.

I want to remind everyone on the call that earnings is a managed outcome. And so there has been many quarters in the past by way of example, the fourth quarter of last year if memory serves me, during the quarter because the business was much more profitable than we forecasted we are going to be, we allocated during the quarter an additional spending to marketing of something like $6 million. But we delivered earnings never we’d forecast we were going to deliver and we were also able to deliver more growth in part because we are able to invest in more marketing dollars. So, if - as Q4 unfolds, similar dynamic occurs relative to our forecast and we have the wind at our back, and we would be anxious to invest additional money in marketing because it will further accelerate our growth. But base on our plan, we are expecting the answer I gave, which is the decrease both on a percentage basis and a decrease Q over Q in terms of absolute dollars spent on marketing.
