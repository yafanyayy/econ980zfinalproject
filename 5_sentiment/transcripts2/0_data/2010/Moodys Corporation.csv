After our prepared remarks, we'd be happy to respond to your questions.Fourth quarter revenue of $486 million increased 20% over the prior year, reflecting meaningful improvement in credit market activity compared to the conditions experienced globally at the end of 2008. Excluding the favorable impact from currency translation, revenue grew by 17%. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $179 million, 43% higher than the same period last year. Without the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, operating income increased 39%.Diluted earnings per share of $0.43 from the fourth quarter of 2009 included a benefit of $0.01 related to previously announced restructuring activities. Excluding the restructuring in both periods, diluted earnings per share of $0.42 for the quarter increased 14% from $0.37 in the prior-year period.Regarding full year results, Moody's full year results reflected a gradual improvement in credit markets throughout 2009. Strength in corporate debt issuance and growth from Moody's Analytics provided a slight increase in total revenue from the prior year but activity remained limited in other areas.Revenue for 2009 was approximately $1.8 billion, an increase of 2% from full year 2008. Operating income of $688 million declined 8% from a year ago. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 4% from the prior year period. While the impact of foreign currency translation on operating income was negligible.Diluted earnings per share of $1.69 for 2009 declined 10% and included a net charge of $0.01, reflecting costs related to previously announced restructuring plans, partially offset by a benefit from certain legacy tax matters. Excluding these items in both years, diluted earnings per share of $1.70 for the full year 2009 decreased 7% from $1.82 in 2008.At this point, I'll turn the call over to Linda to provide further details on our financial performance and other updates."

Global revenue from Moody's Corp. increased by 20%. U.S. revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $245 million. While revenue generated outside the U.S. rose by 16% to $241 million and represented 50%",976,"Thanks, Ray. I'll begin with revenue for the fourth quarter. Global revenue from Moody's Corp. increased by 20%. U.S. revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $245 million. While revenue generated outside the U.S. rose by 16% to $241 million and represented 50% of Moody's total revenue. Recurring revenue of $290 million was up 2% from the fourth quarter of last year and represented 60% of total revenue.Looking at each of our businesses. First, Moody's Investors Service revenue for the quarter was $332 million, 31% above the prior-year period. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew 26%. U.S. ratings revenue rose by 42% compared to growth of 19% outside the U.S. Revenue from outside the U.S. represented 46% of total ratings revenue. Global Corporate Finance revenue of $115 million in the fourth quarter nearly doubled from a year ago, primarily driven by activity in the high-yield bond market. Revenue increased 106% year-over-year in the U.S. and 90% outside the U.S.Global Structured Finance revenue for the fourth quarter was $79 million, down 14% from a year earlier. Within the U.S., Structured Finance revenue increased 5% from the year-ago period, reflecting increased issuance of the asset-backed securities and real estate investment trust funds. Non-U.S. Structured Finance revenue decreased 25%, driven by revenue declines across all asset classes as improved credit market conditions flowed the use of securitization for Central Bank supported programs.Global Financial Institutions revenue of $72 million increased by 27% from the fourth quarter of 2008, due to gains from the banking sector. Revenue rose by 18% in the U.S., and 35% outside the U.S. Global revenue for Public, Project and Infrastructure Finance grew 36% to $66 million year-over-year. The increase of 36% in U.S. revenue was primarily driven by public finance issuance related to stimulus programs, such as Build America Bonds. Outside the U.S., revenue increased 35% with strong issuance in European Infrastructure Finance.Turning now to Moody's Analytics. Global revenue of $154 million increased 3% from the fourth quarter of 2008 with negligible impact from foreign currency translation. Beginning with the fourth quarter reporting period, we slightly modified the reporting revenue categories for Moody's Analytics revenue to better reflect our major product groupings. For the Research, Data and Analytics business, which represents most of the products previously reported in the subscription category, revenue of $106 million declined by 1% from the prior-year period. In the Risk Management Software category, which includes software licenses, maintenance fees and associated services, revenue of $42 million was 21% higher than in the fourth quarter of 2008. And in the Professional Services category, which captures revenue from our training, services and other customer specific project work, revenue of $6 million was down 26%.For Moody's Analytics, U.S. revenue declined 5% to $66 million, reflecting the effect of customer attrition due to financial market disruption in late 2008 and early 2009. Outside the U.S., revenue increased 10% over the prior-year period to $88 million, primarily attributable to growth in the Risk Management Software business and represented 57% of total Analytics revenue.Turning now to expenses. Moody's fourth quarter operating expenses, $307 million increased 10% over the prior-year period. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, reported expenses grew by 8%. The increase was primarily driven by higher accrual for performance-based compensation, and also reflected continuing investment across all areas of the business, including technology, infrastructure and investor outreach. Moody's reported operating margin for the quarter was 36.8%. Excluding the restructuring adjustment in the current period, expenses were 11% higher than the prior-year period and operating margin was 36.6% compared to 31.1% in the fourth quarter of 2008.Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.3% compared with a somewhat unusual 28.6% in the fourth quarter of 2008. The increase was primarily due to a favorable true-up of the full year 2008 tax accrual in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, the 2008 effective tax rate included realization of U.S. manufacturing and research credits and deductions.I'd like to turn now to an update on capital allocation and stock buybacks. Moody's remains committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders by investing in growing areas of our business, reinvesting in ratings quality initiative, making selective acquisitions in related businesses, repurchasing our stock and paying a quarterly dividend. We intend to uphold our commitment to returning capital to shareholders in a manner that is consistent with maintaining sufficient liquidity. On December 15 of last year, we announced 5% increase our quarterly dividend. And in 2010, we expect to resume share repurchases at modest levels subject to available cash flow and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.During the fourth quarter of 2009, Moody's did not repurchase shares and issued approximately 400,000 shares under employee stock-based compensation plans. Outstanding shares as of December 31, 2009, totaled 237 million, representing a 1% year-over-year increase. As of December 31, 2009, Moody's had $1.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining under its current program.Now for some details on the balance sheet. Moody's had $1.2 billion of outstanding debt at year end. With approximately $550 million of additional capacity available under our revolving credit facility. We reduced total outstanding debt by $87 million during the fourth quarter and $274 million for the full year of 2009. We expect to continue to repay short-term debt during 2010. As of December 31, 2009, our net debt position or total debt minus cash and cash equivalents was $720 million, a decrease of 41% from year-end 2008.The last update I'd like to provide is on CapEx. For the full year of 2009, our total capital expenditures were $91 million and included the fit-out of our Canary Wharf location in London to which we relocated in the fourth quarter. We expect to continue to strategically invest in facilities to support business needs. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Ray."

I'll start now with a brief update on legislative and regulatory developments. We continue to communicate with oversight authorities at national, regional and global levels, and expect increased levels of regulatory activity over the near term. In the U.S., as discussed previously, in June 2009, the administration presented a blueprint for financial systems reform. In December, the U.S. House of Representatives passed its version of the Reform Bill, which contains a section on enhancing the oversight of Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, or NRSROs. The proposal include measures to increase accountability and transparency, strengthen the management and disclosure of conflicts of interest and further empower the SEC's oversight of NRSROs.The Senate has begun work on its version of the Reform Bill, which also includes the discussion draft on enhancing the oversight of credit rating agencies. The discussion draft is broadly consistent with the administration's blueprint. However, whereas the administration intentionally did not address the liability position of credit rating agencies as presently constructed, the discussion draft could increase the industry's exposure.We are currently discussing with congressional staff the provisions potential negative impact, not only for the rating agency industry, but also for the broader U.S. bond market. As the Reform Bill progresses through the banking committee, which is the committee of jurisdiction and ultimately to the full Senate, it will be subject to debate and change. If passed by the full Senate, the Reform Bill maybe further debated as the House and Senate work to address inconsistency.On the regulatory front, the SEC is considering feedback on several initiatives it published for comment in the third quarter of 2009. These include a proposed rule that would require all issuers making registered offering to disclose ratings that they use in connection with the offering, and a concept release on identifying credit rating agencies whose ratings are disclosed in registered offerings as experts under the law. If the concept release ultimately were to be enacted into an SEC rule, the credit rating agency has the consent to have their ratings use in U.S. registered offering would have additional liability associated with that consent. This idea is still in the concept release form and the SEC generally take to delivered of approach to issues presented in concept releases, it's too early to assess the likely outcome. The SEC is also considering comment on its proposals to strengthen the NRSRO compliance function and to require further disclosures about potential conflicts of interest. In addition, the SEC adopted a rule which comes into effect in June 2010, which will require structured finance issuers to make available to all interested NRSROs the data provided to the NRSRO that they have hired to assign a rating.In Europe, as noted on previous calls, EU has passed a new regulatory regime for the credit rating agency industry, which we expect will be fully in effect by the second half of 2010. We're currently in the process of implementing the regulation and in doing so, we continue to interact with national and regional authorities as well as issuers and investors. Our best estimate of the implementation cost is incorporated into our 2010 guidance.We remain focused on playing a constructive part in the discussions of these issues with Congress, the SEC and other regulatory and legislative authorities and market participants. We will continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that recognize the global nature of our ratings and that align with the G-20's direction and framework. I'll conclude this morning's prepared remarks by discussing our full year guidance. Moody's outlook for 2010 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activities, consumer borrowing and securitizations and the eventual withdrawal of government-sponsored economic stabilization initiatives. There's an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and the factual conditions differ. Moody's results for the year may differ materially from our current outlook. Our projections assume foreign currency translation at the end of year 2009 rates.We anticipate continuing recovery for 2010, but also expect market conditions to remain challenging until economic improvement across the key markets is sustained. With this outlook, we are projecting a stronger revenue increase and a return to earnings growth for 2010, with ongoing expense management to support business initiatives and regulatory and compliance efforts. For Moody's overall, the company expects full year 2010 revenue to increase in the high single digit percent range. Recurring revenue from both of our business segments will continue to provide a stable base. Expenses for full year 2010 are also expected to grow in the high single digit percent range, with modest upward progression through the year. Of the anticipated 2010 expense increase, about half is related to headcount additions to support strategic initiatives. Approximately, another $15 million of the increase is for incremental compliance, including personnel and compliance-related technology costs.The remainder is due to an unfavorable foreign exchange impact versus 2009 average rates and the restoration of budgeted bonus expense to targets. We expect that our operating margin will remain in the high 30s percent range and our effective tax rate will be in the range of 37% to 38%. We expect diluted earnings per share for full year 2010 to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.85.Our other costs [ph] will assume $70 million to $90 million capital expenditures to continue reporting investments in our technology infrastructure and address compliance requirements and to support facilities needed globally, as Linda mentioned. For the global Moody's Investor Service business, we expect revenue for the full year of 2010 to increase in the high single to low double digit percent range. We anticipate growth in the mid-teens percent range in the U.S. and mid-single digit percent range outside the U.S.Corporate Finance revenue is projected to grow in the high teens percent range as we expect strength from speculative grade issuance to offset a moderation of investment grade issuance from the high volume of 2009. Structured Finance revenue is forecast to grow in the mid-single digit percent, reflecting modest growth in most asset classes. We anticipate low single digit percent range growth in Financial Institution revenue, and low double digit percent range growth in Public, Project and Infrastructure Finance revenue. For Moody's Analytics, we project full year 2010 revenue growth in the mid-single digit percent range, driven by organic growth. We expect revenue growth in the low single digit percent range for Research, Data and Analytics, and increase in the mid-teens percent range for Risk Management Software, and growth in the high single digits to low double digit percent range for Professional Services. We expect Moody's Analytic revenue to increase at a low single digit percent rate in the U.S., and at a mid-single digit percent rate outside the U.S.That concludes our prepared remarks and joining us for the question-and-answer session are Michele Madeleine, our Chief Operating Officer for Moody's Investor Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics. We're pleased to take any questions you may have."

You're right, operating expenses were up about $28.7 million [ph] for the fourth quarter. But keep in mind that was coming off an extremely weak fourth quarter of 2008. The weakest quarter we've had in quite a while. The change is due to $4.2 million increase in salaries, $15.6 million in bonus and incentive compensation and $6.9 million in benefits and tax. That comes to $26.7 million of that increase. We've had some offsets as well and we also had some increases in the technology spending. So that would be the majority of what happened in the fourth quarter. But again, it's more of a return to normalcy as compared to a pretty anemic fourth quarter of last year."

Linda will follow with additional financial detail and operating highlights, and I'll then speak to recent developments in the legislative and regulatory area and finish with comments on Moody's outlook for 2010. After our prepared remarks we'd be happy to respond to your questions.
Moody’s results for the first quarter reflected strong corporate and financial institution debt issuance, particularly in the high-yield sector of the corporate market. Total revenue was $477 million, up 17% year-over-year, excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation revenue rose 14%.
Operating income for the first quarter was $197 million, 32% above the prior year period with negligible impact from foreign currency translation. Excluding the restructuring charge in 2009 and minor adjustments to this charge in 2010 operating income increased 22%. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.47, an increase of 24% year-over-year. Excluding these restructuring items in both periods diluted EPS grew 15%.
Our performance in the first quarter reflected the strength in corporate and financial institution issuance that I just noted, as well as improved stability in the markets and customers served by Moody’s Analytics. But, we also saw deeper than expected weakness in European structured finance. We are reaffirming our full year 2010 EPS guidance of $1.75 to $1.85, due to uncertainty that issuance levels later this year will continue to over come weakness some areas of structured finance.
I’ll now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our results and other updates.

Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translations revenue grew 14%. US revenue grew 22%, $255 million; while revenue outside the US grows by 11%, $222 million and represented 47% of the total. Recurring revenue $281 million represented 59% of total revenue compared to 67% in the prior year period.
Looking at each of our businesses, Moody’s Investor Service revenue for the quarter was $335 million 24% year-over-year increase, excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translations and IS revenue grew 21%. US revenue was up 30% over the prior year period; outside the US revenue grew 17% and represented 44% of total ratings revenue.
Global corporate finance revenue in the first quarter increased by 50% from year ago to $126 million and was primarily driven by strong high-yield bonds and loan issuance. Revenue growth was 49% in the US and 53% outside the US. Global structure finance revenue for the first quarter was $71 million, 1% below the prior year period.
US revenue grew 21% reflecting increase issuance activity and asset tax securities and commercial real estate finance. Non-US structure finance revenue was down 17%, the decline was due to weak issuance across most asset classes in Europe and better market conditions improved issuer’s excess to liquidity and reduced issuance of new securitization for Central Bank sponsor programs.
Global financial institutions revenue of $76 million grow 35% from the same quarter of 2009, primarily due to gains in the banking and insurance sectors. Revenue was up 39% in the US and 33% outside the US. Global revenue for public project and infrastructure grew 7% year-over-year to $61 million.
Revenue grew 6% in US due to stronger public finance issuance across most sectors as well as improved project finance market conditions. Non-U.S. revenue grows 8%, primarily driven by investment grade activity within project and infrastructure finance.
Turning now to Moody's Analytics, global revenue is $141million was up 2% from the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, revenue grew - increased 1 percent. US revenue of $65 million grew 3% over the first quarter of 2009. Non-US revenue increased 1% to $76 million and represented 54% of total analytics revenue.
Globally, revenue from research, data and analytics of $105 million increased by 3% from the prior-year period represented over 70% of total MA revenue. The return to growth for these businesses reflects gradual stabilization amongst our capital market customers as destructions for the financial crisis received. In our more transaction sensitive businesses, revenue from risk management software was $33million grew 4% and revenue from professional services of $3 million declined 30%.
Growth rates in both of these business units are subject significant quarter-to-quarter volatility due to the variable nature of project timings and the concentration of revenue and relatively small number of engagement.
Turning now to expenses, Moody’s first quarter expenses were $280 million, 8% above the prior year period. Excluding the restructuring charge in 2009, a minor adjustment to this charge in 2010, expenses were up 13%. The increased was primarily due to higher accruals were performance-based compensation and increased expenses for consulting and professional services. Without the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation reported expenses grew 5% from the prior period.
Operating margins for the quarter was 41.3% or 41.1%, excluding the restructuring adjustment. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.2% compared with 35.7% for the prior year period. The difference between quarters was primarily due to reductions in tax and tax related liabilities in the prior period that did not occur this quarter.
Now I would like to turn to an update on capital allocation stock buybacks and capital expenditures. During the first quarter of 2010 Moody’s repurchased 1.1 million shares at a total cost of $30 million and an average price below $27 per share and issued 1.4 million shares under employees stock-based compensation plan.
Outstanding shares as of March 31st, 2010, totaled 237 million a 1% increased from the year earlier. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders while maintaining sufficient liquidity. In 2010, we expect to continue share repurchases at modest level subject to available cash flow another ongoing capital allocation division.
At quarter end Moody's had 1.1 billion of outstanding debt and more than 600 million of additional debt capacity available under our revolving credit facilities. During this quarter we used a portion of our cash flow to reduce total debt outstanding are approximately $70 million. And net debt position has decreased by approximately $95 million to approximately $625 million.
For full year 2010, we now anticipate capital expenditures in the range of 80 million to $100 million primarily reflecting greater spending on technology initiative.
And with that I will turn the call back over to Ray.

Legislative and policy making activity on financial reform is ongoing. In March the senate banking committee voted on the financial reform bill, which we expect to be considered for discussion and debate on the Senate floor soon. As if retains the regulation of Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations or NRSROs that include measures to increase accountability and transparency, strengthen the management and disclosure of conflict of interest and further empower the SEC's oversight of NRSROs. We support most aspects of the bill, we remained concerned that bill's liability provisions to meet the unattended consequences that could negatively impact the credit market.
As such we do not believe that these are partisan issues and continue to recommend alternatives that will enhance rating agency accountability while reducing the likelihood of adverse outcomes in market and market participant.
While the passage and timing of the financial reform bill remained uncertain. President Obama has indicated his goal to sign the financial reform bill into law by the end of May. As a result it's possible that both chambers of commerce could agree on some form of the bill over the next few weeks.
It's still uncertain that final version of any legislation would be, but if the law is passed to the current liability provision we will implement appropriate changes to manage our operations prudently to correspond to a different environment. The SEC also continues to be active and its rule making related to NRSROs. During the process of implementing a final rule regarding rating agency disclosure of information related to the structured finance rating process and has submitted comments regarding other proposed rules and concept releases that relate to our industry. As the legislator focus on financial reform continues many of them studying the market crisis including congressional committee.
Moody's has participated in number of hearings and meetings held by legislators and regulators in the US and other jurisdictions and we will participate in a hearing on Wall Street on the financial crisis held by the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations this Friday. We remained focus on planning a constructed discussion of partisan issues related to our industry and the broader financial markets.
In Europe as noted on previous calls we are in the process of implementing the new European Union credit rating agency regulation and in doing so we will continue to communicate with national and regional authorities charged with providing guidance and oversight for this regulation.
Finally, as regulatory reviews and activity occur in other jurisdictions we will continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that recognize the international nature of our ratings and align with the G20 statements in the International Organizational Security Commission or IOSCO framework.
I’ll conclude this morning’s prepared remarks by discussing our full year guidance. Moody’s outlook for 2010 is based on assumptions about many macro economic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investments spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization and the eventual withdrawal of government sponsored economic stabilization initiatives.
There is an importance degree of uncertainties surrounding these assumptions and if actual conditions differ, Moody’s results for the year may differ materially from our current forecast. Our full year outlook assumes foreign currency translation at exchange rate as of the end of the first quarter 2010.
As I said earlier, we are reaffirming our full year 2010 EPS guidance in the range of $1.75 to $1.85. We still expect revenue growth in the high single to low double-digit percent range from Moody’s Investor Service and growth in the mid single digit percent range for Moody’s Analytics.
However, our 2010 guidance for certain components of our business has been modified to reflect our current view on credit market conditions and implications for the company.
My comments only address those components that have been revised and we refer you to our earnings release for a full review of our guidance.
At Moody’s Investors Service, we now expect non-US revenue growth in the low single digit percent range. Corporate finance revenue is now projected to increase in the low 20s percent range with anticipated growth and speculative grade bond and loan activity partly offset by moderation of investment grade issuance from the high volume in 2009. Based on a current visibility, we are also expecting a stronger level of high yield activity in the first half of the year our investment grade is forecast to improve slightly in the second half.
Structured finance revenue is now expected to decline in the low-single digit percent range primarily reflecting lower European issuance activity in asset back securitization and derivatives when previously anticipated. Total recovery in securitization is partly dependent on the resolution of rules and policies within and outside the US and CapEx including disclosure by issuers accounting and regulatory capital treatment of securitized assets and retention of risk.
Actually this is a qualified; Moody is affecting our application and the possible impact on issuers and investors in different jurisdictions. The Moody’s analytics we now expect full year revenue growth in the high single to low double digit percent range in risk management software and in the mid to high single digit percent in professional services.
Sales in both businesses remain inline with expectations, however revenue is subject to significant quarter-to-quarter volatility or into the business is still modest scale and revenue concentration in a relatively small number of large projects. In the software business for example, we across several larger than expected transactions which has extended both of sales cycle and the implementation timeframe.
That concludes our prepared remarks and joining us for the question-and-answer session are Michelle Madelain, the Chief Operating Officer of Moody’s Investor Service and Mark Almeida, President of Moody’s Analytics, will be please take any questions you may have.

This year, we expect the compensation accruals to be flattered and then at higher level because the business is doing well. But, as you know, we are looking at potential hiring increases in the single digit. So, it would reflect those potential increases. Now, we’re not exactly certain how those increases were lay out. We are looking at potentially, we’re deploying some people internally and we’ve got to see how our balances is out with new hires but that would be the main caused of the expense ramp for the back half of the year coupled with some increased IT expenses and compliance expenses as we move fairly implementation into the EU growth for example.

On the corporate side, as we remarked in our prepared comments, we expect that the first half of the year, speculative grade is going to be relatively stronger and then investment grade picking up the second half of the year versus spec grade. We had a very strong quarter for financial institutions and I would be surprised if we see that momentum continue throughout the rest of the year. And I would expect to see a relative stability in the public project and infrastructure line. On the Moody’s Analytics side, if you look at the seasonal pattern that we’ve had there in the past, you see that revenue has historically grown through the year and I don’t think there is anything we’re looking at that would contradict that at this point.

For structured finance the first quarter of 2010 our transaction revenue was 41%, our relationship revenue was 59%. For corporate for CFG, transaction revenue was 71%, very strong showing as I mentioned and 29% relationship revenue. Financial Institutions were 43% transaction and 57% relationship and public project and infrastructure was 55% transaction and 45% relationship.
So for the rating agency as a whole we are running 55% transaction and 45% relationship. It's pretty interesting both two reversal where we were at this time last year. Now for analytic we are running 8% transaction, 92% relationship and for the company as a whole - excuse me 41% transaction, 59% relationship given the strength in issuance.

But I think would satisfy a greater sense of accountability and would allow the industry to operate in a way that’s going to be as constructive for credit markets as possible, so that’s really where we would urge law makers and regulators to focus and then we will see how that works out.

Moody’s results for the second quarter were strong given the greater volatility in debt capital markets as compared to the first quarter. Total revenue was $478 million, up 6% from the second quarter of 2009, was largely driven by the resurgence of US-based bank loan activity for refinancing and LBO transactions, plus growth across Moody’s Analytics.
Operating income for the second quarter was $191 million, an increase of 2% year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.51, 11% above the $0.46 in the prior year period. Excluding legacy tax and restructuring items in both years, diluted EPS for the quarter of $0.49 grew by 14% year-over-year.
Turning to year-to-date performance, revenue for the first six months of 2010 was $954 million, 11% increase from the first half of 2009. Expenses were $567 million, up 8% from the prior year period, and operating income of $387 million increased 15%.
Revenue at Moody’s Investors Service in the first six months of 2010 was $664 million, an increase of 14% from the prior year period. Moody’s Analytics revenue of $290 million was 4% higher than the prior year period. We’re reaffirming our full-year 2010 EPS guidance of $1.75 to $1.85 based on the sound first-half performance, but we expect the uneven credit market conditions will persist during the second half.
I will now turn the call over to Linda to provide further commentary on our results and other updates.

The impact of foreign currency translation on revenue was negligible. For the second quarter, US revenue increased 10% to $262 million; while revenue outside the US increased 1% to $215 million, representing 45% of Moody’s total revenue. Recurring revenue of $284 million represented 59% of total revenue compared to 61% in the prior year period.
Looking at each of our businesses, Moody’s Investors Service revenue for the quarter was $329 million, a 6% increase year-over-year. US revenue was up 12% over the prior year period; outside the US revenue declined 2% and represented 41% of total ratings revenue.
Global corporate finance revenue in the second quarter increased 19% from a year ago to $128 million. Revenue grew 30% in the US, primarily driven by strong activity and high yield bank loans, which more than offset reduced issuance of investment grade bonds.
Outside the US, revenue increased 1% from the prior year period, with strong issuance in Asia and Latin America, mostly offset by limited activity in Europe and Canada. Global structured finance revenue for the second quarter was $73 million, 2% below the prior year period.
In the US revenue declined 4% year-over-year with reduced activity in derivatives and asset backed commercial paper programs, partially offset by growth in commercial real estate finance issuance. Non-US structured finance revenue grew 1%, with improved European covered bond issuance, most offset by declines in other asset classes.
Global financial institutions revenue of $63 million decreased 6% from the second quarter of 2009 primarily due to issuance declines in the US and European insurance and banking sectors. US financial institutions revenue was down 9%, while outside US revenue declined 4%.
Global revenue for public, project and infrastructure finance business grew by 6% year-over-year to $64 million. Revenue increased 13% in the US, with higher revenue in the public and project finance sectors. Non-U.S. revenue declined 8% primarily due to lower issuance volumes in European infrastructure finance.
Turning now to Moody's Analytics, global revenue for is Moody's Analytics of $149 million was up 6% from the second quarter of 2009. US revenue grew by 6% year-over-year to $67 million. Non-US revenue increased by 7% to $82 million and represented 55% of total analytics revenue.
All lines of business grew over the prior year quarter led by risk management software, which generated the majority of the quarter’s revenue growth. Globally revenue from research, data and analytics of $105 million increased by 3% from the prior-year period and represented over 70% of total MA revenue. The return to growth for these businesses reflect further stabilization among our capital market customers, as disruption from the financial crisis recede.
In a more transaction sense of the businesses, revenue from risk management software of $39 million grew 16%, while revenue from professional services of $5 million, increased 14% from the prior year period. Growth rates in both of these business units are subject to significant quarter-to-quarter volatility due to the variable nature of project timing and the concentration of revenue in a relatively small number of engagements.
Turning now to expenses, Moody’s second quarter expenses were $287 million, an increase of 9% compared to the second quarter of 2009. The increase was primarily due to greater headcount and incentive compensation as well as higher spending related to legal and regulatory requirements.
Excluding minor restructuring related items from both periods, Moody’s second quarter 2010 expenses increased 10%. Excluding restructuring items in both periods, operating margin for the second quarter of 2010 was 39.9% compared to 42.2% in 2009.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.1% compared with 36.4% for the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits and other tax related liabilities resulting from the closing of the various tax audits, lower taxes on foreign income, and the favorable resolution of a legacy tax matter.
Now I would like to turn to an update on capital allocation and stock buybacks. During the second quarter of 2010, Moody’s repurchased 2.8 million shares at a total cost of $70 million and issued 0.1 million shares under employees stock-based compensation plan. Outstanding shares as of June 30, 2010, totaled 234 million, representing a 1% decline from the year earlier. As of June 30, 2010, Moody’s had 1.3 million of share purchase authority remaining under its current program.
At quarter-end, Moody's had $1.1 billion of outstanding debt and approximately $640 million of additional debt capacity available under its revolving credit facility. We used a portion of our cash flow to reduce total outstanding debt by $16 million during the second quarter. Net debt was potentially unchanged at approximately $620 million. We remain committed to using our strong cash flow to create value for shareholders, while maintaining sufficient liquidity.
In 2010, we expect to continue share repurchase at modest levels, subject to available cash flow, market conditions, and other ongoing capital allocation decisions.
And with that I will turn the call back over to Ray.

I’ll continue now with an update on legislative and regulatory developments.
In the US, last week the president signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act, which establishes a revised legal and regulatory infrastructure for the US financial system. We believe that regulatory reform is healthy for the markets, and we’re committed to implementing the provisions that are specific to our industry as quickly and effectively as possible.
The intent of the law regarding credit rating agencies is increased transparency and accountability through a number of measures. The majority of the provisions seek to enhance the regulatory environment for Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations, or NRSROs, and will be implemented through rule-making by the SEC.
Certain of provisions, however are effective immediately, including the revised litigation pleading standard provided for by section 933 and the rescission of rule 436 G. Section 933 provides that the initial complaint in a Federal securities fraud case against a credit rating agency will be sufficient if a plaintiff adequately alleges that the rating agency knowingly or recklessly either failed to conduct a reasonable investigation of factual elements relevant to the rating, or failed to obtain independent third party verification of factual material relied upon for the rating.
This provision changes only the pleading standard for bringing a case, not the liability standard that sets forth what a plaintiff will ultimately be required to prove. Moody’s analysts have always investigated the factual elements relevant to our ratings, including in many instances a review of information that has been verified by independent third parties.
In response to the revised pleading standard however, we are undertaking certain processes and operational changes, which include enhanced documentation of some of our existing processes, and seeking additional third-party verification where appropriate. We are also considering other possible actions that may help mitigate some of the financial risks of this revised pleading standard.
Regarding the other litigation related provision, as a result of the rescission of SEC rule 436 G, if an NRSRO provides consent for a rating to be included in the 1933 Act registration statement or prospectus. The NRSRO is subject to expert liability. Moody’s like several other NRSROs has stated that we are not able to provide that consent without further study of the legal consequences.
However, this is no way limits our rating activity of the public availability of Moody’s ratings through our website or press releases or other multi-uses of our ratings in the offering process. While the rescission of 436 G is applicable to US public securities offerings, it does not cover securities offered outside the US, or US private placements or municipal bonds. It is most relevant to limited sectors of the market where there is a regulatory requirement to include ratings in a registration statement or prospectus.
As we have discussed for more than a decade, Moody’s support through removal of ratings from regulations, and believes it is in the best interests of all market participants. In Europe, as noted on previous calls, we are in the process of implementing the new European Union credit rating agency regulation, and continue to communicate with national and regional authorities charged with providing guidance and oversight for this regulation.
We are completing our application to register under the new EU regulatory regime for credit rating agencies, and anticipate that additional European regulatory review will be ongoing during the second half of the year. Finally, as regulatory reviews and activity occur in other jurisdictions, we will continue to advocate for globally consistent approaches that align with the G-20 statements.
I would like to conclude this morning’s prepared remarks by discussing our full year guidance. Moody's outlook for 2010 is based on assumptions about many macroeconomic and capital market factors, including interest rates, corporate profitability and business investment spending, merger and acquisition activity, consumer borrowing and securitization, and the eventual withdrawal of government-sponsored economic stabilization initiatives. There is an important degree of uncertainty surrounding these assumptions and, if actual conditions differ, Moody's results for the year may differ materially from our current forecast.
As I mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our full-year 2010 EPS guidance in the range of $1.75 to $1.85; however, certain components of 2010 guidance have been modified to reflect our current view of credit market conditions and implications for the company. My comments will primarily focus on those components that have been revised, and we refer you to our earnings release for a full review of our guidance.
Our full-year outlook assumes foreign currency translation at exchange rates as of the end of a second quarter. For Moody’s Corporation we now expect revenue to grow in the mid-single-digit percent range and expenses to increase in the mid- to high-single-digit range. As previously discussed, we expect operating expenses to increase throughout the year, and we continue to believe incremental compliance costs related to new regulation will be approximately $15 million for this year and $15 million to $25 million for next year.
The company still projects the full-year 2010 operating margin in the high-30% range and now expects the effective tax rate in the range of 34% to 35%. At Moody’s Investors Service, we expect global revenue growth in the mid-single digit percent range. Reduced issuance activity and challenging credit market conditions in some key markets abroad are expected to continue going forward.
In the US, we expect MIS revenue to increase in the low double-digit percent range, while non-U.S. revenue is expected to decline in the low single digit percent range. Corporate finance revenue is projected to increase in the high teens to low 20s percent range, structured finance revenue is expected to decline in the high single to low double-digit percent range, while revenue from financial institutions is expected to be relatively flat.
Revenue from public, project and infrastructure finance is projected to increase in the mid-single digit percent range. At Moody’s Analytics, we continue to expect full-year 2010 revenue to increase from the mid-single digit percent range. Revenue in the US is now expected to grow in the mid-single digit percent range, the same rate of growth as outside the US. We continue to project revenue growth in the low single digit percent range for research data and analytics, while growth for risk management software is now expected to be in the low double digit percent range. Professional services is expected to grow in the mid-single digit percent range.
That concludes our prepared remarks and joining us for the question-and-answer section are Michel Madelain, Chief Operating Officer, Moody's Investors Service; and Mark Almeida, President of Moody's Analytics. We will be pleased to take any questions you may have.

We have a very good quarter regarding the tax rate. Obviously, we had some beneficial one-off situations, and then we also work hard on making sure that we are providing the correct tax structure for the corporation, given that in general 50% of our revenues are now oversees.

So let us see where the politicians do and we will update you when we do next year’s guidance.
