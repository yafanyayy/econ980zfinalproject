First, as it relates to the fourth quarter, we recorded diluted EPS of $0.89. That does exclude $0.22 related to the transaction and integration planning costs primarily associated with the Black & Decker merger.
Diluted EPS from continuing operations on a GAAP basis then was $0.67. I think important to note, $0.04 to $0.05 of the $0.89 was an unanticipated tax benefit and the remainder of the tax benefit was included in our guidance as explained in the press release, and that we’ll cover in a little bit more detail later on in this morning’s presentation.
So for the year, diluted EPS was $2.80 versus $2.74 in 2008 again excluding the $0.22 per share in the fourth quarter related to the Black & Decker transaction. Fourth quarter was $0.89 and for the year that brought us to $3.02 which did include the gain of the debt extinguishment reported in the second quarter 2009.
So EPS for the year up 10% versus 2008 excluding the fourth quarter charges and 2% on a GAAP basis including those charges.
Quarterly gross margin rate 40.7% was quite encouraging and it was our second consecutive quarter above 40%. Pricing, cost productivity initiatives and commodity deflation all continued to offset the impact of the volume under absorption and that led us to a record annual gross margin for the year of 40.4%.
Cash flow was encouraging as well, $446 million for the year, up 6% versus 2008, and working capital reached 7.9 turns, another record. And that’s due to the ongoing success of the Stanley fulfillment system that Jim Loree is going to talk to you a little bit more about in his part of the presentation.
Looking very briefly at some of the segment highlights, Security achieved 20% operating margin while absorbing a 4% revenue decline. The CDIY segment profit improved $17 million or 71% while the Industrial profit rate improved sequentially to 11.3%, and Don Allen is going to give you more detail on the segments in his portion.
Last, but certainly not least, the planning for the pending combination of Black & Decker remains on track. Close is expected at the end of the first quarter or the beginning of the second quarter and I’m going to spend a few minutes updating everyone on that which may help or even preempt some of the questions, and everybody will be on the same page.
Two slides on the transaction; the first one is just a bit of a refresher and the second one, think of it as an update. The benefits of this combination are compelling to say the least. The strategic benefits which we’ve talked about before will make us a global leader in both hand and power tools with an iconic brand portfolio and over 250 years of combined history.
We’ll have greater scale in both hand and power tools as well as storage, mechanical security and engineered fastenings, a world class innovation process, global, low cost sourcing and manufacturing platforms and additional presence in high growth emerging markets.
Both companies are growing rapidly from a low base in India, China and the rest of Asia and Black & Decker as many of you know brings a very strong presence in Latin America to the combination.
The financial benefits we believe are equally compelling. It will be highly accretive with $1.00 per share of accretion projected by year three, $350 million in cost synergies on an annual basis with the opportunity for margin improvement both from the cost synergies as well as embedding SFS across a larger volume base.
Free cash flow is anticipated to be in excess of $1 billion and with $1.5 billion in EBITDA by the third year of the transaction. And of course, with that cash flow we’ll have increased resources to invest in security solutions, engineered fastening, other high growth platforms as well as organic growth at the core businesses, and as we’ve stated before, our capital allocation going forward is planned to be similar to what it’s been in the past; roughly two-thirds of our cash flow focused on strategic, accretive acquisitions and one-third being returned to the shareholders in the form of both dividends and selected stock repurchases.
A strong balance sheet is also important. We’re going to have a strong balance sheet going in and it’s going to be strengthened further over time.
In terms of an update on the transaction, what have we done to date and what do have left to be done. As you know, we have received HSR approval. The period expired on December 29, and we’ve established January 12, 2010 as the record date for shareholders to be involved in voting for the transaction.
We filed a preliminary S-4 with the SEC for review and we’re awaiting comments on the second version of that document. We’ve announced an integration team with co-leaders from both Stanley and Black & Decker; I’ll touch more on that in a minute, along with a new organization design and a senior leadership team for the combined company.
And let me say what I can about that now because we’ve certainly had a lot of questions and we want to be sure everybody’s on the same page and has the same information.
The senior corporate structure going forward was in fact identified in the press release. Jim Loree, Don Allen and myself will essentially have the same positions in the new company going forward as we have at Stanley.
We have established a synergy steering committee that Nolan Archibald with co-share and [Jim Don] along with Mark Matthew, our head of Human Resources in [Mosel Agrasse], head of our European business and our global industrial and automotive platform will sit on that synergy team.
As I mentioned, we’ve established integration management office that’s co-chaired by Brett Bontreger, a tested and proven Stanley executive who was involved in integrating Facom among other things, and most of our major acquisitions, along with Tony Milando from Black & Decker, who is currently Vice President of Operations for the worldwide power tools and accessories business.
Under Brett and Tony there are fourteen dedicated teams focused on various businesses and functions with one member from Black & Decker and one member from Stanley on each of those teams and importantly, no business leaders are on those teams, and the business leaders will be charged with focusing on the core business and continuing to do what they do best, and the integration teams will collaborate closely with them to ensure that we achieve the synergies.
Looking quickly at the segments, going forward our intent is to report externally in the same three segments that Stanley currently reports. In Security, the Convergent Security Solutions business will essentially remain intact while the Black & Decker Hardware and Home Improvement business will be integrated within the Mechanical Access Security business.
On the Industrial segment, that essentially will remain intact as well with the global platform leaders in Industrial and Automotive repair and infrastructure reporting to Jim Loree as they do now.
The Black & Decker Engineered Solutions business, probably better known as MHAR will also remain intact with Mike Tyll who currently heads that business for Black & Decker managing that business and the Stanley Assembly Technologies business will be integrated within MHAR.
And finally, the Black & Decker worldwide Power Tools and Accessories business along with the Stanley Construction and Do-It-Yourself business will become the new CDIY segment. It will be under the leadership of Stanley executives and six of the top ten executives in that organization will at this stage, are planned to come from Black & Decker. 
That will ensure the knowledge; the skill sets that are unique to power tools as well as the knowledge that exists within the business will carry forward in the new organization. Collaboration to the extent that we’ve been allowed to do so has been quite encouraging so far.
And lastly, on the geographies looking at Europe, Asia and Latin America, existing leaders will focus on either the core business or growth opportunities depending on the geography and there’s a somewhat equal distribution at this stage of Stanley and Black & Decker executives.
That’s all that I’m really able to say about the organization at this stage, but the structure as announced, is consistent with the dual objectives of protecting the core franchise while integrating the two companies as rapidly and as prudent as we can as we convey to achieve the potential synergies that are available from this transformational opportunity.
Jumping back quickly to the slide, what’s left to be done; we need to continue to execute on our 2010 goals, and of course we need to obtain the remaining regulatory approvals from the EU as well as other foreign jurisdictions.
We need a shareholder vote. We need approval from both the Stanley and Black & Decker shareholders and of course we need to retain key talent on both sides of the organization. That all leads as I mentioned to expected close somewhere near the end of the first quarter or the beginning of the second quarter.
Solid progress we think we have achieved on all fronts. Integration planning is well underway and hopefully that answers a lot of questions that you might have had and we can focus on some other things the rest of this call.
So let’s get back to Stanley’s fourth quarter. Looking at revenues around the world, they declined in most of the world as you’ll see in the U.S. on the left hand side, second from the top, revenues down 14% both as reported and organically excluding any effects of currency and in Europe, down 9%, down 16% excluding currency and acquisitions. 
Asia and Australia did show some growth and it’s a complicated chart with a lot of numbers on it but we’re trying to provide you as much data as possible and hopefully the message is clear. Revenues remain down but the rate of decline was lower and revenues actually increased on a sequential basis as shown on the next slide.
Looking at fourth quarter revenue by segment, again a lot of data on this chart but what I really wanted to point out is some of the trends by segment to supplement what we just showed you by geography.
Volume and sources of growth is identical to what we listed in our press release in terms of the do to or the walk, but if we focus on the fourth quarter, you see volume down 16% for the entire company offset by price, was 1% favorable so organic growth declined 15%.
Currency helped 4%. There was no impact from acquisitions in the fourth quarter as previous acquisitions anniversaried by the end of the third quarter so total revenues down 11%. That is all in our press release.
Looking at the segment results, just a couple of things to focus on; CDIY down 8% in total, 14% volume decline which was the 8% revenue decline was obviously a significant improvement on a sequential basis.
Security held up fairly well, volume down 9%, revenue down 4%. So the total company as you see got 11% in revenue, volume down 16%.
Moving on to earnings, at a high level you see the 11% volume decline, but still translating to $0.89 of earnings which is 39% improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2008. Within the fourth quarter of 2008 as stated in our press release, there were $0.59 of restructuring costs taking GAAP earnings to $0.05 a share.
This year, per our press release, $0.89 of operating earnings, $0.22 of charges related to the Black & Decker transaction costs, resulting in GAAP earnings of $0.67.
Looking at margins, a nice improvement of 210 basis points. Both Jim and Don are going to talk about how that worked by segment as well as what’s driving that margin improvement and looking at the tax rate of minus 4.4%, you see a little bit of an explanation in the box. It’s the effect of resolution of some income tax audits.
The tax rate would have been 22% excluding this $14 million benefit. And again, as referenced in the press release, $11 million of that $14 million benefit was due to the closing of U.S. audits through 2006. The other $3 million was a favorable adjustment in the U.K. around the deductibility of certain interest payments.
As you know, we’re not allowed to based on recent FAS rule changes to release any of those reserves until the audits are formally closed. The audits closed in the fourth quarter. We released the reserves, and that’s the impact as it related to EPS.
Let’s turn it over to Jim who’s going to talk to you about some very encouraging margin performance driven by a combination of cost control, targeted investments and most importantly, the benefits of the Stanley fulfillment system.

As you indicated one highlight for 2009 was the extraordinary in the area of gross margin. We achieved 40.4% for the year, a record with a 40.7% rate in the fourth quarter. For the full year that’s a 260 basis point increase over prior year",1304,"Thanks John. As you indicated one highlight for 2009 was the extraordinary in the area of gross margin. We achieved 40.4% for the year, a record with a 40.7% rate in the fourth quarter. For the full year that’s a 260 basis point increase over prior year, and this was achieved with the backdrop being the worst economic conditions in 60 years.
And the 2009 performance, as well as the long term positive trend is really a function of four factors. One is the tight operational management across our businesses as it related to productivity projects, supplier management, price realization, product mix and new product vitality.
Secondly, it’s the strength of our value propositions for our customers, able to get paid for those. And we also are benefiting quite extensively from the implementation of the Stanley fulfillment system which I’ll talk about more in a moment and then finally the deliberate shifting of our portfolio in higher margin, higher growth area.
And now as we look forward, the challenge will be as we merge with Black & Decker and their gross margins in the low 30’s so on a weighted basis when we put the companies together, we’ll be right around 35% or so, and we need to begin this march forward over the coming years to get the combined company back up to these levels over time. And that will be an exciting challenge that we’ll take on with the integration process.
Now moving to working capital, I have to say our fourth quarter working capital performance was a very pleasant and positive surprise. Coming into the end of the year, we were confident that we had plans in place to achieve mid to upper six turns for the year and we basically blew that number away with a volume performance which was essentially in line with what we were expecting, and we achieved 7.9 turns, a feat which I think will put us in good stead with best in class as it relates to our peers.
It was a two turn increase and up almost three turns versus Q3 sequentially and was a major driver behind our $446 million of free cash flow which was our second best ever free cash flow performance, again in this very tough economy.
As you can see, inventory dropped 15 days. Receivables dropped 11 days. We were able to hold payables, so a nice performance across the elements and in total, a very significant $243 million decrease in working capital.
Moving to the how, it’s all about the sustained process improvement through the Stanley fulfillment system. And with Black & Decker as we integrate, we see an opportunity here as well in the coming years. They’ve been making good progress in working capital as well, but not as dramatic and not as quick, and I think we can assist them with that and really unlock several $100 million worth of cash flow.
Here’s a little more information and color on SFS. As I mentioned before, it has four elements. Let’s start in the upper right hand side with the S&OP process. That’s all about keeping supply and demand in balance. 
Then we move to common platforms in the lower right. That is basically standardization of process and IT platforms to provide scalability and efficiency. Now this is an area where conversely, Black & Decker can help us because they’ve made excellent progress in this area in their worldwide power tools and accessories business which is about 70% of their company and depending combination will actually accelerate Stanley’s standalone ability to drive towards common platforms. We’re very excited about that.
Then we move to the lower left hand part of the slide and we talk about transformational lean. Stanley’s trademark transformational lean methodology combines traditional supply chain and manufacturing lean with back room and then combines what I call incremental lean which is what most people do with respect to lean, with an even more powerful application of lean to gain changing transformation of business models in order to create competitive advantage.
In this area it’s early days for us. We have some really interesting experiments going on and implementing here. We’ve made good progress on the incremental part. Now we move to the business model transformation part and we see tremendous opportunity here in the coming years.
Then finally, complexity management in the upper left, it’s all about eradicating complexity in everything we do except where customers gain value from complexity in what we offer, and then it’s about providing it most efficiently and then getting paid for it.
Those are the four elements of the Stanley fulfillment system. They work in concert. They’ve been working well. It’s early days as we look at the implementation of the system and we’re very proud of the accomplishments so far but there’s many, many more to come in this area.
My final slide today is about the brand. There are several key messages here. Number one, the spending is up. If we look at the spending it’s not on the chart, but if we look at it over the ’05 to ’09 time frame, we were averaging about $21 million a year of spend. That’s in stark contrast to the ’01 to ’03 time frame when we were investing $10 million a year.
What we achieved from ’05 to ’09 in terms of unaided awareness improvements and frankly improvements across the spectrum of various measurements of types of awareness. In 2005 we had a 27% unaided awareness number and that went to 35% in ’06 and 41% in ’07, 43% in ’08 and finally 48%, a big increase this year, and we’re currently approaching the level that Stanley had at its peak historical level achieved in the early 80’s of 55%.
So lots of good progress in the last five years, and one of the other themes is that we’re trying to spend our money much more wisely and get the biggest bang for our buck so very little TV advertising, and then spreading it around several different areas.
The latest initiative that we have is we have become the official tool provider of the Walt Disney World Resort and we have a partnership with Disney which is a 10 year alliance. It brings branding in the parks, B to B opportunities and other elements with a select group of alliance partners.
We have construction wall signage throughout the Walt Disney Resort. Stanley, Mac and Vidmar products are highlighted in the Lights Motor Action garage. We’re also providing cabinets, tools, branded benches, cabinets and tools and accessories for the test track line area and the ride itself. So that’s very exciting and just getting underway. 
Of course we continue to be a Nascar sponsor. We have sustained brand exposure over 38 weekends with primary sponsorship in 20 races, extensive customer and user activation and numerous race related in store and on track promotions, and a very healthy menu for 2010.
Last year’s big story for the brand awareness moving the needle was the Major League Baseball sponsorship. In 2009 we had 11 teams. We’re going to add one in 2010, thus giving us signage in 40% of all the games and we have really placed our signs strategically to maximize television exposure and we love and thank our Hartford neighbors at ESPN folks for their sports center coverage of our brand and its saturation that we get from all that exposure.
And then of course last year we also began sponsoring the English Premier League which is the number one soccer league in the world and 650 million people around the world watch that every week and it’s an exciting initiative.
Now I’ll turn it over to Don Allen who will take you through some of the numbers.

As we typically try to show you each quarter, we take last year’s SG&A and walk it forward. I’ll start with the right side of the chart.
If you look at the cost reductions that we’ve done throughout the year, just as a reminder, in total we reduced cost by $265 million in 2009. Of that number, about $150 million impacted SG&A and the head count impacted was just under 3,000 individuals. So in the fourth quarter we saw a $37 million benefit of that which is 13% reduction to the base versus the fourth quarter of ’08. 
And then looking at some of the increases on the left side of the chart, we did have some integration costs associated with the planning of the merger of Stanley and Black & Decker of about $5 million. 
FX was a negative impact year over year of $10 million and then we continued investments in SG&A. Jim just spent a fair amount of time talking through the brand investments and the significance of that. As many of you are aware we made investments in our Security businesses to put more feet on the street and focus on certain share gains we can achieve.
And then as we began to re-instate some of our employee benefits in the fourth quarter that were suspended earlier in the year, we begin to see some cost increases there. So the net result is about a 2% decline in SG&A and we continue to see the impact of our reductions in the fourth quarter.
Now I’d like to spend a little bit of time walking you through the segments. We start with the Security segment. Once again Security was the gem of the quarter. In the four quarters of 2009 we experienced in essence a single digit revenue declines but have been improving their profit rate throughout the year and year over year as well.
So if we look at revenues, as John mentioned, revenues were down 4%, organically down 7% so a consistent trend that we’ve seen throughout the year. The good news is that the segment profit was actually up 4% on that small revenue decline which resulted in segment profit rate of 19.9% so just under 20% which was off of last quarter which was close to 21%, so 150 basis point improvement versus the fourth quarter of ’08.
Looking at the two sub business within our Security segment, starting with Convergent Security Solutions first, revenues declined similar in line with the total segment, single digits. They continue to see weakness in the installation revenues and health care capital expenditures affecting some of the small health care businesses in this business.
That continues to be a constraint as we move forward. The good news is their recurring monthly revenues continue to grow and we saw growth in the fourth quarter again in the low double digits range.
So as we move forward looking at profit rate and revenue trends, I’ll spend more time later on, but we’ve seen a continual trend in the Convergent business of improving their profit rate performance because they’re really been focused on the integration of the acquisitions, driving the benefits and cost reduction, productivity in their cost base, and obviously the mix towards more RMR versus installation improves their profit rate as well.
On the Mechanical Access side of the segment, similar story but slightly different reasons for them. Revenues declined a little bit more significantly than we saw in the Convergent side. They have been affected by the slowdown in commercial construction more than we’ve seen in Convergent. 
However, they’ve been very focused on retaining and maintaining certain national customers, and that’s something we will continue to be focused on as we got through this slowdown in commercial construction.
A great story for them in line with the overall working capital story for the company is that working capital turn for MAS were up 14.7% and along with that they improved their fill rates. So last but not least, their profit rate improved as well through price realization, the deflation that we saw in commodity prices and then the continued cost reductions that they’ve done throughout the year.
Moving to the Industrial segment, Industrial as you know throughout the year has really suffered on the top line. They’ve seen significant inventory corrections throughout the supply chain to our end customers, and in the fourth quarter we did see significant revenue declines again, although not as significant as we saw on the previous three quarters of 2009.
So revenues were down 23%, organically 26% and the segment profit was only down 14% versus that revenue decline as we did see many of the cost actions that we started in Europe in the spring of 2009 were completed in the fourth quarter so we saw the benefit of that in the segment profit, and as a result, the segment profit rate was at 11.3% which was a sequential improvement from the third quarter where it was at 9.2%. So we saw a nice impact of those cost actions coming through in the fourth quarter.
As I mentioned, we did see significant destocking trends throughout the year. We believe that they have ceased in the fourth quarter in the Industrial segment and I’ll talk more about what we think that means for next year later on in the presentation.
Facom’s revenue decline has slowed to 11% where we saw significant declines in the previous quarter in the mid 20% to 30% range, and they’ve been very focused on their new product development along with the Proto business and how we can actually gain share in this type of declining environment and that continues to be something that’s always been significant in the Facom business and will be going forward.
The last item to mention is the Mac tools business. Mac has significantly improved their profit share over the year and that was despite an 18% drop in their unit volume as they were very focused on price realization and actions with the end customers and cost reductions.
CDIY had a nice quarter as well in the fourth quarter as we continue to see and experience further stabilization in this segment. The revenues were down 8% as John mentioned. Organically they were down 13%, and so in the first three quarters revenues were down 25%, 28% and 23%, and now only down 8%.
Part of that is certainly the comps we’re comparing to in the fourth quarter of ’08, but it’s also an improvement on a sequential basis, so we are seeing nice stabilization and the potential for some growth as we move forward.
Segment profit up 71%, really being driven by the integration of the Bostitch business in the consumer tools and storage throughout the year, significant productivity within the plants, some of them associated with Bostitch but also just the normal productivity programs that we implement and then certainly SG&A actions that they’ve taken have assisted in getting to almost a 12% segment profit rate in the fourth quarter.
The last think I’ll mention here on CDIY is that the working capital turn has improved to 7.9 turns. That almost a two turn improvement versus the prior year. So clearly, SFS has really taken hold on our CDIY segment.
On the next chart I’d like to spend a little bit of time talking about some of the key trends as we move forward. If we start with Security, the way this chart works, we showed it for the first time for you last quarter, is up top, the yellow line represents the segment profit rate over the previous two years, and then the gray bars represent the unit volume decline within revenue.
In Security, as I mentioned earlier, installations within our Convergent business are showing some signs of slight improvement in Europe but they continue to be very weak within the U.S. and that will be something we continue to monitor as we go into 2010.
Commercial construction continues the slowdown. The slowdown in commercial construction continues to impact both businesses, but even more in our Mechanical Access business. So we’re beginning to focus on other areas such as education and health care verticals to try to offset the impact of that as we move forward.
We would expect that any slowdown or recovery in commercial construction market would probably lag a recovery in the residential construction market, so it appears that residential construction has stabilized, and we’ll see as we move forward what the time frame for both those recoveries are.
Last but not least, we believe our profit rate will likely continue to very strong in our segment as we continue to focused on price inflation management as well as effective cost management, and trying to gain share in all different areas as much as possible.
Industrial clearly is lagging behind both businesses and lagging behind CDIY. We do believe that the vast majority of the inventory destocking we saw is behind us. Industrial production worldwide continues to be up so we do believe that will ultimately have a positive impact on our business moving forward but we are cautious as we move into 2010.
We believe the destocking is behind us as I mentioned and there is a suggestion of a possibility of improvement as certain restocking may need to take place in this segment because of the low inventory levels throughout the supply chain.
But we’ll be focused on top line weakness and really trying to maintain our profit rates as we experienced in late 2009 and ensure that our cost base is appropriately adjusted and maintained to where it is today. The profit rate has probably bottomed out in the third quarter in the low 9% range. We think that it will likely continue moving forward at a trend that we saw in the fourth quarter.
CDIY clearly has stabilized as I mentioned and as many of you know this segment is impacted by housing starts and consumer confidence, and so we believe there will be modest growth in this segment in 2010. We do think the growth in the U.S. will be muted and emerging markets will be much stronger, but it’s something that we’ll keep a close eye on to see if there is a stronger recovery as we move into 2010.
Again, being very focused on new product development, innovation, our marketing to be a key driver to our top line, gain as much market share as we can in this difficult environment. And then profit rates continue the migration back to historical levels in 2010.
So that’s the segments. Let’s spend a little bit of time on free cash flow which is the next page. Jim touched on the significant working capital performance of 7.9 turns which resulted in over $200 million of working capital positive cash flow in the fourth quarter and for the year, $226 million.
The net result of our earnings and our working capital turn performance offset by our planned capital expenditures was $263 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter which is up significantly over $100 million versus last year’s fourth quarter mostly due to the working capital performance.
And then for the year, our free cash flow was $446 million, up almost $25 million versus last year or 6% which is a significant performance considering the revenue pressures that we saw throughout 2009.
Next, our balance sheet; as many of you are aware we had a plan to deleverage ourselves in 2009 by $200 million. We slightly over achieved that where our debt went down $229 million and our adjusted debt to capital is right around 30% which is exactly what we were targeting for the year.
So we’re very pleased with that. Obviously the cash flow that we experienced and the significant working capital, turn improvement really facilitated us achieving that goal.
So let’s move to guidance. The first thing I want to note is that the guidance we’re providing excludes any impacts of the Black & Decker and Stanley merger so this would be Stanley standalone for 2010.
We believe that the EPS will range from $3.00 to $3.25 on a standalone basis and there’s certain assumptions that we’ve put in place that align with that particular net result. Net revenues should increased 2% to 4%. That’s primarily unit volume revenue increases.
We believe it reflects a modest economic recovery. Each one of our segments will be impacted differently as I just described, but we think it’s a reasonable modest recovery.
There are a couple of non recurring items in 2009 that you need to factor in as you look at our 2009 EPS and try to roll forward to this guidance, the first of which is a $0.34 gain on debt extinguishment that we did in the second quarter where we were actually able to repurchase over $100 million of our junior subordinated debt securities for about $55 million for a $44 million gain.
John mentioned the Black & Decker transactional cost in the fourth quarter of $0.22. And then the next item would be a reminder to folks that we will have a diluted impact of some shares that we need to issue around May of 2010. It will be about $0.16 EPS dilution and it’s associated with our equity unit hybrid instrument.
The proceeds from that will be used to pay down other debt maturities that obviously mature at certain points throughout 2010.
The tax rate we expect to turn back to more normalized levels. That’s a diluted impact of about $0.20 to $0.25 year over year.
And then the next items which is certainly significant, as we’ve mentioned during the year, we expect about $100 million of cost carry over from 2009 to 2010. We have $75 million here as we have reinstated certain employee benefit costs as well as certain other costs that we are allowing to go back into the system so it nets to $75 million carry over.
And we have certain investments we want to make, continue to make in brand and security as we move forward and those investments will certainly be monitored as we move throughout the year and ensure that our top line actually performs in the 2% to 4% range.
Restructuring and impairment related charges should be flat to 2009. They were $45 million in 2009. We had $41 million in the restructuring line and about $4 million in the OM lines up above, so we expect that to be relatively flat as we will continue certain plan rationalization activities in line with our SFS.
And then we expect a net zero impact from price and inflation. We currently have very little inflation in our estimates as they’re based on current commodity prices and if commodity prices increase and we experience inflation, we would expect that we would be able to pass that onto our customers in a price increase.
Free cash flow estimate is about $300 million to $350 million. We’re estimating a relatively modest improvement in working capital for Stanley as we will be investing a lot of time in the merger of Stanley and Black & Decker and also trying to implement a lot of the SFS principals within the new company.
And last thing I’ll mention here is that we still are committed to the financial guidance provided with respect to the new combined company of Stanley and Black & Decker as we rolled out in November of last year.
So in summary, we continue to move forward on a rigorous integration planning for Black & Decker. It’s something that a lot of us are investing a great deal of time in at this point. We’re very much focused though on making sure that our core businesses continue to perform strongly and we’re focused on market share gains, customer services and keeping our fill rates up and improving them.
We do see modest signs of growth potential within CDIY and that’s encouraging, but we are being cautious as we move forward here to make sure that if a market recovery happens, we’re ready and prepared to handle it, but if it doesn’t we have contingency plans in place to accordingly.
SFS is going to play an integral role in really navigating any significant upswing in demand that we experience as well as the successful integration of Black & Decker. We believe we’re ready to serve our customers in the event of any volume surge that might occur throughout the year.
That concludes our presentation.

And in Security, we think relatively modest growth. There will be pressure associated with the commercial construction slowdown and how long that lags on. We think the vast majority of 2010 commercial construction will be relatively slow.
I think obviously our history as a company around share repurchases, we evaluate those on a case by case basis. We will have a fair amount of need for cash associated with the Black & Decker Stanley merger. There’s a lot of one time costs, restructuring and other payments that will need to be made.  There is about $670 million of one time costs. Of that, about $470 million is cash so there will be significant cash obligations in connection with that.
But we’ll have to see as the two companies come together what the projections we have for cash flow are in the first two to three quarters.

We have no idea what their cash flow looks like in the fourth quarter or what it might look like prospectively until we have a much deeper integration process and we close the deal. So it’s really a difficult question to answer without the requisite information.
As far as the gross margin rate goes, we’re pleased with the 40% and excited about the progress. We don’t see anything that suggests that on a standalone basis the gross margin rate would go down any time soon in the company and obviously there will be all sorts of things that we’ll have to deal with along the way such as the CDIY business grows at a faster rate than the Security business.
That’s going to put a little downward pressure on it. We’re pretty confident that we’ll continue to see progress in productivity including the effect of absorption benefits that should accrue as volume begins to come back in general.
So we those two as more or less offsetting and then we’ll continue to work all the levers that I mentioned when I went through the gross margin chart, the price inflation recovery. If you go back to 2004, we’re still almost $90 million short in terms of the recovery of inflation through pricing. So we’re not building any kind of a price umbrella at all, and we’re not over extended in that area.
However, you never know what competitive conditions are and how they’re going to evolve. So we’ll continue to manage that with our pricing center of excellence and all the folks that we have out in the business coordinating very carefully on that one. Then we have our productivity, our mix management, our new product innovation and as I said earlier, getting paid for the value proposition.
So we’d like to see that 40% carry on. We think we can do it and I guess time will tell.

Bostitch which is was a struggling business and facing unprecedented volume declines, many of which were market driven has dramatically improved its margins within CDIY despite the fact that its 20% to 25% less volume.

So it’s not a huge portion of the business but it’s certainly significant and it’s something that can have a bit of a negative impact on us and we would expect a little bit of a negative impact in 2010 from that.
But there are other sectors as I mentioned such as health care, education, and government that are significant in both the Security businesses. In the case of Convergent, health care is almost 23% and then government and education combined is about 14% in Convergent and about the same number in Mechanical.
So there’s some nice verticals in both businesses that have not been as dramatically impacted by the slowing economy nor do we think they’re going to be significantly impacted as we go into 2010. So you have a dynamic that’s happening in our Security segment where they will have a negative drag around commercial construction, but we do think there’s some verticals that can offset that and result in slightly modest growth for the year.

Let me just start by saying this had the potential to be a confusing and very noisy quarterly release, due to the obvious fact that the Black & Decker transaction closed three weeks before the end of the quarter.",2612,"Thanks, Kate and good morning everybody. Let me just start by saying this had the potential to be a confusing and very noisy quarterly release, due to the obvious fact that the Black & Decker transaction closed three weeks before the end of the quarter. 
So I did want tot thank those of the legacy Black & Decker and Stanley finance teams first of all for closing three sets of books at least in a very short period of time and for extraordinary efforts in that regard as well as the finance and IR teams for pulling together what we think is a clear presentation. But as Kate said she will be available as when management is necessary. Later on in the day and later on in the week to clarify anything that’s still outstanding at the end of this call.
So lets get started, diluted EPS was $0.70 and that did include and $0.04 negative impact based on the acquisition, of ADT France which closed on March 9. It excludes one time charges. We did reference the ADT transaction in the press release, so we are not going to spend a lot of time on it this morning other than to say it is strategic and to fit extraordinarily well with its GDP, general protection our French Electronic Security business and as Don will discuss in his guidance, we still believe that this acquisition is going to be meaningfully accretive $0.07, $0.08 in your tree on the expanded share base.
So diluted EPS including the charges of $213 million was a loss of $1.9 and again Don’s going to give you more of a granularity on the charges and their composition in the quarter which we believe to be quite clear.
The gross margin rate excluding charges was 39.4% and excluding Black & Decker with the impact of Black & Decker for the three week stub period the rate improved 120 basis points versus the first quarter 09 to 40.8% and that is a first quarter record for our company. Free cash flow was positive $37 million excluding charges and payments related to the transaction. 
Working capital was encouraging as well, reaching 7.3 turns excluding Black & Decker and 4.6 turns on a pro-forma basis including both companies in those results. CDIY segment, our largest segment profit improves to $83 million and that is up 189% excluding the charges. Industrial saw a nice rebound, profit rate improving 280 basis points to 13.2% again excluding the charges and as I had mentioned earlier ADT France closed on March 9. It’s going to be a great addition and complementary to our existing conversion securities solution platform in Europe.
The integration which I am sure everyone is curious about into how its progressing, we think very well and we are going to talk a little bit more about the synergy target and our estimates and Don is going to give you some detail on our 2010 guidance for the combined company which is now at $3.10 to $3.33 per share excluding the one time charges.
So moving to the first quarter results of the combined company very simple and straight forward a 46% increase excluding the charges as you can see to about $2.70 for one Q 2010 and the charge is related to $213 million or translated to $1.79 a share on the new share base reflecting the timing of the acquisition. So, on a GAAP basis, a loss of $1.9. The only thing that might look a little odd is the minus 1.4% tax rate. 
Just very quickly it’s a one time event the charges had an impact of about 35.2% on the tax rate not all of those charges were tax deductible. There is also an ADT net operating loss impacting about 3.9% and the impact of the tax extender benefit impact which is about 2.6%. That gets you to a normalized rate of 27.3% which is why we have highlighted that and that’s what Don will talk to in the guidance in terms of that should be your expectation going forward.
Looking at margins on the next page we think it’s important to note pretty strong gross margin of 39.4% for the combined company, as noted in the press release on a legacy Stanley basis continued its positive trend about 40.8% on a standalone basis. So we remain encouraged with the margin performance and Jim’s going to talk about some of the drivers of that as he reviews the various segment results.
Operating margin remains fairly constant around 13%. So, we’re in a good place as we begin to go forward and combine these two companies and report to you on a combined basis.
The cost synergy drivers are I think important to everyone. This chart is essentially unchanged from what we have presented on two or three occasions. So I won’t spend a lot of time on it, other than to emphasize a few points.
We continue to feel confident in our $350 million estimate for synergies, but there have been so many questions as well as the cost to achieve it at not exceeding $400 million over the three year timeframe. 
But there have been enough questions on the $350 million but I just wanted to shed a little more light on it. As Don will point out in his guidance we are going to realize about $90 million of that $350 million during calendar 2010. So the majority of the year one achievement that we previously put in our model of course we only have nine months. 
But in the nine months 2010 we’re looking for about $90 million of benefit. But relating to the $350 in total first of all it’s a very big number and as a consequence it’s not easy. And I think its important to point out, if one just does, back of envelope math against the purchased base or the cost base and comes up with a number, it’s really important to note, there’s a couple of very large areas where there is absolutely no overlap at all between the two legacy companies.
I mean one example and a good one is batteries in the purchasing area, our legacy Black & Decker spends about $300 million a year on nickel cadmium and lithium iron batteries Stanley spends essentially nothing, its anecdotal but its just an example of an area where there is no overlap, and on an business basis, the convergent security business is $800 million in revenue with essentially no overlap whatsoever with the legacy Black & Decker business. 
So the base against which to focus on the up further synergies is actually smaller than one might realize at first blush. And the $350 million is a fairly aggressive number.
Second the cost to achieve synergies in excess of $300 million may render the returns for those programs or those investments and those expenses unattractive. So while the number could be driven higher it may not be in the best interest of the company to do it and last but certainly now least as Jim will point out to the extent we achieve additional cost synergies we may well choose to reinvest to those synergies in growth initiatives as we referred to in our press release. 
We intend to grow this combined business as soon as we’ve got our synergy targets fairly embedded in the P&L.
Looking at the status of integration over the first six weeks, we are quite pleased with where we are, let’s hope it’s on some of the major milestones, the first being customers and employees are very-very simply said our primary objective is to protect our core.
We’ve executed on a goal of a smooth close in the first thirty days as a combined company going well. We’ve been proactive and positive with communication with employees and customers, numerous town hall meetings and market visits, Jim myself, Don Allen and the senior management team have spent as much time as ever in our careers in front of our employees and in front of customers. It’s a very important part of the integration and we will continue to do that for the foreseeable future. And importantly let’s avoid pitfalls we have thus far no major pitfalls and no major surprises, now that we are five weeks post close.
Focusing on the cost synergies we have finalized the bottoms up synergy identification process and that will be presented to the executive steering committee in late May. As a reminder Brett Bontrager on the Stanley side who has got a wealth of experience in major integrations for Stanley and Tony Milando who was formerly head of operations for the worldwide power tools and accessories business co-leading this integration process, they are reporting to a steering committee of six people that include Jim Loree, myself, Don Allan, Mark Mathieu, Massimo Grassi in Europe and of course Nolan Archibald from Black & Decker who brings all the experience from that organization to bear on the synergies and the targets and what’s a good business decision and what isn’t. 
That group meets quite regularly, there are 13 sub-teams focused on either businesses or functions. And as those of you who are familiar with our company know it’s a very-very important part of the rhythm and rigor with which we integrate acquisitions and we’re putting the best team we can on the field to ensure that this process continues and that its given the utmost detention from the top of the house right down to the folks executing the programs. Thus far all our findings have supported that $350 million target.
Regarding the execution, we rigorously attract the cost synergy extraction and are quite sure that we are quantifying appropriately and not double counting. We are eagerly and rapidly deploying the Stanley fulfillment system on the Black & Decker base. I am really pleased to say that Black & Decker had a focus on operational excellence, it was their internal terminology, the elements and the fundamentals of SFS are being embraced, I think there is broad scale understanding of the benefits it has had the legacy Stanley over the last three to four years. 
And that it can have on the business with a very similar geographic and customer base. So far so good on that, and last but certainly not least we’ve identified or beginning to identify the revenue synergies and corresponding plans to get them. And I think it will come as no surprise that once the cost synergies are identified and we’re clear that they are on track, it’s more inspirational, it’s more motivating, and it’s more fun to grow the business than to take cost out of it.
So there’s been tremendous support around this initiative. So, so far so good, we are underway. No major pitfall.
Looking very quickly at the geographical breakdown the purpose of this chart is to say that combining these two companies didn’t have a tremendous impact geographically on the companies on a standalone basis. Specifically the large purple section of the pie showing 56%, Legacy Stanley, Legacy Black & Decker were between 55 and 57% of their business in the U.S. prior to the merger. 
The primary difference being Stanley had a slightly larger presence in Europe and Black & Decker had a meaningfully larger presence in Latin America. But when you combine the two companies, you see that the U.S. is about 56% of the revenue, Europe is 25% and then Latin America, Canada, Australia adding to 14 and Asia and the Rest of the World adding to, excuse me, the Rest of the World including the 14 and Asia about 5%.
Looking at our businesses by segment, again I think just two important points to make here on this chart. Even as a combined entity, we remain a diversified global leader and second, it is not a departure or an abandonment of Stanley’s strategy to continue to diversify into higher growth emerging markets and businesses. 
Specifically, if we look at CDIY, which includes the legacy Stanley’s CDIY business, the legacy Black & Decker worldwide power tools and accessory business and the Price Pfister business which historically Black & Decker reported within hardware and home improvement, it makes up 58% of the combined total of the company on a 2009 revenue basis. 
Security which is basically all of Stanley’s Legacy security business, both mechanical and convergent, plus Black & Decker hardware and home improvement less Price Pfister, making up about 25% of the business and industrial which included Stanley’s industrial portfolio and essentially the MR Technologies business making up 17% of the business. 
The chart in the bottom to me at least is very important and it’s very important that everyone understands it. In 2002, the large home centers in mass merchants, 7 customers represented 40% of Legacy’s Stanley’s revenue and the largest customer represented 22%. 
By the end of 2008, as Stanley diversified its portfolio, those numbers became 13 and 6% respectively. Adding Black & Decker, 2009 base on a pro-forma basis moves those numbers back to 31% of the combined companies business as through U.S. home centers and mass merchants and 12% through our largest customer. 
Not a tremendously concentrated business I think by most standards and while, we can say it’s a step back, all it does is put Stanley where it was at about 2006 in its evolution. Its certainly not an abandonment of Stanley’s strategy diversified, its simply a reflection of the math and that Stanley’s been able to merge with a great company and a great set of brands at a very opportunistic time in the cycle. 
Our strategy going forward will remain exactly as it’s been in the past and as we’ve pointed out on many times to continue to grow, to continue to diversify our portfolio and take some of the volatility out of our end results. 
Looking quickly at first quarter revenues, I think the good news is here they are stabilizing versus the dramatic declines of 2009. The chart on the top I think shows that clearly from a holistic point of view but more importantly if we look at the segment results, what we see is the four sequential quarters for both revenues and volumes starting in 2Q 09 going through the first quarter and the first quarter results of course, reflect the addition of 3 weeks of Black & Decker, so the CDIY business and the industrial business are a little bit less representative, Jim’s going to talk about that in just a minute but I think the important point to note is that within security, the rate of decline is slowing down dramatically. 
The mix is strong, customer attention is as good or better than it’s ever been. And it’s obviously a less volatile business than CDIY or industrial, it serves Stanley extraordinarily well on the last couple of years with a less perceptive decline. And as a consequence the recovery, the market based recovery within the security business will be slightly slower. 
But we are highly confident that it’s there and in the mean time a very strong customer attention and a very solid mix in terms of recurring revenue. It’s keeping on the margins of that business and a very-very safe place.
So I am going to turn it over Jim Loree who is going to take you through both per segment results and add a little more clarity on the legacy businesses because we think that will provide some good insight into how the companies performed on the standalone basis right up until the transaction close.

Thank you John, let’s start with construction in DIY, the story here was very positive, twofold, Legacy Stanley drove a 470 basis point improvement in the OM rate on a negative 2% organic volume growth. And Black & Decker performed exceptionally well adding $30.9 million to operating margin and having an accretive impact on the operating margin rate.
So let’s break it down if we move to revenues we came in at 561 in this segment with an 85% increase 82 points of which were associated with BDK, five points currency, thus the minus 2% organic and that was about minus 1% price and about minus 1% unit volume. 
Segment profit was up a 189%. If you take out a substantial contribution $39 million from the acquisition, if the actual rate was 14.2% and still a very impressive performance for the Legacy Stanley business as I said a 470 basis points.
If we get in to the specifics the U.S. revenues and European revenues organically were both slightly negative, the Big-box customers in the U.S. continue to have tight inventory controls. Did not see a lot of rebuilding there, orders were modestly positive and new product development was strong, with the introduction of the Bostich hand tool line and Legacy segment profit improved 54% due to the dramatically lower over head that resulted from the significant cost takeouts over the last five quarters or so.
Working capital was a good story going from about 2.5 turns a year ago to 6.8 turns with a $55 million inventory reduction versus prior year and only a $4 million increase in inventory sequentially versus the fourth quarter.
So I think this is a very strong story here we will get into a little bit more color on the pro-forma Black & Decker performance in a few minutes. But I expect the next chapter for this segment will be operating leverage and as we look forward we are looking for a little more volume growth and as we get into the year so we should see some good operating leverage as we go forward here. So stay tuned for that. 
Now interestingly as we look at security this quarter. One would say it was a challenging quarter, we expected that but ironically if we had this quarter two or three quarter ago we would have thought it was a pretty good quarter. So what’s essentially happened here is security continues to kind of plug along it was really the foundation that helped the company get through some of the difficult construction DIY industrial market conditions and it continues to be very strong and stable. 
Revenues were up 11% all of the growth in the quarter was due to the addition of HHI into the results. Legacy Stanley also benefited from the ADT, France acquisition which contributed three points and currency which contributed 3 points and currency which contributed 3 points especially get to the minus 6% organic growth. 
If you divide that or look at the components of that, both convergent and security of the electronic business and mechanical security, we’re both down roughly 6%. There were different stories, Convergent was relatively simple story, modest volume decline, slight RMR increased couple of points. 
Stable operating margins, pretty much business as usual trying to get through the difficult market conditions but a nice aspect of the quarter for them was that the National account budget seemed to be loosening up a little bit which is good. However the core business which was the foundation of their volume story in the last year or so was week, so you had kind of a change in mix there due to that. 
On the mechanical side, the volume decline was also expected but the operating margin did dip from about 20% in the prior year first quarter to 16%. Again a two-fold story here, absorption issues and the factories clearly contributed to that and then secondly some SG&A investments for growth, primarily for growth in Asia and for feet on the street in U.S. Got ahead of the growth curve which is not unexpected and perfectly fine, so that caused a temporary dip in the operating margin rate and we don’t see that as a continuing issue. 
Now industrial I think was a very positive story. I think its also indicative of the first signs of what a few points of volume can do for operating margin growth in this type of a business what we call operating leverage and also a nice contribution from Black & Decker’s Emhart Technologies business which itself is rebounding in a very big way and again we’ll talk about the Black & Decker activities in just a minute. Revenues were up 22%, 16 points of that was from the MR contribution, 3 points currency, organic growth was positive, 3% and that led to a 54% segment profit increase and without the MR contribution a 25% segment profit increase which is fantastic and that would have been about $30 million of segment profit attributable to the Legacy industrial Stanley business and if you go to the segment profit rate, we increased from 10.4 to 13.2%, 280 basis points and about a 100 of that was associated with the Emhart contribution, so 12.2% operating margins for the core Stanley Legacy business there. 
So pretty much the story on the volume was a rebound in Europe and at Proto with Europe up 6% in volume and Proto up 14%, we all know what’s happening in the industrial markets, it’s a strong story. I think a little bit of that obviously, maybe more than a little bit, was restocking and when we look at the GDP, its not quite up at those levels and then we did have some weakness in our Vidmar storage business and our hydraulics business, both the Vidmar issue being driven by government spending delays and the hydraulics just a cyclical business which is kind of which appears to be at the trough of the cycle right now. 
Now I’m going to change gears here for a moment and we’re going to look at the pro-forma Black & Decker Legacy segment performance. And when we look at this page and I can’t help but think that the timing of this merger was excellent. 
This chart shows the Black & Decker segments a rate on a full quarter over quarter, pro-forma basis. So this is how it would have looked had Black & Decker been a standalone business at this point in time and if we start with PT&A which is power tools and accessories which was a very large part of their business as you can see, they have 6% growth 1% organic growth, North America was the weakest part of the story although the consumer products group was strong. 
Europe had a nice performance with positive 3% organic that was very encouraging. And Latin America was up 11% and Asia up 13% both bright spots. So good story there, hardware and home improvement shown here as HHI was up 12% mostly organic, U.S. Lock Set’s primarily the quick set Kwikset Baldwin business was up 14% and Price Pfister was up 9%.
Nice product introduction, in the mid point price point range in Kwikset, as leading to some outstanding success in the marketplace and also some nice rebound in the markets as well. And if there was any rebound in the market story within Black & Decker’s Legacy businesses it was in the fastening in assembly segment which is also known as Emhart Teknologies and this is a business that sells productivity to industrial customers primarily automotive OEM it’s about two thirds driven by global automotive production and about a third driven by industrial production. 
And the story of course in the quarter was that the at the global vehicle demand was up 42% around the world with North America is up 62%, Europe up 25% and Japan up 53% thus Emhart which has historically been a mid teens operating margin performer, quickly rebounded from a trough last year of 2% to 14% very impressive performance from the folks at Emhart largely market driven but they took out a lot of cost in that business and they have got a cost structure that’s really in a good place.
So truly a terrific performance from our new colleagues from Black & Decker, this morning there were a lot of questions about how could this margin be so rich. And the story is very simple these folks took out about $300 million, slightly more than $300 billion of cost from the last five or six quarters before the merger. And their cost structure is in great shape and a little volume is going to go a long way towards big profit improvements in that part of the business.
Another great story for the quarter in my view was working capital in the legacy Stanley business. You may recall for those of you that have been following the company that Stanley closed out last year at 7.9 turns we typically will have at least a point reduction in the turns as we go in to the end of the first quarter with the seasonal bills and so forth. 
We were able to contain that to a much smaller increase, closed at 7.3 turns and that’s up from 4.8 last year so a real nice performance there you can see good news in all fronts, inventory down 25%, receivables down 14, payables up 10% that’s good. Total 34% reduction from 762 down to 504, but I just want to emphasize that these improvements are process driven by the Stanley fulfillment system.
And we don’t have the time this morning to delve into Stanley fulfillment system in great detail or the folks that aren’t familiar with it. However will note there is a new section in the web-based annual report that we are issuing that we’ll give you a lot of insight into Stanley fulfillment system if you are interested in learning more about it.
But as we move to the next page here we can see that there is one huge opportunity and John alluded to it earlier and that is that rigorous deployment of the Stanley fulfillment system across the newly added Black & Decker entities will provide a huge opportunity for the company. As you can see the combined working capital of the companies although with a nice reduction from last year is right around $1.9 billion and that’s comprised of $0.5 billion of Stanley, Legacy, working capital and $1.4 billion of Black & Decker Legacy working capital. 
Now a little math, if we just annualize the first quarter for illustrative purposes, we would have $8.8 billion of annualized revenues. If we could get to the 7.9 turns that we ended the year at, that would free up $1.1 billion in cash, I mean it would free up $800 million in cash because it would be $1.1 billion. 
So 1.9 minus, 1.1 is 800 million but I will also emphasize that this is, well its an objective, it is also a journey, and not an overnight sensation, as I mentioned, SFS is process driven. It took us 3 years to get from 4.5 turns to 7.9 but we as John mentioned, have begun the journey here and it is a very do-able journey with a very positive outcome and now I will turn it over to Don Allan, our Senior Vice President, CFO to go through some of the financial aspects of the quarter.

First thing I’d like to do is start with our balance sheet on a combined basis. We feel really good about our financial position going into the new company and moving forward. As you can see at the bottom of the page, our debt to capita",2531,"Thank you Jim. First thing I’d like to do is start with our balance sheet on a combined basis. We feel really good about our financial position going into the new company and moving forward. 
As you can see at the bottom of the page, our debt to capital ratio is 35%. We adjusted for the hybrid instruments that we have at 31%, exactly where we were hoping we would be as we put the two companies together, post merger. 
A few other items of note here of significance obviously there are some large dollar variances on the balance sheet by merging the two companies when you compare to the first quarter of last year. 
The largest changes have to do in other assets where the goodwill and the intangibles are recorded at about $5.6 billion as well as the Black & Decker working capital components being added in there about $2.4 billion on the asset side of the balance and then equity, clearly the issuance of the equity associated with the merger of $4.5 billion is increasing our equity and that’s really what’s driving the debt to capital ratio coming down from where we were last year at this point in time. 
So we feel very good starting out our financial position as we move forward. For free cash flow in the first quarter, this chart depicts what free cash flow was excluding one time payments. 
We had approximately $92 million of one time payments related to the merger and if you exclude that effect, the free cash flow was $37 million. Operating cash flow was $59 million which was an improvement of $55 million year-over-year in the first quarter of 2009 and you can see that its driven by a net income increase and John and Jim just walked through some of the details in that area and working capital was significant negative in the first quarter in $90 million which is a normal of trend for both companies, they tend to have a working capital negative in the first quarter as certain inventories get billed going into the second quarter and then just the timing of the sales related to AR as we have a large sales month in March and that could drive our receivables up at the end of the first quarter. 
So pretty much as planned with our working capital in Q1. Touching on the ADT France acquisition on the next page, it’s not a large acquisition but it’s something important that we should talk about briefly. 
It really is a continuation of our strategy within security to expand our footprint internationally. We’ve talked to many of you over the last year or two that’s an important part of our initiative and overall strategies within security and this acquisition really allows us to continue to take that step forward. 
By combining ADT France and GDP together, we’re creating the largest market share company in France by doing that. GDP brings a strong core commercial orientation and then ADT has a very strong national account orientation. So by deploying these two companies together they mix well together from that perspective.
The revenues are expected to be in 2010 to be about $125 to $135 million as I’ll go through in more detail later. Last year’s revenues in 09 were 132 million euro, about $175 million and the RMR component it is about 45%.
As John mentioned earlier the accretion should be about $0.07 to $0.08 by year three as we look to remove about $35 million of cost by pulling the two companies together which would allow the operating margin to be approximately 20%. Once the synergies are completely removed.
We feel we have a really strong and experienced management team in France that can drive this integration, improve their worth in the GDP acquisition that we did a few years ago and integrating them in to our worldwide business. And now then have the ADT France business integrated in to their local operations.
The last thing I will leave you with there is a dilutive impact associated with operating margins related to the acquisition in 2010. It could be as much 150 to 200 basis points in 2010 to the CSS business and to the overall segment about 75 to 100 basis points. But that’s just a one year phenomena as we go in to 2011 and 2012 we would expect the operating margin CSS to get back to 20% bar that we have established. We feel very good about that acquisition as we head in to this year.
The next page is really the way that we begun to summarize some of the trends that we are seeing in our three different segments and then after that I will walk in to the guidance in a little more detail.
We start with the CDIY segment, I want to leave you with two or three thoughts here as we head in to 2010 and beyond. We believe that we are starting to see an improvement in top line in our CDIY segment. And we expect mid single digit growth in revenue and that would be total growth on an organic basis and including currency. It does not include any impact of acquisitions going forward. So this would be on a pro-forma basis.
We also are seeing continued recovering and merging markets around the world. So we expect growth to be stronger in emerging markets in both hand tools as wells as power tools and Bostich around the world. We don’t expect the U.S. and mature markets in Europe as well to grow as significantly, but we do expect some modest growth in those particular markets.
And as always we continue to be very focused on new product development, innovation and making sure that those roll outs help us drive more market share gains as we move forward.
Industrial as Jim mentioned we are beginning to see a little bit effect of re-stocking throughout the supply chain. We start that in the month of March in particular in FACOM and Proto. And we believe these indications allow us to forecast or predict possibility of a high single digit revenue growth in this segment in 2010.
This customer re-stocking is primarily the industrial portion of our businesses the automotive component has not been as strong but we do believe that it’s coming likely in the second quarter.
In the Engineered Fastening business we saw significant increase in light vehicle production in the first quarter we expect that trend to continue compared to the prior year and the second quarter and the third quarter which would drive revenue growth. And then a small acquisition in Engineer Fastening called FIT which really allows us to diversify ourselves stuff little bit away from the automotive manufacturing environment in aerospace it is a strategy that will continue to look as we move forward as a company. 
Security talked a little bit about this already related to ADT, France but the transit I am listening here do not include the effects of ADT, France so revenue, we actually expect to decline slightly in our security business this year. This is late cycle business as many of you know and the economic recovery will come a little bit later as we’re seeing some of the economic recovery in our CDIY business and industrial, we expect securities to see it either later this year or early next year. 
So as a result, we will have a small single digit revenue decline throughout 2010. We are seeing recovery in the core commercial accounts and lagging international account customer base. Installation revenues continue to improve slightly but not significantly. I talked about the integration ADT France acquisition already and you can see the impact financially in 2010, there will be a slight drag in our operating margins as I mentioned. 
A clearly commercial construction continues to be a drag on this segment and it’s an area that we continue to focus on but we are also focusing on other verticals such as education and health care to try to offset the impact of that. While moving to our guidance for 2010 on the next page. Excluding one time charges and cost, we believe the EPS guidance for 2010 is $3.10 and $3.30 and underlining some of the assumptions in that you can see on this page, we start with the first section at the top, the remaining nine months of 2010, so this is just for the upcoming three quarters. 
We believe the net sales will increase 4 to 5% on a pro-forma merge company basis and that excludes the impact on ADT France and that will include the impact of currency which we would expect to be relatively immaterial for the remainder of the year but I’ll talk about that a little bit later as it relates to the Chinese RMB. ADT France will contribute a $125 to $135 million of sales and will be modestly diluted to EPS in 2010. 
We believe our gross margins on a combined basis for the next nine months will range between 37 and 38% and so you see the blending effect of putting the two companies together Stanley and Black & Decker as it mixes our Stanley gross margin rate down from the 41 to 40% category that its been in the last two or three quarters. 
But we also expect to experience some significant commodity inflation for the remainder of the year and if the Chinese RMB does revalue, that could be a significant pressure as well. So we’ve forecasted the potential for a 5% RMB revaluation which equates to approximately $42 million on an annualized basis. 
Exactly the timing of that and when that will happen is difficult to predict but we’ve assumed about 2/3rds of that in our guidance. With that being said with commodity inflation coming and revaluation of Chinese currency, we’re very proactive of looking at how we can pass on some of these increases to our customer base as we’ve done as a company for the last two to four years. 
It continues to be something that we’re focused on and we’ll continue to do that throughout 2010 but there clearly will be a lag in the timing of that as we’re tended to see during its significant inflationary periods. One fact I’ll leave you with related to inflation is that when you look at the steel components that we buy, to compare the average cost in the first quarter to the fourth quarter of last year, the increases have been about 7 to 10%. 
We haven’t experienced that as a company but if you look at what’s happening on the commodity markets, those are the percentage increases that we’re seeing. If you compare the first quarter averages to the third quarter of last year, increase is around 25%. So there’s clearly as inflationary pressures that are coming. 
We need to be proactive about how we pass those increases onto our customers and that’s something that we’re very focused on. Two other items to note related to this nine month period, the tangible amortization of approximately $55 million and as John mentioned, the cost synergy impact in calendar 2010 will be $90 million. That’s about 90% of that $90 million will impact SG&A. 
Looking at the full year, the bottom part of the page, our share count clearly is going to increase as a result of the merger but we also have the previously announced issuance of about six million shares related to our equity unit hybrid instrument that will occur in May of 2010. So the average outstanding share is approximately $150 million. 
The tax rate should be about 26 to 27% as John mentioned earlier, the normalized Q1 tax rate was around 27%. So really, we’ll be consistent with what we experienced in the first quarter. And in the impact of foreign currency, we would expect to be utilized current exchange rates. 
We would expect that to be relatively minimal. Now that excludes the effect of the Chinese RMB. Anything that happens related to that is outside of that secret assumption. And then last, the structuring and related charges is not associated with Black & Decker or ADT, France will be about $30 to $40 million. 
So the free cash flow assumption related to this, when you factor in these particular EPS guidance and excluding the effect of the one time charges and payments will be about $600 million for the merged company in 2010. The next page is a summary of the one time charges that we expect for the full year of 2010. And if you look at our GAAP, EPS forecast for guidance, we believe that we would be anywhere from a loss of $0.41 to a slight gain of $0.05 based on the exact outcome of these charges that was our remainder of the year. 
And they’re really broken down into three different components. The first is just restructuring cost associated with severing employees as well as closing facilities. And the range there is $245 to $295 million, $90 million of which we’ve actually incurred in the first quarter of 2010. 
Then we have one time cost of SG&A and the category that we call other net flow operating margins of a $100 million which relates to certain executive comp charges and investment banking fees and other advisory consulting fees that we’re utilizing for the integration process. A vast majority of that was actually incurred in the first quarter about $81 million. 
So we had $90 million of additional cost for the remainder of the year. And then last, an accounting charge related to inventory where we actually step up the value and purchase accounting. It’s a non-cash charge, will be a $170 million, $42 million of that was the report in first quarter. 
So, on a cash EPS basis excluding these different charges, we believe that the cash EPS will be $4.89 to $5.09. That assumes about $370 million of depreciation and amortization. 
So to summarize this morning’s call, we feel that we’ve been very, we made successful progress in beginning the execution of the integration with Black & Decker. We believe the $350 million cost synergy target is achievable. As I mentioned related to trends we are seeing selected customer re-stocking activity in our industrial channel and signs of a bit of a pick up in the end markets that allows us to feel that a 4 to 5% revenue growth for the remainder of 2010 is reasonable. 
We’re focused on strong new product launches to gain market share and boost that top line growth as much as we can. And as Jim mentioned, the operating leverage is something that we’re very focused on and we saw a bit of demonstration of that in the first quarter in CDIY industrial. 
And then last but certainly not least, SFS we believe will play a very significant role in the successful integration of Black & Decker as well as our objectives around working capital. So with that we conclude the presentation portion of this morning’s call.

So that cost is obviously not all coming back and when the volume comes in, there is some cost add backs and both of the businesses but we’re here to enjoy some operating leverage and make some selective reinvestments in growth as we move forward and we will monitor and allocate those growth reinvestments as we go but the expectation here is that we’ve gone through a lot of pain both organizations over the last couple of years and we expect to enjoy the fruits on a more granular basis when you get into gross margins, both companies have a tried and true productivity regiment, somewhat different, we’re taking the best of the best and putting them together in those cases. 
I think Stanley has probably been a little more Legacy Stanley, has been a little more focused on pricing core competency in the organization and I think we have some opportunities to drive that through the new company and help drive some positive improvement in gross margins in particular in that area but I would also say that I think that inflation is something that we all need to be as Don pointed out, we all need to be cognizant that as this economy heats up, we’re already seeing the early signs of commodity inflation, so there will be some puts and takes here as we go and we’re probably not going to get a 100% price recovery just like we didn’t get a 100% price recovery in legacy Stanley since 04, we got 80%. 
We can get somewhere between 60 and 80% as a combined company, I think we’ll be doing quite well but it’ll be a lag time in that regard and that’s why Don’s guidance may seem a little cautious to some folks, including you Eric based on something I read. I think its probably appropriate, I think the margin rates that we’re at today certainly seems sustainable to us but you know we’re three weeks into our relationship here, so you know time will tell.

Additionally we are starting to see the effects of the leverage from that volume, so you can begin to see the accretive impact of that. And that’s really what’s driving that $0.25 to $0.30 improvement from what we were thinking back in November of last year.

I never heard four questions knocked in so quickly, well we don’t have you on the buzzer but, let me try them all and Jim will jump into help. In terms of restocking and sell through, it’s a little early as you know and everyone on the call knows the home centers close their fiscal books at the end of January which is always a relatively soft month for we as suppliers in terms of volume. 
So when we shift in February and March we do believe its helping with restocking. In terms of POS all I will say is there is nothing out of the ordinary yet. And I don’t want to say any more than that, the simple reason being without inventory there can’t be any sell through and inventories have been so low up until about March that we think POS has been constrained, of our lack of inventory at retail. 
So we’ve seen no dramatic increases, we’ve seen no decreases but the simple answer is it’s one to three months early to make any kind of I would say projection or draw any kind of conclusion based on that.
And I hope that its clear, so modest restocking, constant sell through, we think we are going, it’s going to take a few months of inventories. Being at a more robust level in the stores before we can expect the kind of POS lift that we are hoping to see.
In terms of revenue synergies its early days, we’ve been in I would say file and agreement across the two companies that they are there as I referenced they are more, it’s much more motivating and inspirational to work on revenue synergies. 
But I have to say first and foremost, we need to be sure the cost synergy plans are in place. They are being executed and that’s embedded.
We’ve only recently since we’ve been able to put the two companies together at the very senior levels of management, top 12 people in the combined company established a process for identifying, re-sourcing and managing any potential conflict with revenue synergies relative to cost synergies. 
Because conceivably one could get in the way or the other so there has to be a way to establish the appropriate priorities and to the extent of conflict exists resolve it. As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, there’s actually a formal presentation at the end of May to the steering committee where we think we can, we will be a little bit more granular internally and that something material takes place. 
Obviously, we’ll be public about it otherwise we’ll just talk about the status in out next quarterly review. Lastly in terms of timing for SFS, Jim said it best. It’s an evolution, it’s not a revolution. This is not a silver bullet, its not an overnight phenomenon, it’s a very, very long journey. 
I’d like to think with the very willing audience and or if you will body and that’s the entire Black & Decker operating and management team. They’ve seen the positive impact it’s had for Stanley over the last three years. 
But I'll say our own experience. We started talking about it four years ago. We started really embedding it three years ago and it’s taken while the improvements been gradual, it’s taken three years to really, really, really see the fruit on those trees. 
So I like to think we can do a little quicker because we have some more. As Jim pointed out, we’re applying it across a much, much larger base. So that’s going to have an impact as well but I think it’s going to be 12 to 18 months before its appropriate to see any process driven changes that the result of SFS and I think you can expect steady improvement from there.

So we’re trying to sequence these things in a rational and orderly manner. But there is that huge opportunity out there and I think also the fact that there are fewer skewers in the power tool business than in the hand tool business will help us, the fact that we got the experience, the joint reference will help us expedite. 
But it’s going to be a very large undertaking and it will take at least, somewhere in the range of probably 18 to 24, maybe 36 months to get it done to that level. 
And the last thing I would just comment on the revenue synergies a little bit. I had the opportunity to spend about four weeks visiting far flung regions of the world and meeting the Black & Decker folks and learning about their business in great detail around the world and starting to kind of frame out what the revenue synergy areas might. 
And I think there’s five really significant ones and some more that I don’t know about yet that will kind of be surfaced during our betting process over the next few months. But they have a very strong organization in Latin America. They have production in Brazil which is expandable, they have a distribution center down there which we don’t have and for those of you that are familiar with Brazil, those are both enormously important assets in order to be successful in Brazil which is really on fire from a market growth perspective.
So we will quickly, as quickly as possible take advantage of that opportunity to gain market share with the legacy Stanley business down in Latin America. The business leader down there is terrific. Likewise, in the Middle East and Dubai which covers the entire Middle East and Africa region for Legacy Black & Decker and now Stanley, Black & Decker. Very strong organizations in the Middle East as well and a good infrastructure significantly bigger and better than ours in the Middle East, we will leverage that as quickly as we can and in Asia, I think we find that both companies have fledgling operations there. 
When we put them together, I think we have sufficient scale to have a meaningful growth initiative in Asia and really leverage off each other and our distribution channel access and our talent over there, we were fortunate enough to retain both leaders from Stanley Legacy and Black & Decker legacy Asia and we have them now kind of divided up that territory within both of their regions, so they both are now we have twice the senior talent working in Asia and the emerging markets and then closer to home, I think well really, that staff the channel is something that Stanley has coveted for a long time and aspire to do better in and the Bostich hand tool launch is just an example of something that’s really targeted at the staff channel but when you look at the Black & Decker relationships and the staff channel there are stronger then and their history is more successful in that channel than ours and so we hope to leverage that and then lastly in the industrial channels around the globe, as many of you know, Stanley has transformed its market approach in those channels to really drive a global platform approach across the regions and Black & Decker, well it has this entity called industrial power tools, its really far more construction oriented than some industrial but Stanley has much better channel access into the industrial and automotive repair channels across the world and we expect to leverage that as a revenue synergy as well. 
So I hope that gives you a little color into some of the potential areas that could be very meaningful on a go forward basis.

So even though the kind of boundary you will get to that number. The opportunity for us going forward is clearly continue top line growth and we are seeing the signs of that 2010 if these trends continue then we will have more growth in 11 and 12 but you know working capital is also a significant opportunity for us. And getting to the billion required a modest improvement in the Black & Decker working capital turns of about two turns. And that was really part of that projection that provided back in November.
The other thing to keep in mind is that the performance last year of both companies had had on a combined basis about $450 million of working capital benefit in it and we don’t expect that at this point in time and that will peak 2010 but as we move forward as Jim mentioned there is a big opportunity for $800 million of cash flow from working capital.

Steel is as Don pointed out he, he quantified exactly how much it will be, how much we think it will be, what’s built in to our projections. But RMB is huge obviously with product both from our competitors and ourselves sourced from Asia, 5% RMB inflation, its $42 million on an annualized basis. The simple thing to say is when we see that inflation coming it will take one to three months for it to hit our cost of goods. 
We would be out trying to announce and implement pricing. The second we see it coming, if you assume a six month lag in some customers from the day we announced till the day we get it. We have a three months gap to fill and that’s what, Don’s trying to improve. So simply said we try to be equal to or ahead of the curve, we’ve done a good job, over the last three or four years driven by the central pricing Center of Excellence and people from that organization being embedded within each of the business units.
And that’s were we’ll stay, we’ll try to stay equal to or ahead of the curve and both commodities and RMB inflation are going to be very, very big external factors or market driven factors to look at. Importantly as it relates to the impact of RMB inflation, we are not in this alone, anyone whether its private label of the home centers or a foreign competition in CDIY they are going to be impacted as much or more as we are. 
So while the numbers are big the forces in the marketplace will, our presence that will suggest we won’t be alone in the need to achieve pricing to maintain margin.

I think Black & Decker hardware and home improvement business will be a little bit less seasonal than Stanleys. 
Specifically, ours is driven hard as you know by two things in Legacy Stanley. The tremendous penetration we have on university campuses and mechanical locking and most of that takes place in June and July which spills into the third quarter where we get on to the campuses to change a lot of locks. 
That will be less Black & Decker’s mechanical security business will not be tremendously impacted by that. The second point being our access technologies business which we love tends to have a far greater performance in the second and third quarters than first and fourth and its all weather related. 
We have never had any slide availability issues when we go to install or in some cases, service doors or retro fit doors. That goes away. So what you’ve seen on the Stanley side historically, we would expect again whilst we expect very little of it on the Black & Decker side. 
Their mechanical security business is less university and large retail oriented. So essentially on our combined basis that the percentage increase which we often attribute to 100 to 200 basis, is cut in half just due to the business twice the size.

These are the, this is the most powerful and sought after brand in the professional channel that’s the DeWALT brand of course. And we believe not due to the effect that we’re a larger company, we due to the fact that that we’re a larger company, we do due to the fact that Legacy of Stanley brands and DeWALT brands are the most sought after brands in the industry and we have every hope and expectation to gain share as a result of that as we’re able to put these two companies together and introduce our new products. 
You’ll recall from following Stanley historically new product launches take place in March and October and we start to see the benefits of that in the second obviously and fourth quarters. Every year about $100 million in revenue on the Legacy Stanley CDIY side has been generated from new products, we see no reasons why that shouldn’t continue going forward.

A lot of cross training on product, a lot of the fact that folks know and understand their legacy customers and product lines, that they need to be properly incented to go achieve these synergies without losing focus on the core business and as if you will qualitative or subjective as that all sounds, Jim and I and all the folks at Black & Decker, particularly in the regions, have all had the same experience. 
It takes longer because it is not as easy as it sounds. We will get there with very little capital but its all about protecting the core while we layer this on and get out of them as soon as we can. We’ll have a better flavor for what those are and how quickly we might achieve them as we live together for 3 to 6 months as opposed to 3 to 6 weeks.

It's a great way to become more familiar with the Stanley story. You can access this through our homepage. And as always, please feel free to contact me with any follow-up questions you might have after today's call. 
We will be making some forward-looking statements during this call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risks and uncertainties. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today, and we direct you to the cautionary statements in the Form 8-K, which we filed with today's press release, and in our most recent 34 Act.
With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren."
304977,100726874,58011,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Kate, and good morning, everybody. Let me just start by saying, this had the potential to be a confusing and very noisy quarterly release due to the obvious fact that the Black & Decker transaction closed three weeks before the end of the quarter.",2570,"Thanks, Kate, and good morning, everybody. Let me just start by saying, this had the potential to be a confusing and very noisy quarterly release due to the obvious fact that the Black & Decker transaction closed three weeks before the end of the quarter. So I did want to thank both the legacy Black & Decker and Stanley finance teams.  First of all, for closing three sets of books, at least in a very short period of time. And for extraordinary efforts in that regard, as well as the finance and IR teams for pulling together what we think is a clear presentation. That as Kate said, she will be available, as well as management as necessary later on in the day and later on in the week to clarify anything that's still outstanding at the end of this call.
So let's get started. Diluted EPS was $0.70, and that did include a $0.04 negative impact based on the acquisition of ADT France, which closed on March 9. It excludes one time charges. We did reference the ADT transaction in the press release. So we're not going to spend a lot of time on it this morning other than to say it's strategic and it's going to fit extraordinarily well with GDP, Générale de Protection, our French Electronics Security business. And as Don will discuss in his guidance, we still believe that this acquisition is going to be meaningfully accretive, $0.78 in year three on the expanded share base.
So diluted EPS, including the charges of $213 million, was a loss of $1.09. And again, Don's going to give you more granularity on the charges in their composition in the quarter, which we believe to be quite clear. The gross margin rate, excluding charges, was 39.4%. And excluding Black & Decker, with the impact of Black & Decker for the three-week stub period, the rate improved to 120 basis points versus the first quarter '09 to 40.8%. And that is a first quarter record for our company. Free cash flow was positive, $37 million, excluding charges and payments related to the transaction. Working capital was encouraging as well, reaching 7.3 turns, excluding Black & Decker, and 4.6 turns on a pro forma basis, including both companies in those results.
CDIY segment, our largest segment, profit improved to $83 million and that's up 189%, excluding the charges. Industrial saw a nice rebound. Profit rate improving 280 basis points to 13.2%, again excluding the charges. And as I've mentioned earlier, ADT France closed on March 9. It's going to be a great addition and complementary to our existing Convergent Security Solution platform in Europe. 
The integration, which I'm sure everyone is curious about, into how it's progressing, we think very well. And we're going to talk a little bit more about the synergy target and our estimates. And Don's going to give you some detail on our 2010 guidance for the combined company, which is now at $3.10 to $3.33 per share, excluding the one time charges.
So moving to the first quarter results of the combined company, very simple and straightforward, a 46% increase, excluding the charges. As you can see, to $0.70 from 1Q 2010. And the charges related to $213 million translates to $1.79 a share on the new share base, reflecting the timing of the acquisition. So on a GAAP basis, a loss of $1.09. The only thing that might look a little odd is the minus 1.4% tax rate. Just very quickly, it's a one time event. The charges had an impact of about 35.2% on the tax rate. Not all of those charges were tax deductible. There's also an ADT net operating loss, impacting about 3.9% and the impact of the tax extender benefit impact, which is about 2.6%. That gets you to a normalized rate of 27.3%, which is why we've highlighted that, and that's what Don will talk to in the guidance in terms of that should be your expectation going forward.
Looking at margins on the next page. We think it's important to note pretty strong gross margin of 39.4% for the combined company. As noted in the press release, on the legacy Stanley basis continued its positive trend, about 40.8% on a standalone basis. So we remain encouraged with the margin performance. And Jim's going to talk about some of the drivers of that as he reviews the various segment results. Operating margin remains fairly constant at around 13%. So we're in a good place as we begin to go forward and combine these two companies and report to you on a combined basis.
The cost synergy drivers are I think important to everyone. This chart is essentially unchanged from what we have presented on two or three occasions. So I won't spend a lot of time on it other than to emphasize a few points. We continue to feel confident in our $350 million estimate for synergies. But there have been so many questions, as well as the cost to achieve it at not exceeding $400 million over the three-year timeframe. But there've been enough questions on the $350 million. But I just want to shed a little more light on it. As Don will point out in his guidance, we're going to realize about $90 million of that $350 million during calendar 2010. So the majority of the year one achievement that we previously put in our model, of course, we only have nine months. But in the nine months, 2010, we're looking for about $90 million of benefit. 
But relating to the $350 million in total, first of all, it's a very big number. And as a consequence, it's not easy. And I think it's important to point out, if one just does back-of-envelope math against the purchase base or the cost base, and comes up with a number, it's really important to note that there's a couple of very large areas where there's absolutely no overlap at all between the two legacy companies. One example, and a good one, is batteries in the purchasing area. While legacy Black & Decker spends about $300 million a year on nickel cadmium and lithium-ion batteries, Stanley spends essentially nothing. That's anecdotal but it's just an example of an area where there's a overlap loss. And on a business basis, the Convergent Security business is $800 million in revenue with essentially no overlap whatsoever with the legacy Black & Decker business. So the base against which to focus in the up further synergies is actually smaller than one might realize at first blush. And the $350 million is a fairly aggressive number. 
Second, the cost to achieve synergies in excess of $300 million may render their returns for those programs, for those investments and those expenses unattractive. So while the number could be driven higher, it may not be in the best interest of the company to do it. 
And last, but certainly not least, as Jim will point out, to the extent we achieved additional cost synergies, we may well choose to reinvest those synergies and growth initiatives as we referred to in our press release. We intend to grow this combined business as soon as we've got our synergy targets up fairly embedded in the P&L.
Looking at the status of integration over the first six weeks, we're quite pleased with where we are. Let's focus on some of the major milestones. The first being customers and employees, or very, very simply said, our primary objective is to protect our core. We've executed on a goal of a smooth close and the first 60 days as a combined company is going well. We've been proactive and positive with communication with employees and customers, numerous town hall meetings and market visits. Jim, myself, Don Allan and the senior management team have spent as much time as ever in our careers in front of our employees and in front of customers. It's a very important part of the integration. And we will continue to do that for the foreseeable future. And importantly, let's avoid pitfalls. We have, thus far, no major pitfalls and no major surprises now that we're five weeks post closed. 
Focusing on the cost synergies, we have finalized the bottoms of the synergy identification process, and that will be presented to the executives steering committee in late May. As a reminder, Brett Bontrager on the Stanley side, who's got a wealth of experience in major integrations for Stanley, and Tony Milando, who was formerly head of operations for the Worldwide Power Tools and Accessories business are co-leading this integration process. They are reporting to a steering committee of six people that includes Jim Loree, myself, Don Allan, Mark Mathieu, Massimo Grassi in Europe, and of course Nolan Archibald from Black & Decker who brings all the experience from that organization to bear on the synergies and the targets and what's a good business decision and what isn't. That group meets quite regularly. There are 13 sub-teams focused on either businesses or functions. And as those of you who are familiar with our company know, it's a very, very important part of the rhythm and rigor with which we integrate acquisitions. And we're putting the best team we can on the field to ensure that this process continues and that it's given the utmost attention from the top of the house right down to the focus of executing the programs. Thus far, all our findings has supported that $350 million target. 
Regarding the execution, we rigorously tracked the cost synergy extraction and are quite sure that we're quantifying appropriately and not double counting. We're eagerly and rapidly deploying the Stanley Fulfillment System on the Black & Decker base. I'm really pleased to say that while Black & Decker have had a focused on operational excellence, it was their internal terminology, the elements and the fundamentals SFS are being embraced. I think there's broadscale understanding of the benefits it has had, the legacy Stanley over the last three to four years. And then it can have on a business with a very similar geographic and customer base. So far so good on that.
And last, but certainly not least, we've identified or beginning to identify the revenue synergies and corresponding plans to get them. And I think it will come as no surprise that once the cost synergies are identified, and we're clear that they're on track, it's more inspirational, it's more motivating, it is more fun to grow the business than to take costs out of it. So there's been tremendous support around this initiative. So, so far, so good. We're underway, no major pitfalls.
Looking very quickly at the geographical breakdown, the purpose of this chart is to say that combining these two companies didn't have a tremendous impact geographically on the companies on a standalone basis, specifically the large purple section of the pie showing 56%. Legacy Stanley, legacy Black & Decker were between 55% and 57% of their business in the U.S. prior to the merger. The primary difference being Stanley had a slightly larger presence in Europe and Black & Decker had a meaningfully larger presence in Latin America. So when you combine the two companies, you see that the U.S. is about 56% of the revenue, Europe is 25%, and then Latin America, Canada, Australia adding to 14%, and the rest of the world included in the 14% and Asia about 5%.
Looking at our businesses by segment, again I think just two important points to make here on this chart. Even as a combined entity, we remain a diversified global leader. And second, it is not a departure or an abandonment of Stanley's strategy to continue to diversify into higher growth, emerging markets and businesses. 
Specifically, if we look at CDIY, which includes the legacy Stanley CDIY business, the legacy Black & Decker Worldwide Power Tools and Accessories business and the Price Pfister business, which historically Black & Decker reported within Hardware and Home Improvement, it makes up 58% of the combined total of the company on a 2009 revenue basis. 
Security, which is basically all of Stanley's legacy Security business, both mechanical and convergent, plus Black & Decker Hardware and Home Improvement, less Price Pfister, making up about 25% of the business. And industrial, which included Stanley's industrial portfolio and essentially the Emhart Teknologies business, making up 17% of the business. 
The chart in the bottom, to me at least, is very important, and it's very important that everyone understands it. In 2002, the large home centers and mass merchants, seven customers represented 40% of legacy Stanley's revenue, and the largest customer represented 22%. By the end of 2008, as Stanley diversified its portfolio, those numbers became 13% and 6%, respectively. Adding Black & Decker, 2009 base on a pro forma basis moves those numbers back to 31% of the combined companies businesses through U.S. home centers and mass merchants, and 12% through our largest customer. Not a tremendously concentrated business I think by most standards. And while we can say it's a step back, all it does is put Stanley where it was at about 2006 in its evolution. It's certainly not an abandonment of Stanley's strategy to diversify, it's simply a reflection of the math. And Stanley's being able to merge with a great company and a great set of brands at a very opportunistic time in the cycle. Our strategy going forward will remain exactly as it's been in the past. And as we've pointed out on many times, to continue to grow, to continue to diversify our portfolio and take some of the volatility out of our end results.
Looking quickly at first quarter revenues, I think the good news is, here they are stabilizing versus the dramatic declines of 2009. The chart on the top I think shows that clearly from a holistic point of view. But more importantly, if we look at the segment results, what we see is the four sequential quarters for both revenue and volumes, starting in 2Q '09 going through the first quarter. And the first quarter results, of course, reflect the addition of three weeks of Black & Decker. So the CDIY business and the Industrial business are a little bit less representative. Jim's going to talk about that in just a minute. But I think the important point to note is within security, the rate of decline is slowing down dramatically. The mix is strong, customer attention is as good or better than it's ever been, it's obviously a less volatile business than CDIY or Industrial. It serves Stanley extraordinarily well on the last couple of years with a less precipitous decline. And as a consequence, the market based recovery within the Security business will be slightly slower. But we're highly confident that it's there. And in the meantime, a very strong customer retention and a very solid mix in terms of recurring revenue is keeping the margins of that business in a very, very safe place. 
So I'm going to turn it over to Jim Loree who's going to take you through both the segment results and add a little more clarity on the Legacy business, because we think that will provide some good insight into how the Company performed on standalone basis right up until the transaction closed."
304977,100726874,58011,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John. Let's start with Construction and DIY. The hear was very positive, twofold. Legacy Stanley drove 470 basis point improvement in the OM rate, negative 2% organic volume growth. And Black & Decker performed exceptionally well, adding $39 mi",1895,"Thank you, John. Let's start with Construction and DIY. The hear was very positive, twofold. Legacy Stanley drove 470 basis point improvement in the OM rate, negative 2% organic volume growth. And Black & Decker performed exceptionally well, adding $39 million to operating margin and having an accretive impact on the operating margin rate. 
So let's break it down. If we move to revenues, we came in at 561 in this segment with an 85% increase, 82 points of which were associated with BDK, five points currency, plus/minus 2% organic. And that was about minus 1% price and about minus 1% unit volume.
Segment profit was up 189%. If you take out a substantial contribution, $39 million from the acquisition, the actual rate was 14.2% and still a very impressive performance for the legacy Stanley business. As I said, up 470 basis points. If we get into the specifics, the U.S. revenues and European revenues, organically, were both slightly negative. The big-box customers in the U.S. continue to have tight inventory controls. Did not see a lot of rebuilding there. Orders were modestly positive and new product development was strong, with the introduction of the Bostitch Hand Tool line. And legacy segment profit improved 54% due to the dramatically lower overhead that resulted from the significant cost takeouts over the last five quarters or so. Working capital was a good story going from about 2.5 turns a year ago to 6.8 turns with a $55 million inventory reduction versus prior year, and only $4 million increase in inventories sequentially versus the fourth quarter.
So I think this is a very strong story here. We'll get into a little bit more color on the pro forma Black & Decker performance in a few minutes. But I expect the next chapter for this segment will be operating leverage. And as we look forward, we're looking for a little more volume growth and as we get into the year. So we should see some good operating leverage as we go forward here, so stay tuned for that. 
Now interestingly, as we look security this quarter, one would say it was a challenging quarter. We expected that. But ironically, if we've had this quarter two or three quarters ago, we would have thought it was a pretty good quarter. So what's essentially happened here is security continues to kind of plug along. It was really the foundation that helped the company get through some of the difficult Construction DIY and industrial market conditions. And it continues to be very strong and stable.  Revenues were up 11%. All of the growth in the quarter was due to the addition of HHI into the results. Legacy Stanley also benefited from the ADT France acquisition, which contributed three points in currency, which contributed three points, plus you get to the minus 6% organic growth. If you divide that or look at the components of that, both convergent security, the Electronic business and mechanical security, were both down roughly 6%. They were different stories, though. The convergent was relatively a simple story, modest volume decline, RMR increased a couple of points, stable operating margin. Pretty much business as usual, trying to get through the difficult market conditions. The nice aspect of the quarter for them was that the national account budget seemed to be loosing up a little bit, which is good. However, the Core business, which was the foundation of their volume story in the last year or so was weak. So you had kind of a change in mix there due to that. 
On the mechanical side, the volume decline was also expected. But the operating margin did dip from about 20% in the prior year first quarter to 16%. Again, a twofold story here. Absorption issues in the factories clearly contributed to that. And then secondly, some SG&A investments for growth, primarily for growth in Asia and for Feet on the Street in the U.S. got ahead of the growth curve, which is not unexpected and perfectly fine. So that cost the temporary dip in the operating margin rate, and we don't see that as a continuing issue.
Now Industrial, I think, was a very positive story. I think it's also indicative of the first signs of what a few points of volume can do for operating margin growth in this type of a business, what we call operating leverage. And also a nice contribution from Black & Decker's Emhart Teknologies business, which itself is rebounding in a very big way. And again, we'll talk more about the Black & Decker activities in just a minute.
Revenues were up 22%, 16 points of that was from the MR contribution, three points currency. Organic growth was positive 3%. And that led to a 54% segment profit increase. And without the Emhart contribution, a 25% segment profit increase, which is fantastic and that would have been about $30 million of segment profit attributable to the legacy, Industrial Stanley business. And if you go to the segment profit rate, we increased from 10.4% to 13.2%, 280 basis points. And about 100 of that was associated with the Emhart contribution. So 12.2% operating margin for the core Stanley legacy business there. 
So pretty much the story on the volume was a rebound in Europe and at Proto, with Europe up 6% and volume in Proto up 14%. We all know what's happening in the industrial markets. It's a strong story. I think a little bit of that, obviously, maybe more than a little bit was restocking.  And when we look at the GDP, it's not quite up at those levels. And then we did have some weakness in our Vidmar Storage business and our Hydraulics business. Both the Vidmar issue being driven by government spending delays and the Hydraulics just a cyclical business, which is kind of appears to be at the trough of the cycle right now.
Now I'm going to change gears here for a moment, and we're going to look at the pro forma Black & Decker legacy segment performance. And when I look at his page, and I can't help but think that the timing of this merger was excellent. This chart shows the Black & Decker segment's rate on a full quarter-over-quarter pro forma basis. So this is how it would have looked had Black & Decker been a standalone business at this point in time. 
And If we start with PT&A, which is Power Tools and Accessories, which is a very large part of their business, as you can see, they had 6% growth, 1% organic growth. North American was the weakest part of the story, although the Consumer Products Group was strong. Europe had a nice performance with positive 3% organic, that was very encouraging. And Latin America was up 11%, and Asia up 13% both bright spots. So good story there. 
Hardware and Home Improvement shown here as HHI was up 12%, mostly organic. U.S. locksets, primarily the Kwikset and Baldwin business was up 14% and Price Pfister was up 9%. Nice product introduction at midpoint price point range in Kwikset, is leading to some outstanding success in the marketplace, and also some nice rebound in the markets as well.  And if there was any rebound in the market story within Black & Decker's legacy businesses, it was in the Fastening and Assembly segment, which was also known as Emhart Teknologies. And this is a business that sells productivity to industrial customers, primarily Automotive OEMs, it's about 2/3 driven by global automotive production and about 1/3 driven by industrial production. And the story, of course, in the quarter was that the global vehicle demand was up 42% around the world with North America up 62%, Europe up 25%, and Japan up 53%. Thus Emhart, which has historically been a mid-teens operating margin performer, quickly rebounded from a trough last year of 2% to 14%. Very impressive performance from folks at Emhart. Largely, market driven, but they took a lot of cost in that business and they got a cost structure that's really in a good place. 
So truly a terrific performance from our new colleagues from Black & Decker. This morning, there were a lot of questions about how could these margins to be so rich. And these stories is very simple, these folks took about $300 million slightly more than $300 million of costs over the last five, six quarters before the merger. And their cost structure is in great shape and a little volume is going to go along ways towards big profit improvements in that part of the business.
Now another great story for the quarter, in my view, is working capital in the legacy Stanley business. You may recall from those of you that have been following the company that Stanley closed out last year at 7.9 turns. We typically will have at least a point reduction in the turns as we go into the end of the first quarter with the seasonal build and so forth. We were able to contain that to a much smaller increase. So we don't close at 7.3 turns. And that's up from 4.8 last year. So a real nice performance. There you can see good news in all fronts. Inventory down 25%, receivables down 14%, payables up 10%, that's good. Total of 34% reduction from 762 down to 504. And I just want to emphasize that these improvements are process-driven by the Stanley Fulfillment System. And we don't have the time this morning to delve into Stanley Fulfillment System in great detail for the folks that aren't familiar with it. However, we'll note, there's a new section in a web-based annual report that we're issuing that will give you a lot of insight into Stanley Fulfillment System if you're interested in learning more about it. 
But as we move to the next page here, we can see that there's one huge opportunity, and John alluded to it earlier, and that is that rigorous deployment of the Stanley Fulfillment System across the newly added Black & Decker entities will provide a huge opportunity for the company. As you can see, the combined working capital of the companies, although it was nice reduction from last year, is right around $1.9 billion. And that's comprised of $500 million of Stanley, legacy, working capital and $1.4 billion of Black & Decker legacy working capital.
Now a little math. If we just annualize the first quarter for illustrative purposes, we would have $8.8 billion of annualized revenues. If we could get to the 7.9 turns that we ended the year at, that would free up $1.1 billion in cash. It would free up $800 million in cash because it would be $1.1 billion. So $1.9 million minus $1.1 million is $800 million. But I also will emphasize that this is, while it's an objective, it is also a journey and not an overnight sensation. As I mentioned, SFS is process-driven. It took us three years to get from 4.5 turns to 7.9. But we, as John mentioned, have begun the journey here, it is a very doable journey with a very positive outcome. 
And now I will turn it over to Don Allan, our Senior Vice President and CFO to go through some of the financial aspects of the quarter."
304977,100726874,58011,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. First thing I'd like to do is start with our balance sheet on a combined basis. We feel really good about our financial position going into the new company and moving forward. As you can see at the bottom of the page, our debt to capital r",2532,"Thank you, Jim. First thing I'd like to do is start with our balance sheet on a combined basis. We feel really good about our financial position going into the new company and moving forward. As you can see at the bottom of the page, our debt to capital ratio is 35%. We adjusted for the hybrid instruments that we have, it's at 31%, exactly where we were hoping it would be as we put the two companies together post-merger. 
A few other items to note here that's significant, obviously, there's some large dollar variance on the balance sheet by merging the two companies, when you compare it to the first quarter of last year. The largest changes have to do in other assets where the goodwill and the intangibles are recorded of about $5.6 billion, as well as the Black & Decker working capital components being added in there of about $2.4 billion on the asset side of the balance. 
And then equity, clearly the issuance of the equity associated with the merger of about $4.5 billion is increasing our equity. And that's really what's driving the debt to capital ratio coming down from where we were last year at this point in time. So we feel very good starting out, financial position, as we move forward. 
For free cash flow in the first quarter, this chart depicts what free cash flow was excluding one time payments. And we had approximately $92 million of one time payments related to the merger. And if you exclude that effect, the free cash flow was $37 million. Operating cash flow of $59 million, which was an improvement of $55 million year-over-year in the first quarter of 2009. And you can see it's driven by net income increase. And John and Jim just walked you through some details in the area. And then working capital was a significant negative in the first quarter of $90 million, which is a normal trend for both companies. They tend to have working a capital negative in the first quarter as certain inventories get billed going into the second quarter. And then just the timing of the sales related to AR, as we have a large sales month in March and that can drive our receivables up at the end of the first quarter. So pretty much as planned was our working capital in Q1.
Touching on the ADT France acquisition on the next page. It's not a large acquisition, but it's something important that we should talk about briefly. It really is a continuation of our strategy within Security to expand our footprint internationally. We've talked to many of you over the last year too, that's an important part of our initiative and overall strategy within Security. This acquisition really allows us to continue to take that step forward. By combining ADT France and GDP together, we're creating the largest market share company in France, by doing that. GDP brings a strong core commercial orientation and then ADT has a very strong national account orientation. So by pulling these two companies together, they mix well together from that perspective. 
The revenues are expected to be, in 2010, to be about $125 million to $135 million, as I'll go through in more detail later. Last year's revenues, in '09, were $132 million euro, about $175 million. And the RMR component is about 45%. As John mentioned earlier, the accretion should be about $0.07 to $0.08 by year three as we look to remove about $35 million of costs by pulling the two companies together, which would allow the operating margin to be approximately 20%, once the synergies are completely removed. 
We feel we have a really strong and experienced management team in France that can drive this integration. They proved their worth in the GDP acquisition that we did a few years ago and integrating them into our Worldwide business. And now they have the ADT France business integrated into their local operations. 
The last thing I'll leave you with, there is a dilutive impact associated with operating margins related to this acquisition in 2010. It could be as much as 150  to 200 basis points in 2010 to the CSS business, and to the overall segment about 75 to 100 basis points. But that's just a one year phenomena. As we go into 2011 and 2012, we would expect the operating margins in CSS to get back to that 20% bar that we've established. So we feel very good about that acquisition as we head into this year.
The next page is really the way that we've begun to summarize some of the trends that we're seeing in our three different segments. And after that, I'll walk into the guidance with a little more detail. 
We me start with the CDIY segment. I want to leave you with two or three thoughts here. As we head into 2010 and beyond, we believe that we're starting to see an improvement in the top line in our CDIY segment. And we expect mid single-digit growth in revenue. And that would be total growth on an organic basis and including currency. It does not include any impact of acquisitions going forward. So this will be in a pro forma basis. We also are seeing continued recovery in merging markets around the world. So we expect growth to be stronger in the merging markets in both Hand Tools, as well as Power Tools and Bostitch around the world. We don't expect the U.S., and mature markets in Europe as well, to grow as significantly. But we do expect some modest growth in those particular markets. And as always, we continue to be very focused on new product development, innovation and making sure that those rollouts help us drive more market share gains as we move forward.
Industrial, as Jim mentioned, we are beginning to see a little bit of an effect in restocking and throughout the supply chain. We saw that in the month of March, in particular, in FACOM [Franco Américaine de Construction d'Outillage Mécanique] and Proto. And we believe these indications will allow us to forecast or predict the possibility of a high single-digit revenue growth in this segment in 2010. This customer restocking is primarily in the industrial portion of our businesses. The automotive component has not been as strong, but we do believe that it's coming likely in the second quarter.
In the Engineering Fastening business, we saw significant increase in light vehicle production. In the first quarter, we expect that trend to continue compared to the prior year and the second quarter and the third quarter, which will drive revenue growth. And then a small acquisition in Engineered Fastening called, FIT [Fastener Innovation Technology, Inc.], which really allows us to diversify ourselves little bit away from the automotive manufacturing environment. In aerospace, it's a strategy that we'll continue to look at as we move forward as a company.
Security. Talked a little bit about this already, our ADT France. But the trends that I'm listing here do not include the effects of ADT France. So revenue, we actually expect to decline slightly as a Security business this year. This is a late cycle business as many of you know and the economic recovery will come a little bit later. As we're seeing some of that economic recovery in our CDIY business and Industrial, we expect Security to see if either later this year or early next year. So as a result, we will have a small single-digit revenue decline throughout 2010.
We are seeing recovery within the core commercial accounts and lagging in our national account customer base. Installation revenues continue to improve slightly, but not significantly. I talked about the integration of the ADT France acquisition already, and you can see the impact financially in 2010. There was a slight drag in our operating margins as I mentioned. Clearly, commercial construction continues to be a drag on the segment and it's an area that we continue to focus on. We also are focusing on other verticals such as education and healthcare to try to offset the impact of that.
So moving to our guidance for 2010 on the next page. Excluding one-time charges and costs, we believe the EPS guidance for 2010 is $3.10 to $3.30. And underlying some of the assumptions in that, you can see on this page, we start with the first section at the top. For the remainder nine months of 2010, so this is just for the upcoming three quarters. We believe that net sales will increase 4% to 5% on a pro forma merged company basis and that excludes the impact of ADT France. And that will include the impact of currency, which we would expect to be relatively immaterial for the remainder of the year. But I'll talk about that a little bit later as it relates to the Chinese RMB. ADT France will contribute $125 million to $135 million of sales and will be modestly dilutive to EPS in 2010.
We believe our gross margins on a combined basis for the next nine months will range between 37% and 38%. And so you see the blending effect of putting the two companies together Stanley and Black & Decker as it mixes the Stanley gross margin rate down from the 41% to 40% category that it's been in the last two or three quarters. But we also expect to experience some significant commodity inflation through the remainder of the year. It is the Chinese RMB does revalue, that could be a pressures as well. So we didn't forecast that the potential for a 5% RMB revaluations, which equates to approximately $42 million on an annualized basis. Exactly the timing of that and when that will happen is difficult to predict. But we've assumed about 2/3 of that in our guidance. 
That being said, with commodity inflation coming and revaluation of currency, the Chinese currency, we're very proactive in looking at how we can pass us on some of these increases to our customer base, as we've done as a company for the last two to four years. It continues to be some significant that we're focused on, and we'll continue to do that throughout 2010. But clearly, it will be a lag in the timing of that as we intended to see during the significant inflationary periods. 
One fact I leave you with related to inflation is that when you look at the steel components that we buy, if you compare the average cost in the first quarter to the fourth quarter of last year, the increases have been about 7% to 10%. We haven't experienced that as a company but if you look at what's happening on the commodity markets those are the percentage increases that we're seeing. If you compare the first quarter averages to the third quarter of last year, the increases are around 25%. So there clearly is inflationary pressures that are coming in. We need to be proactive about how we pass those increases out on our customers and that's something we're very focused on. 
Two other items to note related to this time of period intangible amortization of approximately $55 million. And as John mentioned, the cost synergy impact in calendar 2010 will be $90 million. That's about 90% of that $90 million that impact SG&A.
Looking at the full year, the bottom part of the page, our share count clearly is going to increase as the result of the merger, but we also have the previously announced issuance of about 6 million shares related to our equity unit hybrid instrument, that will occur in May of 2010. So the average outstanding shares will approximate $150 million. 
The tax rate should be about 26% to 27%. As John mentioned earlier, the normalized Q1 tax rate was around 27%, so really we'll be consistent with what we experience in the first quarter. And in the impact to foreign currency, we would expect to be utilized currency exchange rates, we would expect that to be relatively minimal. Now that exclude the effect of the Chinese RMB. Anything that happens related to that is outside of that particular assumption. And then last, the restructuring and related charges not associated with Black & Decker or ADT France will be up $30 million to $40 million.
So the free cash flow assumption related to this when you factor in this particular EPS guidance and excluding the effect of the one-time charges and payments, will be about $600 million for the merge company of 2010. 
The next page is a summary of the one-time charges that we expect for the full year of 2010. And if you look at our GAAP EPS forecast or guidance, we believe that we would be anywhere from a loss of $0.41 to a slight gain of $0.05 based on the exact outcome of these charges over the remainder of the year. 
And it really broken into three different components. The first is this restructuring costs associated with severing employees as well as closing facilities, and the range there is $245 million to $295 million, $90 million of which we've actually incurred in the first quarter of 2010. Then we have one-time costs in SG&A and the category that we call other net below operating margin of $100 million, which relates to certain executive comp charges, investment banking fees and other advisory consulting fees that we're utilizing for the innovation process. The vast majority of that was actually incurred in the first quarter about $81 million. So we have $90 million of additional costs for the remainder of the year. And then last, an accounting charge related to inventory where we actually step up the value and purchase accounting. It's a non-cash charge will be $170 million, $42 million of that was recorded in the first quarter.
So at a cash EPS basis, excluding these different charges, we believe that the cash EPS will be $4.89 to $5.09, and that assumes about $370 million of depreciation and amortization. 
So to summarize this morning's call, we feel we've made successful progress in beginning the execution and the integration with Black & Decker. We believe the $350 million cost synergy target is achievable. As I mentioned, related to trends we're seeing selected customer restocking activity in our industrial channel and signs of a bit of a pickup in. And the end market still allow us to fell that a 4% to 5% revenue growth through the remainder of 2010 is reasonable. We're focused on strong new product launches to gain market share and boost that top line growth as much as we can. And as Jim mentioned, the operating leverage is something that we're very focused on, and we saw a bit of demonstration of that in the first quarter in CDIY industrial. And then last, but certainly not least, SFS we believe will play a significant role in the successful integration of Black & Decker, as well as our objectives around working capital. 
So with that, that concludes the presentation portion of this morning's call."

So that cost is obviously not all coming back. And when the volume comes in, there is some cost add-backs in both of the businesses. But we're here to enjoy some operating leverage and make some selective reinvestments in growth as we move forward. And we'll kind of monitor and allocate those growth reinvestments as we go. But the expectation here is that we've gone through a lot of pain over the last -- both organizations over the last couple of years and we expect to enjoy the fruits. On a more granular basis, when you get into gross margins, both companies have a tried-and-true productivity regimen, somewhat different. We're taking the best-of-the-best and putting them together in those cases. I think, Stanley, has probably been a little bit more -- Legacy Stanley, has a little bit better focused on pricing core competency in the organization. And I think we have some opportunities to drive that through the new company and help drive some positive improvement in gross margins, in particular, in that area. But I will also say that I think that inflation is something that we all need to be, as Don pointed out, we only need to be cognizant as this economy heats up, we're already seeing the early signs of commodity inflation. So there will be some puts and takes here as we go. We'll probably not going to get 100% price recovery, just like we didn't get 100% price recovery in Legacy Stanley since '04, we got 80%. We can get somewhere between 60% and 80% as a combined company and I think we'll be doing quite well. There will be a lag time in that regard. And that's why while Don's guidance may seem a little cautious to some folks, I think including New York [ph] (59:49) based on something I read, I think it's probably appropriate. I think the margin rates that we're at today, certainly seems sustainable to us. But we're three weeks into our relationship here, so time will tell."

In terms of restocking and sell-through, it's a little early. As you know and everyone on the call knows, the home centers closed their fiscal books at the end of January, which is always a relatively soft month for we as suppliers in terms of volume. So what we've shipped in February and March, we do believe it's helping with restocking. In terms of POS, all I'll say is, there's nothing out of the ordinary yet. And I don't want to say any more than that. The simple reason being without inventory, there can't be any sell-through. And inventories have been so low up until about March, that we think POS has been constrained by lack of inventory at retail. So we've seen no dramatic increases. We've seen no decreases. But the simple answer is it's one to three months early to make any kind of I'd say, projection or draw any kind of conclusions based on that, and I hope that's clear. So modest restocking, constant sell-through, but we think it's going to take a few months of inventories being at a more robust level in the stores before we can expect the kind of POS lift that we're hoping to see. In terms of revenue synergies, it's early days. We've been in I'd say file an agreement across the two companies that they are there. As I referenced, they're more -- it's much more motivating and inspirational, the work on revenue synergies. But I have to say, first and foremost, we need to be sure the cost synergy plans are in place. They're being executed and that's embedded. We've only reasonably, since we've been able to put the two companies together at the very senior levels of management, top 12 people in the combined company establish a process for identifying, resourcing and managing any potential conflict with revenue synergies relative to cost synergies. Because conceivably, one could get in the way of the other, so there has to be a way to establish the appropriate priorities and to the extent that conflict exists, resolve it. As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, there's actually a formal presentation at the end of May to the Steering Committee, where we think we will be a little more granular internally. That if something material takes place, obviously, we'll be public about it, otherwise, we'll just talk about the status in our next quarterly review. Lastly, in terms of timing for SFS, Jim said it best, it's an evolution, it's not a revolution. This is not a silver bullet, it's not an overnight phenomenon, it's a very, very long journey. I'd like to think with a very willing audience, or if you will, body and that's the entire Black & Decker operating and management team, they've seen the positive impact in Stanley over the last year. But I'll say our own experience, we started talking about it four years ago, we started really embedding it three years ago. And it's taken, while the improvement has been gradual, it's taken four years to really, really see the fruit on those trees. So I'd like to think we can do it a little quicker because we have some more experience. As Jim pointed out, we're playing at across a much, much larger base. So that's going to have an impact as well. But I think it's going to be 12 to 18 months before it's appropriate to see any process-driven changes as the result of SFS. And I think you can expect a steady improvement from there."

And hence, we're putting up the revenue synergy, deep dive kind of planning process a couple of months. And SFS may take a little bit longer to implement across the platform because we can't do everything at once. So we're trying to sequence these things in a rational and orderly manner. But there is that huge opportunity out there. And I think also the fact that there are fewer SKUs in the Power Tools business than in the Hand Tool business will help us. The fact that we've got the experience that John referenced will help us expedite. But it's going to be a very large undertaking. And it will take at least somewhere in the range of probably 18 to 24, maybe 36 months to get it done to that level. And then last thing, I would just comment on the revenue and synergies a little bit. I had the opportunity to spend about four weeks visiting far-flung regions of the world and meeting the Black & Decker folks and learning about their business in great detail around the world and starting to kind of frame out what the revenue synergy areas might be. And I think there's five really significant ones and maybe some more that I don't know about yet that will kind of desurface during our bidding process during the next few months. But they have a very strong organization in Latin America. They have production in Brazil, which is expendable. They have a distribution center down there, which we don't have. And for those of you that are familiar with Brazil, those are both enormously important assets in order to be successful in Brazil, which is really on fire from a market growth perspective. So we will quickly, as quickly as possible, take advantage of that opportunity to gain market share with the Legacy Stanley businesses. They're in Latin America, the business leader down there is terrific. Likewise in the Middle East, in Dubai, which covers the entire Middle East and Africa region for the Legacy Black & Decker, and now Stanley Black & Decker. Very strong organization in the Middle East as well, and a good infrastructure, significantly better and bigger than ours in the Middle East. We will leverage that as quickly as we can. And in Asia, I think we find that both companies have fledgling operations there. When we put them together, I think we have sufficient scale to have a meaningful growth initiative in Asia, and really leverage off each other and our distribution channel access and our talent over there. We were fortunate enough to retain both leaders from Stanley Legacy and Black & Decker Legacy Asia, and we have them now kind of divided up that territory within both of their regions. So they both are now -- we have twice the senior talent working on Asia and the emerging markets. And then closer to home, I think well really the staff to channel is something that Stanley has coveted for a long time, and inspired to do better in the Bostitch hand tool launches is just an example of something that's really targeted of this staff to channel. But when you look at the Black & Decker relationships and the staff to channel there, stronger and their history is more successful in that channel than ours. And so we hope to leverage that. And then lastly on the industrial channels around the globe, as many of you know, Stanley has transformed its market approach in those channels to really drive a global platform approach across the regions. And Black & Decker, while it has this entity called Industrial Power Tools, it's really far more construction oriented than industrial. It has some industrial. But Stanley has much better channel access into the industrial and automotive repair channels across the world, and we expect to leverage that as a revenue synergy as well. So I hope that gives you a little color into some of the potential areas that could be very meaningful on a go-forward basis."

Steel is, as Don pointed out, he'll quantify exactly how much it will be, how much we think it will be, what's build into our projections. The RMB is huge, obviously, with products both from our competitors and ourselves, sourced from Asia. 5% RMB inflation is $42 million on an annualized basis. The simple thing to say is when we see that inflation coming, it will take 1 to 3 months afraid to get our cost of goods. We would be out trying to announce and implement pricing, the second we see it coming. If you assume a six-month lag in some customers from the day we announce until the day we get it, we have a three-month GAAP to fill, and that's what I'm trying to improve. So simply said, we're trying to be equal to or ahead of the curve. We've done a good job with that over the last three or four years, driven by the Central pricing Center of Excellence and people from that organization, being embedded within the age of the business units. And that's where we'll stay. We'll try to stay equal to or ahead of the curve. And both commodities and revenue inflation are going to be very, very big external factors or market-driven factors to look at. importantly, as it relates to the impact of RMB inflation, we're not in this alone. Anyone, whether it's private label or home centers or foreign competition in CDIY, they're going to be impacted as much or more as we are. So while the numbers are big, the forces in the marketplace are present that we'll suggest we won't be alone in the need to achieve pricing to maintain margin."

I think Black & Decker's Hardware and Home Improvement business will be a little bit seasonal than Stanley's, specifically, ours is driven, as you know, by two things in legacy Stanley. The tremendous penetration we have on university campuses and mechanical locking, and most of that takes place in June and July, which goes into the second quarter where we get into the campuses to change a lot of locks. That will be less -- Black & Decker's Mechanical Security business, will not be significant impacted by that. The second point being is our access technology business, which we launched tends to have a far greater performance in the second and third quarters than first and fourth. And it's all weather-related. We had never have any slight availability issues when we go to install or in some cases service doors or retrofit doors that goes away. So what you've seen on the Stanley side historically, we would expect again. We expect very little of it on the Black & Decker side and their Mechanical Security businesses is less university and large retailer oriented. So essentially, on a combined basis, the percentage increase, which we often attribute to 100 to 200 basis points is cut in half due to the business is twice the size."

Importantly, as the legacy Stanley team, under sense of the Black & Decker's Power Tools better, and there's still tremendous amount of expertise within the combined company.

The products are available. The pipeline is full. These are -- this is the most powerful and sought after brand in the professional channel. That's the Dewalt brand, of course. And we believe not to the effect that we're larger company, 2 to the fact that legacy Stanley brands and the Dewalt brands are the most sought after brand in the industry, and we have every hope and expectation to gain share as a result of that as we booked up with these two companies together and introduce our new products. You'll recall from following Stanley, historically, new product launches take place in March and October. And we start to see the benefits of that in the second, obviously, and fourth quarters. Every year, about $100 million in revenue on the legacy Stanley CDIY side has been generated from new products. We see no reason why that shouldn't continue going forward."

I would like to point out that our first quarter earnings release, which was issued at 7 a.m. this morning, and a supplemental presentation which we will refer to during the call are available on the Investor Relations portion of our website and accessible on our homepage of www.stanleyblackanddecker.com. 
This morning, John, Jim and Don will review Stanley's first quarter 2010 results and various other topical matters followed by a Q&A session. Because of the complexity of this quarter, and the large amount of content, the entire call is expected to last approximately one hour and 15 minutes in order to provide adequate time for Q&A. A replay of the call will be available beginning at 2 p.m. today. The replay number and access code are in our press release. 
As a reminder, you can also download the earnings replay as a podcast from iTunes and even set up a subscription for future replays of the calls we post. This should be posted within 24 hours. 
I also wanted to call your attention to Stanley's 2009 annual report and annual review website and videos that we launched yesterday. We decided to go online this year with a lot of our normal annual report content. And we invite you to check out the site and explore the videos which feature conversations with senior management, as well as the interactive charts and informational resources throughout the site. It's a great way to become more familiar with the Stanley story. You can access this through our homepage. And as always, please feel free to contact me with any follow-up questions you might have after today's call. 
We will be making some forward-looking statements during this call. Such statements are based on assumptions of future events that may not prove to be accurate. And as such, they involve risks and uncertainties. It is therefore possible that actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements that we might make today, and we direct you to the cautionary statements in the Form 8-K, which we filed with today's press release, and in our most recent 34 Act.
With that, I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Lundgren."

Let me just start by saying, this had the potential to be a confusing and very noisy quarterly release due to the obvious fact that the Black & Decker transaction closed three weeks before the end of the quarter.",2570,"Thanks, Kate, and good morning, everybody. Let me just start by saying, this had the potential to be a confusing and very noisy quarterly release due to the obvious fact that the Black & Decker transaction closed three weeks before the end of the quarter. So I did want to thank both the legacy Black & Decker and Stanley finance teams.  First of all, for closing three sets of books, at least in a very short period of time. And for extraordinary efforts in that regard, as well as the finance and IR teams for pulling together what we think is a clear presentation. That as Kate said, she will be available, as well as management as necessary later on in the day and later on in the week to clarify anything that's still outstanding at the end of this call.
So let's get started. Diluted EPS was $0.70, and that did include a $0.04 negative impact based on the acquisition of ADT France, which closed on March 9. It excludes one time charges. We did reference the ADT transaction in the press release. So we're not going to spend a lot of time on it this morning other than to say it's strategic and it's going to fit extraordinarily well with GDP, Générale de Protection, our French Electronics Security business. And as Don will discuss in his guidance, we still believe that this acquisition is going to be meaningfully accretive, $0.78 in year three on the expanded share base.
So diluted EPS, including the charges of $213 million, was a loss of $1.09. And again, Don's going to give you more granularity on the charges in their composition in the quarter, which we believe to be quite clear. The gross margin rate, excluding charges, was 39.4%. And excluding Black & Decker, with the impact of Black & Decker for the three-week stub period, the rate improved to 120 basis points versus the first quarter '09 to 40.8%. And that is a first quarter record for our company. Free cash flow was positive, $37 million, excluding charges and payments related to the transaction. Working capital was encouraging as well, reaching 7.3 turns, excluding Black & Decker, and 4.6 turns on a pro forma basis, including both companies in those results.
CDIY segment, our largest segment, profit improved to $83 million and that's up 189%, excluding the charges. Industrial saw a nice rebound. Profit rate improving 280 basis points to 13.2%, again excluding the charges. And as I've mentioned earlier, ADT France closed on March 9. It's going to be a great addition and complementary to our existing Convergent Security Solution platform in Europe. 
The integration, which I'm sure everyone is curious about, into how it's progressing, we think very well. And we're going to talk a little bit more about the synergy target and our estimates. And Don's going to give you some detail on our 2010 guidance for the combined company, which is now at $3.10 to $3.33 per share, excluding the one time charges.
So moving to the first quarter results of the combined company, very simple and straightforward, a 46% increase, excluding the charges. As you can see, to $0.70 from 1Q 2010. And the charges related to $213 million translates to $1.79 a share on the new share base, reflecting the timing of the acquisition. So on a GAAP basis, a loss of $1.09. The only thing that might look a little odd is the minus 1.4% tax rate. Just very quickly, it's a one time event. The charges had an impact of about 35.2% on the tax rate. Not all of those charges were tax deductible. There's also an ADT net operating loss, impacting about 3.9% and the impact of the tax extender benefit impact, which is about 2.6%. That gets you to a normalized rate of 27.3%, which is why we've highlighted that, and that's what Don will talk to in the guidance in terms of that should be your expectation going forward.
Looking at margins on the next page. We think it's important to note pretty strong gross margin of 39.4% for the combined company. As noted in the press release, on the legacy Stanley basis continued its positive trend, about 40.8% on a standalone basis. So we remain encouraged with the margin performance. And Jim's going to talk about some of the drivers of that as he reviews the various segment results. Operating margin remains fairly constant at around 13%. So we're in a good place as we begin to go forward and combine these two companies and report to you on a combined basis.
The cost synergy drivers are I think important to everyone. This chart is essentially unchanged from what we have presented on two or three occasions. So I won't spend a lot of time on it other than to emphasize a few points. We continue to feel confident in our $350 million estimate for synergies. But there have been so many questions, as well as the cost to achieve it at not exceeding $400 million over the three-year timeframe. But there've been enough questions on the $350 million. But I just want to shed a little more light on it. As Don will point out in his guidance, we're going to realize about $90 million of that $350 million during calendar 2010. So the majority of the year one achievement that we previously put in our model, of course, we only have nine months. But in the nine months, 2010, we're looking for about $90 million of benefit. 
But relating to the $350 million in total, first of all, it's a very big number. And as a consequence, it's not easy. And I think it's important to point out, if one just does back-of-envelope math against the purchase base or the cost base, and comes up with a number, it's really important to note that there's a couple of very large areas where there's absolutely no overlap at all between the two legacy companies. One example, and a good one, is batteries in the purchasing area. While legacy Black & Decker spends about $300 million a year on nickel cadmium and lithium-ion batteries, Stanley spends essentially nothing. That's anecdotal but it's just an example of an area where there's a overlap loss. And on a business basis, the Convergent Security business is $800 million in revenue with essentially no overlap whatsoever with the legacy Black & Decker business. So the base against which to focus in the up further synergies is actually smaller than one might realize at first blush. And the $350 million is a fairly aggressive number. 
Second, the cost to achieve synergies in excess of $300 million may render their returns for those programs, for those investments and those expenses unattractive. So while the number could be driven higher, it may not be in the best interest of the company to do it. 
And last, but certainly not least, as Jim will point out, to the extent we achieved additional cost synergies, we may well choose to reinvest those synergies and growth initiatives as we referred to in our press release. We intend to grow this combined business as soon as we've got our synergy targets up fairly embedded in the P&L.
Looking at the status of integration over the first six weeks, we're quite pleased with where we are. Let's focus on some of the major milestones. The first being customers and employees, or very, very simply said, our primary objective is to protect our core. We've executed on a goal of a smooth close and the first 60 days as a combined company is going well. We've been proactive and positive with communication with employees and customers, numerous town hall meetings and market visits. Jim, myself, Don Allan and the senior management team have spent as much time as ever in our careers in front of our employees and in front of customers. It's a very important part of the integration. And we will continue to do that for the foreseeable future. And importantly, let's avoid pitfalls. We have, thus far, no major pitfalls and no major surprises now that we're five weeks post closed. 
Focusing on the cost synergies, we have finalized the bottoms of the synergy identification process, and that will be presented to the executives steering committee in late May. As a reminder, Brett Bontrager on the Stanley side, who's got a wealth of experience in major integrations for Stanley, and Tony Milando, who was formerly head of operations for the Worldwide Power Tools and Accessories business are co-leading this integration process. They are reporting to a steering committee of six people that includes Jim Loree, myself, Don Allan, Mark Mathieu, Massimo Grassi in Europe, and of course Nolan Archibald from Black & Decker who brings all the experience from that organization to bear on the synergies and the targets and what's a good business decision and what isn't. That group meets quite regularly. There are 13 sub-teams focused on either businesses or functions. And as those of you who are familiar with our company know, it's a very, very important part of the rhythm and rigor with which we integrate acquisitions. And we're putting the best team we can on the field to ensure that this process continues and that it's given the utmost attention from the top of the house right down to the focus of executing the programs. Thus far, all our findings has supported that $350 million target. 
Regarding the execution, we rigorously tracked the cost synergy extraction and are quite sure that we're quantifying appropriately and not double counting. We're eagerly and rapidly deploying the Stanley Fulfillment System on the Black & Decker base. I'm really pleased to say that while Black & Decker have had a focused on operational excellence, it was their internal terminology, the elements and the fundamentals SFS are being embraced. I think there's broadscale understanding of the benefits it has had, the legacy Stanley over the last three to four years. And then it can have on a business with a very similar geographic and customer base. So far so good on that.
And last, but certainly not least, we've identified or beginning to identify the revenue synergies and corresponding plans to get them. And I think it will come as no surprise that once the cost synergies are identified, and we're clear that they're on track, it's more inspirational, it's more motivating, it is more fun to grow the business than to take costs out of it. So there's been tremendous support around this initiative. So, so far, so good. We're underway, no major pitfalls.
Looking very quickly at the geographical breakdown, the purpose of this chart is to say that combining these two companies didn't have a tremendous impact geographically on the companies on a standalone basis, specifically the large purple section of the pie showing 56%. Legacy Stanley, legacy Black & Decker were between 55% and 57% of their business in the U.S. prior to the merger. The primary difference being Stanley had a slightly larger presence in Europe and Black & Decker had a meaningfully larger presence in Latin America. So when you combine the two companies, you see that the U.S. is about 56% of the revenue, Europe is 25%, and then Latin America, Canada, Australia adding to 14%, and the rest of the world included in the 14% and Asia about 5%.
Looking at our businesses by segment, again I think just two important points to make here on this chart. Even as a combined entity, we remain a diversified global leader. And second, it is not a departure or an abandonment of Stanley's strategy to continue to diversify into higher growth, emerging markets and businesses. 
Specifically, if we look at CDIY, which includes the legacy Stanley CDIY business, the legacy Black & Decker Worldwide Power Tools and Accessories business and the Price Pfister business, which historically Black & Decker reported within Hardware and Home Improvement, it makes up 58% of the combined total of the company on a 2009 revenue basis. 
Security, which is basically all of Stanley's legacy Security business, both mechanical and convergent, plus Black & Decker Hardware and Home Improvement, less Price Pfister, making up about 25% of the business. And industrial, which included Stanley's industrial portfolio and essentially the Emhart Teknologies business, making up 17% of the business. 
The chart in the bottom, to me at least, is very important, and it's very important that everyone understands it. In 2002, the large home centers and mass merchants, seven customers represented 40% of legacy Stanley's revenue, and the largest customer represented 22%. By the end of 2008, as Stanley diversified its portfolio, those numbers became 13% and 6%, respectively. Adding Black & Decker, 2009 base on a pro forma basis moves those numbers back to 31% of the combined companies businesses through U.S. home centers and mass merchants, and 12% through our largest customer. Not a tremendously concentrated business I think by most standards. And while we can say it's a step back, all it does is put Stanley where it was at about 2006 in its evolution. It's certainly not an abandonment of Stanley's strategy to diversify, it's simply a reflection of the math. And Stanley's being able to merge with a great company and a great set of brands at a very opportunistic time in the cycle. Our strategy going forward will remain exactly as it's been in the past. And as we've pointed out on many times, to continue to grow, to continue to diversify our portfolio and take some of the volatility out of our end results.
Looking quickly at first quarter revenues, I think the good news is, here they are stabilizing versus the dramatic declines of 2009. The chart on the top I think shows that clearly from a holistic point of view. But more importantly, if we look at the segment results, what we see is the four sequential quarters for both revenue and volumes, starting in 2Q '09 going through the first quarter. And the first quarter results, of course, reflect the addition of three weeks of Black & Decker. So the CDIY business and the Industrial business are a little bit less representative. Jim's going to talk about that in just a minute. But I think the important point to note is within security, the rate of decline is slowing down dramatically. The mix is strong, customer attention is as good or better than it's ever been, it's obviously a less volatile business than CDIY or Industrial. It serves Stanley extraordinarily well on the last couple of years with a less precipitous decline. And as a consequence, the market based recovery within the Security business will be slightly slower. But we're highly confident that it's there. And in the meantime, a very strong customer retention and a very solid mix in terms of recurring revenue is keeping the margins of that business in a very, very safe place. 
So I'm going to turn it over to Jim Loree who's going to take you through both the segment results and add a little more clarity on the Legacy business, because we think that will provide some good insight into how the Company performed on standalone basis right up until the transaction closed."

Let's start with Construction and DIY. The hear was very positive, twofold. Legacy Stanley drove 470 basis point improvement in the OM rate, negative 2% organic volume growth. And Black & Decker performed exceptionally well, adding $39 mi",1899,"Thank you, John. Let's start with Construction and DIY. The hear was very positive, twofold. Legacy Stanley drove 470 basis point improvement in the OM rate, negative 2% organic volume growth. And Black & Decker performed exceptionally well, adding $39 million to operating margin and having an accretive impact on the operating margin rate. 
So let's break it down. If we move to revenues, we came in at 561 in this segment with an 85% increase, 82 points of which were associated with BDK, five points currency, plus/minus 2% organic. And that was about minus 1% price and about minus 1% unit volume.
Segment profit was up 189%. If you take out a substantial contribution, $39 million from the acquisition, the actual rate was 14.2% and still a very impressive performance for the legacy Stanley business. As I said, up 470 basis points. If we get into the specifics, the U.S. revenues and European revenues, organically, were both slightly negative. The big box customers in the U.S. continue to have tight inventory controls; did not see a lot of rebuilding there. Orders were modestly positive and new product development was strong, with the introduction of the Bostitch Hand Tool line. And legacy segment profit improved 54% due to the dramatically lower overhead that resulted from the significant cost takeouts over the last five quarters or so. Working capital was a good story going from about 2.5 turns a year ago to 6.8 turns with a $55 million inventory reduction versus prior year, and only a $4 million increase in inventories sequentially versus the fourth quarter.
So I think this is a very strong story here. We'll get into a little bit more color on the pro forma Black & Decker performance in a few minutes. But I expect the next chapter for this segment will be operating leverage. And as we look forward, we're looking for a little more volume growth and as we get into the year. So we should see some good operating leverage as we go forward here, so stay tuned for that. 
Now interestingly, as we look security this quarter, one would say it was a challenging quarter. We expected that. But ironically, if we've had this quarter two or three quarters ago, we would have thought it was a pretty good quarter. So what's essentially happened here is security continues to kind of plug along. It was really the foundation that helped the company get through some of the difficult Construction DIY and industrial market conditions. And it continues to be very strong and stable.  Revenues were up 11%. All of the growth in the quarter was due to the addition of HHI into the results. Legacy Stanley also benefited from the ADT France acquisition, which contributed three points and currency, which contributed three points, thus you get to the minus 6% organic growth. If you divide that or look at the components of that, both convergent security, the Electronic business and mechanical security, were both down roughly 6%. 
They were different stories, though. The convergent was relatively a simple story, modest volume decline, RMR increased a couple of points, stable operating margin. Pretty much business as usual, trying to get through the difficult market conditions. The nice aspect of the quarter for them was that the national account budget seemed to be loosening up a little bit, which is good. However, the Core business, which was the foundation of their volume story in the last year or so was weak. So you had kind of a change in mix there due to that. 
On the mechanical side, the volume decline was also expected. But the operating margin did dip from about 20% in the prior year first quarter to 16%. Again, a twofold story here. Absorption issues in the factories clearly contributed to that. And then secondly, some SG&A investments for growth, primarily for growth in Asia and for Feet on the Street in the U.S. got ahead of the growth curve, which is not unexpected and perfectly fine. So that caused a temporary dip in the operating margin rate, and we don't see that as a continuing issue.
Now Industrial, I think, was a very positive story. I think it's also indicative of the first signs of what a few points of volume can do for operating margin growth in this type of a business, what we call operating leverage. And also a nice contribution from Black & Decker's Emhart Teknologies business, which itself is rebounding in a very big way. And again, we'll talk more about the Black & Decker activities in just a minute.
Revenues were up 22%, 16 points of that was from the MR contribution, three points currency. Organic growth was positive 3%. And that led to a 54% segment profit increase. And without the Emhart contribution, a 25% segment profit increase, which is fantastic and that would have been about $30 million of segment profit attributable to the legacy, Industrial Stanley business. And if you go to the segment profit rate, we increased from 10.4% to 13.2%, 280 basis points. And about 100 of that was associated with the Emhart contribution. So 12.2% operating margin for the core Stanley legacy business there. 
So pretty much the story on the volume was a rebound in Europe and at Proto, with Europe up 6% and volume in Proto up 14%. We all know what's happening in the industrial markets. It's a strong story. I think a little bit of that, obviously, maybe more than a little bit was restocking.  And when we look at the GDP, it's not quite up at those levels. And then we did have some weakness in our Vidmar Storage business and our Hydraulics business. Both the Vidmar issue being driven by government spending delays and the Hydraulics just a cyclical business, which is kind of appears to be at the trough of the cycle right now.
Now I'm going to change gears here for a moment, and we're going to look at the pro forma Black & Decker legacy segment performance. And when I look at this page, and I can't help but think that the timing of this merger was excellent. This chart shows the Black & Decker segments arrayed on a full quarter-over-quarter pro forma basis. So this is how it would have looked had Black & Decker been a standalone business at this point in time. 
And if we start with PT&A, which is Power Tools and Accessories, which is a very large part of their business, as you can see, they had 6% growth, 1% organic growth. North American was the weakest part of the story, although the Consumer Products Group was strong. Europe had a nice performance with positive 3% organic, that was very encouraging. And Latin America was up 11%, and Asia up 13% both bright spots. So good story there. 
Hardware and Home Improvement shown here as HHI was up 12%, mostly organic. U.S. locksets, primarily the Kwikset and Baldwin business was up 14% and Price Pfister was up 9%. Nice product introduction in the midpoint price point range in Kwikset, is leading to some outstanding success in the marketplace, and also some nice rebound in the markets as well.  And if there was any rebound in the market story within Black & Decker's legacy businesses, it was in the Fastening and Assembly segment, which is also known as Emhart Teknologies. And this is a business that sells productivity to industrial customers, primarily Automotive OEMs. It's about 2/3 driven by global automotive production and about 1/3 driven by industrial production. And the story, of course, in the quarter was that the global vehicle demand was up 42% around the world with North America up 62%, Europe up 25%, and Japan up 53%. Thus Emhart, which has historically been a mid-teens operating margin performer, quickly rebounded from a trough last year of 2% to 14%. Very impressive performance from the folks at Emhart. Largely, market driven, but they took a lot of cost in that business and they got a cost structure that's really in a good place. 
So truly a terrific performance from our new colleagues from Black & Decker. This morning, there were a lot of questions about how could these margins be so rich. And the story is very simple: These folks took out about $300 million slightly more than $300 million of costs over the last five, six quarters before the merger. And their cost structure is in great shape and a little volume is going to go along ways towards big profit improvements in that part of the business.
Now another great story for the quarter, in my view, is working capital in the legacy Stanley business. You may recall from those of you that have been following the company that Stanley closed out last year at 7.9 turns. We typically will have at least a point reduction in the turns as we go into the end of the first quarter with the seasonal build and so forth. We were able to contain that to a much smaller increase. So we don't close at 7.3 turns. And that's up from 4.8 last year. So a real nice performance. There you can see good news in all fronts. Inventory down 25%, receivables down 14%, payables up 10%, that's good. Total of 34% reduction from 762 down to 504. And I just want to emphasize that these improvements are process-driven by the Stanley Fulfillment System. And we don't have the time this morning to delve into Stanley Fulfillment System in great detail for the folks that aren't familiar with it. However, we'll note, there's a new section in a web-based annual report that we're issuing that will give you a lot of insight into Stanley Fulfillment System if you're interested in learning more about it. 
But as we move to the next page here, we can see that there's one huge opportunity, and John alluded to it earlier, and that is that rigorous deployment of the Stanley Fulfillment System across the newly added Black & Decker entities will provide a huge opportunity for the company. As you can see, the combined working capital of the companies, although it was nice reduction from last year, is right around $1.9 billion. And that's comprised of $500 million of Stanley, legacy, working capital and $1.4 billion of Black & Decker legacy working capital.
Now a little math. If we just annualize the first quarter for illustrative purposes, we would have $8.8 billion of annualized revenues. If we could get to the 7.9 turns that we ended the year at, that would free up $1.1 billion in cash. It would free up $800 million in cash because it would be $1.1 billion. So $1.9 million minus $1.1 million is $800 million. But I also will emphasize that this is, while it's an objective, it is also a journey and not an overnight sensation. As I mentioned, SFS is process-driven. It took us three years to get from 4.5 turns to 7.9. But we, as John mentioned, have begun the journey here, it is a very doable journey with a very positive outcome. 
And now I will turn it over to Don Allan, our Senior Vice President and CFO to go through some of the financial aspects of the quarter."
304977,100726874,61408,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. First thing I'd like to do is start with our balance sheet on a combined basis. We feel really good about our financial position going into the new company and moving forward. As you can see at the bottom of the page, our debt to capital r",2532,"Thank you, Jim. First thing I'd like to do is start with our balance sheet on a combined basis. We feel really good about our financial position going into the new company and moving forward. As you can see at the bottom of the page, our debt to capital ratio is 35%. We adjusted for the hybrid instruments that we have, it's at 31%, exactly where we were hoping it would be as we put the two companies together post-merger. 
A few other items to note here that's significant, obviously, there's some large dollar variance on the balance sheet by merging the two companies, when you compare it to the first quarter of last year. The largest changes have to do in other assets where the goodwill and the intangibles are recorded of about $5.6 billion, as well as the Black & Decker working capital components being added in there of about $2.4 billion on the asset side of the balance. 
And then equity, clearly the issuance of the equity associated with the merger of about $4.5 billion is increasing our equity. And that's really what's driving the debt to capital ratio coming down from where we were last year at this point in time. So we feel very good starting out, financial position, as we move forward. 
For free cash flow in the first quarter, this chart depicts what free cash flow was excluding one time payments. And we had approximately $92 million of one time payments related to the merger. And if you exclude that effect, the free cash flow was $37 million. Operating cash flow of $59 million, which was an improvement of $55 million year-over-year in the first quarter of 2009. And you can see it's driven by net income increase. And John and Jim just walked you through some details in the area. And then working capital was a significant negative in the first quarter of $90 million, which is a normal trend for both companies. They tend to have working a capital negative in the first quarter as certain inventories get billed going into the second quarter. And then just the timing of the sales related to AR, as we have a large sales month in March and that can drive our receivables up at the end of the first quarter. So pretty much as planned was our working capital in Q1.
Touching on the ADT France acquisition on the next page. It's not a large acquisition, but it's something important that we should talk about briefly. It really is a continuation of our strategy within Security to expand our footprint internationally. We've talked to many of you over the last year too, that's an important part of our initiative and overall strategy within Security. This acquisition really allows us to continue to take that step forward. By combining ADT France and GDP together, we're creating the largest market share company in France, by doing that. GDP brings a strong core commercial orientation and then ADT has a very strong national account orientation. So by pulling these two companies together, they mix well together from that perspective. 
The revenues are expected to be, in 2010, to be about $125 million to $135 million, as I'll go through in more detail later. Last year's revenues, in '09, were $132 million euro, about $175 million. And the RMR component is about 45%. As John mentioned earlier, the accretion should be about $0.07 to $0.08 by year three as we look to remove about $35 million of costs by pulling the two companies together, which would allow the operating margin to be approximately 20%, once the synergies are completely removed. 
We feel we have a really strong and experienced management team in France that can drive this integration. They proved their worth in the GDP acquisition that we did a few years ago and integrating them into our Worldwide business. And now they have the ADT France business integrated into their local operations. 
The last thing I'll leave you with, there is a dilutive impact associated with operating margins related to this acquisition in 2010. It could be as much as 150  to 200 basis points in 2010 to the CSS business, and to the overall segment about 75 to 100 basis points. But that's just a one year phenomena. As we go into 2011 and 2012, we would expect the operating margins in CSS to get back to that 20% bar that we've established. So we feel very good about that acquisition as we head into this year.
The next page is really the way that we've begun to summarize some of the trends that we're seeing in our three different segments. And after that, I'll walk into the guidance with a little more detail. 
We me start with the CDIY segment. I want to leave you with two or three thoughts here. As we head into 2010 and beyond, we believe that we're starting to see an improvement in the top line in our CDIY segment. And we expect mid single-digit growth in revenue. And that would be total growth on an organic basis and including currency. It does not include any impact of acquisitions going forward. So this will be in a pro forma basis. We also are seeing continued recovery in merging markets around the world. So we expect growth to be stronger in the merging markets in both Hand Tools, as well as Power Tools and Bostitch around the world. We don't expect the U.S., and mature markets in Europe as well, to grow as significantly. But we do expect some modest growth in those particular markets. And as always, we continue to be very focused on new product development, innovation and making sure that those rollouts help us drive more market share gains as we move forward.
Industrial, as Jim mentioned, we are beginning to see a little bit of an effect in restocking and throughout the supply chain. We saw that in the month of March, in particular, in FACOM [Franco Américaine de Construction d'Outillage Mécanique] and Proto. And we believe these indications will allow us to forecast or predict the possibility of a high single-digit revenue growth in this segment in 2010. This customer restocking is primarily in the industrial portion of our businesses. The automotive component has not been as strong, but we do believe that it's coming likely in the second quarter.
In the Engineering Fastening business, we saw significant increase in light vehicle production. In the first quarter, we expect that trend to continue compared to the prior year and the second quarter and the third quarter, which will drive revenue growth. And then a small acquisition in Engineered Fastening called, FIT [Fastener Innovation Technology, Inc.], which really allows us to diversify ourselves little bit away from the automotive manufacturing environment. In aerospace, it's a strategy that we'll continue to look at as we move forward as a company.
Security. Talked a little bit about this already, our ADT France. But the trends that I'm listing here do not include the effects of ADT France. So revenue, we actually expect to decline slightly as a Security business this year. This is a late cycle business as many of you know and the economic recovery will come a little bit later. As we're seeing some of that economic recovery in our CDIY business and Industrial, we expect Security to see if either later this year or early next year. So as a result, we will have a small single-digit revenue decline throughout 2010.
We are seeing recovery within the core commercial accounts and lagging in our national account customer base. Installation revenues continue to improve slightly, but not significantly. I talked about the integration of the ADT France acquisition already, and you can see the impact financially in 2010. There was a slight drag in our operating margins as I mentioned. Clearly, commercial construction continues to be a drag on the segment and it's an area that we continue to focus on. We also are focusing on other verticals such as education and healthcare to try to offset the impact of that.
So moving to our guidance for 2010 on the next page. Excluding one-time charges and costs, we believe the EPS guidance for 2010 is $3.10 to $3.30. And underlying some of the assumptions in that, you can see on this page, we start with the first section at the top. For the remainder nine months of 2010, so this is just for the upcoming three quarters. We believe that net sales will increase 4% to 5% on a pro forma merged company basis and that excludes the impact of ADT France. And that will include the impact of currency, which we would expect to be relatively immaterial for the remainder of the year. But I'll talk about that a little bit later as it relates to the Chinese RMB. ADT France will contribute $125 million to $135 million of sales and will be modestly dilutive to EPS in 2010.
We believe our gross margins on a combined basis for the next nine months will range between 37% and 38%. And so you see the blending effect of putting the two companies together Stanley and Black & Decker as it mixes the Stanley gross margin rate down from the 41% to 40% category that it's been in the last two or three quarters. But we also expect to experience some significant commodity inflation through the remainder of the year. It is the Chinese RMB does revalue, that could be a pressures as well. So we didn't forecast that the potential for a 5% RMB revaluations, which equates to approximately $42 million on an annualized basis. Exactly the timing of that and when that will happen is difficult to predict. But we've assumed about 2/3 of that in our guidance. 
That being said, with commodity inflation coming and revaluation of currency, the Chinese currency, we're very proactive in looking at how we can pass us on some of these increases to our customer base, as we've done as a company for the last two to four years. It continues to be some significant that we're focused on, and we'll continue to do that throughout 2010. But clearly, it will be a lag in the timing of that as we intended to see during the significant inflationary periods. 
One fact I leave you with related to inflation is that when you look at the steel components that we buy, if you compare the average cost in the first quarter to the fourth quarter of last year, the increases have been about 7% to 10%. We haven't experienced that as a company but if you look at what's happening on the commodity markets those are the percentage increases that we're seeing. If you compare the first quarter averages to the third quarter of last year, the increases are around 25%. So there clearly is inflationary pressures that are coming in. We need to be proactive about how we pass those increases out on our customers and that's something we're very focused on. 
Two other items to note related to this time of period intangible amortization of approximately $55 million. And as John mentioned, the cost synergy impact in calendar 2010 will be $90 million. That's about 90% of that $90 million that impact SG&A.
Looking at the full year, the bottom part of the page, our share count clearly is going to increase as the result of the merger, but we also have the previously announced issuance of about 6 million shares related to our equity unit hybrid instrument, that will occur in May of 2010. So the average outstanding shares will approximate $150 million. 
The tax rate should be about 26% to 27%. As John mentioned earlier, the normalized Q1 tax rate was around 27%, so really we'll be consistent with what we experience in the first quarter. And in the impact to foreign currency, we would expect to be utilized currency exchange rates, we would expect that to be relatively minimal. Now that exclude the effect of the Chinese RMB. Anything that happens related to that is outside of that particular assumption. And then last, the restructuring and related charges not associated with Black & Decker or ADT France will be up $30 million to $40 million.
So the free cash flow assumption related to this when you factor in this particular EPS guidance and excluding the effect of the one-time charges and payments, will be about $600 million for the merge company of 2010. 
The next page is a summary of the one-time charges that we expect for the full year of 2010. And if you look at our GAAP EPS forecast or guidance, we believe that we would be anywhere from a loss of $0.41 to a slight gain of $0.05 based on the exact outcome of these charges over the remainder of the year. 
And it really broken into three different components. The first is this restructuring costs associated with severing employees as well as closing facilities, and the range there is $245 million to $295 million, $90 million of which we've actually incurred in the first quarter of 2010. Then we have one-time costs in SG&A and the category that we call other net below operating margin of $100 million, which relates to certain executive comp charges, investment banking fees and other advisory consulting fees that we're utilizing for the innovation process. The vast majority of that was actually incurred in the first quarter about $81 million. So we have $90 million of additional costs for the remainder of the year. And then last, an accounting charge related to inventory where we actually step up the value and purchase accounting. It's a non-cash charge will be $170 million, $42 million of that was recorded in the first quarter.
So at a cash EPS basis, excluding these different charges, we believe that the cash EPS will be $4.89 to $5.09, and that assumes about $370 million of depreciation and amortization. 
So to summarize this morning's call, we feel we've made successful progress in beginning the execution and the integration with Black & Decker. We believe the $350 million cost synergy target is achievable. As I mentioned, related to trends we're seeing selected customer restocking activity in our industrial channel and signs of a bit of a pickup in. And the end market still allow us to fell that a 4% to 5% revenue growth through the remainder of 2010 is reasonable. We're focused on strong new product launches to gain market share and boost that top line growth as much as we can. And as Jim mentioned, the operating leverage is something that we're very focused on, and we saw a bit of demonstration of that in the first quarter in CDIY industrial. And then last, but certainly not least, SFS we believe will play a significant role in the successful integration of Black & Decker, as well as our objectives around working capital. 
So with that, that concludes the presentation portion of this morning's call."

So",387,"Clearly, the story, as I mentioned in my remarks, has everything to do with the fact that on a combined basis, these companies took out well over $600 million of costs, close to $700 million of costs in the last six quarters before the end of the year. So that cost is obviously not all coming back. And when the volume comes in, there is some cost add-backs in both of the businesses. But we're here to enjoy some operating leverage and make some selective reinvestments in growth as we move forward. And we'll kind of monitor and allocate those growth reinvestments as we go. But the expectation here is that we've gone through a lot of pain over the last -- both organizations over the last couple of years and we expect to enjoy the fruits. On a more granular basis, when you get into gross margins, both companies have a tried-and-true productivity regimen, somewhat different. We're taking the best-of-the-best and putting them together in those cases. I think, Stanley, has probably been a little bit more -- Legacy Stanley, has a little bit better focused on pricing core competency in the organization. And I think we have some opportunities to drive that through the new company and help drive some positive improvement in gross margins, in particular, in that area. But I will also say that I think that inflation is something that we all need to be, as Don pointed out, we only need to be cognizant as this economy heats up, we're already seeing the early signs of commodity inflation. So there will be some puts and takes here as we go. We'll probably not going to get 100% price recovery, just like we didn't get 100% price recovery in Legacy Stanley since '04, we got 80%. We can get somewhere between 60% and 80% as a combined company and I think we'll be doing quite well. There will be a lag time in that regard. And that's why while Don's guidance may seem a little cautious to some folks, I think including New York [ph] (59:49) based on something I read, I think it's probably appropriate. I think the margin rates that we're at today, certainly seems sustainable to us. But we're three weeks into our relationship here, so time will tell."

In terms of restocking and sell-through, it's a little early. As you know and everyone on the call knows, the home centers closed their fiscal books at the end of January, which is always a relatively soft month for we as suppliers in terms of volume. So what we've shipped in February and March, we do believe it's helping with restocking. In terms of POS, all I'll say is, there's nothing out of the ordinary yet. And I don't want to say any more than that. The simple reason being without inventory, there can't be any sell-through. And inventories have been so low up until about March, that we think POS has been constrained by lack of inventory at retail. So we've seen no dramatic increases. We've seen no decreases. But the simple answer is it's one to three months early to make any kind of I'd say, projection or draw any kind of conclusions based on that, and I hope that's clear. So modest restocking, constant sell-through, but we think it's going to take a few months of inventories being at a more robust level in the stores before we can expect the kind of POS lift that we're hoping to see. In terms of revenue synergies, it's early days. We've been in I'd say file an agreement across the two companies that they are there. As I referenced, they're more -- it's much more motivating and inspirational, the work on revenue synergies. But I have to say, first and foremost, we need to be sure the cost synergy plans are in place. They're being executed and that's embedded. We've only reasonably, since we've been able to put the two companies together at the very senior levels of management, top 12 people in the combined company establish a process for identifying, resourcing and managing any potential conflict with revenue synergies relative to cost synergies. Because conceivably, one could get in the way of the other, so there has to be a way to establish the appropriate priorities and to the extent that conflict exists, resolve it. As I mentioned in my introductory remarks, there's actually a formal presentation at the end of May to the Steering Committee, where we think we will be a little more granular internally. That if something material takes place, obviously, we'll be public about it, otherwise, we'll just talk about the status in our next quarterly review. Lastly, in terms of timing for SFS, Jim said it best, it's an evolution, it's not a revolution. This is not a silver bullet, it's not an overnight phenomenon, it's a very, very long journey. I'd like to think with a very willing audience, or if you will, body and that's the entire Black & Decker operating and management team, they've seen the positive impact its had for Stanley over the last year. But I'll say our own experience, we started talking about it four years ago. We started really embedding it three years ago. And it's taken, while the improvement has been gradual, it's taken three years to really, really see the fruit on those trees. So I'd like to think we can do it a little quicker because we have some more experience. As Jim pointed out, we're applaying it across a much, much larger base. So that's going to have an impact as well. But I think it's going to be 12 to 18 months before it's appropriate to see any process-driven changes as the result of SFS. And I think you can expect a steady improvement from there."

And hence, we're putting off the revenue synergy",713,"Yes,  I think everyone needs to understand that when you're implementing $350 million of synergies in a $9 billion company, while it may not sound like much on a percentage basis, it's really all consuming. And hence, we're putting off the revenue synergy, deep dive kind of planning process a couple of months. And SFS may take a little bit longer to implement across the platform because we can't do everything at once. So we're trying to sequence these things in a rational and orderly manner. But there is that huge opportunity out there. And I think also the fact that there are fewer SKUs in the Power Tools business than in the Hand Tool business will help us. The fact that we've got the experience that John referenced will help us expedite. But it's going to be a very large undertaking. And it will take at least somewhere in the range of probably 18 to 24, maybe 36 months to get it done to that level. And then last thing, I would just comment on the revenue and synergies a little bit. I had the opportunity to spend about four weeks visiting far-flung regions of the world and meeting the Black & Decker folks and learning about their business in great detail around the world and starting to kind of frame out what the revenue synergy areas might be. And I think there's five really significant ones and maybe some more that I don't know about yet that will kind of desurface during our bidding process during the next few months. But they have a very strong organization in Latin America. They have production in Brazil, which is expendable. They have a distribution center down there, which we don't have. And for those of you that are familiar with Brazil, those are both enormously important assets in order to be successful in Brazil, which is really on fire from a market growth perspective. So we will quickly, as quickly as possible, take advantage of that opportunity to gain market share with the Legacy Stanley businesses. They're in Latin America, the business leader down there is terrific. Likewise in the Middle East, in Dubai, which covers the entire Middle East and Africa region for the Legacy Black & Decker, and now Stanley Black & Decker. Very strong organization in the Middle East as well, and a good infrastructure, significantly better and bigger than ours in the Middle East. We will leverage that as quickly as we can. And in Asia, I think we find that both companies have fledgling operations there. When we put them together, I think we have sufficient scale to have a meaningful growth initiative in Asia, and really leverage off each other and our distribution channel access and our talent over there. We were fortunate enough to retain both leaders from Stanley Legacy and Black & Decker Legacy Asia, and we have them now kind of divided up that territory within both of their regions. So they both are now -- we have twice the senior talent working on Asia and the emerging markets. And then closer to home, I think well really the staff to channel is something that Stanley has coveted for a long time, and inspired to do better in the Bostitch hand tool launches is just an example of something that's really targeted of this staff to channel. But when you look at the Black & Decker relationships and the staff to channel there, stronger and their history is more successful in that channel than ours. And so we hope to leverage that. And then lastly on the industrial channels around the globe, as many of you know, Stanley has transformed its market approach in those channels to really drive a global platform approach across the regions. And Black & Decker, while it has this entity called Industrial Power Tools, it's really far more construction oriented than industrial. It has some industrial. But Stanley has much better channel access into the industrial and automotive repair channels across the world, and we expect to leverage that as a revenue synergy as well. So I hope that gives you a little color into some of the potential areas that could be very meaningful on a go-forward basis."

We're seeing the signs of that in 2010. If these trends will continue, then we'll have a more growth in 11 and 12. Was working capital is also significant opportunity for us. And getting to the billion dollars required modest improvement in the Black & Decker working capital turns for two turns.

Steel is, as Don pointed out, he'll quantify exactly how much it will be, how much we think it will be, what's build into our projections. The RMB is huge, obviously, with products both from our competitors and ourselves, sourced from Asia. 5% RMB inflation is $42 million on an annualized basis. The simple thing to say is when we see that inflation coming, it will take 1 to 3 months afraid to get our cost of goods. We would be out trying to announce and implement pricing, the second we see it coming. If you assume a six-month lag in some customers from the day we announce until the day we get it, we have a three-month GAAP to fill, and that's what I'm trying to improve. So simply said, we're trying to be equal to or ahead of the curve. We've done a good job with that over the last three or four years, driven by the Central pricing Center of Excellence and people from that organization, being embedded within the age of the business units. And that's where we'll stay. We'll try to stay equal to or ahead of the curve. And both commodities and revenue inflation are going to be very, very big external factors or market-driven factors to look at. importantly, as it relates to the impact of RMB inflation, we're not in this alone. Anyone, whether it's private label or home centers or foreign competition in CDIY, they're going to be impacted as much or more as we are. So while the numbers are big, the forces in the marketplace are present that we'll suggest we won't be alone in the need to achieve pricing to maintain margin."

And we believe not to the effect that we're larger company, 2 to the fact that legacy Stanley brands and the Dewalt brands are the most sought after brand in the industry, and we have every hope and expectation to gain share as a result of that as we booked up with these two companies together and introduce our new products. You'll recall from following Stanley, historically, new product launches take place in March and October. And we start to see the benefits of that in the second, obviously, and fourth quarters. Every year, about $100 million in revenue on the legacy Stanley CDIY side has been generated from new products. We see no reason why that shouldn't continue going forward."

And also, they had reduced a lot of their brand support in taking costs out. And a lot of that brand support, well it's not a cost synergy per se and it's not a revenue synergy per se. We are able to leverage a lot of our existing brand support assets, such as our MLB program, we see for Dewalt in four parts that we probably already have. And also in our premier football over in Europe,  you'll see Dewalt out the games now. So around the world, in NASCAR, you see the same thing.

Let me first just touch on some second quarter highlights, in a quarter that we were quite pleased with our performance in general, as well as where we see the business going from here.
Revenues on a pro forma basis increased 13% to $2.4 billion and I’m going to give you a breakdown by geography and source in just a minute, and Jim Loree, when he reviews the segments, will give you even a little more granularity within the segments as to what we feel some of the indicators are.
Our second quarter diluted EPS of $1.24 excluding the onetime charges related primarily to the Black & Decker merger, the details of the special charges, which totaled $229 million, are included on page four of our press release. We provide quite a bit of granularity there, and we don’t intend to spend much time on this morning’s call, and that is there clearly if you do need in the press release.
That does include a $36 million benefit, the $1.24 or $0.21 a share attributable to favorable settlements of tax contingencies associated with the resolution of Black & Decker income tax audits from prior years.
On a GAAP basis $0.28 diluted EPS, including all the one-time charges, $213 million of free cash flow, excluding the one-time payments, and again that’s $27 million detailed in the press release.
So, legacy Stanley reached a record 8.6 working capital turns, and it’s nothing else, it’s indication that SFS, the Stanley Fulfillment System is alive and well in the legacy business and you’ll hear later that we are very rapidly expanding the Stanley Fulfillment System across the larger base and it’s beginning to gain traction.
The integration is proceeding quite smoothly, but the focus in the second half will be on the launch of SFS across the larger framework, as well as the beginning of the formulation of some revenue synergy plans.
Our CDIY segment, which is now the largest segment in the business, profitability improved 430 basis points to 15.6%, again, excluding the CDIY portion of the one-time charges that I alluded to earlier.
And the smaller but still very important integration of Stanley Solutions de Sècuritè, or SSDS, the former ADT France business is also progressing quite well. Margins improved significantly versus the prior year and it’s an important strategic add-on to our Continental European Convergent Security business.
Don is going to talk a little bit more about full year guidance, but excluding one-time charges we’ve increased it to $3.56 to $3.76 range or $3.35 to $3.55 if we exclude the $0.21 tax related benefit that we realized in the second quarter.
So, the bottom end of our guidance now exceeds the top end of the range previously presented in April. Don will talk a little bit more about that and the underlying assumptions towards the end of our presentations.
Lastly, free cash flow guidance for the year, where previously we said it would approximate $600 million, we’re thinking and guiding to the fact that it will exceed $600 million for the year.
Moving on just a snapshot of essentially the earnings picture, $0.89 same period year ago on our share base of roughly 79.7 million, and looking forward to 2010, due to the merger, the average share count for the quarter of 166.1 million, you see $0.28 on a GAAP basis, $1.03 without the one-time charges, but excluding the benefit, the $36 million benefit or $0.21 a share impact of the tax settlement, which would take it to $1.24.
I think of equal or greater importance, that’s obviously shown in the tax rate, ongoing or normalized tax rate would have been 28% without that benefit. I think that helps you in terms of your modeling. Without the charges operating margin increased to 13.7% very healthy performance across all three segments. Jim Loree is going to give you a little more granularity on the segments in just a minute.
Looking at worldwide revenues, we’ll go around the world very quickly, starting with our largest market in the left in the US So, revenues grew 6% and US continues to represent 56% of Stanley Black & Decker’s global revenues. Canada grew nicely, 28%, and it represents about 7% of global revenues, very strong growth in Latin America.
Mexico, we recognize it as part of North America, but we report it in our Latin American and manage it as part of our Latin American business, grew 39% and it represent 7% of our total. Europe, driven by strong industrial growth, showed 17% revenue growth, it’s 24% of our total.
Good performance in Asia, primarily Mainland China, Southeast Asia, represents 4% of our total, grew 35%. Australia, an important market albeit a small one for both legacy Stanley and legacy Black & Decker, represents 2% of our total, but we had nice lift of 11%.
So, emerging markets are clearly showing the strongest recovery and the strongest performance, in a geographical range where revenues grew from as little as 6% to as much 39%, getting us to the 13% total that I spoke about it earlier.
Looking at the sources of those growth, 9% organic growth, which we can compare both sequentially and looking little a bit by business. Volume, as I mentioned earlier, accounted for 9% of that growth. There was no impact of price globally, so organic growth of 9% from volume.
We lost a percentage point due to currency and then if we isolate the impact of Black & Decker this is the first quarter were we had full three months of Black & Decker in the GAAP results, plus the benefit of the French convergent security business, 149% for the total of 157%.
If you look at that compared to 38% sequentially in the first quarter, remember that both the ADT France business and Black & Decker business were only part of the combined total for about three weeks in the first quarter.
If you look at our segments, CDIY volume grew 6%, driven by power tools, worldwide power tools grew 10%, which is very strong performance in that business. Industrial volumes across the globe grew 30%, engineered fastening. Essentially the Emhart business, plus the former Stanley Assembly Technologies business grew 44%.
Security on a volume basis was flat with some puts and takes that Jim is going to give you little more granularity on. The legacy of Black & Decker Hardware and Home Improvement business, excluding the Price Pfister business, grew 3%, and for total of 12% as you can see it.
So, a lot of restocking, we talked about it in our press release, Don will address to the extent appropriate in his comments, but we also saw a nice uptick in demand, which ultimately resulted in some tremendous volume leverage, which showed up both on the top line and in our margins.
The integration remains first and foremost, and something we are all spending a lot of time on, probably the highest priority item in addition to protecting our core business remains that cost synergy targets. We feel very good about what they are.
We’re continuing to guide that $90 million of cost synergies will be realized in our P&L in 2010, and we remain on track for $350 million of annual cost synergy realization by year three, which is where we have been essentially since the announcement of this deal, and as we’ve both looked at this top down, bottom up, with various puts and takes.
Rigorous tracking is in place, with weekly meetings and conversations with the integration management office, and the Steering Committee, monthly rhythms are established now to both track actuals and flag any issues early to put them on a corrective path if the specific program is falling behind.
We’ve had a lot of outside help in pulling this together and getting it started that will end in mid-August and I’m confident that we are ready to pass that baton and take the process over 100% internally. We’ve done this before and we believe that we’re in very good shape on that end.
The focus has moved from planning to execution. We’ve stabilized the organization and we’ve certainly executed well in the first full quarter that we’ve been able to track. The actuals that are included within the $90 million are on or slightly ahead of plan. So a good start.
We’ve streamlined the integration teams. As I’ve talked about previously, the integration teams historically consisted of one legacy Stanley manager, one legacy Black & Decker manager and a third-party subject matter expert.
We’re now able to deploy some of the internal executives back to the businesses, so we have a total, going forward for the rest of the year, of about 16 people as opposed to 40 working full time on the integration.
Of those 16, just an interesting point of reference, nine are legacy Stanley executives, seven are legacy Black & Decker executives, and Brett Bontrager and the integration management office continues to do an extraordinary job of keeping this on track and keeping everyone informed.
Management teams, particularly Jim Loree, Don Allan, myself, as well as our business leaders have traveled essentially to every large facility around the world, having met thousands of employees and try to get everyone on the same page, and we feel really good about the way these two organizations are coming together.
I think of equal or perhaps greater importance going forward is we’ve started the process to identify revenue synergy opportunities. The focus, of course, is on high priority opportunities that we have a high likelihood to achieve at a reasonable cost.
We’re developing the plans, we’re hiring people if necessary to execute against those synergies. They’ll be included within the businesses and the businesses will be held accountable for achieving them. We will have a lot more granularity on our October call as it relates to the magnitude of those synergies, which is what we have said all along.
We want to ensure that our cost synergies are in the bank and we’ve protected the core and then we’ll start to develop, execute staff and fund, our highest priority revenues synergies.
Last but certainly not least, the roll out of the Stanley Fulfillment System across the larger base is in process. We’ve established clear understanding of what the goals are, what are the principles, what are the processes, as well as some working capital fundamentals, guidelines, and targets across the entire system, providing the tools and the processes to develop a gain plan to achieve the working capital targets, which is obviously a tremendous source of cash generation, has been in the past and continues to be in the future, as we combine these two organizations with very similar supply chains. And we’re providing the method of tools the know-how to enable the businesses to engage associates quickly at the point of impact.
What I’ll say as we’ve visited and spent time with the management teams around the world. We clearly are gaining traction with legacy Stanley businesses that have been historically below line average as well as the new businesses that have become part of the combined enterprise. We are sharing best practices and developed elsewhere across the system, and we’re already seeing sequential improvement second quarter versus first quarter.
Let me turn it over now to Jim Loree, who is going to take you into a little more detail on the specific segment performance. We’ll then turn it over to Don Allan, who’s going to talk about our balance sheet. It’s in good shape as well as provide an outlook for the rest of the year.

Let’s start with Construction and DIY. There are four parts of this great story. The first one is resumption of modest end market demand along with some inventory corrections that led to organic growth in both the legacy CDIY and the wo",1794,"Thank you, John. Let’s start with Construction and DIY. There are four parts of this great story. The first one is resumption of modest end market demand along with some inventory corrections that led to organic growth in both the legacy CDIY and the worldwide Product Tools and Accessories business from legacy Black & Decker.
As you can see, our CDIY hand tool business was up 5%, the power tool business was up 8% organically. While, to some it may not seem like very significant numbers, there in the context of several quarters, if not over a year, of negative organic growth in both segments including minus 2% most recently in legacy CDIY.
In the first quarter, the Power Tools and Accessories business actually continued the strong performance sequentially from the first quarter organically. So we have both of that going on. At the same time, we have growing momentum in new product development and introduction, both the power tools and hand tools.
In hand tools, the Bostitch hand tool launch has been very successful. More successful even in the FatMax Xtreme launch that we had a few years ago, and then within Professional Power Tools, the compact cordless lithium ion, product revenues were substantial in terms of growth and we have another way of lithium ion product introductions coming in the third and fourth quarter. So, very exciting. Progress a little bit of catch up over the past few years, but we are confident that these introductions will be very successful.
And then within the Consumer Products group, had some improvements in the Tradesmen product line but substantial progress in the outdoor portfolio driven by a new 24 Volt String Trimmer and a 36 Volt Lawn Mower, which in particular, the string trimmer have been very successful from a quantity perspective, and both have been readily accepted by the marketplace.
So, second element of the story, growing new product momentum. And then we move to all of these with a backdrop of firstly more efficient cost structure. Both companies, as you know, took out substantial cost before the merger and now we have the beginnings of merger synergy realization beginning to occur and will gain momentum as we go forward.
The fourth part of the story, which is strong operating leverage and that’s exactly what we saw here. The hand tools business ran at an operating margin rate of close to 17%, very, very near its peak of 17.6% in the third quarter of ‘06, and the Power Tools business on a pro forma basis ran at an operating margin of 14.4%, which was very close to its peak back in the second quarter of ‘06.
So essentially, what you have is both Hand Tools and Power Tools performing right about at their historic high operating margin percent range that were achieved at the top of the cycle while still very early in the cycle, so very exciting story.
As John mentioned, we’re very pleased with the stability of the management structure that we have in CDIY and the way they are operating across geographies, across businesses and across functions. Led by Jeff Ansell, the veteran legacy SWK proven performer, he has a staff of regional business heads and functional leaders that really achieves a nice blend from both companies and the best of the best on the team now, and I think that we can attribute a lot of this performance to the hard work of that team.
Moving on to Security, well, this is the segment that really buttressed Stanley, its results during the steep Construction and DIY and industrial downturn over the past few years, and it tends to be more of a mid-to-late cycle performer. In the second quarter, solid, but not spectacular, but signs of a positive turn in electronic ahead and a stable performance in mechanical.
So, basically I would like to characterize it as sort of holding the fort while the Construction & DIY segment an Industrial segment really outperformed, but I will say that even the organic growth that Security was able to achieve, while modest at 1% in the legacy Stanley Security Solutions business, was a turn from what we’ve been seeing in past quarters, so a very positive sign there. For instance, last year it was down 8% and you will recall that in the first quarter of this year it was also negative.
Little more color on Convergent, organics sales were flat and recurring monthly revenue was up 4% with flat installs. So those negative install numbers that we have been seeing have at least stabilized at flat, and now as we look ahead, we have some positive order rates, nothing to get euphoric about, but definitely positive order rates in the quarter which portend some possible growth in the coming quarters. The attrition rates in this business are easing as well from their highs, so good progress there.
On the ADT France acquisition, which John so eloquently pronounced, I will just call it SSDS. The integration is proceeding nicely, as you can see, and as expected it was dilutive to OM rate in the quarter, but I will say the cost takeouts are on track.
A social plan has been announced and is underway. It’s running at a revenue run rate of about $145 million annually, and it will be somewhere between breakeven and line average OM rate in 2011, closer to that, definitely on track with the accretion estimates that we provided last quarter.
The Mechanical business organic sales were up 1%. We had low single-digit growth in the Legacy Stanley builders’ hardware and automatic door business, where the automatic door business also benefiting from strong retrofit and repair in the phase of a very weak retail environment, retail and new construction environment. We had mild erosion in the traditional best access or otherwise known as commercial locking systems business due to the depressed commercial construction market.
So very stable and steady with some puts and takes in the various product lines within Mechanical Access Solutions. And then the new HHI business, which excludes Price Pfister in this particular segment, had some organic growth, some positive organic growth.
Also, very similar story to CDIY with some new product wins such as the Kwikset SmartKey and the Baldwin Prestige Line, which is sort of the entry level Baldwin line based up the Kwikset platform. They achieved an operating margin rate of over 14%, which was 300 basis points higher than their five year quarterly average. So a very strong performance by our colleagues at HHI.
So both of the sub segments within Security held the fort as I’ve said during the quarter given a difficult environment, and we did see some encouraging signs in certain places.
Industrial; Industrial, I characterize it as a stunningly good quarter. It far exceeded our own expectations driven by volume growth and operating leverage. The organic growth was an almost unheard of levels 30% for legacy Industrial that would be the Facom business and the hydraulics business, Mac, Proto included in that.
That was against the 36% decline organically in the second quarter of ‘09. Our new addition, the Emhart business, otherwise known as Engineered Fastening, was up a remarkable 42% on global light vehicle production increases of about 25%. With strength in North America, light vehicle production was up almost 70% there. Europe light vehicle production was fairly weak in contrast at plus 5%, Japan almost 30% up.
So they benefited from strong end markets, but they benefited from more than that as well. Strong presence in the emerging markets helped them. Also, larger cars and trucks, which take more fasteners so they had more penetration, some new products, the nameplate mix everything it seems went right for these folks in the quarter.
They contributed to substantial profit growth in this particular segment. So the segment profit rate was up 450 basis points from 9.4% last year to 13.9%. As you can see, it would have been 10.8%, excluding the Engineered Fastening addition.
So even within the core legacy Industrial, we had some substantial improvements. Facom sales were up 16; Proto, generally US revenues up 38%. A lot of this was restocking, as we’ve mentioned before, particularly in this segment but across I’d say both Construction DIY and Industrial, a lot of restocking going on here. We also had tremendous destocking in the past quarter. So I think it’s very encouraging that we’re seeing some signs of life there.
Moving on to working capital, where kind of we put it all together now instead of showing the SWK legacy separately, but it is really two different stories. The Stanley legacy working capital turns running 8.6, a new record for the Stanley legacy businesses. We have the Black & Decker legacy businesses running right around 4 turn. So blend it on a blended basis, we’re running at 5.1 turns.
What that means is, in that $1.9 billion of working capital that we ended the quarter with, about a $1.4 billion of it relates to legacy Black & Decker and about $0.5 billion relates to Stanley legacy.
So, you can see there is a big improvement opportunity related to the legacy Black & Decker by implementing the Stanley Fulfillment System. So, the key message here is that there is an opportunity ahead to generate significant cash flow benefits over the next few years by implementing the Stanley Fulfillment System across the legacy Black & Decker platform.
And then my final chart is just to reminder to everyone that, as much as we love the Tool business, especially at this stage of the cycle and especially the way it’s performing today, the company continues to have a priority to continue to diversify and grow its revenue base outside of Construction and DIY, and Industrial Tool revenue. So don’t be surprised in the next few quarters if we put our toe in the water in some of these other growth platforms with some smaller acquisitions.
It probably won’t be in Convergent Security or Mechanical Security, which are two of the five growth platforms, because both these teams are very busy right now integrating, in the case of Convergent, SSDS and in the case of Mechanical, HHI, but you might expect to see some activity in one or more of the other newer growth platforms, such as engineered fastening, infrastructure or healthcare.
You can be sure that if you see any activity in the next couple of quarters, it will be only because we feel we have both the financial capacity, and within that particular segment as well as the total company, the organizational capacity to integrate them successfully.
So, with that, I will turn it over to Don Allan.

304977,109137619,68209,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. As Jim was discussing the growth platform, clearly the company needs to continue to generate significant free cash flow for that strategy to be effective going forward, and as you can see in the second quarter, the cash flow performance wa",2328,"Thank you, Jim. As Jim was discussing the growth platform, clearly the company needs to continue to generate significant free cash flow for that strategy to be effective going forward, and as you can see in the second quarter, the cash flow performance was very strong. Free cash flow was $213 million, which is up significantly from last year as a result of the merged company and the income increased by $136 million.
One thing to keep in mind as we go through these numbers, as John mentioned earlier on, it does exclude one-time payments related to the merger costs and we did have $27 million of those payments in the second quarter, and year-to-date it is approximately $119 million.
A few other items to note here on this page, working capital you see is a slight negative in the second quarter and for year-to-date about $110 million of a negative drain on cash. We expect that to reverse itself in the back half of the year, which is typical for both legacy companies as they tend to utilize working capital in the first half of the year and then begin to improve that performance in the back half.
As we indicated in our April guidance, and we still feel it’s appropriate, we should have a likely modest improvement by the end of the year in working capital.
Another item to notice here in the other line, we do have a few unusuals in ‘09. For those of you who follows legacy Stanley, we did have a significant gain in the second quarter of last year, a non-cash gain, some extinguishment of debt of over $30 million, that’s driving a lot of that variance year-over-year.
So, as you can see, through six months, the free cash flow was $250 million. If you compare that to the history of both companies, they both tend to experience anywhere from 35% to 40% of the annualized free cash flow in the first half of the year. If you just extrapolate that mathematically, it gives you a free cash flow number somewhere between $625 million and $650 million. That’s why we believe we’re going to exceed $600 million in free cash flow for 2010.
Moving to the balance sheet on the next page, obviously, as indicated back in the first quarter, we had significant changes compared to the prior year as a result of the merger of Stanley and Black & Decker. So, you see cash increasing dramatically, and various other assets and liabilities as well, and I will walk to a little bit more detail on that later on.
I think the real takeaway here is really the continued improvement in our debt levels. Our debt went down almost $400 million from the first quarter to the second quarter, as we continue to generate strong cash flow and we had certain maturities that occurred at the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter. So, our debt-to-cap ratio went from 35% to 32%, and when you adjust it for hybrid instruments, it went from 31% to that range of 28% to 29%.
We are very close to our original year-end projections for debt-to-capital, so we feel very good that we are a few quarters ahead in that regard. As I mentioned on the previous page, continued cash flow performance will ensure that we either beat or achieve our objectives in this area.
Some of the variances are significant. Obviously, in the balance sheet as I’ve mentioned earlier, we have a significant amount of goodwill, over $5 million related to the merger and the inclusion of the working capital that Jim mentioned from Black & Decker and obviously various other assets and liabilities, which is driving the majority of that variance year-over-year. So, we feel very good where we are in our balance sheet. We are in good financial position and our debt-to-cap ratios are slightly ahead of where we’re planning.
On the next page, as we’ve done over the last few quarters, we want to get some indication around the outlook. In this particular case, the back half of 2010 by segment and some of the trends that we are seeing and the trends that we believe are going to happen over the next six months in this case.
So please start with our CDIY segment. On a pro forma basis, we do believe that we will see revenue growth in the back half of the year in low single digits. We saw significant growth, as Jim mentioned and John mentioned, in the first of the year and the second quarter in this particular segment, but we do believe there was some restocking occurring. So when you exclude that impact, we believe that this growth rate will be a reflection of what the demand that actually we experienced in the first half of the year.
Now, one of the things that is really driving growth in the end user demand is all the different things that we are doing around new products. Jim talked about the lithium ion rollout, and that we have a second half rollout as well of additional products. Many other new products are being rolled out or have been rolled out in 2010.
And then, of course, the performance in emerging markets, in particular, Latin America, as John touched on, is really helping to drive that growth. So some of the mature markets we don’t expect to grow significantly and likely could be flat in the back half of the year, but all the other areas that we’re focused on are allowing us to feel that we can achieve a low single digit growth rate in the second half.
Industrial, we believe Industrial will perform relatively well in the back of the year as it did in the second quarter. On a pro forma basis, we think high single digit revenue growth in the second half. There likely could be some continued restocking in this channel, but we don’t think it will be significant. We think a lot of that’s occurred, and something we will continue to monitor.
When you look at the Industrial Distribution businesses, both in North America and in Europe, they have been strong and that we think they will continue to be strong and it will more than offset the weakness that we are seeing in our mobile distribution market in North America.
What I am going to note in our storage business, as you see here on the page is that we have struggled a little bit with our government business. It has been soft. We do expect an improvement in that at the back half of the year, but it does hinge on the passage of a particular war spending bill that is in the Congress right now, but likely will it be approved at some point later this year.
And then we touched on the performance of light vehicle production around the world and how that’s helped our Engineered Fastening business. We don’t expect the growth rates in that area to be quite as significant. If you look at the forecast for car manufacturing production around the world, it’s relatively flat year-over-year in the second half of the year with it’s likely being somewhat of an uptick in the fourth quarter, but slightly down in the third quarter.
And then last, but certainly not least, our Security segment. Slight improvement from what we were seeing in April. We actually were anticipating slightly negative revenue performance for the year. We believe in the back half of the year now we’re going to probably emerge into either a flat or slight low single-digit growth rate as a result of the improving trend that we’re seeing in the order rates and particularly in June that Jim touched on in his discussion around the segments.
We are, obviously, continuing to see some softness in commercial construction and the market there, and many of the professionals and forecasters believe that the bottoming is not going to occur maybe too early 2011 now. The good news is, as you’ll see here in the fourth bullet is that, we continue to be very focused on other verticals such as education, government and healthcare to really ensure that we’re driving positive growth, while commercial construction continues to be soft.
So, overall, that’s kind of a sense by segment of how we think things will evolve over the remainder of the year. And as we move to the next page, the end result of that is the guidance that we provided this morning in our press release.
The first thing that I’ll point out is that the numbers that I’m going to walk though here do exclude the one-time costs related to the Black & Decker merger and the SSDS acquisition. And just as a reminder, those one-time costs for this year, the restructuring and related costs are estimated to be $245 million to $295 million.
We will have some one-time costs in SG&A and other net of approximately $120 million related to banking fees, consulting fees, et cetera, and then the non-cash accounting inventory step up charge of $170 million. That’s just to refresher for those of you who are familiar with that.
And then the other items to make note of is these numbers do not include the $0.21 second quarter tax benefit that was recorded, and John walked through a little bit detail earlier on. So, with that, we believe the earnings guidance for the year will be $3.35, $3.55. I have also indicated earlier that we expect to exceed $600 million of free cash flow.
Three significant items to point out here related to the back half of 2010. The first item is that, we think the net organic sales will increase 4% to 5% on a pro forma basis. That includes the currency effect.
If currency levels stay where they are today, we’d likely see a 1% to 2% negative currency effect on sales. So, excluding that we believe it’s 4% to 5%. Really is a reflection of the first half performance that we saw on organic pro forma basis of about 11%, and particularly in the second quarter that strong performance, if you exclude the effects of the restocking that we have estimated,, we think the end user demand in the second quarter was about 4% to 5%, and we believe that will continue into the back half of the year.
Gross margins will likely be in the range of 37% to 38%, which would be consistent with what we saw in the second quarter of 37.7%. We do believe that we will have lower anticipated inflation around the RMB revaluation, as we were expecting a possible revaluation back in April. It does not appear that that will be the case of the magnitude that we believe, (inaudible) more gradual impact over time, but the negative effect of the euro versus the US dollar will most likely offset that. So a net neutral impact from those two items.
And then last, but not least, commodity inflation. We do believe that we will have a headwind in the back half of the year from commodity inflation. Some of the major commodities that we purchase, particularly steel, if you look at the market prices at the end of June of this year versus the end of June last year, the increases are anywhere from 60% to 80% and then other commodities that we purchased, the increases are anywhere from 20% to 30%. So we will definitely experience some level of commodity inflation in the back half of the year, and as always, we will continue to be focused on productivity in our supply chain and passing on price to our customers to ensure that we minimize that impact.
A few items that are not on this page, so just as a reminder from the April guidance, no changes to some other factors; the impact of the SSDS acquisition we expect that to be relatively neutral or slightly negative from a diluted impact. The intangible amortization of Black & Decker is $55 million on an annual basis. John mentioned the cost synergy, positive impact of $90 million. Our tax rate should be between 26% and 27% for the year, excluding all the special charges.
And then there will be some other restructuring charges unrelated to the merger and ADT of about $30 million to $40 million and that’s just a reminder for everybody. The end result is that our cash EPS estimate is $5.10 to $5.30 for the year. So, clearly, we’re seeing significant cash performance when you exclude the impact of approximately $350 million of depreciation and amortization.
So to summarize our presentation this morning on the last page, the integration of Black & Decker continues to be on track. $350 million cost synergies is where we believe we are, and we’re reiterating that today and we’re beginning the process to identify their revenue synergies as John mentioned.
Working capital continues to be a focus through SFS. Now, we’re beginning to roll out the plans across the Black & Decker framework and beginning to make progress there as we move forward. The revenue performance is very encouraging in the second quarter.
The restocking impact, as you can see here, is 50% to two-thirds of our unit volume growth, but there was strong end user demand, and clearly, a successful impact of the new products that we’ve rolled out, which makes us feel good about the back half of 2010.
The operating leverage from that growth is significant and clearly, evident in our gross margin and operating margin rates. And then last but certainly not least, the solid free cash flow growth and continued improvement there will allow us to support our exceeding $600 million of free cash flow estimate for 2010.
So with that, that concludes our presentation portion of the call today.

That is the assumption per Don’s outlook for the entire businesses going forward, specifically what we do take on in terms of commodity inflation, most of which, anything that we take on from this day forward won’t hit the P&L until the fourth quarter, but anything we take on we will recover in terms of price and/or productivity, thus the assumption of maintenance of gross margin at current level.

Half to two-thirds is our best estimate. We think it was globally at least half. You know well, because you know our business well, we don’t have the robust POS data outside the US in general and then, of course, within the Industrial segment in particular.
Our sense is current inventories are above where they need to be globally, both in industrial distribution and with the large North American retailers. I think, if we had to speculate, we would say there was a little bit more restocking in industrial Europe driving that tremendous volume impact than anywhere else.
So, just simply, best estimate based on all the POS data we have, based on talking to our customers, the restocking was a little higher in industrial Europe, it was meaningful in the North American big box, but inventories are not out of line, and a little less everywhere else. I think that’s the best we can do. Jim may want to add a little more clarity to that.

The European Power Tools sales were up 12%; any Power Tool information here will be pro forma as well. Hand Tools were also up 12%, so Europe up 12%. You’ll be pretty sure that that was not all sell-through.
Latin America was up 36% in power tools, 27% in Hand Tools. Despite the strength of that economy again, I think you could be pretty sure that some of that was restocking. Canada up 37% in Power Tools, up 26% in Hand Tools and Asia up 24% in Power Tools, and up 9% in Hand Tools. So what you have here is a tremendous surge of a volume outside of the US where we don’t have really great data, but you could look at the numbers and you could be pretty confident that there is a pretty substantial element of restocking in CDIY.
The key here is that US in CDIY was only up, only modestly positive, really very close to flat, a couple of points up, in both Power Tools and Hand Tools. So you can see that what you have with the US retailers is, as you know, their performance is kind of flattish from a sell-through basis in the last quarter.
So I’m guessing that a lot of the European and other non-American volume growth in CDIY was inventory restocking. When you get to Industrial, Emhart is not going to have a tremendous amount of inventory restocking, but the legacy Industrial, as John pointed out, both in Europe and in North America is largely a distribution oriented channel and with their kind of 30% organic growth, you can be sure that a substantial portion of that was restocking.

What really drove the Emhart lift was light vehicle production, as Jim Loree went through with a lot of granularity. I think Jim that’s had a lift on all of our industrial and automotive repair aftermarket businesses.
Our sense is, yes, there was a lot of restocking because distributors both in the industrial side for Proto and on the automotive repair side for Facom, I think they actually accepted opportunity lost or loss volume rather than be carrying excess inventory. At least, there is a cautious optimism that allowed them to restock. We’ve talked on earlier quarters, which came first, the chicken or the egg? You can’t have the POS or the sell-through, if there is no inventory at distribution.
So the only other point I would make other than just a general broad scale lift is the European industrial production numbers thus far are better than what we are experiencing in terms of POS. So, I guess there is some cautious optimism there, that’s what attributed to the restocking, and ultimately, will attribute to some sell-through on the European industrial side.

The difference being legacy Stanley spend a lot of cash to do that, downsized our infrastructure to be profitable at 75% to 80% of its historic size, given the market-driven volume declines that you cited.
So, you saw a third, fourth and first quarters for legacy Stanley, record gross margins, because the cost structure had been reduced so dramatically. Black & Decker reduced costs dramatically as well. It was a slightly different approach, where on the one hand they spent a lot less to do it, on the second hand there were temporary cut backs in salaries, benefits, discretionary spending. Some of that will come back, but not all of it.
So both companies took $200 million to $300 million worth of cost out of their base. It’s still out of the base. Some of it will come back marginally as volumes increase. That’s why we’re so encouraged that we could get the margin achievement we did at current volume levels, and we’d like think we’ve got some upside leverage as volumes rebound for all the reasons you stated.

It’s a question of the integrity of our balance sheet, the ability to fund it.
Remember, we’ve got $1.5 billion in cash on our balance sheet, $1 billion of which is outside the US and to the extent the growth platforms that Jim talked about infrastructure, healthcare and engineered fastening, there is very, very little integration going on in those three areas. So to the extent, if we were to add to those platforms, the integration of those acquisitions to the extent it would be required would be done by completely different people, totally capable teams that have done it before. Jim made the point very clearly.
Obviously, it needs to clear financial hurdles and it needs to be a great opportunities strategically and economically, but nor would we even contemplate pushing the button on an acquisition if we didn’t believe we have the organizational capacity to absorb it.
That would mean it comes with a really, really good management team that would require less integration or even a reverse integration or it was something, for instance, within the healthcare infrastructure or Engineered Fastening business, where we have very capable management team, particularly within Engineered Fastening, that’s simply essentially a standalone business other than from embedding SFS not involved in a lot of the merger related synergy activity.

I would argue that from a revenue diversification standpoint that we’re far better off right now getting going on building these significant growth platforms outside of CDIY and Industrial, so that when the time comes, just like the time came last time, that the revenues plunge, we have something to buttress up the portfolio then and that’s the thinking and we get paid to manage risk and that’s our measured view.

It’s a very strong business that’s mixed down a little bit due to the integration and an acquisition and we expect it to be right back at historic levels in the not too distant future.

The math is simple, when installation as a percent of total is down, margins and mix improved positively. We’ve said previously on these calls, we obviously need the installations to generate the future RMR.
What we were pleased with was the fact that attrition, which was running a little ahead of historical levels, in fact, declined sequentially, which is a good thing. We continue to gain share at national accounts, where we really believe we have a competitive advantage over almost anyone out there.
So the ongoing RMR from national account share gains and the slight decline in attrition actually helped our margins and gave us, I’ll say, a cautious optimism going forward. At the end of the day a little bit more installation and we actually implemented I think some fairly creative programs to ensure that we maintain, if not increase, our installed base to fuel or prime the pump for the future, RMR is tactical more than strategic, but important part of how we will operate going forward.

Revenues on a pro forma bas",1954,"Thanks, Kate, and good morning, everybody. Let me first just touch on some second quarter highlights, a quarter that we were quite pleased with our performance in general, as well as where we see the business going from here. 
Revenues on a pro forma basis increased 13% to $2.4 billion, and I'm going to give you a breakdown by geography and source in just a minute. Jim Loree, when he reviews the segments, will give you even a little more granularity within the segments as to what we feel some of the indicators are.
Our second quarter diluted EPS is $1.24, excluding the one-time charges related primarily to the Black & Decker merger. The details of the special charges, which totaled $229 million are included on Page 4 of our press release. I think we've provided quite a bit of granularity there, and we don't intend to spend much time on this morning's call. And it is there clearly delineated in the press release. That does include a $36 million benefit, the $1.24, or $0.21 a share attributable to favorable settlement of tax contingencies associated with the resolution of Black & Decker income tax audits from prior years.
On a GAAP basis, $0.28 diluted EPS, including all the one-time charges, $213 million of free cash flow, excluding the one-time payments. And again, that's $27 million detailed in the press release. So Legacy Stanley reached a record 8.6 working capital turns, and it's nothing else, it's indication that SFS, the Stanley Fulfillment System, is alive and well in the Legacy business. And you'll hear later that we are very rapidly expanding the Stanley Fulfillment System across a larger base since it's beginning to gain traction.
The integration is proceeding quite smoothly, but our focus in the second half will be on the launch of SFS across a larger framework, as well as the beginning of the formulation of some revenue synergy plans. Our CDIY segment, which is now the largest segment in the business, profitability improved 430 basis points to 15.6%, again, excluding the CDIY portion of the one-time charges that I alluded to earlier. And the smaller but still very important integration of Stanley Solutions de Sècuritè, or SSDS, the former ADT France business, is also progressing quite well. Margins improved significantly versus the prior year, and it's an important strategic add-on to our Continental European Convergent Security business. 
Don is going to talk a little bit more about full year guidance. But excluding one-time charges, we've increased it to $3.56 to $3.76, in that range, or $3.35 to $3.55 if we exclude the $0.21 tax-related benefit that we realized in the second quarter. So the bottom end of our guidance now exceeds the top end of the range previously presented in April, and Don will talk a little bit more about that and the underlying assumptions toward the end of our presentations. And lastly, our free cash flow guidance for the year where previously we said it would approximate $600 million, we're thinking and guiding to the fact that it will exceed $600 million for the year.  
Moving on, just a snapshot of essentially the earnings picture. $0.89 same-period year ago on our share base of roughly 79.7 million. And looking forward to 2010, shares due to the merger, the average share count for the quarter of 166.1 million. You'll see $0.28 on a GAAP basis, $1.03 without the one-time charges, but excluding the benefit, the $36 million benefit or $0.21 a share impact of the tax settlement, which would take it to $1.24. 
I think of equal or greater importance, that's obviously shown in the tax rate, the ongoing or normalized tax rate would've been 28% without that benefit. And I think that helps you in terms of your modeling. Without the charges, operating margin increased to 13.7%, very healthy performance across all three segments, and Jim Loree is going to give you a more little granularity on the segments in just a minute.
Looking at worldwide revenues. We'll go around the world very quickly, starting with our largest market on the left, in the U.S. Revenues grew 6%, and U.S. continues to represent 56% of Stanley Black & Decker's global revenues. Canada grew nicely, 28%, that represents about 7% of global revenues. Very strong growth in Latin America. Mexico, we recognize it as part of North America, but we report it in our Latin America and manage it as part of our Latin American business, grew 39% and represents 7% of our total.
Europe, driven by strong industrial growth, showed 17% revenue growth, it's 24% of our total; and good performance in Asia, primarily Mainland China; Southeast Asia, represents 4% of our total, grew 35%; and Australia, an important market, albeit a small one for both Legacy Stanley and Legacy Black & Decker, represents 2% of our total, but we have a nice lift of 11%. 
So merging markets are clearly showing the strongest recovery and the strongest performance. In a geographical range where revenues grew from as little as 6% to as much as 39%, getting us to the 13% total that I spoke about earlier.
Looking at the sources of those growth. 9% organic growth, which we can compare both sequentially and looking a little bit by business. Volume, as I mentioned earlier, accounted for 9% of that growth. There was no impact of price globally, so organic growth of 9% from volume. We lost a percentage point due to currency. And then if we isolate the impact of Black & Decker, this is the first quarter were we had a full three months of Black & Decker in the GAAP results, plus the benefit of the French Convergent Security business, 149% for the total of 157%. 
If you look at that compared to the 38% sequentially in the first quarter, remember that both the ADT France business and the Black & Decker business were only part of the combined total for about three weeks in the first quarter. If you look at our segments, CDIY volume grew 6%, driven by Power Tools. Worldwide Power Tools grew 10%, which is a very strong performance in that business. Industrial volumes across the globe grew 30%. Engineered Fastening, essentially the Emhart business, plus the former Stanley Assembly Technologies business grew 44%. Security on a volume basis was flat, with some puts and takes that Jim is going to give you a little more granularity on. The Legacy Black & Decker Hardware and Home Improvement business, excluding the Price Pfister business, grew 3%; and for a total of 12%, as you can see it. 
So a lot of restocking. We talked about it in our press release. Don will address it to the extent appropriate in his comments. But we also saw a nice uptick in demand, which ultimately resulted in some tremendous volume leverage that showed up both on the top line and in our margins.
The integration remains, first and foremost, something we're all spending a lot of time on. Probably the highest priority item in addition to protecting our core business remains the cost synergy targets. We feel very good about what they are. We're continuing to guide that $90 million of cost synergies will be realized in our P&L in 2010, and we remain on track for $350 million of annual cost synergy realization by year three, which is where we have been essentially since the announcement of this deal and as we've both looked at this top down, bottom up with various puts and takes.
Rigorous tracking is in place with weekly meetings and conversations with the Integration Management Office and the Steering Committee. Monthly rhythms  are established now to both track actuals and flag any issues early to put them on a corrective path at the specific program is falling behind. And we've had a lot of outside help in pulling this together and getting it started, that will end in mid-August. And I'm confident that we're ready to pass that baton and take the process over 100% internally. We've done this before, and we believe that we're in very good shape in that end.
The focus has moved from planning to execution. We've stabilized the organization and we've certainly executed well in the first full quarter that we've been able to track. The actuals that are included within the $90 million are on or slightly ahead of plan, so a good start. We've streamlined the integration teams. As I've talked about previously, the integration teams historically consisted of one Legacy Stanley manager, one Legacy Black & Decker manager and a third-party subject matter expert. We're now able to deploy some of the internal executives back to the businesses, so we have a total going forward for the rest of the year of about 16 people as opposed to 40 working full time on the integration. 
Of those 16, just an interesting point of reference, nine are Legacy Stanley Executives, seven are Legacy Black & Decker Executives. And Brett Bontrager and the Integration Management Office continues to do an extraordinary job of keeping this on track and keeping everyone informed. Management teams, particularly Jim Loree, Don Allan, myself, as well as our business leaders, have traveled essentially to every large facility around the world, having that thousands of employees and try to get everyone on the same page. And we feel really good about the way these two organizations are coming together.
I think of equal, or perhaps greater importance going forward is we've started the process to identify revenue synergy opportunities. The focus of course is on high-priority opportunities that we have a high likelihood to achieve at a reasonable cost. We're developing the plans. We're hiring people if necessary to execute against those synergies. They'll be included within the businesses, and the businesses will be held accountable for achieving them. And we'll have a lot more granularity on our October call as it relates to the magnitude of those synergies, which is what we've said all along, we want to ensure that our cost synergies are in the bank. We've protected the core and then we'll start to develop, execute staff and fund our highest priority revenue synergies.
Last, but certainly not the least, the rollout of the Stanley Fulfillment System across the larger base is in process. We have established clear understanding of what the goals are, what are the principles, what are processes, as well as some working capital fundamentals, guidelines and targets across the entire system, providing the tools, the processes to develop a game plan to achieve the working capital targets, which is obviously a tremendous source of cash generation, has been in the past and continues to be in the future as we combine these organizations with very similar supply chains. And we're providing the method, the tools and the know-how to enable the businesses to engage associates quickly at the point of impact. 
What I will say as we've visited and spent time with the management teams around the world, we clearly are gaining traction with Legacy Stanley businesses that have been historically below line average, as well as the new businesses that have become part of the combined enterprise. We're sharing best practices that have been developed elsewhere across the system, and we're already seeing sequential improvement, second quarter versus first quarter.
Let me turn it over now to Jim Loree, who's going to take you into a little more detail on the specific segment performance. Then turn it over to Don Allan, who's going to talk about our balance sheet, that's in good shape, as well as provide an outlook for the rest of the year."
304977,109137619,68269,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thank you, John. Let's start with Construction and DIY. There are four parts of this great story. The first one is resumption of modest end-market demand along with some inventory corrections that led to organic growth in both the Legacy CDIY and th",1797,"Okay. Thank you, John. Let's start with Construction and DIY. There are four parts of this great story. The first one is resumption of modest end-market demand along with some inventory corrections that led to organic growth in both the Legacy CDIY and the worldwide Power Tools and Accessories business from Legacy Black & Decker. 
As you can see, our CDIY Hand Tool business was up 5%, the Power Tool business was up 8% organically. And while to some, they may not seem like very significant numbers, they are, in the context of several quarters, if not over a year, of negative organic growth in both segments, including minus 2% most recently in Legacy CDIY in the first quarter, the Power Tools and Accessories business actually continued a strong performance sequentially from the first quarter organically. And so we have both of that going on. At the same time, we have growing momentum in new product development and introduction, both in Power Tools and Hand Tools. 
In hand tools, the Bostitch hand tool launch has been very successful, more successful even than the FatMax extreme launch that we had a few years ago. And then within Professional Power Tools, the compact cordless lithium ion, product revenues were substantial in terms of growth, and we have another wave of lithium ion product introductions coming in the third and fourth quarter. So very exciting progress, a little bit of catch-up over the past few years, but we're confident that these introductions will be very successful.
And then within the Consumer Products Group, have some improvements in the Tradesman product line but substantial progress in the outdoor portfolio, driven by a new 24-volt string trimmer and a 36-volt lawnmower, which in particular, the string trimmer have been very successful from a quantity perspective, and both have been readily accepted by the marketplace. 
So second element of the story, growing new product momentum. And then we move to all of this with a backdrop of a vastly more efficient cost structure. Both companies, as you know, took out substantial cost before the merger. And now we have the beginnings of merger synergy realization beginning to occur, and we'll gain momentum as we go forward, and so that enables us. 
The fourth part of the story, which is strong operating leverage, and that's exactly what we saw here. The Hand Tools business ran an operating margin rate close to 17%, very, very near its peak of 17.6% in the third quarter of '06. And the Power Tools business on a pro forma basis ran an operating margin of 14.4%, which was very close to its peak back in the second quarter of '06. So essentially, what you have is both Hand Tools and Power Tools performing right about at their historic high operating margin percent rates that were achieved at the top of the cycle while still very early in the cycle. So very exciting story. 
And as John mentioned, we're very pleased with the stability of the management structure that we have in CDIY and that the way they're operating across geographies, across businesses and across functions, led by Jeff Ansell, a veteran Legacy SWK, a proven performer. He has a staff of regional business heads and functional leaders that really achieved some nice blend from both companies and the best of the best on the team now. And I think that we can attribute a lot of this performance to the hard work of that team. 
Moving on to Security. Well, this is the segment that really butchers Stanley, its results during the steep Construction and DIY and Industrial downturn over the past few years. And it tends to be more of a mid- to late-cycle performer. In the second quarter, solid but not spectacular. But signs of a possible turn in electronic ahead and a stable performance in mechanical. So basically I like to characterize it as sort of holding the fort while the Construction and DIY segment and Industrial segment really outperformed. But I will say that even the organic growth that Security was able to achieve while modest at 1% in the Legacy Stanley Security Solutions business was a turn from what we've been seeing in past quarters, so a very positive sign there. For instance, last year, it was down 8%, and you'll recall that in the first quarter of this year, it was also negative. 
A little more color on Convergent. Organic sales were flat and recurring monthly revenue was up 4% with flat installs. So those negative install numbers that we've been seeing have at least stabilized at flat. And now as we look ahead, we have some positive order rates, nothing to get euphoric about, but definitely positive order rates in the quarter, which portends some possible growth in the coming quarters, and the attrition rates in this business are easing as well from their high. So good progress there.
On the ADT France acquisition, which John so eloquently pronounced, I'll just call it SSDS, the integration is proceeding nicely. As you can see and as expected, it was dilutive to OM rate in the quarter. But I will say the cost takeouts are on track. The social plan has been announced and is under way. It's running at a revenue run rate of about $145 million annually, and it will be somewhere between breakeven and line average OM rate in 2011 closer to that, definitely on track with the accretion estimates that we've provided last quarter.
The Mechanical business organic sales were up 1%. We had low-single-digit growth in the Legacy Stanley Builders Hardware and Automatic Door businesses, with the Automatic Door business also benefiting from strong retrofit and repair in the face of a very weak retail environment, retail new construction environment, and we had mild erosion in the traditional Best Access or otherwise known as Commercial Locking Systems business, due to the depressed commercial construction market. So a very stable and steady with some puts and takes in the various product lines within the Mechanical Access Solutions. And then the new HHI business, which excludes Price Pfister in this particular segment, had some organic growth, some positive organic growth. Also, a very similar story to CDIY with some new product wins such as the Kwikset SmartKey and the Baldwin Prestige line, which is sort of the entry-level Baldwin line based on the Kwikset platform. They achieved an operating margin rate of over 14%, which was 300 basis points higher than their five-year quarterly average. So a very strong performance by our colleagues at HHI. So both of the sub-segments within Security held the floor, as I've said, during the quarter given the difficult environment, and we did see some encouraging signs in certain places.
Industrial. Industrial, I characterize it as a stunningly good quarter, far exceeded our own expectations driven by volume growth and operating leverage. The organic growth was in almost unheard of levels, 30% for Legacy Industrial, that would be the FACOM business and the Hydraulics business, Mac, Proto included in that. That was against the 36% decline organically in the second quarter of '09. 
And our new addition, the Emhart business, otherwise known as Engineered Fastening, was up a remarkable 42% on a global light vehicle production increases of about 25%. With strength in North America, light vehicle production was up almost 70% there. 
Europe, light vehicle production was fairly weak in contrast, at plus 5% in Japan, almost 13% up. So they benefited from strong end markets but they benefited from more than that as well. Strong presence in the emerging markets helped them; also larger cars and trucks, which take more fasteners, so they had more penetration; some new products, name plate mix. Everything seems went right for these folks in the quarter, and they contributed to substantial profit growth in this particular segment. And so the segment profit rate was up 450 basis points from 9.4% last year to 13.9%. As you can see, it would've been 10.8% excluding the engineered fastening additions. 
So even within the core Legacy Industrial, we had some substantial improvement. FACOM sales were up 16%; Proto, generally U.S. revenue is up 38%. A lot of this was restocking, as we've mentioned before, particularly in this segment but across, I'd say, both Construction/DIY and Industrial, a lot of restocking going on here. But we also had tremendous destocking in past quarters. So I think it's very encouraging that we're seeing some signs of life there.
Moving on to working capital. We're, kind of, if we put it all together now instead of showing the SWK Legacy separately, but it is really a two different stories. The Stanley Legacy working capital turns running at 8.6, a new record for the Stanley Legacy businesses. And we have the Black & Decker Legacy businesses running right around four turns. So on a blended basis, we're running at 5.1 turns. And what that means is in that $1.9 billion of working capital that we ended the quarter with, about $1.4 billion of it relates to Legacy Black & Decker and about $0.5 billion relates to Stanley Legacy. So you can see that there's a big improvement opportunity related to the Legacy Black & Decker by implementing the Stanley Fulfillment System. So the key message here is there is an opportunity ahead to generate significant cash flow benefits over the next few years by implementing the Stanley Fulfillment System across the Legacy Black & Decker platform.
And then my final chart. Just a reminder to everyone that as much as we love the Tool business, especially at this stage of the cycle and especially the way it's performing today, the company continues to have a priority to continue to diversify and grow its revenue base outside of Construction/DIY and Industrial Tool revenue. So don't be surprise in the next few quarters if we put our toe in the water and some of these other growth platforms with some smaller acquisitions. It probably won't be in Convergent Security or Mechanical Security, which are two of the five growth platforms, because both these teams are very busy right now integrating. In the case of Convergent, SSDS; and in the case of Mechanical, HHI. But you might expect to see some activity in one or more of the other newer growth platforms such as Engineered Fastening, Infrastructure or Healthcare. And you can be sure that if you see any activity in the next couple of quarters, it will be only because we feel we have both the financial capacity and within that particular segment, as well as the total company, the organizational capacity to integrate them successfully.
So with that, I will turn it over to Don Allan."
304977,109137619,68269,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. As Jim was discussing the growth platform, clearly, the company needs to continue to generate significant free cash flow for that strategy to be effective going forward. And as you can see in the second quarter, the cash flow performance w",2336,"Thank you, Jim. As Jim was discussing the growth platform, clearly, the company needs to continue to generate significant free cash flow for that strategy to be effective going forward. And as you can see in the second quarter, the cash flow performance was very strong. Free cash flow was $213 million, which is up significantly from last year, as a result of the merged company and the income increased by $136 million. One thing to keep in mind as we go through these numbers, as John mentioned early on, it does exclude one-time payments related to the merger costs. And we did have $27 million of those payments in the second quarter, and year-to-date, it's approximately $119 million.
A few other items to note here on this page, working capital, you see as a slight negative in the second quarter and for year-to-date about $110 million of a negative drain on cash. We expect that to reverse itself in the back half of the year, which is typical for both legacy companies, as they tend to utilize working capital in the first half of the year and then begin to improve that performance in the back half. And as we indicated in our April guidance, and we still feel it's appropriate, we should have a likely modest improvement by the end of the year in working capital.
Another item to note here and the underlying, we do have a few unusuals in '09. For those of you who followed Legacy Stanley, we did have a significant gain in the second quarter of last year, a non-cash gain of some extinguishment of debt of over $30 million, that's driving a lot of that variance year-over-year. 
So as you can see through six months, the free cash flow was $250 million. If you compare that to the history of both companies, they both tend to experience anywhere from 35% to 40% of the annualized free cash flow on the first half of the year. If you just extrapolate that mathematically, it gives you a free cash flow number somewhere between $625 million and $650 million. That's why we believe we are going to exceed $600 million in free cash flow for 2010.
Moving to the balance sheet on the next page. Obviously, as I indicated it back in the first quarter, we have significant changes as compared to the prior year as a result of the merger of Stanley and Black & Decker. So you see cash increasing dramatically and various other assets and liabilities as well. And I'll walk through a little bit more detail of that later on. But I think the real takeaway here is really the continued improvement in our debt levels, our debt went down almost $400 million from the first quarter to the second quarter, as we continue to generate strong cash flow and we had certain maturities that occurred at the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter. And so our debt-to-cap ratio went from 35% to 32%. And when you adjust it for our hybrid instruments, it went from 31% to that range of 28% to 29%. 
We're very close to our original year-end projections for debt-to-capital, so we feel very good that we're a few quarters ahead in that regard. And as I mentioned in the previous page, continued cash flow performance will make sure that we ensure that we either beat or achieve our objective in this area.
Some other variance are significant obviously in the balance sheet, as I mentioned earlier, we have a significant amount of goodwill, over $5 million related to the merger and the inclusion of the working capital that Jim mentioned from Black & Decker, and obviously, various other assets and liabilities that's driving the majority of that variance year-over-year. So we feel very good at where we are in our balance sheet, and we're in a good financial position and our debt-to-cap ratios are slightly ahead of where we were planning.
On the next page. As we've done over the last few quarters, we want to give some indication around the outlook. In this particular case, the back half of 2010 by segment and some of the trends that we're seeing and the trends that we believe are going to happen over the next six months in this case. 
So if we start with our CDIY segment. On a pro forma basis, we do believe that we will see revenue growth in the back half of the year in low-single digits. And we saw significant growth, as Jim mentioned and John mentioned in the first half of the year and in the second quarter in this particular segment. But we do believe there was some restocking occurring. And so when you exclude that impact, we believe this growth rate will be a reflection of what the demand that actually we experienced in the first half of the year.
Now one of the things that is really driving growth in the end-user demand is all the different things that we're doing around new products. Jim talked about the lithium ion rollout, and then we have a second half rollout as well of additional products. Many other new products are being rolled out or have been rolled out in 2010. And then of course, the performance in emerging markets, in particular, Latin America, as John touched on, is really helping to drive that growth. So some of the mature markets, we don't expect to grow significantly and likely it could be flat in the back half of the year. But all these other areas that we're focused on are allowing us to feel that we can achieve a low-single-digit growth rate in the second half.
Industrial, we believe Industrial will perform relatively well in the back half of the year, as it did in the second quarter. On a pro forma basis, we think high-single-digit revenue growth in the second half. There likely could be some continued restocking in this channel, but we don't think it will be significantly, we think a lot of that has occurred. But it's something we will continue to monitor. When you look at the Industrial Distribution businesses, both in North America and in Europe, they have been strong, and then we think they will continue to be strong, and it will more than offset the weakness that we're seeing in our mobile distribution market in North America. 
I want to end a note in our Storage business. As you see here on the page is that, we have struggled a little bit with our Government business, it has been soft. We do expect an improvement on that in the back half of the year. But it does hinge on the passage of a particular war spending bill that is in Congress right now. But likely, it will be approved at some point later this year.
And then we touched on the performance of light vehicle production around the world and how that's helped our Engineered Fastening business. We don't expect the growth rates in that area to be quite as significant. If you look at the forecast for car manufacturing production around the world, it's relatively flat year-over-year in the second half of the year, with it likely being somewhat of an uptick in the fourth quarter but slightly down in the third quarter. 
And then last, but certainly not the least, our Security segment. A slight improvement from what we're seeing in April. We actually were anticipating slightly negative revenue performance for the year. We believe in the back half of the year now, we're going to probably emerge into either flat or slight low-single-digit growth rate, as a result of the improving trend that we're seeing in the order rates, in particular in June, that Jim touched on in his discussion around the segments. We are obviously continuing to see some softness in commercial construction and the market there. And many of the professionals and forecasters believe that the bottoming is not going to occur maybe till early 2011 now. But the good news is you'll see here in the fourth pole is that we continue to be very focused on other verticals such as education, government and healthcare to really ensure that we're driving positive growth, while commercial construction continues to be soft.
So overall, that's kind of a sense by segment of how we think things will evolve over the remainder of the year. And as we move to the next page, the end result of that is the guidance that we provided this morning in our press release. The first thing that I'll point out is that the numbers that I'm going to walk through here do exclude the one-time costs related to the Black & Decker merger and the SSDS acquisition. And as a reminder, those one-time costs for this year for restructuring and related costs are estimated to be $245 million to $295 million. We will have some one-time costs in SG&A and other net of approximately $120 million related to banking fees, consulting fees, et cetera. And then the non-cash accounting inventory step-up charge of $170 million. And that's just the refresher for those of you who are familiar with that. And then the other items I'll make note is that these numbers do not include the $0.21 second quarter tax benefit that was recorded and that John walk through a little bit detail earlier on.
So with that, we believe the earnings guidance for the year will be $3.35 to $3.55. I've also indicated earlier that we expect to exceed $600 million of free cash flow. And three significant items to point out here related to the back half of 2010. The first item is that we think the net organic sales will increase 4% to 5% on a pro forma basis, that includes the currency effect. If currency levels stay where they are today, we'd likely see a 1% to 2% negative currency effect on sales. So excluding that, we believe it's 4% to 5%. And really, it's a reflection of the first half performance that we saw on an organic pro forma basis of about 11%. And in particular, in the second quarter, that strong performance, if you exclude the effects of the restocking that we've estimated, we think the end-user demand in the second quarter was about 4% to 5%. And we believe that will continue into the back half of the year.
Gross margins will likely be in the range of 37% to 38%, which would be consistent with what we saw in the second quarter of 37.7%. We do believe that we will have lower anticipated inflation around the RMB revaluation as we are expecting a possible revaluation back in April. It does not appear that, that will be the case of the magnitude that we believe, it is more gradual impact over time. But the negative effect of the euro versus the U.S. dollar will most likely offset that. So a net neutral impact from those two items.
And then last but not the least, commodity inflation. We do believe that we will have a headwind in the back half of the year from commodity inflation. But some of the major commodities that we purchased, particularly steel, if you look at the market prices at the end of June of this year versus the end of June last year, the increase is anywhere from 60% to 80%. And then other commodities that we've purchased, an increase of anywhere from 20% to 30%. So we will definitely experience some level of commodity inflation in the back half of the year. And as always, we'll continue to be focused on productivity in our supply chain and passing on price to our customers to ensure that we minimize that impact.
Two items that are not on this page, but just as reminders from the April guidance, no changes to some other factors: the impact of the SSDS acquisition, we expect that to be relatively neutral or slightly negative from a diluted impact; the intangible amortization of Black & Decker's $55 million on an annual basis. John mentioned the cost synergy, positive impact of $90 million. Our tax rate should be between 26% and 27% for the year, excluding all the special charges. And then there will be some other restructuring charges unrelated to the merger in ADT of about $30 million to $40 million, and that's just a reminder for everybody. 
The end result is that our cash EPS estimate is $5.10 to $5.30 for the year. So clearly, we're seeing significant cash performance when you exclude the impact of approximately $350 million of depreciation and amortization.
So to summarize our presentation this morning on the last page, the integration of Black & Decker continues to be on track. $350 million across synergies is where we believe we are, and we are reiterating that today. And we're beginning the process to identify their revenue synergies, as John mentioned. Working capital continues to be a focus through SFS. Now we're beginning to roll out the plans across the Black & Decker framework and begin to make progress there as we move forward. 
The revenue performance is very encouraging in the second quarter. And the restocking impact, as you can see here, is 50% to 2/3 of our unit volume growth. But there was strong end-user demand and clearly a successful impact of the new products that we've rolled out, which makes us feel good about the back half of 2010. The operating leverage from that growth is significant and clearly evident in our gross margin and operating margin rates. 
And then last but certainly not least, the solid free cash flow growth and continued improvement there allows us to support our exceeding $600 million of free cash flow estimate for 2010.  So with that, that concludes our presentation portion of the call today."

You know well because you know our business well, we don't have the robust POS data in outside the U.S. in general, and then, of course, within the Industrial segment in particular. Our sense is current inventories are above where they need to be globally, both in industrial distribution and with the large North American retailers. I think if we had to speculate, we'd say there was a little bit more restocking in Industrial Europe driving that tremendous volume impact than anywhere else. So just simply, best estimate based on all the POS data we have, based on talking to our customers, the restocking was a little higher in industrial Europe. It was meaningful in the North American big box, but inventories are not out of line and a little less everywhere else. I think that's the best we can do. Jim, you want to add much more granularity to that?"

The European Power Tools sales were up 12%, and that any Power Tool information here'll be pro forma as well. Hand Tools were also up 12%, so Europe, up 12%. We're pretty sure that, that was not all sell-through. Latin America was up 36% in Power Tools, 27% in Hand Tools. Despite the strength of that economy, again, I think you could be pretty sure that some of that was restocking. Canada, up 37% in Power Tools, up 26% in Hand Tools; and Asia up 24% in Power Tools and up 9% in Hand Tools. So what you have here is a tremendous surge of volume outside of the U.S., where we don't have really great data. But you can look at the numbers and you could be pretty confident that there's a pretty substantial element of restocking in CDIY. And the key here is that the U.S., in CDIY, was only up, only modestly positive, really very close to flat, couple of points up, and so in both Power Tools and Hand Tools. So you can see that what you have with the U.S. retailers, as you know, their performance is kind of flattish from a sell-through basis in the last quarter. So I'm guessing that a lot of the European and other non-American volume growth in CDIY was inventory restocking. When you get to Industrial, Emhart is not going to have a tremendous amount of inventory restocking. But the legacy Industrial, as John pointed out, both in Europe and in North America, is largely a distribution-oriented channel. And with their kind of 30% organic growth, you can be sure that a substantial portion of that was restocking."

What really drove the Emhart lift was light vehicle production, as Jim went through with a lot of granularity. I think, Jim, that's had lift on all of our Industrial and Automotive Repair Aftermarket businesses. Our sense is, yes, there was a lot of restocking because distributors, both in the industrial side for Proto and on the automotive repair side for FACOM, I think they actually accepted opportunity lost or lost volume rather than be carrying excess inventory. At least, there's a cautious optimism that allowed them to restock. And we've talked on earlier quarters, which came first the chicken or the egg? You can't have the POS or the sell-through if there is no inventory at distribution. So the only other point I would make other than just a general broadscale lift is, the European industrial production numbers thus far are better than what we're experiencing in terms of POS. So we've got, I guess, there's some cautious optimism there. That's what attributed to the restocking and ultimately will attribute to some sell-through on the European industrial side."

So you saw a third, fourth and first quarters for legacy Stanley, record gross margins because the cost structure had been reduced so dramatically. Black & Decker reduced cost dramatically as well. It was a slightly different approach where on the one hand, they spend a lot less to do it. On the second hand, they were temporary cutbacks in salaries, benefits, discretionary spending. Some of that will come back, but not all of it. So both companies took $200 million to $300 million worth of cost out of their base. It's still out of the base.

And our firm belief is we wouldn't go forward with it if we thought it's going to be -- jim made the point very clearly. Obviously, it needs to clear financial hurdles, and it needs to be a great opportunity strategically and economically. But nor would we even contemplate pushing the button on an acquisition if we didn't believe we have the organizational capacity to absorb it.

It's a very strong business that's mixed down a little bit due to the integration and an acquisition, and we expect it to be right back at historic levels in the not-too-distant future."

But as we've said previously on this call, we obviously need the installations to generate the future RMR. What we were pleased with was the fact that attrition, which was running a little ahead of historical levels, in fact, declined sequentially, which is a good thing. And we continue to gain share at national accounts where we really believe we have a competitive advantage over almost anyone out there. So the ongoing RMR from national account share gains and the slight decline in attrition actually helped our margins and gave us, I'll say, cautious optimism going forward. The end of the day, a little bit more installation, and we've actually implemented, I think, some fairly creative programs to ensure that we maintain, if not increase, our installed base to fuel our prime the pump for the future RMR is an important part of our -- it's tactical more than strategic, but important part of how we will operate going forward."

As Kate said, our press release was up this morning and the headlines or highlights that you should have taken away are that some good solid organic growth is resumed and our integration process is exceeding quit",1624,"Thanks, Kate, and good morning, everybody. As Kate said, our press release was up this morning and the headlines or highlights that you should have taken away are that some good solid organic growth is resumed and our integration process is exceeding quite well and perhaps ahead of expectations.
We reported pro forma revenues of increase of 11% to $2.4 billion. Organic revenues up 8% as the legacy Stanley and legacy Black & Decker businesses grew 7% and 9% respectively. $0.97 diluted EPS excluding the charges or $0.73 GAAP earnings including the charges, strong free cash flow, $234 million that excludes one-time payments of the $81 million as outlined in our press release.
The CDIY segment grew, organic revenues were up 7%, and there was quite a lot of successful new product activity that Jim Loree is going to highlight for you in a few minutes. We saw top line growth in Convergent albeit a modest 1%. Order trends are increasing and our French security business, SSDS, Stanley Solutions de Sècuritè, formerly the ADT France business turned profitable during the quarter.
That is extremely noteworthy that six months to nine months earlier than our projections and remember this is a business that was losing up to $15 million a year for the last two years. Bernard Richerme and his team in France and in Europe is doing a really good job putting those two businesses together and turning them profitable well ahead of schedule.
The customer restocking moderated within the Industrial segment, and end user demand did remain strong. Our full year guidance, excluding one-time charges, we increased our range to $381 million to $391 million, and it’s $360 million to $370 million if we exclude the $0.21 second quarter 2010 tax related benefit that we achieved. Strong free cash flow has led us to increase our free cash flow guidance for the year.
Now we expect to exceed $700 million, where previously we thought that $600 million or slightly above $600 million was a more appropriate target, and last but not least, our cost synergy estimate for 2010 has increased to $125 million as the integration progress remains ahead of plan.
Now, you’re going to see the impact of the increase from $90 million to $125 million in Don’s outlook in a few minutes, but essentially we’ve taken the third quarter performance, which was driven by improved volume and synergy achievement, and rolled it into the annual guidance in conjunction with a slight improvement in fourth quarter outlook driven primarily by the improved synergy realization and we’ve rolled that into our annual guidance as well.
Looking quickly around the globe, we saw organic revenue growth in every geographic market. If we look at our large two established markets middle left the U.S. which represents 56% of our total, and Europe which represents 24% of our total, mid to high single-digit growth in both of those markets.
Looking at our smaller established markets, specifically Canada and Australia, they showed reasonable growth as well, 8% in Australia and 11% in Canada. While the emerging markets really, really began to gain or keep the further traction.
Latin America grew an extraordinary 27% off a high $500 million base, and we saw strong growth in Asia as well albeit off a lower base to 23% organic growth across Asia.
Looking to our results, the earnings increased 26% as stated excluding the one-time costs. The $0.97 excluded $58 million or $0.24 a share, and we provided significant detail in the press release on page four of the make-up of those charges including both the cash and non-cash elements.
Importantly the 3Q ‘09 excludes any impact of Black & Decker as that transaction did not close as you well know until the middle of March 2010. I think the other point worthy of note on the chart as it relates to margins and tax rate, 27% tax rate which Don will explain is more in line with what we anticipate the ongoing tax rate to be.
We achieved the $0.97 with the 27% tax rate, if you compare that to year ago the 22.1% tax rate included a large audit settlement that we were able to book in the third quarter of 2009. So aided by $45 million of realized synergies that hit the P&L in the third quarter, we got to $0.97.
Looking at sources of growth as mentioned previously 8% organic growth on a pro forma basis, so across the board with the exception of legacy Stanley mechanical security, we grew in every business and that was quite encouraging.
The sources of growth on the left as you can see were 7%, currency was a negative 2% impact, remember that currency particularly the euro relative to the dollar has changed dramatically in the last six or eight weeks, but currency was negative 2% in the quarter, and then of course the large addition from the impact of the Black & Decker business and to a lesser extent our CRC Evans acquisition.
I think more importantly on the right hand side if we look at the legacy Stanley, legacy Black & Decker businesses, good high single digit organic growth in aggregate. The strength clearly in Industrial, but strong performance in CDIY and Security essentially flat across the combination of the two businesses to get us to our total, blended total of 8%.
New products as I mentioned earlier contributed to the volume, good performance in emerging markets, strong industrial order flow, all helping those numbers and Jim is going to give you more detail on the segments in just a minute.
I think the integration remains a very high interest certainly to us and everyone on the call, and it’s on track with several key initiatives well ahead of schedule. The process remains disciplined. We’ve certainly not stopped the rhythm and rigor around putting these two companies together. Steering Committee meets on a biweekly basis with the six most senior executives in the company.
The majority of the original integration team you will recall, the 13 teams consisted of a Stanley executive, a Black & Decker executive, and an outside consultant from Bain & Company.
Many of them have been deployed back to the business or they’ve been able to be redeployed to work on some revenue synergy projects, and that’s a very important thing, so the majority of these teams are led by now one person, some are led by two and internalization is complete, simply meaning we’re finished with our outside counsel, it served us extremely well, but we’ve taken this process over on our own and there are some cost savings of course associated with that.
The cost synergies are absolutely ahead of plan. $45 million realized in the third quarter, which has allowed us to take our estimate of what we will actually achieve in 2010 up to $125 million. That’s up $35 million from our last estimate due primarily to effective execution.
The biggest areas or the most important areas where we’re achieving it is in sourcing and within the regional business units, the consolidation of hand and power tool, although there are a plethora of examples where both functional and business projects are ahead of schedule, those being the two largest impacts.
As a consequence, we are likely to exceed the $350 million target that we’ve given from the outset of putting these two companies together, and as we said in our press release, we are refining the estimate and the extend of our performance on how much we’re going to reinvest in growth projects and we will intend when the year is finished in December when we report in January to give a precise estimate of how high up can be, and what we intend to do with any overachievement.
We’ve made the points before, but I think it’s worth reemphasizing. To the extent we exceed the cost synergies, we’re going to look very hard at cost to achieve these incremental synergies, if it’s not a good business proposition we’re not going to do it. We’re also going to look at the business risk associated.
The risk to fill rates, the risk to the organization, the risk to anything that matters in terms of how we run our business, and judgmentally weigh it out against the added value of the opportunity to achieve synergies.
And of equal or greater importance, what I just mentioned to the extent we do exceed $350 million, we think, it’s quite prudent given the existing environment to reinvest some of that overachievement in driving growth at or above the rate of the market, some of which we’ve already done, and some of which we will continue in the years going forward.
Last but not least, I want to touch on revenue synergies. They are compelling. We’re refining them as well as could have assigned, how and where to assign the appropriate accountability, the timing and what the opportunities are. The regional business teams have already begun to implement some quick hits and you saw that in the top line growth in the third quarter.
As we’ve said previously, the geographic opportunities for an example, Latin America are likely among the earliest and the largest. Some of the other very meaningful revenue synergies are still there. They are gaining traction. We’re being able to quantify them better and better as time goes on, but they will take a little longer in some of the geographic synergies.
Now let me turn it over to Jim Loree to talk about some of the new product successes that helped us in the third quarter, as well as give you a look at some more detail with insight of the segments.

304977,113996630,80450,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. It’s never a better time than during a downturn to redouble your efforts on new product development and share gain. Both companies have been doing that during this last downturn. And I think what we’re seeing now is the manifestation of",2238,"Thanks, John. It’s never a better time than during a downturn to redouble your efforts on new product development and share gain. Both companies have been doing that during this last downturn. And I think what we’re seeing now is the manifestation of that, not just in power tools but across the company and across the globe.
But in power tools, perhaps one of the most exciting product introductions in years for the Black & Decker legacy businesses with three new families of compact cordless 12-volt lithium ion power tools now hitting the market.
Each of these families the Black & Decker, the DEWALT, and the Porter-Cable families are uniquely designed for their target markets. Each are differentiated to offer compelling value propositions versus competitive lines. And so far the market reaction has been outstanding.
Simply put, they are the best 12-volt cordless compact tools in the marketplace. I encourage you to go to the Web site and research them some more. Go to the stores because they are in stores as we speak.
I would say in addition to the power tools, the hand tool business and the freshness of the product line is also extremely high with the rollout of a new storage line at a large U.S. mass merchant with the introduction of FatMax mechanics tools and air tools for the Canadian market. And, of course, Bostitch hand tools that were introduced earlier this year, which have been extremely well received and are performing even better at the point of sale than the FatMax introduction of about five, six years ago.
So lot’s going on in the construction and DIY business. Clearly, it is off the defense and on to the offense for this segment. But I mentioned that across the company there is activity going on.
Let’s turn to Security; you can look at the three pictures here. First, the audio intrusion panel; this is a new mid price point panel for Sonitrol customers, which cuts their installation cost for a small business installation by about 30%.
In the healthcare, the SpaceTRAX RFID inventory management system is a RFID based CONBON system for hospital supplies which greatly enhances nurses productivity in the hospitals. And then the six panel telescoping door on the right there is designed to provide maximum clearance for openings for retailers where space is limited.
For instance, it allows a 50 inch wide pass through and a 70 inch wide opening, which may not sound like a lot, but that is the highest ratio of pass through to rough opening that we’re aware of in the marketplace. That product will replace the clunky bi-fold doors that you often see in major pharmacies. It will also open up the manual door market at gas stations, convenience stores and small retailers, so it’s a market expansion play as well.
Now moving to Industrial, the Industrial segment and down to engineered fastening, we have an exciting new stud welding system being introduced as we speak in the Emhart Teknologies business. This system replaces a very successful but dated system that was first introduced in 2002 and is still a market leading system.
The first installation of this new system occurs this quarter at a major German auto manufacturer. Key features, this is easily networked, it’s highly programmable. A technician or an engineer at an auto OEM’s headquarters can monitor the performance of these systems all around the world when they’re installed.
It uses 70% less air, so it is environmentally friendly. It has a much faster feeding mechanism which provides for productivity, exceptionally high levels of quality, and it’s just another key product development that keeps our Emhart business ahead of the competition.
And then finally moving over to Industrial and Automotive Repair, there is also a very important product introduction going on which is called the Expert Line and this is a global product family of professional hand tools for industrial and automotive repair at the mid price point.
It replaces five brands; Tona, Pastorino, Britool and two others. When completely implemented it will reduce the SKU count from 7,000 to about 2,500, and yet each one of those served markets for those brands will have a broader product line covering that market area.
It is a complete offering of high quality tools at a value price point, and as I said, it offers a global market coverage, and is essential to penetrate the emerging markets where the price points are a bit lower. So it’s a very strategic offering and introduction for the industrial and automotive repair business.
If we shift now to have a look at the CDIY segment, they had a terrific organic growth quarter. They grew their total revenues to $1.3 billion, roughly at a $5 billion run rate. The Legacy CDIY Stanley business was up 8% organically. Worldwide product tools and accessories up 7%.
As you can see, and John mentioned revenues grew in all regions of the world, led by Latin America which had volume increases of 26%, and Asia which was up 14% in this segment.
North America, despite the weakness in the marketplace, it was up 6%, and EMEA was up 9%. Interestingly now emerging markets in this segment account for about 20% of sales and will then grow again at about a 20% rate, that gives about 4 points of organic growth to their total segment, which is a nice growth booster. And it will be especially nice when the core markets in North America and Europe pick up and we’ll have that additive volume increase on top of it.
I talked at length about the new 12-volt compact lithium product, so I won’t dwell on that, as well as the hand tool introductions. I will touch upon the segment profit rate, which improved 360 basis points on a pro forma basis even though when you look at the Stanley 14% legacy last year, it’s now mixing into a 13.2% in the third quarter ‘10 in the combined company, but the important part is the pro forma comparison up from 9.6% to 13.2% with productivity, the cost synergies, and operating leverage are more than offsetting headwinds, such as FX and inflation.
There has been some chatter in the early notes about concerns regarding sequential decline in Construction and DIY segment, CDIY segment profit rate; start by mentioning that we did mention that on the last call that we expected to see some degradation in the profit rate, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise. It was a 2.4 point sequential decline.
And it was driven by the new product introduction rollout for the lithium ion. We did have some FX and inflation impact as well, and we also had our mix impact going from high outdoor content in 2Q to lower outdoor content in 3Q, something which generally happens every year, and one should be aware of in this business.
So we’re going to have some fluctuation in the operating margin rates from quarter to quarter, nothing to be concerned about. A lot of it had to do with spending on the lithium ion introductions.
Now we’ll move over to Security. Today’s it’s about 25% of the company. The total revenues were up 40% to $563 million. All of the growth was derived from acquisitions including the SSDS, as John mentioned, the formerly ADT France acquisition as well as the Black & Decker merger accounting for that growth.
Our legacy Stanley Security Solutions business was actually down 3% organically, and the HHI business was up 3%. As you can see from the regional revenue, it’s still fairly North American-centric and the segment profit rate was down 360 basis points, but only 280 basis points if you exclude the acquisition. So a very high third quarter ‘09 profit rate, and a much more normalized third quarter ‘10 at 18% excluding HHI and SSDS.
We were very positive about what was observed in the convergent security solutions business with their first organic growth quarter in quite some time, even just up 1%, but what was really encouraging was the order rates which were 11%. So very, very significant improvement in backlog, which is encouraging.
The national accounts are gaining momentum. The small accounts have stabilized, and so looks like a pretty good story there with RMR growth in the quarter and orders improving. We talked a little bit about SSDS already the works counsel process is complete. The restructuring is well underway. That will occur for probably next six months or so. The all-in percentage should approach line average by the end of 2011.
And then healthcare solutions was also having nice performance, up 9% organically, strength across the platform, and the 2011 healthcare acquisition pipeline is growing. So that’s a growth platform for the company. I’d expect to see some activity there as we go forward.
On the mechanical side, they are still battling tough market conditions. They had a negative 6% organic growth in legacy Stanley, five points of that was attributable to a large retail customer destocking residential hardware. That was pretty much as expected.
We also had Access Technologies, good performance there with strong service, strong remodeling activity, offset by continued commercial hardware weakness, which is market related, and it was down 3% in the best access business, the Mechanical Access Solutions.
And then Black & Decker HHI was a bright spot with 3% organic growth. Kwikset, SmartKey successes continue and the Baldwin Prestige Line is being well accepted and that more than encountered the market weakness that they encountered as well with inventory corrections in their business.
And then the operating margin rate for the mechanical business was pretty much consistent with the prior year despite their volume issues which I think was an achievement.
Now the star of the quarter from a segment perspective was Industrial, their total revenues were up 152% to $517 million with a stunning 26% organic growth in the legacy Stanley industrial business. Remember that comes against some fairly easy comps but still a great achievement. And then equally, as impressive 27% growth in the Emhart Teknologies business.
Profit rate was up substantially, a lot of that was driven by the mix into Emhart which was very profitable as well as CRC-Evans, successful integration of that and acquisition continues. As we move through the various pieces and parts, industrial and automotive repair business had a nice quarter with volume up 20%.
The inventory restocking continued at the customer level but at a smaller pace. We feel that about two-thirds of the growth was attributable to end user demand increases and clearly some share gains going on in this business, and we also had strength in our Asian emerging markets.
Within Europe the organic revenues were up 9%. North America IAR which includes Mac, Proto and Vidmar was up 40% with Proto share gains fairly at significant level as they continue to penetrate distribution more deeply and continue to bring some new products into the mix. And then Engineered Fastening sales growth was driven by strong OEM production rates in Americas and in Japan and they also achieve record operating profit.
Interestingly, global auto production was only up 8% overall, so this business also benefited from customer mix, platform mix, within customers, geographic mix and just general good market performance, operating performance in the business. And then finally CRC-Evans contributed $49 million to revenues and 70 basis points to the profit rate.
I’ll move now to working capital very briefly. There is about $2 billion now in working capital. We had a nice 0.4% or 10% increase in the turns to 4.6% but included in that 4.6% is a dichotomy between the legacy Stanley which is at about 8.3 turns and accounts for about $500 million of that $2 billion of working capital and the remainder is associated with the Black & Decker and some of the new acquisitions that we did this year.
So an 11% overall sales increase working capital was up 1% but when you look at the components such as inventory for example which is at 85 days, legacy Stanley is at 68 and legacy Black & Decker is at 98.
So a huge room for opportunity there and we have similar but not as dramatic room for improvement in the DSO which is 65 days in total but 61 Stanley legacy and 69 Black & Decker legacy and then in payables there clearly is a big opportunity there as well with a 62 day overall average but with legacy Stanley at 74 days and legacy Black & Decker at 53.
So that kind of highlights the opportunity and we’ll talk more as we go on here over the coming quarters about how the Stanley fulfillment system principles will be applied to the Black & Decker legacy activities as well as some of the new acquisitions to extract over as much as we can out of this $2 billion of working capital and clearly there is an opportunity of some substantial magnitude if you consider the fact that legacy Stanley is at 8.3 turns if we could get that 4.6 up a couple of turns, it would really result in hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental improvement.
So with that, I’m going to turn it over to Don Allan who is going to take you through some more details on the financials.

304977,113996630,80450,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Let me start with free cash flow statement here, just to remind, it does exclude special charges. So we had special payments related to the merger in the third quarter of $81 million and year-to-date $200 million.Obviously, you can see t",2295,"Thank you, Jim. Let me start with free cash flow statement here, just to remind, it does exclude special charges. So we had special payments related to the merger in the third quarter of $81 million and year-to-date $200 million.
Obviously, you can see the effect of the merger and the net income and the depreciation and amortization increasing significantly year-over-year by about $140 million.
The most significant thing to note here is really that working capital is negative to the first three quarters of the year and although we’re pleased with our working capital performance so far this year, we did take a bit of step back in the third quarter from the second quarter as our working capital turns went from 5.1 to 4.6, as anticipated.
As we look forward to the fourth quarter, we have detailed plans and forecasts in place that we believe we will actually achieve close to 5 or 5.2 working capital turns by the end of the year which is what our plan was back in March as we began to put the two companies together.
So a bulk of that $183 million of a negative that you’re seeing year-to-date in possibly will likely disappear as a result of that significant working capital performance that we expect in the fourth quarter.
Keep in mind both companies have a history of having strong working capital performances in the fourth quarter due to the seasonality nature of both business as well as the timing of certain events that happen within the quarter, third quarter versus fourth quarter.
The last thing I’ll mention on this page is that looking at the bottom line over the free cash flow you can see that even with that negative, we achieved $234 million of free cash flow in the third quarter, and now are very close to $500 million of free cash flow year-to-date.
Looking back in historical trends of the company on a combined basis, both companies tend to achieve about two-thirds of their free cash flow for the year by the end of September. If you take that analytical view that would mean we would achieve close to $725 million to $750 million of free cash flow. Hence why we believe we are going to exceed $700 million of free cash flow for the year.
Moving on to the balance sheet again this is a comparison prior year related to third quarter of ‘09 as Stanley only, so the third quarter of 2010 includes the merged company, and obviously the variances are being driven by the impact of the two companies being put together.
Couple things that I want to point out here though, obviously our cash balances are significant $1.6 million worldwide, all of that is currently overseas, and we continue to evaluate potential options as we go forward of bringing some of that cash home through different means.
It will be something that we will be finalizing in the fourth quarter of this year. Debt is at $3.4 billion, and it’s up slightly from the second quarter as we did issue a set of bonds, 30-year bonds at 5.2% back in September. We’re very pleased with that issuance at that rate, and its ability for us to spread out some of our maturities as we go forward.
And then last but certainly not least on this page is capital ratios. We are at about 33% debt to capital; when we adjust for our hybrid instruments, we’re around 29% to 30%. And so that’s a continued improvement of where we started back in the first quarter those ratios were respectively 35% and 31%.
So we feel like we are on track for our objectives around debt by the end of the year. So I want to spend a little time on the next page, which has to do with our outlook around some of our segments and primarily focus on revenue.
I want to start with the CDIY segment. We are anticipating a low single digit growth rate on a pro forma basis for the fourth quarter. But there is a couple things to clarify related to that.
We mentioned in the press release that there were tougher prior year comparisons and to be specific what that is, when you compare fourth quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter of 2009 for this business, Black & Decker last year had 14 weeks of activity in that number, it’s just the timing of their fiscal calendar, compared to what we will have this year, which will be 13 weeks. That impact actually has a drag of about 4 points on the CDIY growth number. So as an example, if the business was going to grow 2% in our current forecast, on an apples to apples basis, it’s actually growing 6%.
So I think it’s important that folks understand what we mean by tougher prior year comparisons in this particular case. And I’ll also give you a sense of the magnitude of that for the total company on the next page.
Jim talked about the successful 12-volt rollout and I’m not going to harp on that, but clearly that is a significant impact, and it’s helping to offset some of that timing issues that I described with those headwinds.
Sequentially the operating profit will see pressure in the fourth quarter as we will have increased promotions, negative currency effect, as well as lower absorption. So we will see a bit of a sequential decline from third and fourth quarter in CDIY as a result of those items.
We continue to see really nice growth in Latin America and Asia, and expect that to continue in the fourth quarter. Although, we’ll likely see a little bit of a weaker performance in the U.S. and Europe primarily because of the comparison issue that I described earlier.
Moving on to Security; as Jim mentioned, security had a nice quarter on the electronics security side of the business as well as HHI. Mechanical Access continues to see some pressure related to the commercial construction markets as well as that inventory correction item that Jim mentioned related to the third quarter.
We think that we will see a slight revenue decline in the fourth quarter for the overall segment on a pro forma basis, and that’s indicative of factors I just mentioned.
The good news is that CSS order flow continues to be strong and solid, and that’s really being driven by activity in the national accounts in North America. So we’re pleased that there appears to be a positive trend and acceleration occurring in that business.
We have seen an uptick in delayed and abandoned construction projects in that commercial construction sector of the Mechanical Access business, so that’s really creating that pressure that I described, and then of course the residential hardware business is historically weak in the fourth quarter due to seasonality, but we are seeing a bit of an offset from the continued success of the SmartKey products as well as the Baldwin Prestige product lines. So we do expect a little bit of growth in that business in the fourth quarter, but not of the magnitude we saw on previous quarters.
Industrial, mid-single-digit pro forma organic growth rate, so we are continuing to see nice growth in this particular area. We don’t expect to see the growth of the magnitude that we saw in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, which was 20%, 30% range as a result of a couple of things.
One, we believe that the customer restocking has ended. We saw a little bit of that occur in the third quarter, as Jim described. We don’t expect that to continue into the fourth quarter.
Also, we do see lower global automotive production forecasts around the world, so as a result our engineered fastening business will likely not see the type of growth rates and leverage they saw in the third quarter, so that will be a bit of an offsetting pressure to some of the positives that we’re seeing in North America industrial distribution business that continues to be strong, and we expect that to be strong in the fourth quarter.
And in the mobile distribution and industrial storage business will show modest growth as well. We think we’ll also see strength in our infrastructure business as we expect to see growth in particularly emerging markets as you see here on the page.
So to summarize the guidance on page 17, this is our updated outlook for 2010. It excludes one-time charges related to the merger with BDK was well as the acquisition of SSDS or ADT France and CRC-Evans.
Just as a reminder to folks, those charges are the following as far as guidance for the year, for restructuring related we still believe it will be $245 million to $295 million, probably closer to the high end of the range as a result of what John described with higher synergies being achieved in 2010.
The one-time SG&A and other costs will approximate $135 million, so that’s up slightly from July as a result of activity there associated with ADT France and CRC-Evans in particular. In the inventory step up which is an accounting charge, will be about $175 million, $170 million related to BDK and $5 million led to CRC.
Our guidance increase has been $3.60 to $3.70. So we’ve increased that from $3.35 to a high end of $3.55 from back in July. What are the factors that are really driving that? First of all the second half organic sales growth we believe is now going to approximate 5% where we said 4% to 5% back in July. We saw 8% pro forma growth into third quarter of 2010.
Clearly that implies a slower growth in the fourth quarter to get to 5% number, it implies about 2%. That extra week phenomena, those tougher and prior year comps that I described are really causing about 3 point drag in that comparison. So if you made an apples-to-apples comparison it will be about 5% growth number year-over-year.
Gross margins, we will see a sequential decline of probably 50 to 80 basis points from the third quarter that’s very much in line with historical trends for both businesses. As we tend to see lower absorption in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter and this year, we like to see a little bit of currency pressure, additional currency pressure as well.
So there is a little bit of pressure there on the gross margin line and then also we’ll also see some additional promotional costs and SG&A. That will cause some pressure on the operating margin line.
The good news as John mentioned the cost synergy realization is up to $125 million in 2010 as we mentioned in July, we achieved $30 million in the second quarter. John mentioned $45 million in the third quarter and so that would mean we are going to achieve about $50 million in the fourth quarter to get to $125 million for the year.
Other items that are not on the page related to the guidance that there are no changes but we’ve communicated in the past. These are two acquisitions of SSDS and CRC-Evans. We don’t expect any major changes to that guidance that we’ve provided previously around EPS as well as the BDK intangible amortization is still expected to be $55 million.
The tax rate is in the range of 26% to 27% for the full year. So that implies a lower tax rate for the fourth quarter because we’re at almost 28% through the first three quarters of this year.
Other restructuring which is restructuring unrelated to BDK, ADT France and CRC is still expected to be $30 million to $40 million which means we’ll have a rather large charge in the fourth quarter of anywhere from $12 million to $17 million depending on certain activities and timing of events.
And then commodity inflation continues to be a pressure for us in the back half of the year compared to the prior year. As you look at commodity prices versus the second half of 2009, we’re still seeing 20% to 40% increases. Those are all items that are consistent with what we said in the past and there are no significant changes there.
The net effect of this on a cash basis, cash EPS is now expected to be $4.34 up to be $4.44 for 2010 and that excludes approximately $175 million of amortization. The last thing I’ll mention, on this page is just to reaffirm that the free cash flow for 2010 is expected to exceed $700 million as I described earlier.
So to summarize the presentation portion of the call, we definitely feel like the third quarter is an illustration of how our integration continues to be proficient and effective.
The cost synergies for 2010 have been raised to $125 million as we had indicated and we’re very pleased to see earlier than expected profitability with our French electronics security business, SSDS.
2011 forecasted cost synergies did drive 10% to 15% profit growth above and beyond core business growth and in organic growth across majority of business driven by the footprint of the emerging markets and all the new product innovation that Jim described.
The second quarter restocking activity is moderated as we expected in the third quarter and we don’t expect that to continue into the fourth quarter and as I mentioned free cash flow guidance has been raised and we expect significant fourth quarter 2010 working capital benefits.
With that, I’m going to pass the call back to Kate White so she can clarify few items related to outstanding shares and EPS projection for the year.

Remember when we made the acquisition, we talked about how accretive it would be in year two or three. It looks like we’re going to get there sooner.
What we also said, when we made the acquisition and we’re pretty much on track despite our relatively low purchase price, we have upwards of $50 million to spend on restructuring of that business, but when you add the purchase price and the restructuring together in our capital base, as Jim talked about, in the quarter when we made this acquisition, it has the potential to be an extraordinarily high ROCE acquisition.
Obviously, it’s going to be accretive, because we’ve taken up a large negative and turned it into a modest and we think much larger positive going forward. And the capital base is still going to be extraordinarily low relative to its revenues and profitability.
I think your estimate of profitability, we’d like to get there, I think that’s fairly aggressive and fairly early that would imply high teen, low 20s, operating margins. We didn’t commit or undertake to get there quite that quickly. But that’s the direction we’re going and sooner rather than later, we’ll be line average with our Electronic Security business.

First of all, we have a stated objective in our CDIY business to grow the business at 2x the rate of the market. Two things going on, we’ve historically done that for the last four or five years in the legacy Stanley hand tools business. I think it’s clear that the worldwide power tools and accessory business due to the delayed adoption of lithium ion, lost a little bit of share.
I think Jim has pointed out and Jeff Ansell’s team is doing a great job getting these new products into the market, where we’re catching up in a very big hurry and the market is accepting it well. I’d say there is no reason why we can’t regain the three to five share points lost over the last three years, and just in fact, if we’re able to do that, we’ll be growing the power tools side of the business at 2x the rate of the market too. So that’s not a volume projection going forward. Some of these products have only been in the marketplace less than three months.
There will be others in the first half of next year, but yes, we are optimistic with our new product pipeline, with the hand tool and power tool team that are coming together to form a very, very powerful business unit, good customer reaction to what we’ve shown them so far, so we are cautiously optimistic, but we’re not out there with any estimates yet because we don’t have enough data to base it on.

And then the question becomes as we get a couple of years into this what happens and that’s why we have these five growth platforms. That’s why when you look at what we’re acquiring in these growth platforms we’re looking for higher growth, higher margin, higher organic growth higher margin areas, so that we can reduce our dependency on slower growth market. You’ll see a portfolio shift that we think over the coming years where security, mechanical security, electronic security, Engineered Fastening, healthcare infrastructure really do grow as important platforms and business and take a much larger share of the revenue as we head into the next down cycle years from now on the tool side.

It’s off to a very good start and we remain enthusiastic about the business, about its ability to grow organically, about its ability to add meaningful value both on an ROC basis and an accretion basis.
With the second one, we’re looking in many different platforms it won’t surprise you that the multiples for some of the healthcare opportunities that Jim referred to are higher than 6 to 8. In the tool space that’s pretty much what they are. For five years, we answered questions in security when we were trading at 6 to 7 how can you make acquisitions at 10 to 11 times EBITDA and have it not destroy value.
The answer is simply 10 to 11 times EBITDA for higher growth, higher margin businesses that’s what the market requires and within two years or three years, they are back to 4 to 6 which is what we’ve done with HSM, what we’ve done with Sonitrol and what we’ve done with other businesses. The same will apply outside industrial tools going forward.
To the extent, we pay a higher multiple than the multiple at which we’re trading, it will be with the understanding in the plan between synergies and growth to have that multiple be well within our range and as a consequence haven’t create value for our shareholders. It’s probably worth mentioning that the entire management team, its Stanley Black & Decker’s long-term incentive is based equally on earnings growth and return on capital employed.
So the acquisition market is heating up. It’s more competitive, more sponsors are showing up and showed up even six months ago to compete for attractive, that being said, it’s not a lot of change from what we’ve been dealing with for the last six years. We’ll maintain our financial discipline. We’ll maintain our both strategic review and financial hurdle rates and look at each acquisition opportunity on its own merits.

I am interested in kind of you have the business legacy Black & Decker how the differences are versus your initial expectations regarding. I know you had talked about, perhaps BDK had used price to gain share which didn’t work as well as your ability to pass through commodity costs on the Stanley hand tool business perhaps more aggressively than Black & Decker did in the past. Can you just give your initial assessments in how you’re handling cost inflation with different businesses?

It was basically the defensive maneuver to protect whatever share they could while they scrambled to redesign the product lines which you’re not seeing the manifestation of. So it’s tough to recover a lot of price when you don’t have the products to back it up.
So I’d suggest what we’re doing now in the power tool business is that we are gradually introducing these new families of cordless products to recapture the market share, and we will do what we need to do to reestablish ourselves at the market share position where we think is optimal given the various facts and circumstances in the marketplace.
So, now that said, I think that if I were to be completely objective, I think that pricing is probably more of a core competency on a functional basis in many of the Stanley legacy businesses, and we have some folks in our pricing center of excellence already working with the legacy Black & Decker folks to help implement that within their system.
I’d say the same is true for the granularity of the analysis related to operations cost in particular related to procurement, which they didn’t do on a centralized basis, and legacy Stanley did, which meant not only did we have perhaps more opportunity to leverage the supply base over a larger base, but also have more timely information that could be actually cycled into the pricing analysis and strategy process, and I think that is definitely something that Don Allan and his team are going to be working diligently on over the coming quarters to get at the same level the legacy Stanley was at.
That said, it’s one of the most positive surprises of all here and we didn’t have a chance to see these families of new products that have been developed by the legacy Black & Decker folks in power tools. We had to take it on face, because we couldn’t get access to it during the due diligence process for any trust reasons. We had to take it on faith that these products would be everything that they indicated that they would be from an attractiveness perspective, and we couldn’t be happier. We couldn’t be happier with the team that developed these products or the product themselves and the future that actually portends for the power tool business.

In terms of deal sizes, for the next six to 12 months, we’re not looking at deals well above $500 million, unless it were to be a game changing opportunity and timing over which we have no control, because as Don pointed out, despite we’re going to have $700 million in cash flow if we look at this year, we’re spending close to $400 million to achieve the synergies. We’re paying a dividend. That pretty much takes care of cash flow without changing the structure of our balance sheet.
Going forward, if we look at $700 million plus, the dividend, repay a couple hundred million in debt to be solidly where the rating agencies need us to be, we still have $400 million to $500 million to spend. That should give you a flavor, Jim, either accumulatively or with one large deal without issuing equity, the size we’re looking at.
In terms of the platforms, again it’s the same. Jim alluded to it. We’ve taken our portfolio back to about 2006 levels in terms of the ability to which is influenced or impacted by the North America residential construction and CDIY markets. That’s not dead, but ultimately, we’re going to discriminate in favor of healthcare infrastructure, engineered fastening, security, things that we feel we have right to succeed, the multiples would be a little higher, but as I responded to Mike Rehaut’s question, we’ll get those multiples down over time, but we’re going to discriminate in favor of higher growth, higher margin businesses going forward to get our portfolio back towards.
We got a roughly a third, a third, a third which is not a concrete target but we like the fact of being look five years out to $15 billion company with $5 billion in CDIY, $5 billion in Security and $5 billion in Industrial, that gives us a lot of leverage to pull off as a management team when macroeconomic, when and if the macroeconomic situation changes dramatically.

But the same kind of cross selling opportunities exist in all emerging markets, remember we focused in executive and an entire team on what we call the Emerging Markets Asia-Pacific Group, and we have Jeff Chen focusing on mainland China, Ben Sihota from Black & Decker focusing on the other markets.
So first and foremost in the geographies, beyond that they’re going to take a little longer to incubate and its really all we’re going to say at this point, everything else we’ve said in investor presentations and we’ll give you some more granularity on that in January when we wrap the year up and decide quite frankly how much cost synergy excess if you will we have to fund some of these programs.

First of all, we have one major retailer that took about $0.5 billion of inventory out in their system in the last 90 to 120 days. That may or may not continue into the fourth quarter, probably will continue to some extent. The rest of the field I’d say the inventory is on the average for the big retailers with our products, we only have legacy Stanley at this point in time we’re still trying to get the circuits hooked up to get all the weeks on hand and so forth point of sale for the whole system.
But the weeks on hand with the legacy Stanley which I think will be a good proxy for CDIY, right around 12 which was a couple of weeks lower than it was in 2005, those who can remember back that far 2005 was the year that the large retailers, three of them shut off ordering in the middle of December. So we don’t think that that scenario is likely, but we see a scenario where point of sale is not robust at most of these customers. It’s not terrible, it’s just kind of bumping along flattish kind of territory. Our invoice sales was very consistent from a volume point of view, from a unit point of view with that in the legacy Stanley business in the third quarter.
As we step back from it, I’d say we probably see caution in the winds at the retailers and part of our outlook reflects that. So I think we’ve kind of baked in the environment in a very reasonably way here. As we look forward into 2011, clearly the product introductions that are occurring as we speak will have several quarters of opportunity to manifest themselves in sales gains. We’ll have some additional product introductions coming in several areas, including power tools, as we get into next year. So that will help us.
I think on balance, the product introductions will provide a nice buffer against if we continue to have sluggish environment. We’re not suggesting that we will, but it’s too early for us to call what the environment for 2011 is going to be, and that’s why we’ll have much more granularity around the guidance in the fourth quarter earnings release in January.

So a lot of our conclusions have to come from discussing with sales folks and sales management what their observations are in the marketplace, and we don’t have great visibility into say the tool cribs where things are really kind of stocked and restocked, but we do have reasonable qualitative visibility into the distribution channel and we think what occurred during the destocking phase was there it was kind of a really significant destocking throughout the whole system from the distributors to the dealers to the tool crib folks to secretaries regarding office supplies, and because nobody knew if they were ever going to be able to order anymore.
So I think what’s happening is that clearly, industrial production was not up 20% in our world. We think about a third of it was a restocking, we think another third of it was share gain. So the last third would have been market growth if you will. That seems to be a little bit higher than the production levels. So maybe there is some restocking going on within the factories that buy these plants of industrial tools. But at least at the distributor we think it’s on its course.
For the CDIY, I pretty much covered everything that I could say about, inventories at this point in time which is they are averaging about 12 weeks at our largest U.S. customers or shattering inventory corrections, but they are very cautious with respect to their inventory levels. I think they will be playing wait and see here with the upcoming season, and if the season doesn’t seem to be playing out in the late November, early December time frame there is chance that there could be more inventory correction than normal in this particular year, even though their inventories are in pretty good shape.
There are about two weeks on the average lower than they were in ‘05 when we had, they essentially took two weeks out of December, all three are the biggest retailers in the country. As I said earlier, our guidance reflects some conservatism and caution with respect to the tone of the CDIY market and we shall see where things kind of play out as the season goes here.

We’ve recovered about75% to 85% of raw materials inflation over time. The rest we have to get the productivity to maintain margins which we’ve been able to do.
The second way to ensure that we maintain margins in terms of prices to do what Jim alluded to on the first page of his piece of the presentation, specifically by introducing new and improved products of higher price points and allowing the previous products to waterfall down if necessary to a slightly lower price point allows us to maintain margins we of course have to add features and benefits to do that, because simply asking for more price for an existing product even in the face of materials inflation is very difficult for our customers to accept because they are trying to provide obviously the lowest price as possible to their end users.
So the pricing environment’s no different than it’s been for the last five years and our modus operandi or the way we’re dealing with it is essentially no different at least from a legacy Stanley side, add features and benefits that you can get paid for, command a higher price, having the leading brands on the category, gives you the right as well as the obligation to be the price leader. And that’s our strategy that we will continue to employ in the months to come should materials increase even more than we’re anticipating.

As Kate said, our press release is out this morning, and the headlines or highlights that you should have taken away are that some good solid organic growth has resumed, and our integration process is exceeding q",1616,"Thanks, Kate, and good morning, everybody. As Kate said, our press release is out this morning, and the headlines or highlights that you should have taken away are that some good solid organic growth has resumed, and our integration process is exceeding quite well and perhaps ahead of expectations. 
We reported pro forma revenues of increase of 11% to $2.4 billion. Organic revenues, up 8% as the legacy Stanley and legacy Black & Decker businesses grew 7% and 9%, respectively. $0.97 diluted EPS excluding the charges or $0.73 GAAP earnings including the charges. Strong free cash flow, $234 million. That excludes onetime payments of the $81 million as outlined in our press release. 
The CDIY segment grew. Organic revenues were up 7%, and there was quite a lot of successful new product activity that Jim Loree is going to highlight for you in a few minutes. We saw top line growth in Convergent, albeit a modest 1%. Order trends are increasing, and our French security business, SSDS, Stanley Solutions de Sècuritè, formerly the ADT France business, turned profitable during the quarter. That is extremely noteworthy that it's six to nine months earlier than our projections, and remember, this is a business that was losing up to $15 million a year for the last two years. Bernard, who is Chairman, and his team in France and Europe [ph] (21:13) is doing a really good job putting those two businesses together and turning them profitable well ahead of schedule. 
The customer restocking moderated within the Industrial Segment, but end user demand did remain strong. Our full year guidance, we increased. Excluding onetime charges, we increased our range to $3.81  to $3.91, and it's $3.60 to $3.70  if we exclude the $0.21 second quarter 2010 tax-related benefit that we achieved. 
Strong free cash flow has led us to increase our free cash flow guidance for the year. Now we expect to exceed $700 million, where previously, we thought that $600 million or slightly above $600 million was a more appropriate target. 
And last but not least, our cost synergy estimate for 2010 has increased to $125 million as the integration progress remains ahead of plan. Now you're going to see the impact of the increase from $90 million to $125 million in Don's outlook in a few minutes. But essentially, we've taken the third quarter performance, which was driven by both improved volume and synergy achievement, and rolled it into the annual guidance in conjunction with the slight improvement in fourth quarter outlook, driven primarily by the improved synergy realization, and we rolled that into our annual guidance as well. 
Looking quickly around the globe, we saw organic revenue growth in every geographic market. If we look at our large two established markets, middle left, the U.S, which represents 56% of our total, and Europe, which represents 24% of our total, mid to high single-digit growth in both of those markets. 
Looking at our smaller established markets, specifically Canada and Australia, they showed reasonable growth as well, 8% in Australia and 11% in Canada, while the emerging markets really, really began to gain or keep the further traction. Latin America grew an extraordinary 27%, off a high $500 million base, and we saw strong growth in Asia as well, albeit off a lower base, 23% organic growth across Asia. 
Looking to our results, the earnings increased 26% as stated, excluding the onetime costs. The $0.97 excluded $58 million or $0.24 a share, and we provided significant detail in the press release on Page 4 of the makeup of those charges, including both the cash and non-cash elements. 
Importantly, the 3Q '09 excludes any impact of Black & Decker as that transaction did not close, as you well know, until the middle of March 2010. I think the other point worthy of note on the chart as it relates to margins and tax rate, 27% tax rate, which Don will explain, is more in line with what we anticipate the ongoing tax rate to be. We achieved the $0.97 with the 27% tax rate. If you compare that to year ago, the 22.1% tax rate included a large audit settlement that we were able to book in the third quarter of 2009. So aided by $45 million of realized synergies that hit the P&L in the third quarter, we got the $0.97. 
Looking at sources of growth, as mentioned previously, 8% organic growth on a pro forma basis. So across the board, with the exception of legacy Stanley Mechanical Security, we grew in every business, and that was quite encouraging. The sources of growth on the left, as you can see, were 7%. Currency was a negative 2% impact. Remember, the currency, particularly the euro relative to the dollar, has changed dramatically in the last six or eight weeks. But currency was negative 2% in the quarter and then, of course, the large addition from the impact of the Black & Decker business and, to a lesser extent, our CRC-Evans acquisition. 
I think more importantly on the right-hand side, if we look at the legacy Stanley, legacy Black & Decker businesses, good high single-digit organic growth in aggregate. The strength clearly in Industrial, but strong performance in CDIY and Security, essentially flat across the combination of the two businesses to get us to our blended total of 8%. 
New products, as I mentioned earlier, contributed to the volume. Good performance in emerging markets. Strong industrial order flow, all helping those numbers. And Jim's going to give you more detail on the segments in just a minute. 
I think the integration remains a very high interest certainly to us and everyone on the call, and it's on track with several key initiatives well ahead of schedule. The process remains disciplined. We've certainly not stopped the rhythm and rigor around putting these two companies together. The Steering Committee meets on a biweekly basis with the six most senior executives in the company. The majority of the original integration team, you will recall, the integration team's consisted -- the 13 teams consisted of a Stanley executive, a Black & Decker executive and an outside consultant from Bain & Company. Many of them have been deployed back to the business or they've been able to be redeployed to work on some revenue synergy projects, and that's a very important thing. So the majority of these teams are led by now one person, some are led by two. And internalization is complete, simply meaning we're finished with our outside counsel. It served us extremely well, but we've taken this process over on our own, and there's some cost savings, of course, associated with that. 
The cost synergies are absolutely ahead of plan. $45 million realized in the third quarter, which has allowed us to take our estimate of what we will actually achieve in 2010 up to $125 million. That's up $35 million from our last estimate due primarily to effective execution. The biggest areas or the most important areas where we're achieving it is in sourcing and within the regional business unit, the consolidation of Hand and Power Tools, although there are plethora of examples where both functional and business projects are ahead of schedule, those being the two largest impacts. As a consequence, we are likely to exceed the $350 million target that we've given from the outset of putting these two companies together. And as we said in our press release, we are refining the estimate and the extent of out-performance and how much we're going to reinvest in growth projects, and we will intend, when the year is finished in December, when we report in January, to give a precise estimate of how high up can be and what we intend to do with any overachievement. 
We made the points before, but I think it's worth re-emphasizing. To the extent we exceed the cost synergies, we're going to look very hard at costs to achieve the incremental synergies. If it's not a good business proposition, we're not going to do it. We're also going to look at the business risk associated, the risk to fill rates, the risk to the organization, the risk to anything that matters in terms of how we run our business and judgmentally weigh that against the added value of the opportunity to achieve synergies. And of equal or greater importance, what I just mentioned, to the extent we do exceed $350 million, we think it's quite prudent, given the existing environment, to reinvest some of that overachievement in driving growth at or above the rate of the market, some of which we've already done and some of which we will continue in the years going forward. 
Last but not least, I want to touch on revenue synergies. They are compelling. We're refining them as well as how and where to assign the appropriate accountability, the timing and what the opportunities are. The regional business teams have already begun to implement some quick hits, and you saw that in the top line growth in the third quarter. And as we've said previously, the geographic opportunities, for an example, Latin America, are likely among the earliest and the largest. Some of the other very meaningful revenue synergies are still there. They're gaining traction. We're being able to quantify them better and better as time goes on. But they will take a little longer than some of the geographic synergies. Now let me turn it over to Jim Loree to talk about some of the new product successes that helped us in the third quarter as well as give you a look at some more details inside the segments."
304977,113996630,80521,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, John. It's never a better time than during a downturn to redouble your efforts on new product development and share gain. And both companies had been doing that during this last downturn, and I think what we're seeing now is the manifestatio",2220,"Okay. Thanks, John. It's never a better time than during a downturn to redouble your efforts on new product development and share gain. And both companies had been doing that during this last downturn, and I think what we're seeing now is the manifestation of that, not just in Power Tools but across the company and across the globe. But in Power Tools, it's perhaps one of the most exciting product introductions in years for the Black & Decker legacy businesses, with three new families of compact cordless 12-volt lithium-ion power tools now hitting the market. Each of these families, the Black & Decker, the DEWALT and the Porter-Cable families, are uniquely designed for their target markets. Each are differentiated to offer compelling value propositions versus competitive lines, and so far, the market reaction has been outstanding. Simply put, they are the best 12-volt cordless compact tools in the marketplace, and I encourage you to go to the website and research them some more. Go to the stores because they're in stores as we speak. 
And I would say in addition to the Power Tools, the Hand Tool business and the freshness of the product line is also extremely high with the rollout of a new storage line at a large U.S. mass merchant with the introduction of FatMax mechanics tools and air tools for the Canadian market, and of course, the Bostitch hand tools that were introduced earlier this year, which had been extremely well received and are performing even better at the point-of-sale than the FatMax introduction of about five, six years ago. So lots going on in the Construction and DIY business. Clearly, it is off the defense and on to the offense for this segment. 
But I mentioned across the company there's activity going on. Let's turn to Security. You can look at the three pictures here. First, the audio intrusion Panel. This is a new mid-price point panel for Sonitrol customers which cuts their installation cost for a small business installation by about 30%. And in Healthcare, the SpaceTRAX RFID inventory management system is an RFID-based kanban system for hospitals' supplies, which greatly enhances nurses' productivity in the hospitals. 
And then the six-panel telescoping door on the right there is designed to provide maximum clearance for openings for retailers where space is limited. For instance, it allows a 50-inch wide pass-through and a 70-inch wide opening, which may not sound like a lot, but that is the highest ratio of pass-through to rough opening that we're aware of in the marketplace. That product will replace the clunky bi-fold doors that you often see in major pharmacies. It will also open up the manual door market at gas stations, convenient stores and small retailers, so it's a market-expansion play as well. 
Now moving the Industrial segment and down to Engineered Fastening, we have an exciting new stud welding system being introduced as we speak in the Emhart Teknologies business. This system replaces a very successful but dated system that was first introduced in 2002 and is still the market-leading system. The first installation of this new system occurs this quarter at a major German auto manufacturer. The key features: This is easily networked, it's highly programmable. A technician or an engineer at an auto OEM's headquarters can monitor the performance of these systems all around the world when they're installed. It uses 70% less air, so it is environmentally-friendly. It has a much faster feeding mechanism, which provides for productivity, exceptionally high levels of quality, and it's just another key product development that keeps our Emhart business ahead of the competition. 
And then finally, moving over to Industrial & Automotive Repair, there is also a very important product introduction going on, which is called the EXPERT line, and this is a global product family of professional hand tools for Industrial & Automotive Repair at the mid-price point. It replaces five brands, Tona, Pastorino, Britool [ph] (00:34:49) and two others. When completely implemented, it will reduce the SKU count from 7,000 to about 2,500, and yet each one of those served markets for those brands will have a more broader product line covering that market area. It is a complete offering of high-quality tools at a value price point, and as I said, it offers a global market coverage, and it's essential to penetrate the emerging markets where the price points are a bit lower. So it's a very strategic offering and introduction for the Industrial & Automotive Repair business. 
We shift now to have a look at the CDIY segment, they had a terrific organic growth quarter. They grew their total revenues to $1.3 billion, roughly at a $5 billion run rate. The legacy CDIY Stanley business was up 8% organically, Worldwide Product Tools and Accessories, up 7%. And as you can see and John mentioned, revenues grew in all regions of the world, led by Latin America, which had volume increases of 26%, and Asia, which was up 14% in this segment. 
North America, despite the weakness in the marketplace, was up 6% and EMEA was up 9%. And interestingly, now emerging markets in this segment account for about 20% of sales and with them growing at about a 20% rate. That gives about four points of organic growth to their total segment, which is a nice growth booster, and it will be a specially nice one. The core markets in North America and Europe pick up, and we'll have that additive volume increase on top of it. 
We talked at length about the new 12-volt compact lithium products. We'll dwell on that as well as the Hand Tool introductions. I will touch upon the segment profit rate, which improved 360 basis points on a pro forma basis. Even though when you look at the Stanley 14% legacy last year, it's now mixing into a 13.2% in the third quarter '10 in the combined company. But the important part is the pro forma comparison, up from 9.6% to 13.2%, with productivity, the cost synergies and operating leverage are more than offsetting headwinds such as FX and inflation. 
There has been some chatter in the early notes about concerns regarding sequential decline in Construction and CDIY segment. Profit rate, I'd start by mentioning that we did --  we mentioned that on the last call, that we expected to see some degradation in the profit rates, so that shouldn't come as a surprise. It was a 2.4 point [ph] (0:37:25) sequential decline, and it was driven by the new product introduction rollout for the lithium ion. We did have some FX and inflation impact as well, and we also had a mix impact going from high outdoor content in 2Q to lower outdoor content in 3Q, something which generally happens every year and one should be aware of in this business. So we're going to have some fluctuation on the operating margin rates from quarter-to-quarter, nothing to be concerned about. A lot of it had to do with spending on the lithium-ion introductions. 
Now we'll move over to Security. Today, it's about 25% of the company. The total revenues were up 40% to $563 million. All of the growth was derived from acquisitions, including the SSDS, as John mentioned, formerly ADT France acquisition, as well as the Black & Decker merger accounting for that growth. Our legacy Stanley Security Solutions business was actually down 3% organically, and the HHI business was up 3%. 
As you can see from the regional revenue, it's still fairly North American-centric, and the segment profit rate was down 360 basis points, but only 280 if you exclude the acquisition. So a very high third quarter '09 profit rate and a much more normalized third quarter '10 at 18%, excluding HHI and SSDS. 
We were very positive about what was being observed in the Convergent Security Solutions business, with their first organic growth quarter in quite some time, even just up 1%. But what was really encouraging was the order rates, which were up 11%, so very, very significant improvement in backlog, which is encouraging. The national accounts are gaining momentum. The small accounts have stabilized, and so it looks like a pretty good story there with RMR growth in the quarter and orders improving. 
We've talked a little bit about SSDS already. The works council process is complete. The restructuring is well underway. That will occur for probably the next six months or so, and the OM percent should approach line average by the end of 2011. And then Healthcare Solutions has also had a nice performance, up 9% organically. Strength across the platform and the 2011 Healthcare acquisition pipeline is growing. So that's a growth platform for the company, I'd expect to see some activity there as we go forward. 
On the Mechanical side, they're still battling tough market conditions. They had a negative 6% organic growth in legacy Stanley, five points of that was attributable to a large retail customer de-stocking residential hardware. That was pretty much as expected. We also had Access Technologies, good performance there, with strong service, strong remodeling activity, offset by continued commercial hardware weakness, which is market-related. It was down 3% in the Best Access business, Mechanical Access Solutions. 
And then Black & Decker HHI was a bright spot, with 3% organic growth. Kwikset, SmartKey successes continue and the Baldwin Prestige line is being well accepted, and that more than countered the market weakness that they encountered as well with inventory corrections in their business. And then the operating margin rate for the Mechanical Business was pretty much consistent with the prior year despite their volume issues, which I think was an achievement. 
Now the star of the quarter from a segment perspective was Industrial. Their total revenues were up 152% to $517 million, with a stunning 26% organic growth in the legacy Stanley Industrial business. Remember, that comes against some fairly easy comps, but still a great achievement. And then equally as impressive, 27% growth in the Emhart Teknologies business. Profit rate was up substantially. A lot of that was driven by the mix into Emhart, which was very profitable, as well as CRC-Evans, successful integration of that acquisition continues. 
As we move to the various pieces and parts, Industrial & Automotive Repair business had a nice quarter, with volume up 20%. The inventory restocking continued at the customer level but at a smaller pace. And we feel that about 2/3 of the growth was attributable to end-user demand increases and clearly, some share gains going on in this business, and we also had strengths in our Asian emerging markets. 
Within Europe, the organic revenues were up 9%. North America IAR, which includes Mac, Proto and Vidmar, was up 40%, with Proto share gains really a fairly significant level as they continue to penetrate distribution more deeply and continue to bring some new products into the mix. 
And then Engineered Fastening sales growth was driven by strong OEM production rates in Americas and in Japan. And they also achieved record operating profit. But interesting, global auto production was only up 8% overall, so this business also benefited from customer mix, platform mix within customers, geographic mix and just general good market operating performance in the business. And then finally, CRC-Evans contributed $49 million to revenues and 70 basis points to the profit rates. 
I'll move now to working capital very briefly. There's about $2 billion now in working capital. We had a nice 0.4 or 10% increase in the turns to 4.6. But included in that 4.6 is sort of a dichotomy between the legacy Stanley, which is at about 8.3 turns and accounts for about $500 million of that $2 billion of working capital, and the remainder is associated with the Black & Decker and some of the new acquisitions that we did this year. So an 11% overall sales increase, working capital is up 1%. When you look at the components, such as inventory, for example, which is at 85 days, legacy Stanley is at 68 and legacy Black & Decker is at 98, so huge room for opportunity there. 
And we have similar but not as dramatic room for improvement in the DSO, which is 65 days in total but 61, Stanley legacy, and 69, Black & Decker legacy. And then in payables, there clearly is a big opportunity there as well with a 62-day overall average, but with legacy Stanley at 74 days and legacy Black & Decker at 53. So that kind of highlights the opportunity, and we'll talk more as we go on here over the coming quarters about how the Stanley Fulfillment System principles will be applied to the Black & Decker legacy activities as well as some of the new acquisitions to extract over as much as we can out of this $2 billion of working capital. And clearly, there's an opportunity of some substantial magnitude if you consider the fact that the legacy Stanley's at 8.3 turns. If we could get that 4.6 up a couple of turns, it would really result in hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental improvement. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Don Allan, who's going to take you through some more details on the financials."
304977,113996630,80521,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Let's start with the free cash flow statement here. Just a reminder for everyone, it does exclude special charges, so we had special payments related to the merger in the third quarter of $81 million and year-to-date, $200 million. Obvious",2293,"Thank you, Jim. Let's start with the free cash flow statement here. Just a reminder for everyone, it does exclude special charges, so we had special payments related to the merger in the third quarter of $81 million and year-to-date, $200 million. Obviously, you can see the effect of the merger, the net income and the depreciation and amortization increasing significantly year-over-year by about $140 million. 
The most significant thing to note here is really that working capital is negative to the first three quarters of the year. And although we're pleased with our working capital performance so far this year, we did take a bit of a step back in the third quarter from the second quarter as our working capital turns went from 5.1 to 4.6 as anticipated. But as we look forward to the fourth quarter, we have detailed plans and forecasts in place that we believe we will actually achieve close to 5 or 5.2 working capital turns by the end of the year, which is what our plan was back in March as we began to put the two companies together. So a bulk of that $183 million of the negative that you're seeing year-to-date and possibly all of it will likely disappear as a result of that significant working capital performance that we expect in the fourth quarter. 
And keep in mind, both companies have a history of having strong working capital performances in the fourth quarter due to the seasonality nature of both businesses, as well as the timing of certain events that happen within the quarter, third quarter versus fourth quarter. 
The last thing I'll mention on this page is that looking at the bottom line or the free cash flow, you can see that even with that negative, we achieved $234 million of free cash flow in the third quarter and now are very close to $500 million of free cash flow year-to-date. And looking back at historical trends of the company on a combined basis, both companies tend to achieve about 2/3 of their free cash flow for the year by the end of September. And if you take that analytical view, that would mean we will achieve close to $725 million, $750 million of free cash flow. Hence, why we believe we're going to exceed $700 million of free cash flow for the year. 
Moving now to the balance sheet. Again, this is a comparison prior year related to third quarter of '09 as Stanley only. So the third quarter of 2010 includes the merged company, and obviously, the variances are being driven by the impact of the two companies being put together. A couple of things that I want to point out here, though. Obviously, our cash balances are significant, $1.6 million worldwide. All of that is currently overseas, and we continue to evaluate potential options as we go forward, bringing some of that cash home through different means. It will be something that we will be finalizing in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Debt is at $3.4 billion, and it's up slightly from the second quarter as we did issue a set of bonds, 30-year bonds at 5.2% back in September. We're very pleased with that issuance and at that rate and its ability for us to spread out some of our maturities as we go forward. 
And then last, but certainly not least, on this page is capital ratios. We're at about 33% debt-to-capital. When you adjust for our hybrid instruments, we're around 29% to 30%. And so that's a continued improvement of where we started back in the first quarter, and for those, ratios were respectively 35% and 31%. So we feel like we're on track for our objectives around debt by the end of the year. 
So I want to spend a little time on the next page, which has to do with our outlook around some of our segments and primarily focused on revenue. I want to start with the CDIY segment. We are anticipating a low single-digit growth rate on a pro forma basis for the fourth quarter. But there's a couple of things to clarify related to that. We mentioned in the press release that there were tougher prior-year comparisons. And to be specific with that is when you compare fourth quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter of 2009 to this business, Black & Decker last year had 14 weeks of activity in that number. It's just the timing of their fiscal calendar compared to what we will have this year, which will be 13 weeks. That impact actually had a drag of about four points on the CDIY growth number. 
So as an example, if the business was going to grow 2% in our current forecast, on an apples-to-apples basis, it's actually growing 6%. So I think it's important for folks to understand what we mean by a tougher prior-year comparisons in this particular case. And I'll also give you a sense of the magnitude of that for the total company on the next page. Jim talked about the successful 12-volt rollout, and I'm not going to harp on that. But clearly, that is a significant impact, and it's helping to offset some of that timing issues that I described with those headwinds. 
Sequentially, the operating profit will see pressure in the fourth quarter as we will have increased promotions, negative currency effect, as well as lower absorption. So we will see a bit of a sequential decline from third to fourth quarter in CDIY's results of  those items.  We continue to see really nice growth in Latin America and Asia and expect that to continue in the fourth quarter, although we will likely to yield a little bit of a weaker performance in the U.S. and Europe, primarily because of the comparison issue that I described earlier. 
Moving on to Security. As Jim mentioned, Security had a nice quarter on the Electronic Security side of the business as well as HHI. Mechanical Access continues to see some pressure related to the commercial construction markets, as well as that inventory correction item that Jim mentioned related to the third quarter. We think that we will see a slight revenue decline in the fourth quarter for the overall segment on a pro forma basis, and that's indicative of the fact that I just mentioned. The good news is that CSS order flow continues to be strong and solid, and that's really being driven by activity in the national accounts in North America. So we're pleased that there appears to be a positive trend and acceleration occurring in that business. 
We have seen an uptick in delayed and abandoned construction projects in that Commercial Construction sector of the Mechanical Access business, so that's really creating that pressure that I described. And then of course, the Residential Hardware business is historically weak in the fourth quarter due to seasonality, but we are seeing a bit of an offset from the continued success of the SmartKey products, as well as the Baldwin Prestige product lines. So we do expect a little bit of growth from that business in the fourth quarter but not of the magnitude we saw in previous quarters. 
Industrial, mid single-digit pro forma organic growth rates, so we are continuing to see nice growth in this particular area. We don't expect to see the growth of the magnitude that we saw in the third and fourth quarter, which was 20%, 30% range as a result of a couple of things. One, we're definitely seeing, we believe, that the customer restocking has ended. We saw a little bit of that occur in the third quarter, as John described. We don't expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. 
Also, we do see lower global automotive production forecast around the world. So as a result, our Engineered Fastening business will likely not see the type of growth rates and leverage they saw in the third quarter. So that will be a bit of an offsetting pressure to some of the positives we're seeing in North American Industrial Distribution business that continues to be strong, and we expect that to be strong in the fourth quarter. And then the Mobile Distribution and Industrial Storage business will show modest growth as well. We think we'll also see strength in our infrastructure business as we expect to see growth in particular emerging markets as you see here on the page. 
So to summarize the guidance on Page 17, this is our updated outlook for 2010. Again, it excludes onetime charges related to the merger with BDK, as well as the acquisition of SSDS or ADT France and CRC-Evans. And just as a reminder to folks, those charges are the following as far as guidance for the year: For restructuring-related, we still believe it'll be $245 million to $295 million, probably closer to the high end of the range as a result of, what John described, with higher synergies being achieved in 2010. The onetime SG&A and other costs will approximate $135 million, so that's up slightly from July as a result of activity there associated with ADT France and CRC-Evans in particular. And in the inventory step-up, which is an accounting charge, will be about $175 million, $170 million related to BDK and $5 million related to CRC. 
So our guidance increases then to $3.60 to $3.70. So we've increased that from $3.35 to a high end of $3.55 from back in July. And what are the factors that are really driving that? Well, first of all, the second half organic sales growth, we believe, is now going to approximate 5%, where we said 4% to 5% back in July. We saw 8% pro forma growth in the third quarter of 2010. Clearly, that implies a slower growth in the fourth quarter to get to a 5% number. It implies about 2%. But that extra week phenomena, those tougher prior-year comps that I described, is really causing about a three-point drag in that comparison. So if you made an apples-to-apples comparison, it will be about a 5% growth number year-over-year. 
Gross margins, we will see a sequential decline of probably 50 to 80 basis points from the third quarter. That's very much in line with historical trends for both businesses, as we tend to see lower absorption in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And this year, we'll actually see a little bit of additional currency pressure as well. So there's a little bit of pressure there on the gross margin line. And then also, we'll also see some additional promotional costs in SG&A that will cause some pressure on the operating margin line. 
The good news, as John mentioned, cost synergy realization is up to $125 million in 2010. As we mentioned in July, we achieved $30 million in the second quarter. John mentioned $45 million in the third quarter. And so that would mean we're going to achieve about $50 million in the fourth quarter to get to the $125 million for the year. 
Other items that are not in the page related to the guidance there are no changes that we've communicated in the past is the two acquisitions of SSDS and CRC-Evans. We don't expect any major changes to that guidance that we've provided previously around EPS, as well as the BDK intangible amortization, that's still expected to be $55 million. The tax rate is in the range of 26% to 27% for the full year, so that implies a lower tax rate for the fourth quarter because we're at almost 28% through the first three quarters of this year. 
Other restructuring, which is restructuring unrelated to BDK, ADT France and CRC, is still expected to be $30 million to $40 million, which means we'll have a rather large charge in the fourth quarter of anywhere from $12 million to $17 million, depending on certain activities and timing of events. 
And then commodity inflation continues to be a pressure for us in the back half of the year compared to the prior year. As you look at commodity prices versus the second half of 2009, we're still seeing 20% to 40% increases. Those are all items that are consistent with what we've said in the past, and there's no significant changes there.  The net effect of this on a cash basis, cash EPS is now expected to be $4.34, up to $4.44 for 2010, and that excludes approximately $175 million of amortization. The last thing I'll mention on this page is to reaffirm that the free cash flow for 2010 is expected to exceed $700 million as I described earlier. 
So to summarize the presentation portion, we definitely feel like the third quarter is an illustration of how our integration continues to be proficient and effective. The cost synergies for 2010 have been raised to $125 million as we had indicated. And we're very pleased to see earlier-than-expected profitability with our French electronic security business, SSDS. The 2011 forecasted cost synergies, to drive 10% to 15% profit growth above and beyond core business growth, and then organic growth across majority of business driven by the footprint in emerging markets and all the new product innovation that Jim described. 
The second quarter restocking activity has moderated as we expected in the third quarter, and we the don't expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned, free cash flow guidance has been raised, and we expect significant fourth quarter 2010 working capital benefits. With that, I'm going to pass the call back to Kate White, so she can clarify a few items related to outstanding shares and EPS projections here."

What we also said when we made the acquisition and we're pretty much on track, we displayed relatively low purchase price. We have upwards of $50 million to spend on restructuring of that business. But when you add the purchase price and the restructuring together in our capital base, as Jim talked about the quarter when we made this acquisition, it has the potential to be an extraordinarily high ROCE acquisition. Obviously, it's going to be accretive because we've taken up a large negative and turned it into a modest and we think, much larger positive going forward. And the capital base is still going to be extraordinary low relative to its revenues and profitability. I think your estimate of profitability, we'd like to get there. I think that's fairly aggressive and fairly early. That would imply a high teens, low 20s operating margins. We didn't commit or undertake to get there quite that quickly. But that's the direction we're going, and sooner rather than later, it will be line average with our Electronic Security business."

I think Jim has pointed out and Jeff Ansell team's doing a great job getting these new products into the market, where we're catching up in a very big hurry and the market's accepting it well. I'd say there's no reason why we can't regain the three to five share points lost over the last three years. And just in fact, if we're able to do that, we'll be growing the Power Tools side of the business at 2x the rate of the market too. So that's not a volume projection going forward. Some of these products have only been in the marketplace less than three months. There'll be others the first half of next year. But yes, we are optimistic with our new product pipeline with the Hand Tool and Power Tool team that are coming together to form a very, very powerful business unit, good customer reaction to what we've shown so far.

Obviously, the momentum that derives from coming out of this hopefully trough part of the cycle with the additive benefit of the new products and with the additive benefit of whatever revenue synergies we're able to achieve, should enable us for years to come to achieve that better-than-GDP growth for the organic growth for the company. But then the question becomes, as we get a couple of years into this, what happens? And that's why we have this five growth platforms. That's why when you look at what we're acquiring in these growth platforms, we're looking for higher growth, higher margins, higher organic growth, higher-margin areas so that we can reduce our dependency on slower growth markets. So you'll see a portfolio shift that we think over the coming years, where Security, Mechanical Security, Electronic Security, Engineered Fastening, Healthcare, Infrastructure, really do grow as important platforms in the business and take a much larger share of the revenue as we head into the next down-cycle years from now on the Tools side."

First, yes, we see that much accretion based on three months of owning CRC. We've inherited an extraordinarily capable management team, and we're inserting two or three functional Stanley leaders into the business as well. It's off to a very good start, and we remain enthusiastic about the business, about the ability to grow organically, about its ability to add meaningful value, both on an ROC basis and on an accretion basis. With the second one, we're looking at many different platforms. It won't surprise you that multiples for some of the Healthcare opportunities that Jim referred to are higher than six to eight. In the Tools space, that's pretty much what they are. For five years, we answered questions in Security, when we were trading at six to seven, how can you make acquisitions at 10x to 11x EBITDA and have it not destroy value? The answer is simply 10x to 11x EBITDA for higher growth, higher margin businesses, that's what the market requires. And within two or three years, they're back to 4x to 6x, which is what we've done with HSM, what we've done with Sonitrol and what we've done with other businesses. The same will apply outside Industrial Tools going forward. To the extent we pay a higher multiple than the multiple at which we're trading, it will be with the understanding in the plan between synergies and growth to have that multiple be well within our range, and as a consequence, have it create value for our shareholders. It's probably worth mentioning that the entire management team at Stanley Black & Decker's long-term incentive is based equally on earnings growth and return on capital employed. So the acquisition market is heating up. It's more competitive. More sponsors are showing up and showed up even six months ago to compete for attractive properties. That being said, it's not a lot of change from what we've been dealing with for the last six years. We'll maintain our financial discipline. We'll maintain our both strategic review and financial hurdle rates and look at each acquisition opportunity on its own merits."

So it's tough to recover a lot of price when you don't have the products to back it up, so I suggest what we're doing now in the Power Tool business is that we are gradually introducing these new families of cordless products to recapture the market share, and we will do what we need to do to re-establish ourselves at the market share position where we think is optimal, given the various facts and circumstances in the marketplace. Now that said, I think that if I were to be completely objective, I think that pricing is probably more of a core competency on a functional basis at many of the Stanley legacy businesses, and we have some folks in our pricing center of excellence already working with the legacy Black & Decker folks to help implement that within their system. And I'd say the same is true for the granularity of the analysis related to operations, costs, in particular, related to procurement, which they didn't do on a centralized basis and legacy Stanley did, which meant not only did we have, perhaps, more opportunity to leverage the supply base over a larger base, but also have more timely information that could be actually cycled into the pricing analysis and strategy process. And I think that is definitely something that Don Allan and his team are going to be working diligently on over the coming quarters to get at the same level the legacy Stanley was at. That said, it's one of the most positive surprises of all year, and we didn't have a chance to see these families of new products that have been developed by the legacy Black & Decker folks in Power Tools. We had to take it on faith because we couldn't get access to it during the -- due to diligence process for any trust reasons. We had to take it on faith that these products would be everything that they indicated that they would be from an attractiveness perspective, and we couldn't be happier. We couldn't be happier with the team that developed these products, where the products themselves and the future that that actually portends for the Power Tool business."

In terms of deal sizes, for the next 6 to 12 months, we're not looking at deals well above $500 million unless it were to be a game-changing opportunity and timing over which we have no control because, as Don pointed out, despite we're going to have $700 million in cash flow, if we look at this year, we're spending close to $400 million to achieve the synergies, we're paying a dividend. That pretty much takes care of cash flow without changing the structure of our balance sheet. Going forward, if we look at $700 million-plus, the dividend, repay a couple of hundred million in debt to be solidly where the rating agencies need us to be, we still have $400 million to $500 million to spend. That should give you a flavor, Jim, either cumulatively or with one large deal without issuing equity, the size we're looking at. In terms of the platforms, again, it's the same. Jim alluded to it.

The multiples will be a little higher, but as I responded to Mike Rehaut's question, we'll get those multiples down over time. But we're going to discriminate in favor of higher-growth, higher-margin businesses going forward to get our portfolio back towards roughly a third, a third, a third, which is not a concrete target, but we like the fact that being -- look five years out of $15 billion company with $5 billion in CDIY, $5 billion in Security and $5 billion in Industrial, that gives us a lot of leverage to pull up as a management team when and if the macro economic situation changes dramatically."

That's first and foremost, most obvious. But the same kind of cross-selling opportunities exist in all emerging markets. Remember, we focused at executive, an entire team, on what we call emerging markets Asia-Pacific group, and we have Jeff Chen focusing on mainland China. Ben Sihota from Black & Decker focusing on the other markets. So first and foremost, in the geographies, beyond that, they're going to take a little longer to incubate, and that's really all we're going to say at this point. Everything else, we've said in investor presentations, and we'll give you some more granularity on that in January when we wrap the year up. And to say quite frankly, how much cost synergy access, if you will, we have to fund some of these programs.

But the weeks on hand with the legacy Stanley, which I think will be a good proxy for CDIY, right around 12, which was a couple of weeks lower than it was in 2005, for those of us that remember back that far. 2005 was the year that the large retailers, three of them shut off ordering in the middle of December. And so we don't think that that scenario is likely. But we see a scenario where point-of-sale is not robust at most of these customers. It's not terrible. It's just kind of bumping along flattish kind of territory. And our invoice sales was very consistent from a volume point of view, from a unit point of view with that in the legacy Stanley business in the third quarter. So as we step back from it, I'd say we probably see caution in the winds at the retailers, and part of our outlook reflects that. So I think we've kind of baked in the environment in a very reasonable way here. As we look forward into 2011, clearly, the product introductions that are occurring as we speak will have several quarters of opportunity to manifest themselves in sales gains. We'll have some additional product introductions coming in several areas, including Power Tools, as we head into next year, so that will help us. And I think on balance, the product introductions will provide a nice buffer if we continue to have sluggish environment. We're not suggesting that we will, but it's too early for us to call what the environment for 2011 is going to be, and that's why we'll have much more granularity around the guidance in the fourth quarter earnings release in January."

A bit unknown with Industrial because we don't get really great data with the customers for the most part are relatively small, the distributors. And we don't get the same granularity of data that we get with our CDIY business in the U.S., for example. So a lot of our conclusions have to come from discussing with sales folks and sales management, what their observations are in the marketplace. And we don't have great visibility into, say, the tool cribs, where things are really kind of stocked and restocked. But we do have reasonable qualitative visibility into the distribution channel. And we think what occurred during the de-stocking phase was probably -- there was kind of a really significant de-stocking throughout the whole system, from the distributors to the dealers to the tool crib folks to secretaries hoarding office supplies because nobody knew if they were going to be able to order anymore. So now I think what's happening is that, really, Industrial production was not at 20% in our world. And we think about a third of it was restocking. We think another third of it was share gain, and so the last third would've been kind of market growth, if you will. And that seems to be a little bit higher than the production levels, so maybe there's some restocking going on within the factories that buy these kind of Industrial tools. But at least at the distributor level, we think it's run its course. Now for the CDIY, I pretty much covered everything that I can say about inventories at this point in time, which is that they're averaging about 12 weeks, our largest U.S. customers. And we don't anticipate any or shattering inventory corrections, but we are very cautious with respect to -- they're very cautious with respect to their inventory levels. And I think they will be playing wait-and-see here with the upcoming season. And if the season doesn't seem to be playing out in the late November, early December time frame, there is a chance that there could be more inventory correction than normal in this particular year, even though their inventories are in pretty good shape. They're about two weeks on the average lower than they were in '05 when we had -- they essentially took two weeks out of December, all three of the biggest retailers in the country. So as I said earlier, our guidance reflects some conservatism and caution with respect to the tone of the CDIY market, and we shall see where things kind of play out as the season goes here."

The way we maintain pricing, of course, as Jim alluded to, our pricing center of excellence sees the raw materials increases coming. And we've historically done a very good job. We've recovered about 75% to 85% of raw materials inflation over time. The rest, we have to get with productivity to maintain margins, which we've been able to do. The second way to ensure that we maintain margins in terms of prices, to do what Jim alluded to on the first page of his piece of the presentation, specifically by introducing new and improved products at higher price points and allowing the previous products to waterfall down, if necessary, to a slightly lower price point, allows us to maintain margins. We, of course, have to add features and benefits to do that because simply asking for more price for an existing product, even in the face of materials inflation, is very difficult for our customers to accept. They're trying to provide, obviously, the lowest prices possible to their end users. So the pricing environment's no different than it's been for the last five years. And our modus operandi, the way we're dealing with it, it's essentially no different, at least from the legacy Stanley side. Add features and benefits that you can get paid for, command a higher price, having the leading brands in the category gives you the right, as well as the obligation, to be the price leader. And that's our strategy that we will continue to employ in the months to come should materials increase even more than we're anticipating."

As Kate said, our press release is out this morning, and the headlines are highlights that you should have taken away or that some good solid organic growth has resumed, and our integration process is exceeding q",1611,"Thanks, Kate, and good morning, everybody. As Kate said, our press release is out this morning, and the headlines are highlights that you should have taken away or that some good solid organic growth has resumed, and our integration process is exceeding quite well and perhaps ahead of expectations. 
We reported pro forma revenues of increase of 11% to $2.4 billion. Organic revenues, up 8% as the legacy Stanley and legacy Black & Decker businesses grew 7% and 9%, respectively. $0.97 diluted EPS excluding the charges or $0.73 GAAP earnings including the charges. Strong free cash flow, $234 million. That excludes onetime payments of the $81 million as outlined in our press release. 
The CDIY segment grew. Organic revenues were up 7%, and there was quite a lot of successful new product activity that Jim Loree is going to highlight for you in a few minutes. We saw top line growth in Convergent, albeit a modest 1%. Order trends are increasing, and our French security business, SSDS, Stanley Solutions de Sècuritè, formerly the ADT France business, turned profitable during the quarter. That is extremely noteworthy that six to nine months earlier than our projections, and remember, this is a business that was losing up to $15 million a year for the last two years. Bernard Recherme and his team in France and Europe is doing a really good job putting those two businesses together and turning them profitable well ahead of schedule. 
The customer restocking moderated within the Industrial Segment, but end user demand did remain strong. Our full year guidance, we increased. Excluding onetime charges, we increased our range to $3.81 to $3.91, and it's $3.60 to $3.70 if we exclude the $0.21 second quarter 2010 tax-related benefit that we achieved. 
Strong free cash flow has led us to increase our free cash flow guidance for the year. Now we expect to exceed $700 million, where previously, we thought that $600 million or slightly above $600 million was a more appropriate target. 
And last but not least, our cost synergy estimate for 2010 has increased to $125 million as the integration progress remains ahead of plan. Now you're going to see the impact of the increase from $90 million to $125 million in Don's outlook in a few minutes. But essentially, we've taken the third quarter performance, which was driven by both improved volume and synergy achievement, and rolled it into the annual guidance in conjunction with the slight improvement in fourth quarter outlook, driven primarily by the improved synergy realization, and we rolled that into our annual guidance as well. 
Looking quickly around the globe, we saw organic revenue growth in every geographic market. If we look at our large two established markets, middle left, the U.S, which represents 56% of our total, and Europe, which represents 24% of our total, mid to high single-digit growth in both of those markets. 
Looking at our smaller established markets, specifically Canada and Australia, they showed reasonable growth as well, 8% in Australia and 11% in Canada, while the emerging markets really, really began to gain or keep the further traction. Latin America grew an extraordinary 27%, off a high $500 million base, and we saw strong growth in Asia as well, albeit off a lower base, 23% organic growth across Asia. 
Looking to our results, the earnings increased 26% as stated, excluding the onetime costs. The $0.97 excluded $58 million or $0.24 a share, and we provided significant detail in the press release on Page 4 of the makeup of those charges, including both the cash and non-cash elements. 
Importantly, the 3Q '09 excludes any impact of Black & Decker as that transaction did not close, as you well know, until the middle of March 2010. I think the other point worthy of note on the chart as it relates to margins and tax rate, 27% tax rate, which Don will explain, is more in line with what we anticipate the ongoing tax rate to be. We achieved the $0.97 with the 27% tax rate. If you compare that to year ago, the 22.1% tax rate included a large audit settlement that we were able to book in the third quarter of 2009. So aided by $45 million of realized synergies that hit the P&L in the third quarter, we got the $0.97. 
Looking at sources of growth, as mentioned previously, 8% organic growth on a pro forma basis. So across the board, with the exception of legacy Stanley Mechanical Security, we grew in every business, and that was quite encouraging. The sources of growth on the left, as you can see, were 7%. Currency was a negative 2% impact. Remember, the currency, particularly the euro relative to the dollar, has changed dramatically in the last six or eight weeks. But currency was negative 2% in the quarter and then, of course, the large addition from the impact of the Black & Decker business and, to a lesser extent, our CRC-Evans acquisition. 
I think more importantly on the right-hand side, if we look at the legacy Stanley, legacy Black & Decker businesses, good high single-digit organic growth in aggregate. The strength clearly in Industrial, but strong performance in CDIY and Security, essentially flat across the combination of the two businesses to get us to our blended total of 8%. 
New products, as I mentioned earlier, contributed to the volume. Good performance in emerging markets. Strong industrial order flow, all helping those numbers. And Jim's going to give you more detail on the segments in just a minute. 
I think the integration remains a very high interest certainly to us and everyone on the call, and it's on track with several key initiatives well ahead of schedule. The process remains disciplined. We've certainly not stopped the rhythm and rigor around putting these two companies together. The Steering Committee meets on a biweekly basis with the six most senior executives in the company. The majority of the original integration team, you will recall, the integration team's consisted -- the 13 teams consisted of a Stanley executive, a Black & Decker executive and an outside consultant from Bain & Company. Many of them have been deployed back to the business or they've been able to be redeployed to work on some revenue synergy projects, and that's a very important thing. So the majority of these teams are led by now one person, some are led by two. And internalization is complete, simply meaning we're finished with our outside counsel. It served us extremely well, but we've taken this process over on our own, and there's some cost savings, of course, associated with that. 
The cost synergies are absolutely ahead of plan. $45 million realized in the third quarter, which has allowed us to take our estimate of what we will actually achieve in 2010 up to $125 million. That's up $35 million from our last estimate due primarily to effective execution. The biggest areas or the most important areas where we're achieving it is in sourcing and within the regional business unit, the consolidation of Hand and Power Tools, although there are plethora of examples where both functional and business projects are ahead of schedule, those being the two largest impacts. As a consequence, we are likely to exceed the $350 million target that we've given from the outset of putting these two companies together. And as we said in our press release, we are refining the estimate and the extent of outperformance and how much we're going to reinvest in growth projects, and we will intend, when the year is finished in December, when we report in January, to give a precise estimate of how high up can be and what we intend to do with any overachievement. 
We made the points before, but I think it's worth re-emphasizing. To the extent we exceed the cost synergies, we're going to look very hard at costs to achieve the incremental synergies. If it's not a good business proposition, we're not going to do it. We're also going to look at the business risk associated, the risk to fill rates, the risk to the organization, the risk to anything that matters in terms of how we run our business and judgmentally weigh that against the added value of the opportunity to achieve synergies. And of equal or greater importance, what I just mentioned, to the extent we do exceed $350 million, we think it's quite prudent, given the existing environment, to reinvest some of that overachievement in driving growth at or above the rate of the market, some of which we've already done and some of which we will continue in the years going forward. 
Last but not least, I want to touch on revenue synergies. They are compelling. We're refining them as well as how and where to assign the appropriate accountability, the timing and what the opportunities are. The regional business teams have already begun to implement some quick hits, and you saw that in the top line growth in the third quarter. And as we've said previously, the geographic opportunities, for an example, Latin America, are likely among the earliest and the largest. Some of the other very meaningful revenue synergies are still there. They're gaining traction. We're being able to quantify them better and better as time goes on. But they will take a little longer than some of the geographic synergies. Now let me turn it over to Jim Loree to talk about some of the new product successes that helped us in the third quarter as well as give you a look at some more details inside the segments."
304977,113996630,80540,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, John. It's never a better time than during a downturn to redouble your efforts on new product development and share gain. And both companies had been doing that during this last downturn, and I think what we're seeing now is the manifestatio",2216,"Okay. Thanks, John. It's never a better time than during a downturn to redouble your efforts on new product development and share gain. And both companies had been doing that during this last downturn, and I think what we're seeing now is the manifestation of that, not just in Power Tools but across the company and across the globe. But in Power Tools, it's perhaps one of the most exciting product introductions in years for the Black & Decker legacy businesses, with three new families of compact cordless 12-volt lithium-ion power tools now hitting the market. Each of these families, the Black & Decker, the DEWALT and the Porter-Cable families, are uniquely designed for their target markets. Each are differentiated to offer compelling value propositions versus competitive lines, and so far, the market reaction has been outstanding. Simply put, they are the best 12-volt cordless compact tools in the marketplace, and I encourage you to go to the website and research them some more. Go to the stores because they're in stores as we speak. 
And I would say in addition to the Power Tools, the Hand Tool business and the freshness of the product line is also extremely high with the rollout of a new storage line at a large U.S. mass merchant with the introduction of FatMax mechanics tools and air tools for the Canadian market, and of course, the Bostitch hand tools that were introduced earlier this year, which had been extremely well received and are performing even better at the point-of-sale than the FatMax introduction of about five, six years ago. So lots going on in the Construction and DIY business. Clearly, it is off the defense and on to the offense for this segment. 
But I mentioned across the company there's activity going on. Let's turn to Security. You can look at the three pictures here. First, the audio intrusion Panel. This is a new mid-price point panel for Sonitrol customers which cuts their installation cost for a small business installation by about 30%. And in Healthcare, the SpaceTRAX RFID inventory management system is an RFID-based kanban system for hospitals' supplies, which greatly enhances nurses' productivity in the hospitals. 
And then the six-panel telescoping door on the right there is designed to provide maximum clearance for openings for retailers where space is limited. For instance, it allows a 50-inch wide pass-through and a 70-inch wide opening, which may not sound like a lot, but that is the highest ratio of pass-through to rough opening that we're aware of in the marketplace. That product will replace the clunky bi-fold doors that you often see in major pharmacies. It will also open up the manual door market at gas stations, convenient stores and small retailers, so it's a market-expansion play as well. 
Now moving the Industrial segment and down to Engineered Fastening, we have an exciting new stud welding system being introduced as we speak in the Emhart Teknologies business. This system replaces a very successful but dated system that was first introduced in 2002 and is still the market-leading system. The first installation of this new system occurs this quarter at a major German auto manufacturer. The key features: This is easily networked, it's highly programmable. A technician or an engineer at an auto OEM's headquarters can monitor the performance of these systems all around the world when they're installed. It uses 70% less air, so it is environmentally-friendly. It has a much faster feeding mechanism, which provides for productivity, exceptionally high levels of quality, and it's just another key product development that keeps our Emhart business ahead of the competition. 
And then finally, moving over to Industrial & Automotive Repair, there is also a very important product introduction going on, which is called the EXPERT line, and this is a global product family of professional hand tools for Industrial & Automotive Repair at the mid-price point. It replaces five brands, [indiscernible] (00:34:49)Brit tool and two others. When completely implemented, it will reduce the SKU count from 7,000 to about 2,500, and yet each one of those served markets for those brands will have more a broader product line covering that market area. It is a complete offering of high-quality tools at a value price point, and as I said, it offers a global market coverage, and it's essential to penetrate the emerging markets where the price points are a bit lower. So it's a very strategic offering and introduction for the Industrial & Automotive Repair business. 
We shift now to have a look at the CDIY segment, they had a terrific organic growth quarter. They grew their total revenues to $1.3 billion, roughly at a $5 billion run rate. The legacy CDIY Stanley business was up 8% organically, Worldwide Product Tools and Accessories, up 7%. And as you can see and John mentioned, revenues grew in all regions of the world, led by Latin America, which had volume increases of 26%, and Asia, which was up 14% in this segment. 
North America, despite the weakness in the marketplace, was up 6% and EMEA was up 9%. And interestingly, now emerging markets in this segment account for about 20% of sales and with them growing at about a 20% rate, that gives about four points of organic growth to their total segment, which is a nice growth booster, and it will be a specially nice one. The core markets in North America and Europe pick up, and we'll have that additive volume increase on top of it. 
We talked at length about the new 12-volt compact lithium products. We'll dwell on that as well as the Hand Tool introductions. I will touch upon the segment profit rate, which improved 360 basis points on a pro forma basis. Even though when you look at the Stanley 14% legacy last year, it's now mixing into a 13.2% in the third quarter '10 in the combined company. But the important part is the pro forma comparison, up from 9.6% to 13.2%, with productivity, the cost synergies and operating leverage are more than offsetting headwinds such as FX and inflation. 
There has been some chatter in the early notes about concerns regarding sequential decline in Construction and CDIY segment. Profit rate, I'd start by mentioning that we did --  we mentioned that on the last call, that we expected to see some degradation in the profit rates, so that shouldn't come as a surprise. It was a 2.4 point sequential decline, and it was driven by the new product introduction rollout for the lithium ion. We did have some FX and inflation impact as well, and we also had a mix impact going from high outdoor content in 2Q to lower outdoor content in 3Q, something which generally happens every year and one should be aware of in this business. So we're going to have some fluctuation on the operating margin rates from quarter-to-quarter, nothing to be concerned about. A lot of it had to do with spending on the lithium-ion introductions. 
Now we'll go over to Security. Today, it's about 25% of the company. The total revenues were up 40% to $563 million. All of the growth was derived from acquisitions, including the SSDS, as John mentioned, formerly ADT France acquisition, as well as the Black & Decker merger accounting for that growth. Our legacy Stanley Security Solutions business was actually down 3% organically, and the HHI business was up 3%. 
As you can see from the regional revenue, it's still fairly North American-centric, and the segment profit rate was down 360 basis points, but only 280 if you exclude the acquisition. So a very high third quarter '09 profit rate and a much more normalized third quarter '10 at 18%, excluding HHI and SSDS. 
We were very positive about what was being observed in the Convergent Security Solutions business, with their first organic growth quarter in quite some time, even just up 1%. But what was really encouraging was the order rates, which were up 11%, so very, very significant improvement in backlog, which is encouraging. The national accounts are gaining momentum. The small accounts have stabilized, and so it looks like a pretty good story there with RMR growth in the quarter and orders improving. 
We've talked a little bit about SSDS already. The works council process is complete. The restructuring is well underway. That will occur for probably the next six months or so, and the OM percent should approach line average by the end of 2011. And then Healthcare Solutions has also had a nice performance, up 9% organically. Strength across the platform and the 2011 Healthcare acquisition pipeline is growing. So that's a growth platform for the company, I'd expect to see some activity there as we go forward. 
On the Mechanical side, they're still battling tough market conditions. They had a negative 6% organic growth in legacy Stanley, five points of that was attributable to a large retail customer destocking residential hardware. That was pretty much as expected. We also had Access Technologies, good performance there, with strong service, strong remodeling activity, offset by continued commercial hardware weakness, which is market-related. It was down 3% in the Best Access business, Mechanical Access Solutions. 
And then Black & Decker HHI was a bright spot, with 3% organic growth. Kwikset, SmartKey successes continue and the Baldwin Prestige line is being well accepted, and that more than countered the market weakness that they encountered as well with inventory corrections in their business. And then the operating margin rate for the Mechanical Business was pretty much consistent with the prior year despite their volume issues, which I think was an achievement. 
Now the star of the quarter from a segment perspective was Industrial. Their total revenues were up 152% to $517 million, with a stunning 26% organic growth in the legacy Stanley Industrial business. Remember, that comes against some fairly easy comps, but still a great achievement. And then equally as impressive, 27% growth in the Emhart Teknologies business. Profit rate was up substantially. A lot of that was driven by the mix into Emhart, which was very profitable, as well as CRC-Evans, successful integration of that acquisition continues. 
As we move to the various pieces and parts, Industrial & Automotive Repair business had a nice quarter, with volume up 20%. The inventory restocking continued at the customer level but at a smaller pace. And we feel that about 2/3 of the growth was attributable to end-user demand increases and clearly, some share gains going on in this business, and we also had strengths in our Asian emerging markets. 
Within Europe, the organic revenues were up 9%. North America IAR, which includes Mac, Proto and Vidmar, was up 40%, with Proto share gains really a fairly significant level as they continue to penetrate distribution more deeply and continue to bring some new products into the mix. 
And then Engineered Fastening sales growth was driven by strong OEM production rates in Americas and in Japan. And they also achieved record operating profit. But interesting, global auto production was only up 8% overall, so this business also benefited from customer mix, platform mix within customers, geographic mix and just general good market operating performance in the business. And then finally, CRC-Evans contributed $49 million to revenues and 70 basis points to the profit rate. 
I'll move now to working capital very briefly. There's about $2 billion now in working capital. We had a nice 0.4 or 10% increase in the turns to 4.6. But included in that 4.6 is sort of a dichotomy between the legacy Stanley, which is at about 8.3 turns and accounts for about $500 million of that $2 billion of working capital, and the remainder is associated with the Black & Decker and some of the new acquisitions that we did this year. So an 11% overall sales increase, working capital is up 1%. When you look at the components, such as inventory, for example, which is at 85 days, legacy Stanley is at 68 and legacy Black & Decker is at 98, so huge room for opportunity there. 
And we have similar but not as dramatic room for improvement in the DSO, which is 65 days in total but 61, Stanley legacy, and 69, Black & Decker legacy. And then in payables, there clearly is a big opportunity there as well with a 62-day overall average, but with legacy Stanley at 74 days and legacy Black & Decker at 53. So that kind of highlights the opportunity, and we'll talk more as we go on here over the coming quarters about how the Stanley Fulfillment System principles will be applied to the Black & Decker legacy activities as well as some of the new acquisitions to extract over as much as we can out of this $2 billion of working capital. And clearly, there's an opportunity of some substantial magnitude if you consider the fact that the legacy Stanley's at 8.3 turns. If we could get that 4.6 up a couple of turns, it would really result in hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental improvement. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Don Allan, who's going to take you through some more details on the financials."
304977,113996630,80540,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2010",2010-10-20,"Earnings Calls","Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Let's start with the free cash flow statement here. Just a reminder for everyone, it does exclude special charges, so we had special payments related to the merger in the third quarter of $81 million and year-to-date, $200 million. Obvious",2294,"Thank you, Jim. Let's start with the free cash flow statement here. Just a reminder for everyone, it does exclude special charges, so we had special payments related to the merger in the third quarter of $81 million and year-to-date, $200 million. Obviously, you can see the effect of the merger, the net income and the depreciation and amortization increasing significantly year-over-year by about $140 million. 
The most significant thing to note here is really that working capital is negative to the first three quarters of the year. And although we're pleased with our working capital performance so far this year, we did take a bit of a step back in the third quarter from the second quarter as our working capital turns went from 5.1 to 4.6 as anticipated. But as we look forward to the fourth quarter, we have detailed plans and forecasts in place that we believe we will actually achieve close to 5 or 5.2 working capital turns by the end of the year, which is what our plan was back in March as we began to put the two companies together. So a bulk of that $183 million of the negative that you're seeing year-to-date and possibly all of it will likely disappear as a result of that significant working capital performance that we expect in the fourth quarter. 
And keep in mind, both companies have a history of having strong working capital performances in the fourth quarter due to the seasonality nature of both businesses, as well as the timing of certain events that happened within the quarter, third quarter versus fourth quarter. 
The last thing I'll mention on this page is that looking at the bottom line or the free cash flow, you can see that even with that negative, we achieved $234 million of free cash flow in the third quarter and now are very close to $500 million of free cash flow year-to-date. And looking back at historical trends of the company on a combined basis, both companies tend to achieve about 2/3 of their free cash flow for the year by the end of September. And if you take that analytical view, that would mean we will achieve close to $725 million, $750 million of free cash flow. Hence, why we believe we're going to exceed $700 million of free cash flow for the year. 
Moving now to the balance sheet. Again, this is a comparison prior year related to third quarter of '09 as Stanley only. So the third quarter of 2010 includes the merged company, and obviously, the variances are being driven by the impact of the two companies being put together. A couple of things that I want to point out here, though. Obviously, our cash balances are significant, $1.6 billion worldwide. All of that is currently overseas, and we continue to evaluate potential options as we go forward, bringing some of that cash home through different means. It will be something that we will be finalizing in the fourth quarter of this year. 
Debt is at $3.4 billion, and it's up slightly from the second quarter as we did issue a set of bonds, 30-year bonds at 5.2% back in September. We're very pleased with that issuance and at that rate and its ability for us to spread out some of our maturities as we go forward. 
And then last, but certainly not least, on this page is capital ratios. We're at about 33% debt-to-capital. When we adjust for our hybrid instruments, we're around 29% to 30%. And so that's a continued improvement of where we started back in the first quarter, when those ratios were respectively 35% and 31%. So we feel like we're on track for our objectives around debt by the end of the year. 
So I want to spend a little time on the next page, which has to do with our outlook around some of our segments and primarily focused on revenue. I want to start with the CDIY segment. We are anticipating a low single-digit growth rate on a pro forma basis for the fourth quarter. But there's a couple of things to clarify related to that. We mentioned in the press release that there were tougher prior-year comparisons. And to be specific what that is, when you compare fourth quarter of 2010 to the fourth quarter of 2009 to this business, Black & Decker last year had 14 weeks of activity in that number. It's just the timing of their fiscal calendar compared to what we will have this year, which will be 13 weeks. That impact actually had a drag of about four points on the CDIY growth number. 
So as an example, if the business was going to grow 2% in our current forecast, on an apples-to-apples basis, it's actually growing 6%. So I think it's important for folks to understand what we mean by a tougher prior-year comparisons in this particular case. And I'll also give you a sense of the magnitude of that for the total company on the next page. Jim talked about the successful 12-volt rollout, and I'm not going to harp on that. But clearly, that is a significant impact, and it's helping to offset some of that timing issue that I described with those headwinds. 
Sequentially, the operating profit will see pressure in the fourth quarter as we will have increased promotions, negative currency effect, as well as lower absorption. So we will see a bit of a sequential decline from third to fourth quarter in CDIY's results of those items.  We continue to see really nice growth in Latin America and Asia and expect that to continue in the fourth quarter, although we will likely see a little bit of a weaker performance in the U.S. and Europe, primarily because of the comparison issue that I described earlier. 
Moving on to Security. As Jim mentioned, Security had a nice quarter on the Electronic Security side of the business as well as HHI. Mechanical Access continues to see some pressure related to the commercial construction markets, as well as that inventory correction item that Jim mentioned related to the third quarter. We think that we will see a slight revenue decline in the fourth quarter for the overall segment on a pro forma basis, and that's indicative of the fact that I just mentioned. The good news is that CSS order flow continues to be strong and solid, and that's really being driven by activity in the national accounts in North America. So we're pleased that there appears to be a positive trend and acceleration occurring in that business. 
We have seen an uptick in delayed and abandoned construction projects in that Commercial Construction sector of the Mechanical Access business, so that's really creating that pressure that I described. And then of course, the Residential Hardware business is historically weak in the fourth quarter due to seasonality, but we are seeing a bit of an offset from the continued success of the SmartKey products, as well as the Baldwin Prestige product lines. So we do expect a little bit of growth from that business in the fourth quarter but not of the magnitude we saw in previous quarters. 
Industrial, mid single-digit pro forma organic growth rates, so we are continuing to see nice growth in this particular area. We don't expect to see the growth of the magnitude that we saw in the third and fourth quarter, which was 20%, 30% range as a result of a couple of things. One, we're definitely seeing, we believe, that the customer restocking has ended. We saw a little bit of that occur in the third quarter, as Jim described. We don't expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. 
Also, we do see lower global automotive production forecast around the world. So as a result, our Engineered Fastening business will likely not see the type of growth rates and leverage they saw in the third quarter. So that will be a bit of an offsetting pressure to some of the positives we're seeing in North American Industrial Distribution business that continues to be strong. We expect that to be strong in the fourth quarter. And then the Mobile Distribution and Industrial Storage business will show modest growth as well. We think we'll also see strength in our infrastructure business as we expect to see growth in particular emerging markets as you see here on the page. 
So to summarize the guidance on Page 17, this is our updated outlook for 2010. Again, it excludes onetime charges related to the merger with BDK, as well as the acquisition of SSDS or ADT France and CRC-Evans. And just as a reminder to folks, those charges are the following as far as guidance for the year: For restructuring-related, we still believe it'll be $245 million to $295 million, probably closer to the high end of the range as a result of, what John described, with higher synergies being achieved in 2010. The onetime SG&A and other costs will approximate $135 million, so that's up slightly from July as a result of activity there associated with ADT France and CRC-Evans in particular. And in the inventory step-up, which is an accounting charge, will be about $175 million, $170 million related to BDK and $5 million related to CRC. 
So our guidance increases then to $3.60 to $3.70. So we've increased that from $3.35 to a high end of $3.55 from back in July. And what are the factors that are really driving that? Well, first of all, the second half organic sales growth, we believe, is now going to approximate 5%, where we said 4% to 5% back in July. We saw 8% pro forma growth in the third quarter of 2010. Clearly, that implies a slower growth in the fourth quarter to get to a 5% number. It implies about 2%. But that extra week phenomena, those tougher prior-year comps that I described, is really causing about a three-point drag in that comparison. So if you made an apples-to-apples comparison, it will be about a 5% growth number year-over-year. 
Gross margins, we will see a sequential decline of probably 50 to 80 basis points from the third quarter. That's very much in line with historical trends for both businesses, as we tend to see lower absorption in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And this year, we'll actually see a little bit of additional currency pressure as well. So there's a little bit of pressure there on the gross margin line. And then also, we'll also see some additional promotional costs in SG&A that will cause some pressure on the operating margin line. 
The good news, as John mentioned, cost synergy realization is up to $125 million in 2010. As we mentioned in July, we achieved $30 million in the second quarter. John mentioned $45 million in the third quarter. And so that would mean we're going to achieve about $50 million in the fourth quarter to get to the $125 million for the year. 
Other items that are not in the page related to the guidance there are no changes that we've communicated in the past. There is the two acquisitions of SSDS and CRC-Evans. We don't expect any major changes to that guidance that we've provided previously around EPS, as well as the BDK intangible amortization, that's still expected to be $55 million. The tax rate is in the range of 26% to 27% for the full year, so that implies a lower tax rate for the fourth quarter because we're at almost 28% through the first three quarters of this year. 
Other restructuring, which is restructuring unrelated to BDK, ADT France and CRC, is still expected to be $30 million to $40 million, which means we'll have a rather large charge in the fourth quarter of anywhere from $12 million to $17 million, depending on certain activities and timing of events. 
And then commodity inflation continues to be a pressure for us in the back half of the year compared to the prior year. As you look at commodity prices versus the second half of 2009, we're still seeing 20% to 40% increases. Those are all items that are consistent with what we've said in the past, and there's no significant changes there.  The net effect of this on a cash basis, cash EPS is now expected to be $4.34, up to $4.44 for 2010, and that excludes approximately $175 million of amortization. The last thing I'll mention on this page is to reaffirm that the free cash flow for 2010 is expected to exceed $700 million as I described earlier. 
So to summarize the presentation portion of this call, we definitely feel like the third quarter is an illustration of how our integration continues to be proficient and effective. The cost synergies for 2010 have been raised to $125 million as we had indicated. And we're very pleased to see earlier-than-expected profitability with our French electronic security business, SSDS. The 2011 forecasted cost synergies, to drive 10% to 15% profit growth above and beyond core business growth, and then organic growth across majority of business driven by the footprint in emerging markets and all the new product innovation that Jim described. 
The second quarter restocking activity has moderated as we expected in the third quarter, and we don't expect that to continue into the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned, free cash flow guidance has been raised, and we expect significant fourth quarter 2010 working capital benefits. With that, I'm going to pass the call back to Kate White, so she can clarify a few items related to outstanding shares and EPS projections from here."

What we also said when we made the acquisition and we're pretty much on track, we displayed relatively low purchase price. We have upwards of $50 million to spend on restructuring of that business. But when you add the purchase price and the restructuring together in our capital base, as Jim talked about the quarter when we made this acquisition, it has the potential to be an extraordinarily high ROCE acquisition. Obviously, it's going to be accretive because we've taken up a large negative and turned it into a modest and we think, much larger positive going forward. And the capital base is still going to be extraordinary low relative to its revenues and profitability. I think your estimate of profitability, we'd like to get there. I think that's fairly aggressive and fairly early. That would imply a high teens, low 20s operating margins. We didn't commit or undertake to get there quite that quickly. But that's the direction we're going, and sooner rather than later, it will be line average with our Electronic Security business."

I think Jim has pointed out and Jeff Ansell team's doing a great job getting these new products into the market, where we're catching up in a very big hurry and the market's accepting it well. I'd say there's no reason why we can't regain the three to five share points lost over the last three years. And just in fact, if we're able to do that, we'll be growing the Power Tools side of the business at 2x the rate of the market too. So that's not a volume projection going forward. Some of these products have only been in the marketplace less than three months. There'll be others the first half of next year. But yes, we are optimistic with our new product pipeline with the Hand Tool and Power Tool team that are coming together to form a very, very powerful business unit, good customer reaction to what we've shown so far.

Obviously, the momentum that derives from coming out of this hopefully trough part of the cycle with the additive benefit of the new products and with the additive benefit of whatever revenue synergies we're able to achieve, should enable us for years to come to achieve that better-than-GDP growth for the organic growth for the company. But then the question becomes, as we get a couple of years into this, what happens? And that's why we have this five growth platforms. That's why when you look at what we're acquiring in these growth platforms, we're looking for higher growth, higher margins, higher organic growth, higher-margin areas so that we can reduce our dependency on slower growth markets. So you'll see a portfolio shift that we think over the coming years, where Security, Mechanical Security, Electronic Security, Engineered Fastening, Healthcare, Infrastructure, really do grow as important platforms in the business and take a much larger share of the revenue as we head into the next down-cycle years from now on the Tools side."

First, yes, we see that much accretion based on three months of owning CRC. We've inherited an extraordinarily capable management team, and we're inserting two or three functional Stanley leaders into the business as well. It's off to a very good start, and we remain enthusiastic about the business, about its ability to grow organically, about its ability to add meaningful value, both on an ROC basis and on an accretion basis. With the second one, we're looking at many different platforms. It won't surprise you that multiples for some of the Healthcare opportunities that Jim referred to are higher than six to eight. In the Tools space, that's pretty much what they are. For five years, we answered questions in Security, when we were trading at six to seven, how can you make acquisitions at 10x to 11x EBITDA and have it not destroy value? The answer is simply 10x to 11x EBITDA for higher growth, higher margin businesses, that's what the market requires. And within two or three years, they're back to 4x to 6x, which is what we've done with HSM, what we've done with Sonitrol and what we've done with other businesses. The same will apply outside Industrial Tools going forward. To the extent we pay a higher multiple than the multiple at which we're trading, it will be with the understanding in the plan between synergies and growth to have that multiple be well within our range, and as a consequence, have it create value for our shareholders. It's probably worth mentioning that the entire management team at Stanley Black & Decker's long-term incentive is based equally on earnings growth and return on capital employed. So the acquisition market is heating up. It's more competitive. More sponsors are showing up and showed up even six months ago to compete for attractive properties. That being said, it's not a lot of change from what we've been dealing with for the last six years. We'll maintain our financial discipline. We'll maintain our both strategic review and financial hurdle rates and look at each acquisition opportunity on its own merits."

And I'm just speaking in particular of the cordless lithium ion share loss that occurred over the past few years to Hitachi and Nokia and Bosch and so forth. It was basically a defensive maneuver to protect whatever share they could while they scrambled to redesign the product lines, which you're now seeing the manifestation of. So it's tough to recover a lot of price when you don't have the products to back it up, so I suggest what we're doing now in the Power Tool business is that we are gradually introducing these new families of cordless products to recapture the market share, and we will do what we need to do to re-establish ourselves at the market share position where we think is optimal, given the various facts and circumstances in the marketplace. Now that said, I think that if I were to be completely objective, I think that pricing is probably more of a core competency on a functional basis at many of the Stanley legacy businesses, and we have some folks in our pricing center of excellence already working with the legacy Black & Decker folks to help implement that within their system. And I'd say the same is true for the granularity of the analysis related to operations, costs, in particular, related to procurement, which they didn't do on a centralized basis and legacy Stanley did, which meant not only did we have, perhaps, more opportunity to leverage the supply base over a larger base, but also have more timely information that could be actually cycled into the pricing analysis and strategy process. And I think that is definitely something that Don Allan and his team are going to be working diligently on over the coming quarters to get at the same level the legacy Stanley was at. That said, it's one of the most positive surprises of all here. And we didn't have a chance to see these families of new products that have been developed by the legacy Black & Decker folks in Power Tools. We had to take it on faith because we couldn't get access to it during the -- due to diligence process for antitrust reasons. We had to take it on faith that these products would be everything that they indicated that they would be from an attractiveness perspective, and we couldn't be happier. We couldn't be happier with the team that developed these products, where the products themselves and the future that that actually portends for the Power Tool business."

It's the same as the old playbook. In terms of deal sizes, for the next 6 to 12 months, we're not looking at deals well above $500 million unless it were to be a game-changing opportunity and timing over which we have no control because, as Don pointed out, despite we're going to have $700 million in cash flow, if we look at this year, we're spending close to $400 million to achieve the synergies, we're paying a dividend. That pretty much takes care of cash flow without changing the structure of our balance sheet. Going forward, if we look at $700 million-plus, the dividend, repay a couple of hundred million in debt to be solidly where the rating agencies need us to be, we still have $400 million to $500 million to spend. That should give you a flavor, Jim, either cumulatively or with one large deal without issuing equity, the size we're looking at. In terms of the platforms, again, it's the same. Jim alluded to it. We've taken our portfolio back to about 2006 levels in terms of the ability to which has influenced or impacted by the North American residential construction and CDIY markets. That's not bad, but ultimately, we're going to discriminate in favor of Healthcare, Infrastructure, Engineered Fastening, Security, things that we feel we have a right to succeed. The multiples will be a little higher, but as I responded to Mike Rehaut's question, we'll get those multiples down over time. But we're going to discriminate in favor of higher-growth, higher-margin businesses going forward to get our portfolio back towards roughly a third, a third, a third, which is not a concrete target, but we like the fact that being -- look five years out of $15 billion company with $5 billion in CDIY, $5 billion in Security and $5 billion in Industrial, that gives us a lot of leverage to pull up as a management team when and if the macro economic situation changes dramatically."

Certainly, the geographies, the geographic expansion are the biggest and most obvious -- and not just in Latin America, but Latin America only because legacy Black & Decker had such a strong base, $400-plus million of business, established manufacturing capability in Brazil and a very well-established distribution network in all of South America, which far exceeded Stanley's capabilities. That's first and foremost, most obvious. But the same kind of cross-selling opportunities exist in all emerging markets. Remember, we focused at executive, an entire team, on what we call emerging markets Asia-Pacific group, and we have Jeff Chen focusing on mainland China. Ben Sihota from Black & Decker focusing on the other markets. So first and foremost, in the geographies, beyond that, they're going to take a little longer to incubate, and that's really all we're going to say at this point. Everything else, we've said in investor presentations, and we'll give you some more granularity on that in January when we wrap the year up. And decide quite frankly, how much cost synergy excess, if you will, we have to fund some of these programs. Obviously, the sooner we're able to fund them without detracting from margins, the sooner we're going to achieve them."

And that may or may not continue into the fourth quarter. We will continue to some extent. The rest of the field, I'd say the inventories on the average for the big retailers with our products, now we only have legacy Stanley at this point and we're still trying to get the circuits up to get all the weeks on hand and so forth point-of-sale for the whole system. But the weeks on hand with the legacy Stanley, which I think will be a good proxy for CDIY, are right around 12, which was a couple of weeks lower than it was in 2005, for those of us that remember back that far. 2005 was the year that the large retailers, three of them shut off ordering in the middle of December. And so we don't think that, that scenario is likely. But we see a scenario where point-of-sale is not robust at most of these customers. It's not terrible. It's just kind of bumping along flattish kind of territory. And our invoice sales was very consistent from a volume point of view, from a unit point of view with that in the legacy Stanley business in the third quarter. So as we step back from it, I'd say we probably see caution in the winds at the retailers, and part of our outlook reflects that. So I think we've kind of baked in the environment in a very reasonable way here. As we look forward into 2011, clearly, the product introductions that are occurring as we speak will have several quarters of opportunity to manifest themselves in sales gains. We'll have some additional product introductions coming in several areas, including Power Tools, as we get into next year, so that will help us. And I think on balance, the product introductions will provide a nice buffer if we continue to have sluggish environment. We're not suggesting that we will, but it's too early for us to call what the environment for 2011 is going to be, and that's why we'll have much more granularity around the guidance in the fourth quarter earnings release in January."

A big unknown with Industrial because we don't get really great data with the customers for the most part are relatively small, the distributors. And we don't get the same granularity of data that we get with our CDIY business in the U.S., for example. So a lot of our conclusions have to come from discussing with sales folks and sales management, what their observations are in the marketplace. And we don't have great visibility into, say, the tool cribs, where things are really kind of stocked and restocked. But we do have reasonable qualitative visibility into the distribution channel. And we think what occurred during the de-stocking phase was probably -- there was kind of a really significant de-stocking throughout the whole system, from the distributors to the dealers to the tool crib folks to secretaries hoarding office supplies because nobody knew if they were going to be able to order anymore. So now I think what's happening is that, really, Industrial production was not at 20% in our world. And we think about a third of it was restocking. We think another third of it was share gain, and so the last third would've been kind of market growth, if you will. And that seems to be a little bit higher than the production levels, so maybe there's some restocking going on within the factories that buy these kind of Industrial tools. But at least at the distributor level, we think it's run its course. Now for the CDIY, I pretty much covered everything that I can say about inventories at this point in time, which is that they're averaging about 12 weeks, our largest U.S. customers. And we don't anticipate any earth shattering inventory corrections, but we are very cautious with respect to -- they're very cautious with respect to their inventory levels. And I think they will be playing wait-and-see here with the upcoming season. And if the season doesn't seem to be playing out in the late November, early December time frame, there is a chance that there could be more inventory correction than normal in this particular year, even though their inventories are in pretty good shape. They're about two weeks on the average lower than they were in '05 when we had -- they essentially took two weeks out of December, all three of the biggest retailers in the country. So as I said earlier, our guidance reflects some conservatism and caution with respect to the tone of the CDIY market, and we shall see where things kind of play out as the season goes here."

The way we maintain pricing, of course, as Jim alluded to, our pricing center of excellence sees the raw materials increases coming. And we've historically done a very good job. We've recovered about 75% to 85% of raw materials inflation over time. The rest, we have to get with productivity to maintain margins, which we've been able to do. The second way to ensure that we maintain margins in terms of prices, to do what Jim alluded to on the first page of his piece of the presentation, specifically by introducing new and improved products at higher price points and allowing the previous products to waterfall down, if necessary, to a slightly lower price point, allows us to maintain margins. We, of course, have to add features and benefits to do that because simply asking for more price for an existing product, even in the face of materials inflation, is very difficult for our customers to accept. They're trying to provide, obviously, the lowest prices possible to their end users. So the pricing environment's no different than it's been for the last five years. And our modus operandi, the way we're dealing with it, it's essentially no different, at least from the legacy Stanley side. Add features and benefits that you can get paid for, command a higher price, having the leading brands in the category gives you the right, as well as the obligation, to be the price leader. And that's our strategy that we will continue to employ in the months to come should materials increase even more than we're anticipating."
