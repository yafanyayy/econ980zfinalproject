Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for taking time for joining us today. I am joined on the call by Martin Slark, our Chief Executive Officer, Dave Johnson, our Chief Financial Officer and Liam McCarthy, our Chief Operating Officer. Please note that this call is being recorded and will be available for replay by accessing the Investor Relations section of our website. Presentation materials are also available on the website. As usual we would like to limit this call to one hour. When we get to Q&A, we ask for one question per participant and one follow-up question. Thanks.
Before we turn our attention to the quarterly results, let's review our Safe Harbor Statements on slide one and two of the presentation materials. During the course of this presentation, we will be providing forward-looking information and referring to non-GAAP measures. Please read carefully the forward-looking statements section of our press release and Form 10-K for an understanding of the risk and uncertainties associated with forward-looking information and the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to GAAP. For your convenience, we have included these materials in our presentation. They are also available from our website, www.molex.com in the investors section.

If you turn now to page three, this chart demonstrates our order trends over the past several quarters. Orders grew sequentially 7% in the De",1366,"Thank you, Steve, and welcome everyone to the second quarter of fiscal year '10 earnings release conference call. If you turn now to page three, this chart demonstrates our order trends over the past several quarters. Orders grew sequentially 7% in the December quarter to 778 million. This represents our third consecutive quarter of significant growth and we are now 38% about the order rate experienced in December 2008 quarter.
Looking back at our guidance provided in the last call, we stated the normal seasonal trend would generally have ordered slowing in late November or certainly early December. This is not the case this year and in fact, orders increased sequentially in November and then surprisingly they were up again sequentially in December. The strength of these bookings will give us momentum for the second half of our fiscal year. Needless to say, we are quite pleased with the pace and breadth of the recovery in our overall business which we think reflect stronger end-market demand, good new-product strength, continuing success with our focus (inaudible) program particularly in Asia.
It is worth noting that our bookings are still 13% below the peak that we achieved in Q3 of fiscal year '08 and channeling materials are in good shape. Looking at our bookings for the last quarter, we are therefore cautiously optimistic about the prospects of the calendar year 2010.
If you turn now to page four, we show our orders by industry. Hear you can see that the consumer electronics industry showed a lower than normal seasonality and was only down 3% from the September quarter. That reduction for that quarter is very low. This market however was still up 38% year-over-year. Consumer Electronics sold well during the Christmas season particularly in Asia. And having just spent a week in Japan, we don't see any evidence of excess inventory that needs to be burned off at this time.
Going forward, we are encouraged by the not large number of new products recently introduced to the Consumer Electronics show which was certainly not the case a year ago and as well as expectations that Chinese New Year and the World Cup will drive strong demands to TVs this year.
LCD TVs are expected to be up 16% in 2010 to 170 million units including 41 million LED backlit TVs and approximately 1 million 3D TVs. These new TV models have higher connector content which is a positive for Molex. The automotive markets continue to improve steadily from relatively low production levels a year ago. Orders were up 6% sequentially it up over 60% from what was a disastrous quarter the same quarter in 2008.
Automobile inventories remain low and selling rates have held up reasonably well even though government stimulus packages have been withdrawn. Third-party projections suggest that modest unit growth will continue in this sector through 2010. With improving production rates in Asia and the U.S. and decline in Western Europe.
In addition the continue to see strong demand for products similar to those sold in consumer electronics markets to support new functionality such as rear-view cameras, navigation systems, HD and satellite radios and (inaudible) network opportunities is providing the possibilities for Molex to sell not just the connector but value added assembly into this market.
We are seeing strong demand for notebooks service storage and networking products in the data market where orders were up a very strong 9% sequentially and 55% over prior year levels. This is largely due to the third enterprise spending as companies are beginning to replace aging hardware as well as the need for capacity increases due to video and other high-volume data downloads. We believe that the data market will continue to grow in 2010 as we are now receiving orders to delivery in the June quarter. Our major customers in this sector also seeing optimistic over the prospect of 2010.
The overall Telecom market was up 8% sequentially and 22% year-over-year. The infrastructure and smartphone sector was the strongest. Middle rate [ph] cell phone volumes were down as well as the cell phone market in Japan. We have seen a large number of new product design wins in both their infrastructure and smartphone sector. Wins in the smartphones sector will continue to help out sales through Q4 this fiscal year and into Q1 of next fiscal year.
Our industrial business improved significantly again this quarter with a 20% sequential and 26% year-over-year increase. This market tends to track with GDP growth and we expect the pace of recovery to accelerate as GDP growth rates increase and eventually in Europe.
We are very pleased to see significant growth coming out of the Woodhead acquisition with good progress particularly in the manufacture automation and alternative energy markets. Our share in the medical and military markets are still quite small, but we had very good projects under way in both markets which resulted in very significant year-over-year and sequential booking growth rates.
If you now turn to page five, we will look at our order trends by channel and by geography. On a channel basis distribution show the most significant increase in the September quarter. Our point of sale and point of purchase data which we contract through our SAP system are growing in the same rate. So we have not seen any evidence so far of the distribution partners building up inventory of Molex products.
EMS orders increased 8% in the September quarter, the second straight quarter with significant sequential improvement. OEMs now seem to be moving more business to their EMS partners versus holding it in house, as in demand continues to improve.
On a geographic basis, Asia-Pacific North which is Japan and Korea for us was down sequentially due to seasonal nature of the consumer electronics business so that is downturn is very consistent with the data I gave you for consumer market. All other regions are up quite strongly from the September quarter as well as from last year as the recovery strengthens in virtually every major economy.
We continued to benefit from the rapid recovery in Asia and our large presence there. In the long run, we believe our participation in this region close to 60% of sales and our broad-based strength across all key market segments will translate into significant growth opportunities as well as the penetration of electronic devices into household in emerging Asian countries which is continuing and as we mentioned before, this refresh (inaudible) equipment particularly across the Asian economies.
Turn now to page six, we will look at our revenue trend. We reported an increase of 8% in revenue from the September quarter and an increase of 9% from a year ago. We've now reported three consecutive quarters of significant growth from our low point in the March 2009 quarter. Even with this rapid recovery, we are still 16% below the revenue level realized in the 2008 June quarter. So we still have quite a room to grow and a growing backlog to support that growth.
If you turn now to page seven, which charts our changes in revenue by industry. You are basically looking at the same trends that drove orders. But, obviously with some time legs which vary by industry. If you look at the automotive and data market, they increase the most on a sequential basis due to higher production builds schedule by automotive OEMs and higher enterprise spending. Telecom and industrial each increase 6% sequentially due to infrastructure spending and a modest recovery in the manufacturing automation market. As expected, the consumer market which is flat and a sequential basis due to seasonality.
We are optimistic looking ahead to the March quarter. The order rate was quite strong through December quarter and our backlog has increased. Normally, we would anticipate a 3 to 5% reduction in the coming quarter. However, given the strong order backlog, we are providing revenue guidance of 715 to 735 million for the March quarter, the midpoint of this range is down 0.6% which is obviously lower than normal seasonal reduction.
That's the summary of the revenue and order data and Dave Johnson will now give you more information on our financial results.

Page right is our GAAP P&L statement. As Martin said revenue has increase for the third consecutive quarter sequentially and the increased in this current quarter is 8.2% in dollars and 5.5% in the local curre",1438,"Thank you, Martin. Turn to page eight please. Page right is our GAAP P&L statement. As Martin said revenue has increase for the third consecutive quarter sequentially and the increased in this current quarter is 8.2% in dollars and 5.5% in the local currency. Gross margin of 29.1% reflects primarily the higher revenue in the quarter. SG&A of $150.1 million increased $4.5 million due to the reinstatement of salaries and benefits and currency exchange, but still came in at the very low end of our guidance range.
Restructuring was $25.6 million, but we will discuss that's a bit more in the next slide. Interest expense and other expense are not unusual, but please, note that we did not get the benefit of exchange gains in the current quarter that helped the September quarter and last year's December quarter quite significantly.
The effective tax rate on a GAAP basis for the quarter was 44.6%. As you will note, our GAAP tax rate has been quite variable due to restructuring and systematic review of tax matters over the last year. The main driver for the higher tax rate in the current quarter was the decision we made to repeat earnings from overseas to support the completion of our restructuring activities.
On a non-GAAP basis, the effective tax rate was 31.4% and we would anticipate that the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis going forward would be approximately 30% for the final two quarters of our fiscal year.
And finally, on 174.6 million shares outstanding our GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.11.
Now turn to page nine, where we detail our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation adjustments. Beginning with GAAP pre-tax income of $34.8 million and EPS of $0.11, we add back the pre-tax restructuring charge of $25.6 million or $0.13 to arrive at our non-GAAP EPS results of $0.24. The pre-tax restructuring charge was about $7 million higher than our guidance related primarily to the additional non-cash impairment for real estate that we will discuss in more detail when we review restructuring program.
The after-tax restructuring charge of $22.1 million includes a $3 million tax expense for the repatriation of earnings in connection with the restructuring program as I mentioned in our end of the discussion of our GAAP tax rate. As compared to our guidance range of $0.18 to $0.22, we are very pleased to achieve the $0.24 non-GAAP EPS for the quarter.
The chart on page ten details our balance sheet metrics. There were no significant changes to our long-term debt arrangements during the quarter though the absolute amount declined by just over $30 million as we have left outstanding on our revolving credit facility at the end of December. More importantly, net cash of $207 million did not change appreciably from the September quarter. Accounts receivable and inventory continue to be in good control and well below the prior year levels. Accounts receivable days increased one day sequentially to 76 days and inventories decreased one day to 74 days.
Capital expenditure, R&D and cash flow from operations are all very consistent with the sequential quarter. With a significant ramping of demand, we have released additional capital expenditure authorizations for new product tooling that may cause our capital spending to increase in the March quarter. We have been on track with our goal of CapEx at 6.5% of revenue for the first two quarters, but we may see this increased temporarily in the third quarter, but certainly for the right reasons.
The gross margin trend is shown on page 11. Our gross margin of 29.1% is 70 basis points higher than Q1 and 270 basis points higher than the prior year. In fact, the quarter gross margin on revenue of $729 million is approaching the gross margin for Q1 of last year when revenue was $110 million higher. We think however, the gross margin should have been even better than it was. At this stage in the restructuring process, we are experiencing operational challenges related to the production tranfers that are impacting product shipments and also resulting in higher freight and other transition costs. The good news is that these are temporary impacts that will naturally reverse as the transfers are completed.
We talked during the last call about increasing commodity and foreign-exchange transaction cost, we did recognize higher costs in these areas, but they were - we were able to offset these costs with lower price erosion and operational improvements. As predicted last quarter, we did not realize much sequential cost reductions due to the restructuring program but increased cost savings are expected for the next quarter. Therefore, looking forward, we would expect gross margins to continue to trend positively for the down for the year.
Page 12 chart, our SG&A. Please note that we are back to more normal revenue trends we have reintroduced SG&A percentages below the bars on the chart. SG&A for the quarter was $150.1 million compared with our guidance of 150 to $151 million. SG&A increased sequentially by $4.5 million due to $3 million for the reinstatement of salaries and benefits and $2.5 million to simply foreign currencies translation. The weakness of the U.S. dollar between Q1 and Q2 results in all P&L items including SG&A to be inflated. This of course doesn't impact the SG& A percentage but does impact the absolute dollar value. In fact, I think it is important to mention at this point that if the dollar stays where it is today, this will naturally impact our long-term target model. The percentages don't change, but the revenue levels at which we can achieve these percentages will increase due to exchange. The Q2 revenue is about 5% higher at Q2 exchange rates that it would have been at the budget exchange rates used to develop our long-term model.
Therefore, if rates remain where they are, the revenue level at which we plan to achieve our target model of 32% gross margin, 18% SG&A and 14% operating margin has increased from $800 million to $840 million. Remember that our target model is applicable only after all in restructuring savings are recognized so this would mean about a year from now or December 2010 quarter.
Please turn now to our restructuring update on page 13. We are increasingly confident and pleased that we will be 100% complete with our three-year restructuring project by the end of June. By that time, we will have realized 83% of our restructuring savings with the balance of 17% or $34 million to be realized in fiscal year 2011.
As of today, we have closed 13 plants with just one to go. In addition, we have closed or consolidated numerous offices and distribution centers and thicken multiple reductions in force as we have discussed in the past.
Compared to our last reports, we have increased our estimate of the total project cost from $280 to $300 million, so an increase of 20 million. This increase consist of $10 million of non-cash impairment adjustments to properties sold or for sale to reflect the continuing weakness in the real-estate market and $10 million for cash reduction actions that have been initiated as we approach the completion of our program. These additional actions that we have initiated, we expect about $5 million of additional savings. And we have adjusted the chart to reflect the increase in total savings to $205 million.
We continue to believe that the return on this program is exceptional. Now, $205 million of annual savings on $300 million in charges. For use of quantifying the near-term impact, the last line on the chart shows the sequential savings, as expected we have just $1 million of sequential savings in Q2, but anticipates sequential savings of $3 million in Q3 and another $6 million now in Q4. And the sequential savings needed to complete the chart for fiscal year 2011 would be just over $2 million of sequential savings in the September 2011 quarter - I'm sorry, 2010 quarter.
And finally, on page 14, is our forward guidance. Based on the strong bookings that we have experience in the quarter and for through our release today, we expect to mitigate the usual seasonal decline in revenue to a certain extent and therefore believe that revenue for the March quarter will be in the range of 715 to $735 million.
We expect a $10 million of pretax restructuring charge or $0.4 per share, resulting in Non-GAAP earnings per share on the range of 22 to $0.26 per share. That in fact concludes our remarks and we would not be happy to answer any questions you may have.

Adapting affecting seems to be the sale of mid-range phones across the world and I think you know who the strong players are in that segment. In fact in the unit sells and the other issue is really some saturation in the cell phone market and taking place like China.
So, I think what happened is the unit sells, I think when the data comes out that industry, will end up being lower than then anticipated in the mid-range and may well be some increase in the real low end there. But the revenue probably held up if you look at the segment overall, that will probably benefit certain players because of the smartphones segment.

So that's a separate thing. My view is that we still are on track to achieve that and are committed to doing so but I will answer your question also specifically about the commodities.
We have hedged about 25% of our copper spend this year and about half of our goals spend. Those hedges, to remind you, our copper was hedged at $2. So, now today it's roughly at 3.30 and so obviously we are 26:05 the money on the copper hedge and the gold we hedged at $927 per troy ounce. And today gold is at thousand 98. We're putting the money on both of those hedges. It is reducing the impact each quarter. Your question then to what happens when the hedges come to an end, we have gone through and look at our hedge benefit and see what the impact is. Come July, August, September, the hedges were all put in place at different times so it does not happen all at once, but in the first quarter, the sequential impact of the hedges just coming off completely assuming that the commodities stay where they are at today, is less than $1 million in the first quarter.
Then sequentially into the second quarter, it's another about 1.5 million dollars. So roughly in total $2.5 million, so it comes in two different segments and I believe that, that is certainly manageable within our business for and to achieve our models.

One other comment I think when you are trying to look at the margin impact that we found interesting over the last quarter. Is that as raw material costs continued to go up and I'm sure you have seen, one of the things that we have seen going the other direction is the moderation in the level of price erosion. So that has helped us and I think with the strong demand right now and with rising raw material costs, we think we'll see that trend continues. So when we model that forward, we have to look at rising raw material costs such as the price erosion picture and price erosion continues to moderate, which we think it will with the strong demand right now. That is clearly an offset to some degree.

You get a sense that, that's playing out and particularly as the distributors get to where they need and their customers which tend to like the bigger OEM customers that they sort of get to the levels in line with your demand.

I guess my own view is this, now we're going to see where this is right or not. Is that and that is why have I like that question. We get every month, we get POSDATA from our distributors and one of the things I was concerned about, with distribution being the strongest channel last quarter, was they building inventory and so that would slow down in this quarter. But, the POSDATA is as strong as the PopData for us, so that is certainly not the case.
And I think as we mentioned, our bookings are still 15% below the peak that they were in the third quarter of '08. And when you look at the top 10 customer that are driving our business and one of the reason I was out in Asia last week was visiting some of those. They had a parity bullish view about fiscal year '10 and seemed to have good customer pipeline to drive that. All I can say you is at this point, I think we are going to see a slight slowdown in February for Chinese New Year, given the impact that had in Asia on our visit. At least the customers we have talked to seem to be pretty confident about things continuing beyond March. I don't think you're going to see the same sequential quarter-over-quarter growth that we have seen in the last three quarters. But I haven't seen any evidence of a correction other than the seasonal ones for the Chinese New Year.

And it's across a lot of different industries as you have heard today.

But I would say that one of the things that we're excited about is that if you went back to fiscal year '07, which is the second quarter of fiscal year '07, we had similar bookings and look at where they came from then. The bookings were far more narrowly focused on a limited group of companies. And whereas, today I would say far more broad-based and I think one of the interesting things is that if you look at the first half of this fiscal year, our business is still down for the first six months versus the first six months of last year but are focused accounts are up over 15%. We talked about the 50 companies that we have picked around the world that we were going to focus on and I think we are winning with those companies and gaining share with those accounts. So I think some of this is as gaining shares of the focus account on getting exceptional growth in both levels with new product wins.

We acquired a company in China that manufactures primarily our ex-products, so strengthen our position in the RF market and strengthen our product profile",293,"Yes. There was an acquisition during the quarter, we actually disclosed and issued a press release. We acquired a company in China that manufactures primarily our ex-products, so strengthen our position in the RF market and strengthen our product profile there. I think you remember when we talked about where we wanted to focus; we said it will be in the RF area. We said it would be in the medical market and also we wanted to vertically integrate some of our value added business. If you look back at last year, we actually completed three acquisitions last year, Fujigami Micro in early part of the year, which helped us with our micro-etch technology, which we are really excited about from the new technology is coming out of that company and that one of the things that helped our growth. 
We acquired the Antenna Engineering Resources of Motorola in Europe in the middle of the year and that the strengthened our antenna business which has broaden our base. And now TN which is the company we acquired in China that manufacturers RF products. We had a very good pipeline and actually we had a review with our global management and part of my objectives when I was visiting Asia last week was to visit some potential targets. Some of these companies are obviously family owned and so the timing of when they take place I think it is not strictly under our control, but our expectation going forward is to have continuous pipeline. Primarily small niche deals, tuck in one that are focused on technology like the one we did last year, but we would certainly keep our eyes open for more medium-size acquisitions that would strengthen our position in the end market.

We would expect consumer probably to be weaker through March and then start to see some of the new products from their going into next Christmas.
And I think industrial and also our expectation is there they will steadily improve through a combination of just unit growth and increased content. Let me give one example, I think the market that got hit the hardest was auto particularly in North America. North American automotive units sales last year were only 10.3 million units. And that's way down from the 17 million plus that was being sold back in 2000. This year, they're talking about that going up to potentially 12 million plus which is still really low relative to the high point, but still a 20% increase over what we saw last year. So I think when you look at those auto and industrial markets, assuming there is a gradual economic recovery around the world, you could see the units in those grow, but not dramatically.

Before we start the main call, I just wanted to give all of you a quick update on our situation in Japan. As you know we announced publicly on April 9th that we recently",2297,"Good afternoon everyone and thank you again for joining our call and thank you Steve. Before we start the main call, I just wanted to give all of you a quick update on our situation in Japan. As you know we announced publicly on April 9th that we recently learned that Molex have been a victim of a fraud on the part of an individual in our Japanese subsidiary. We have engaged legal counsel, Jones Day and they have in turn engaged forensic accountants, Alex partners, to investigate this matter. Based on the investigated input and written oral statements from the individual involved, we believe that he forged documentation that enabled him to borrow money from Japanese banks in Molex Japan’s name on an unauthorized basis and then concealed those transactions. We believe he used the unauthorized borrowings primarily to fund losses on unauthorized security trades also made in Molex’s name.
At this point we believe that the total amount involved in this fraud scheme is approximately $193.2 million of which we have recognized a loss in the quarter of $31 million and disclosed a contingent liability of $162.2 million. The contingent liability represents the current balance of unauthorized borrowings at Molex Japan. Since this matter is the subject of an ongoing investigation we hope that you will understand that we will not be able to answer any questions on this call relating to this fraud, but we will certainly update you as soon as we have appropriate information to release.
Now let’s turn our attention on to the quarter’s results. If you could turn to page three I will start by talking about our order trends. Overall bookings for the quarter were $838 million, up 8% sequentially and 77% year-over-year. Given that this comparison is to the low point of last year’s downturn we expected strong result. But these results are much stronger than our most optimistic projections.
Excluding last year’s downturn, our average sequential increase in bookings in Q3 versus Q2 is about 3% to 4% versus the 8% we saw this quarter. The ongoing recovery was clearly far more important than any seasonal factors this quarter. The year-over-year numbers were the strongest that I have ever seen in my career at Molex and as you will hear shortly, our booking strength was very broad based. It is worth noting that our March monthly bookings were a new record for the company and our April run rate is above the level that we have reported for Q3.
Today we have not seen any evidence of double ordering, but we have some distributors trying to rebuild inventory, strong orders for new product launches of some customers and some building of inventory in preparation for a predicted stronger second half for this calendar year. And I will give you a few more data points on your concerns perhaps in that area later in my presentation.
Overall our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was a very strong 1.11. If you turn now to page 4 I will talk about the changes in our orders by industry segment for the March quarter. Our booking strength as you can see from the chart was very broad based. The percent of our bookings now coming from focused accounts is over 26% of the total. This is further evidence of the success of our focused account program which is helping both our growth and our margins. Automotive bookings were up 8% sequentially and 80% year-over-year. We continue to benefit from incentive schemes in Japan and from some countries in Europe. Although as I sure you know the incentive schemes have now stopped in Germany.
In North America Q1 we saw vehicle sales increasing for the whole market by 16% to 2.545 million vehicles. Molex’s order increased for the same period with up over 60%. In China Q1 calendar year ‘10 passenger car production was approximately 3.5 million vehicles up 84% from a year ago
Molex growth over the same period is up over 120%. We believe very strong evidence that we are gaining shares to increase sales of standard products across multiple platforms particularly in Asia and with the increasing electronic content, particularly in telematics and safety and convenience applications, we see plenty of opportunities for this growth to continue.
Global vehicle production is predicted to increase 8% in calendar year ‘10 to 61.4 million vehicles and a further 8% onto 66.6 million in calendar year ‘11. Automotive remains a very large connecting market and with our new structure and our global footprint, we believe we can continue to grow fast in the market and operate far more profitably than we have in the recent task.
If you now look at the data segments, we were up 3% sequentially and 81% year-over-year. Calendar year ‘10Q1 is normally a weak quarter for the data market because of a lull following strong calendar yearend hardware purchases. Many companies obviously have capital budgets that are structured on a calendar year basis. This lull did not happen this year. Networking was very strong and particularly we had strong orders coming from all of the market leaders in that segment, so it was broad based even within the networking segment.
The service sector continues to strengthen, we are seeing strong growth from new products particularly our new range of IT sockets.
In storage, the migrations and new protocols such as FAT2.0 and 16 gigabits fiber channel is very positive for Molex with the strong product range that we have in that area. Notebooks were also strong with bookings up over 90% for the quarter year-over-year and across the entire data sector we believe that our strong new product portfolio and the strength of our global sales team that is now selling our entire product range is really helping us to gain share in this segment as well. Telecom was up 5% sequentially and 67% year-over-year. The smartphone sector continues to grow quickly with Molex particularly benefiting from the android platform sales.
Midrange was down this quarter, but is expected to recover in Q4. Entry level phones in emerging markets remain strong, but that was increasingly supported by local manufacturers and gray market phones. Overall cell phone shipment were up only 2% sequentially calendar year ‘10 versus Q4 calendar year ’09, but smart phones were up 15%. What’s very obvious and it’s been very widely publicized is that the incremental revenue growth and profit opportunity in the cell phone market is clearly going to be in the cell phone segment where Molex is very strong. 
Overall the market is expected to expand from 1.21 billion units in calendar year ‘09 to 1.4 billion units in calendar year ‘10. But some of the major suppliers that we, some of the major manufacturers that we deal in this segment are concerned about possible shortages of memory and LCD. If that happens that obviously could limit the overall growth of the market. If you look at the telecomm equipment market that was very, very strong last quarter, particularly with customers in Asia and customer supporting the Asian market. There are some players in both North America and Europe who have been very successful in Europe and we have equally enjoyed that success with them. Migration to new platforms is really what is driving this along with new products sales from Molex’s company. Consumer electronics was up 6% sequentially and 66% year over year. The growth here is being driven by consumers in Asia particularly in the developing markets.
Some particularly strong segments for us of the digital still camera market where a transition is taking place from digital still cameras to digital still single lens reflex cameras. The reason we bring up that particular difference is that if you look at the connector bond on the difference between DSE and DSLR, is the connector content is about 3X and then obviously helps our sale in that segment. Flat panel TVs where LED backlighting is becoming an increasing trend obviously also increases the content in those devices and that has helped us. 3D TV is still small but is growing rapidly. The other good segments for us are in the consumer market or the gaming market where we are doing very well with all three of the major players, Pachinko and e-readers. Our Q3 industrial bookings were up sequentially a very strong 20% and 80% year over year and we actually had record bookings in March for the industrial sector. In the market the most people still think is generally weak we are very excited to see such strong results from the industrial segment.
As we stated last quarter we are starting to see the benefits of our Woodhead acquisition and the synergy with Molex where we are combining Woodhead’s industrial experience with Molex’s electronic technology. We have seen particularly strong growth in alternative energy markets, security networks, robotics and the semiconduction production equipment sectors. So, we are really pleased to see this and we are really pleased to see the benefits from our Woodhead acquisition coming from.
Finally the medical and military market which are still small market for Molex overall were up 15% sequentially but we are up a 188% year-over-year. We are seeing lots of new product winds in both sectors, we have very strong project pipeline in both sectors and we are really pleased to report during the current quarter one of the major military contractors named Molex as preferred supplier so you can expect to see us to continue to have growth in both of these sectors.
Please turn now to page 5, when I will talk about our order growth by channel and by geography. We saw a strong growth across all channels but distribution in EMS were much stronger than the OEM. It’s worth nothing that both of these channels made dramatic cutbacks in inventory levels in the same quarter last year. EMF did this because customers in some key segments took business back in-house to keep their plants busy and distributors credit to them reacted very quickly, so they slowed down their orders that they had placed on supplier.
We are seeing distributors continue to rebuild inventory levels to support increased end demand. As I stated earlier we have not seen any evidence of double ordering, but stronger end demand, slightly longer lead times and greater confidence in the back end of the year is obviously driving stronger orders when we expected. One data point here that might be helpful to our analyst is that normally Molex has about 10% of this backlog which is scheduled out beyond three months.
At the end of March that number had increased to 13% so it’s higher than normal but as you can see it’s not materially higher which gives us great confidence that our backlog is strong and it’s certainly shippable.
Like by geography it should come as no surprise that the strongest year-over-year numbers came from Asia-Pacific sale. The surprise this quarter was the broad based growth in all of our other regions and in particular the strong sequential number in the Americas and Europe.
The sequential growth in the Americas was broad based and in Europe it was driven primarily by industrial market and by the automotive market. APN dominated by Japan was sequentially the weakest but saw a very good pick up at the end of the quarter, as consumer customers started to launch new products for the current calendar year and the lead in toward the selling season at the back end of the calendar year. By the end of this fiscal I think it's worth pointing out that Molex will have more than 60% of its revenues coming from Asia, up from just 50% in fiscal year '07, I think that says a lot about the transitioning of the electronic industry to Asia and also the strong presence that Molex has in that very important angiography.
Now turning to slide 6, several of our key markets normally suffered in the March quarter and looking back over last couple of decades, we normally expect our third quarter revenue to be down sequentially 3% to 4%.
That was clearly not the case this quarter as revenue increased 3.7% from the December quarter and almost 50% from the March quarter last year. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement and we are now just 13% below our peak at $872 million that was achieved in the June 2008 quarter. 
And finally now for me if you turn to page 7, I’ll talk very briefly about the changes in our revenue by industry. As you can see on this chart all of the markets improved substantially from the same quarter last year, on a sequential basis, the data, telecom and consumer market were down between 1% and 2% from the December quarter, but that is much, much better than normal seasonality.
Automotive was up 6% and industrial was up 18%. Going forward, we expect to see the strongest sequential growth in the industrial market as our growing market share in that segment continues. Consumer electronics, data and telecom will exhibit above average growth and we expect automotive could moderate somewhat, because clearly some of the strength we've seen has been incentive driven and the expectation is those incentive will be progressively withdrawn as the year continues.
The June quarter is generally our strongest quarter of the year. And our order rates in April remain strong. We are therefore based on our March orders and the April trends we are seeing, providing a revenue guidance of 810 million to 830 million for the June quarter.
Now, let me turn the call over to Dave Johnson, who will take us through the finances in more detail.

As Martin mentioned we are very pleased with the revenue results of $756.3 million, which is well above the top end of our guidance and up sequential and what was normally a, what is normal",1251,"Thank you Martin, please turn now to slide 8 for our P&L summary. As Martin mentioned we are very pleased with the revenue results of $756.3 million, which is well above the top end of our guidance and up sequential and what was normally a, what is normally a down quarter seasonally.
Gross margin of 31.2% reflects favorable product mix, better than expected savings from restructuring and the continuation of a very good operating leverage, that we have seen coming out of the downturn.
SG&A at $156.4 million is up sequentially due to R&D costs and variable selling costs not due general admin spending. I will skip all the restructuring and our loss on unauthorized activities in Molex, Japan, since we’ll cover these on the next slide. Other expenses up sequentially due to higher interest expense which was $2.3 million for the quarter and a $1.8 million investment loss, primarily due to our 20% ownership share and a Singaporean Company that we account for on the equity method.
This company is going through its own restructuring activity, which resulted in a loss in that business for the quarter and may continue in to the next quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5% which takes us to net income of $23.8 million or $0.14 per share on 174.8 million shares outstanding.
The chart on page 9 is our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation as just mentioned GAAP EPS was $0.14 to which we add that $0.04 for our restructuring program and $0.11 for the unauthorized activities in Molex Japan as Martin explained.
This results in a non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.29. This is well above the mid-point of our previous guidance of $0.24 and is the highest EPS that we have reported in six quarters.
The slide on page 10 details our balance sheet metrics. Our net cash has dropped to $160 million from $207 million in the December quarter, this is due primarily to the cash impact of the unauthorized activities in Molex Japan. 
Working capital requirements supports the recent growth in our business and higher capital expenditures. The higher CapEx is related to production tooling for significant new park introductions and select capacity increases for production machinery to keep up with a rapidly increasing demand from our customers.
As one would expect in this demand environment both accounts receivable and inventory are increasing in a fluid dollar terms. However, accounts receivable days sales outstanding has come down from 76 days last quarter to 73 days this quarter.
Going in the other direction inventory days have increased from 74 days last quarter to 80 days this quarter. Inventory increased at the quarter end to support record level of bookings that we experienced in March and really due to the buffer inventories for the final stage of our product transfer activities in connection with our restructuring program. 
Its no (inaudible) that our vendor managed inventory remains in very good shape at well below days and inventory as distributors has not yet increased above normal levels. We have pulled together gross margin SG&A and operating margin trends all on one chart one page 11, primarily to demonstrate the progress we are making towards our goal of 14% operating margins.
Gross margin has trended very well from a low of 18.5% a year ago to a current quarter of 31.2%. This really demonstrates the substantial operating leverage of our new cost structure even in a phase of transition cost such as pride and duty that remain high and increasing commodity costs.
We had better than expected cost savings resulting from our restructuring program, approximately $6 million in sequential savings in the quarter versus the $3 million we had anticipated and most of these savings benefited the cost of sales line this quarter.
Price erosion was not a mature factor in the quarter, as we continue to see slight downward pressure on this metric though still at the upper end of our 3% to 5% annual expected range.
SG&A at 20.7% reflects spending in absolute dollars of $156 million which is approximately $4 million higher than anticipated. The much faster than expected recovery in demand has resulted in higher spending for both R&D and variable selling cost, but administrative costs which are all cost other than R&D and selling costs actually declined sequentially.
In addition, it’s interesting to note that the total SG&A salaries were flat sequentially. This demonstrates that a sequential increase in SG&A is clearly related to the non-people variable cost that I mentioned which again is cost caused by the faster than expected recovery of our business. As year-over-year growth rates moderate, we expect these variable costs to stabilize.
Most importantly, our operating income margin hasn’t improved very steadily from the prior year to the current levels of 10.5% and we would expect a similar sequential increase in Q4 as we have seen in the past two quarters.
On page 12, we show the trend of our return on net assets metric or [RONA] which increased from a low point of 3.7% in Q4 last year to 14.2% this quarter. This is the metric that under our new division structure we have introduced to monitor the overall progress of each division and business unit. 
This is intended to focus our operating units on the key factors that they can’t control to improve our return on assets which are operating income, capital expenditure and working capital.
Our internal goal has been to get back to 15% by the end of the year and we are clearly on track to meet and exceed this number by the fourth quarter.
Please turn to slide 13. We are just one quarter away from the completion of our three year restructuring program. We incurred $9 million in primarily cash charges in the quarter, and expect to incur the final $11.5 million in Q4 to complete this $300 million project, which will result in annual savings of at least $205 million.
As mentioned previously, we are very pleased to see savings brought forward into the third quarter from the fourth quarter, we had expected $3 million in sequential savings, but actually recognized $6 million savings as I mentioned.
This then leaves just $1 million of sequential savings for Q4 to get us to our full savings target, but we still expect some additional sequential savings in the  first few quarters of fiscal year 2011.
We are down to one final plant closure in Slovakia and then of course the completion and final set up and smooth transition of all the production transfers. Our guidance for the coming quarter is shown on slide 14. Based on our strong bookings and backlog positions we estimate that after mid point of our guidance revenue is expected to increase by 8.4% to the range of $810 million to $830 million as Martin mentioned. After eliminating restructuring charge of $0.06 our non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.40 and it’s important to know that this excludes any cost or charges related to the investigation process in Japan.
In summary, we had strong operating results for the quarter and we are confident that we will continue to see improved operating results now in the fourth quarter. We will now open up the call for questions and I’d like to state just once again that we will not be able to answer any questions related to the fraud in Molex Japan due to the ongoing investigation.

We adopted a policy on these, I am not naming specific customers but I am sure you know as well as I do who the major players are in that market. We have a good presence at all of those companies and what’s been interesting versus say two three years ago is the range of product that we are selling into those companies when we did some analysis internally, is significantly broader that it was three years ago.
So if that segment has come back we have not only benefited from the growth in the segment, but increased penetration in that segment because of our broader product portfolio. We are doing very well in the integrated connector modules. We are doing very well in the fiber area, we are doing very well in the back plane market and so I think the breadth of our product line has particularly benefited up in that segment.

We expect that we are going to continue to grow but the year-over-year growth rate is not going to be at a 77% right. So expect those variable commissions and we model that out will certainly slow down and certainly we have had an extra ordinary amount of new product work going on and new product introductions.
I think the R&D hopefully will continue to be strong. We think we are very happy with what we are doing with our new structure and the fact that we have been able to maintain our direct people cost and the admin cost actually sequentially went down so we  think we will be able to leverage that going forward, so think about that staying very flat and thinking about the variable cost starting to moderate as we move forward.

Now normally speaking, June is normally our strongest quarter going in the end of our fiscal year. we obviously see some markets that are consumer driven, ongoing strength into the first quarter of next year and then I think you know what happens as you go into Christmas in Q1 next year, depends a lot on consumer demand, but certainly capital spending across the industries like I think it seems a lot of companies that come out of downturn flush with cashes driven a lot of purchase of [data] equipment and consumer spending in Asia certainly seems to be very strong we are benefiting from both of those.

Before I talk about our Q4 results, I’d like give all of you a brief update on our Japanese fraud issue.
As previously reported, in April 2010, we launched an investigation when we learned that individual working in Molex Japan’s Finance Group had obtained unauthorized loans from third-party lenders that we used to cover losses from unauthorized trading.
That investigation is substantially complete, and is confirmed that this individual forged documentation in arranging and concealing the transactions, and the total amount of the potential loss has not changed significantly from the prior quarter.
Based on the results of the investigation to date, we have decided for accounting purposes to treat this amount as a loss in the historic financial statements to the company and record a liability for the outstanding unauthorized loans in the amount of $166 million as of June 30th. 
We have recorded this liability by restating our financial statements with very little profit and loss impact in the prior three years, and most of the impact being and adjustment to beginning retained earnings. 
Dave Johnson will speak more about this accounting treatment during this section of the call.
The accounting treatment that we have adopted does not in anyway change our view of this matter and we intend to vigorously contest any attempt by the holder of the unauthorized loans to seek payment.
Due to the sensitive nature of this ongoing legal issue, we will not be able to answer questions relating to the fraud on this call.
So now let me take you on to talking about our operating results for the quarter. And, if you’d like to turn to page three, and look at the slide that shows our order trend, I’ll talk about that trend.
Bookings for the quarter were an all-time record of $910 million, which is 9% higher than the March 2010 quarter and 58% above the June 2009 quarter. While we generally see an improvement in order rates in the June quarter, a 9% sequential increase is significantly above our normal average and indicates that our key markets continue to improve.
The order rate accelerated throughout the quarter and is continued to be strong in July. This we believe gives us the solid momentum going into the September quarter.
For the full year, our bookings were $3.23 billion, up 34% year-over-year. It’s worth noting that in APS, Asia Pacific South, our bookings were up 50%, and we now have bookings in that region almost equal to the combined bookings that we see in the Americas and Europe.
Our book-to-bill ratio was 1.07-to-1. This is still quite strong. However, we expect that this will moderate in the coming quarters, a sequential order increases assume more normal seasonal patterns as additional capacity comes on line.
Now, turn to page four, and I’ll talk a little bit about the order trend by industry. Automotive bookings decreased 1% sequentially, but increased 43% year-over-year. As automotive production tends to decrease in the September quarter with summer shutdowns and model changes, a slight sequential decline in bookings is not surprising. 
Bookings in Europe decreased the most sequentially as incentive programs in these regions are winding down. June car sales in Europe were down 6% year-over-year. The US market has been recovering and is stabilizing in the range of 11 million to 12 million units per year. Dealer inventories remain low and it appears as domestic brands are taking some share back after a very poor period.
As a result, we saw a sequential increase in US bookings, which was offset by decreases in Europe. It’s interesting to note that China will most likely extend its lead over the US, selling an estimated 15.6 million vehicles versus a projected 11.8 million vehicles in North America. So the importance of the China market and the increasing electronic content in vehicles in those markets becomes even more important.
Bookings in the data market increased 12% sequentially and 54% year-over-year. We continued to see evidence of increased enterprise spending in networking, service and storage. Demand for our socket products continues to increase and new product introductions have generally been well received in this market.
Our large customers that we’ve talked to over the large couple of months seemed to be very optimistic that the second half of this year will continue to be strong in these segments. 
Telecom bookings increased 12% sequentially and 60% year-over-year. The telecom infrastructure market without this market this quarter, but the real driver of market performance was mobile phones, specifically smartphones. We are very well positioned with the major smartphone manufacturers. We saw a significant increase in orders in the June quarter as compared to the proceeding quarter. We expect this trend to continue as consumers accelerate their migration to smartphone segment and as new devices with increased functionality are introduced in the Christmas season.
Consumer electronics bookings increased 11% sequentially and 43% year-over-year. The digital still camera, flat-panel TV, and games sectors, all remain strong, based primarily on strong demand within Asia.
Backlight and 3D TV production is expected to accelerate in the July to December period and this will further strengthen bookings over that time period.
The car navigation market will probably slow in North America and Europe, but is beginning to accelerate in China.
Industrial bookings increased 8% sequentially and a very 96% year-over-year. Our industrial business continues to improve due to the recovery of the factory automation segment and very strong orders in the alternative energy markets.
In addition, we continued to see good synergy from our Woodhead acquisition and significantly increased bookings from our focus accounts in the industrial space. We expect this market to continue to expand as global GDP improves.
Our fastest year-over-year growth rates are shown in the military and medical markets. Two years ago, we had virtually no sales in these markets, were based on our bookings trends we could see up to 5% of our revenue coming from these markets in the year ahead. This is terrific progress based on focus on specific accounts with specific new technologies.
If you turn now to page five, I’ll talk briefly about what we’ve seen by channel and by geography. On the channel basis, we continued to see the strongest sequential increases in the distribution at EMS channels. Distributors seemed to be tightly managing their inventory and we have not seen significant increases in the inventories of our products during the quarter.
It should also be noted that the vendor managed inventory days increased by only 1.7 days sequentially from 24.7 days to 26.4 days, but were down from the 27.2 days a year-ago and still below our 30% target days. EMS customers continue to benefit from continued outsourcing as well as new product introductions, particularly in the consumer smartphone and notebook sectors.
On the geographic basis, we saw a nominal sequential improvement in the US and European markets. However, APS and APN both logged significant sequential improvements in bookings. The improvement in Asia is driven by data, telecom and consumer electronics market as much of the production for these global markets is in Asia. We have also noted that there is surging demand for these products in emerging countries within Asia and as a percentage of the products produced in Asia and then consumed in Asia continues to grow. This we believe will provide a strong growth going forward.
Please note that the percentage of our bookings coming from Asia is now at 61% and the percentage of our bookings outside the Americas is now at 76%.
Now, turn to page six. We’ve shown on this chart our revenue trend for the past two years. Revenue for the quarter was $847 million, which is 12% above the proceeding quarter and 48% above June 2009 quarter. All of this is organic growth. 
Revenue is now 67% higher than our locally registered in Q3 of FY09 and 3% below our high point of $872 million. The month of June was our first ever month with more than $300 million sales. We’ve improved for five consecutive quarters and we expect this trend to continue.
Turning now to page seven, I’ll talk very briefly about the revenue trend by industry, which largely follows the same trend that we’ve seen with our bookings. All of the markets were up sequentially and year-over-year. And we saw a stronger sequential growth rates push our revenue above the high end of our guidance for the quarter. The ongoing economic recovery has been more important than normal seasonal patterns over the last few quarters, but we think that normal seasonal patterns will start to resume during the second half of this calendar year. 
There continues to be uncertainty as to how sustainable the global recovery is. Looking forward at our major markets, we expect automotive to moderately decline sequentially, while data, telecom, consumer electronics and the industrial markets will continue to grow. Our view is that much of the economic commentary that we read today is too US-centric and understates the strength of ongoing economic recovery particularly in Asia.
Trying to balance all of these factors, we are giving revenue guidance of $850 million to $880 million for our next quarter. This would represent a 2% sequential revenue increase at the midpoint. At the upper end of the range, it would represent a 30% year-over-year increase in revenue and it’ll also represent record revenues for the company.
On that note, let me turn the call over to Dave Johnson, our CFO, who will take you through the financial statements. Thank you very much.

We have come to another yearend and it was a monumental year for Molex in so many ways. We are certainly very pleased with the financial results that we have achieved in fiscal year 2010.So let’s start",1982,"Thank you, Martin, and good afternoon, everyone. We have come to another yearend and it was a monumental year for Molex in so many ways. We are certainly very pleased with the financial results that we have achieved in fiscal year 2010.
So let’s start with the high level review of our fourth quarter P&L which is shown on page eight. Since we’ve already talked quite a bit about the strong revenue in bookings for the quarter, I’ll skip that and I’ll start with the gross margin of 29.9%. Though, this isn’t over 500 basis points from the prior year, it is down sequentially, which I’ll explain in detail in just a few minutes.
SG&A increased sequentially by just over 1% due to a modest increase in R&D for new product introductions and in selling costs due to the positive demand situation. Restructuring costs of $26.5 million closed out our restructuring program and I’ll discuss this in more detail also on a later slide.
The loss on unauthorized activities in Japan was $4.8 million for the quarter, representing primarily the cost of our investigation. By looking at this line, you’ll get a much better sense of the impact of our restatement. We had previously taken a charge of $31 million in Q3, as you might recall, which has now been reduced to $8 million, and the $2.7 million announced in Q4 of last year is the entire charge taken for that year.
As Martin said, the P&L impact in the recent three years is not significant, and most of the impact has been reflected in retained earnings. In fact, when you look at EPS, there is no impact in 2009, no impact in 2008 for the restatement. And, in 2007, we actually improved EPS by $0.02. And, in 2006, we reduced EPS by $0.04. So as we say, really very little impact on the P&L.
Even though we had recognized this matter as a contingent liability at the end of the third quarter, at the end of the year and based on the substantially completed investigation, we recorded for accounting purposes, an accrued liability of a $165.8 million for the outstanding unauthorized loans pending the resolution of these matters. What this means going forward is that if there is an ultimate resolution at any amount less than the liability, the difference will be reflected as a gain for Molex.
Please see the footnotes in our earnings release and the relevant disclosure in our 10-K, which we filed today for a full explanation of this restatement. I’m required to tell you that previously filed financial statements should not be relied on, but as I just said, we filed our 10-K, just about 30 minutes ago, which, of course, you can rely upon those financial statements.
Moving on, other expense returned to a more normal level of $1.8 million in the quarter and after an effective tax of 35% GAAP EPS came in at $0.23 per share.
Now to translate that to a non-GAAP basis, please see page nine. Beginning with the $0.23 from the prior page, we add back the restructuring charge of $0.14, and I’d like to emphasize that this will be our last quarter of calling out restructuring charges and reporting a non-GAAP EPS number.
The effective tax rate on the restructuring charge this month is unusually low due to the tax jurisdictions where the restructuring actions took place due to net operating losses in certain impacted locations and due to restructuring related tax charges, all of which increased the after-tax amount.
Finally, we add back $0.02 for the loss of an unauthorized activities in Japan and the resulting non-GAAP EPS therefore is $0.39 for the quarter, which was a sequential increase of 34% from the March quarter. And as the lower box indicates the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis for the fourth quarter was 27%, for the full year, the effective tax rate on a non-GAAP basis was 30.4%. So for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we believe the effective tax rate should be somewhere in the range of these two points, that is between 27% and 30%, and we have used 30% in our guidance outlook.
The chart on page 10 shows our full-year results. Revenue reached the $3 billion level, up 16.5% from the prior year. We experienced revenue growth in all end markets for the full year, but have the highest growth in automotive, consumer, and data markets. Geographically, our growth was strongest in the Asia-Pacific region, led by our strong presence in China.
For the year, gross margin improved 430 basis points to 29.7%. SG&A increased 4% from $587 million to $611 million. But remember that we had numerous one-time action such as salary and benefit reductions which reduced costs in 2009. As a percent of sales, SG&A improved by 240 basis points to just over 20% for the year.
And, on the next line, recall that restructuring and impairments included a goodwill impairment in 2009 of $264 million, due to the economic downturn. The next line is the loss in unauthorized activities, which we have already talked about it in length.
Next, other income and expense moved from an other income of $27.3 million to a expense of $6.3 million the most recent year. And this is due to higher interest expense in 2010 and some significant foreign exchange gains in 2009. 
The effective tax rates and EPS numbers are not very comparable due to the 2009 goodwill impairment. However, on a non-GAAP basis, the results can be much more easily compared.
So if you turn the page to page 11, we show that excluding restructuring, unauthorized activities in Japan, excluding tax corrections and goodwill, EPS for 2010 was $1.10 per share compared with $0.32 in 2009. This represents a 244% increase in non-GAAP EPS for the full year.
Page 12, sets forth some of our key balance sheet metrics. Net cash decreased sequentially but remains still above the $100 million. The reduction in cash is related to both the working capital and capital expenditures required to support our rapidly increasing business as well as the payment of cash severance for previous restructuring actions. 
Both receivables and inventory are trending well and are in good control. AR days sales outstanding are increasing slightly as more business ships to Asia where payment terms are generally longer than in the US. Inventory days are dropping gradually, but still remains higher than optimal due to the inventory banks that have been built up for our final production transfers related to the restructuring actions.
Capital expenditures increased to just under $80 million for the quarter, due to spending on tooling and assembly equipment for new product releases and also for generic capacity in which we have strategically invested to meet our critical delivery needs of our customers.
Page 13 is a key chart that shows our progression toward our operating income goal of 14%. The number that stands out is a sequential reduction in gross margin in the recent quarter to 29.9%, which I mentioned before that we would take about. We have carefully analyzed this lower-than-expected gross margin and concluded that the impact is not due to mix or to other business model issues, but rather due almost entirely to issues that we face in the quarter and delivering product to our customers, during what turned out to be the peak of our ramp up in demand, coupled with peaks of our production transfer activity.
We made the conscious decision to deal head-on with the customer delivery issues and to ensure that we would not disappoint our key customers in this critical time of our recovery. We incurred about $12 million to $14 million of unusual supply chain related costs, including overtimes, special warehousing costs, premium freight, and facility ramp-up costs. The good news is that these costs began to subside in June and has further come down in July.
Based on this progress, our guidance for the September quarter assumes that about half of these higher than usual supply chain costs will be eliminated by the coming quarter and we will revert back to a gross margin level in line with the third quarter, and the third quarter was 31.2%.
SG&A at 18.7% of revenue continues to move in a positive direction, dropping below 19% for the first time in our history. We continued to tightly manage the administrative costs, while allowing appropriate increases in R&D and selling expense to accommodate market demand. Overall, we are still in track for our 14% gross margin target and expect to achieve this milestone sometime in the upcoming fiscal year.
Now moving to restructuring on page 14, the upper left box summarizes our total programs, $315 million of costs and annual savings of $205 million. The total costs are $15 million higher than we had been forecasting. As we closed out the program, we added over $15 million of noncash asset and building impairments upon our final evaluation of the projects. The main portion of these impairments relates to buildings that had been written down earlier in the process, which needed to be further impaired due to the declining real estate market.
The top right box highlights our savings for the quarter, including $1 million of sequential savings, which is right on our prior forecast. The lower box shows a sequential savings that carry over into 2011. We expect $2 million of sequential savings in Q1 and a final $3 million of sequential savings in Q2. These savings related to the final closure and actions taken in the fourth quarter, the most important of which was the closure of our largest European facility located in Slovakia, which was finally closed in June.
We are done and we are pleased with the results. And our job now is to keep the cost savings, to simulate the production in the new locations, and to focus additional attention now to strategically build our new business.
Page 15 depicts our return on assets trend, which we refer to as RONA. Please look at the upward trend there, we have surpassed our target of 15% for the year. We achieved 15.8% and we are now sitting on our sites on the range of 20% to 25% in fiscal 2011.
And, on page 16, we show a similar trend of non-GAAP EPS, growing steadily from a negative $0.09 one year ago, to the current level of $0.39 for the June quarter, and most importantly, we expect the growth in earnings to continue which takes us to our last slide.
Slide 17 is our outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We have decided not to provide a full-year outlook since the economic environment is still difficult to predict. However, with the record order level going into the quarter and solid orders so far through July, we believe that we have good visibility into our near-term situation. And as a result, we are expecting to revenue in the range of $850 million to $880 million.
At this level of revenue, considering the improvements to our gross margin that I mentioned a few minutes ago and forecasting no increase in SG&A for the quarter, we expect earnings per share in the range of $0.42 to $0.46. At the midpoint of this range, EPS would grow sequentially by 13% and on a year-over-year basis by a 144%, and would represent operating income in absolute dollars for the company at record levels.
This guidance includes an estimate for the professional service costs in Q1, related to the Japan fraud, which we do not expect to be significant since the investigation is substantially complete.
This concludes our comments, and we will now take your questions. But I must remind you again that we will not be able to answer any questions related to the fraud in Japan.

And, what we’ve done is, we’ve now taken the original list of accounts and added some others to it for the coming year. 
And, what we’ve realized, I think when we focus our new global sales team and our product division on specific accounts, we are very difficult to beat and that’s what really what helped us grow significantly in some of those end markets. 
And, if you look at the margins on those accounts, purely from a perspective of looking at raw materials and labor costs and depreciation, so take the logistics out here for a second, the margins are better on those accounts. So I think we’re excited that that process seems to working and we will be expanding on it in the year ahead.

And, as we said, it’s not due to mix or material or labor cost, it was due to logistics costs. And, I would say, it’s a combination number of things. 
Number one, we were in the final phases of the restructuring that we were doing, and closing down 14 plants and having the number of logistic centers we have around the world. No disrespect to anybody in the analyst community, but I think you - it’s hard to imagine how challenging that is. It’s an enormous task. And by all means if you want to point a finger at our organization for saying that could have been executed more efficiently, certainly go ahead and do that. 
But, I also think you have to look at the fact that if you look at the top 100 connector companies around the world, the only one based on Bishop data that’s ranked in the top 10 consistently for customer service is Molex and we are very proud of that. We’ve been in the top 10 for the last 10 years. And we felt that it was appropriate to take extraordinary means to protect our customers during that period. 
And a lot of those costs were caused, because we were moving production around the world, when our bookings were ramping up. So absolutely it’s something we’re accountable for. But I would rather take one quarter of higher costs, protect our customers, so that we can continue to grow our business ahead, I think that’s a prudent business decision. And our vision here is how we grow share in the market and how we continue to service our customer as well. It’s not about just one quarter’s results.
And I would tell you in the middle of all that, as you know, we’re certainly not going to blame this, we had the volcano in Europe, but we certainly had a tremendous number of shipments that were impacted by that, and that had a considerable impact on the overall numbers as well.

So I think you’ll see our growth comes from a mixture of all three things. Organic growth will be dominant, internally funded startups will be there, and we would certainly do our fair share of deals going forward.

In terms of the demand environment, I would say that I have never seen such a big disconnect between what I read in the paper everyday about the economy and what we’re seeing in terms of our incoming order rate. 
And, as you saw during the commentary, I think a lot of the economic commentary you read in the press is very US centric. And we stretched I think during this call the percentage of our businesses outside of the US, and we genuinely believe there are a lot more other growth in Asia is self sustaining. 
And so, all I can tell you is the best predict that we have in future business I think is what’s happening to our bookings rate. It accelerated throughout the quarter, May was stronger than April, June was stronger than May, and July has continued that path. And we’ve got - a couple of days of August have been good too. So we haven’t seen it yet. 
Now, having said that, I would point out a couple of things. First of all, some portion of the recovery we’ve seen is clearly been driven by stimulus and restocking. Some of that obviously has to go away. I think some of what’s being built is being built for the Christmas season. And the question is will that be sold? And I don’t know the answer to that. But I think we’ll have a clearer picture on that at the end of the next quarter. 
We certainly aren’t seeing a build up with our products from an inventory prospective in distribution or in a vendor managed location. So, so far, I’d say demand has been strong. But, obviously, you’re not going to see the same sequential growth rates, because we’re now up at very high levels and it more than surpassed where we were over a year-ago.
In terms of your other questions, smartphones, I think the industry leaders there are well known, and there some key companies that have taken a lot of share. We have very good content in those phones based on our micro-mini chip products coming out of Japan and a number of other products from other divisions. And so, we’re really excited about that transition, because those phones transition around the world from particularly in Asia to operated devices, I think that’s just a great opportunity for the connector industry in general and we think we’re in a great, great position.
The comment I would make about the PC market is, the one area there where I have seen some concern is in the notebook sector. And I would say that scenario where there were some buildup of inventory of notebooks. And what we talked in the notebook suppliers, what they didn’t know was, was that, A, a slowdown in end demand and they were disappointed with kind of the back-to-school season coming up or why there wasn’t bulk there, or have the launches of things like the Apple iPad taken away some of the demand that they would have had, and has that impacted the end demand of notebooks. But if you look across the computer sector for us generally, overall demand is very good. But I say the inventory issue has been with ODMs in the notebook sector.

Martin, not to beat a dead horse, but just in terms of the performance in the quarter around the gross margins, you mentioned that part of the problem was that you had a pretty steep ramp going on in terms of customer pull it sounded like. Can you talk just functionally what has changed, because I would imagine you're going to have a pretty steep ramp at times in the second half of this year and so how are you better equipped to address that this time, so that we don't see margins maybe come back in into fourth quarter or something like that?

I think the reason you won’t see it again was that what we won’t see happen in the next six months is you won’t see very high ramping demand, enough moving both manufacturing capacity and warehousing locations at the same time. 
We have significantly reduced the number of customer service centers we have around the world and we’ve put in place regional hubs to support each region from an inventory perspective. And we have as you heard closed the largest plant in European in the last quarter. So all those things combined while volume was ramping was a real challenge. 
What I can tell you is the 90% of those costs were in the April-May time period. I mean, the impact was really at the beginning of the quarter. As we got those actions completed and we now have the new locations in place and manufacturing operating effectively in the new locations we see those costs going away. 
And what I see is I think honestly if I was objective about the quarter, we got to our EPS goals to a stronger growth than we anticipated, but with weaker margins. But the margins impact for one time and in fact I think it gives us the cushion as we go into the first half of next fiscal year, because we think the demand will remain strong and we’re going to be able to improve the margins based on eliminating those factors. And the factors are largely within our factors.

I think there are very few people who would have predicted a year-ago that many electronics companies would have recovered as well as they have. And I think going out another year is just really hard to do given the current environment. When I look at where do we get our confidence in terms of growth, let me quote the following: first of all, I think this whole info tech refresh around the world and the spending that companies are spending on their infrastructure to support that is ongoing. And, certainly our major customers seem to feel confident about that continuing. 
Secondly, I think there’s consumer spending in Asia. And the Asian demand for consumer devices that are very prevalent in North America and Europe is certainly ongoing. I've been fascinated by going to stores in China and watching how bare the stores are there and how they can’t keep flat panel TVs on the shelves, et cetera. 
And, lastly, I think we have a unique situation at Molex in the - our focus account program and our ability to grow our business in industrial and medical and military markets is supplementing what would be good growth and what a core markets for us computer and consumer. And so, that’s why I think barring a double-dip recession, I think we feel pretty confident about our ability to grow in the year ahead.

Frankly, the patterns are a little disturbing and I'd love to get your commentary here. North America and Europe we saw massive deceleration in orders in June, Asia Pacific remains strong, so just wanted to see how you sort of reconcile that with the really positive outlook on demand. And then tied to that even if I look at the channel order trends, distribution in EMS continue to remain strong, whereas the last couple quarters OEMs is simply growing about 4% to 5%, so I can't help but wonder whether we're still seeing restocking phenomenon that's still propelling orders and distribution into EMS, and whether in fact we are seeing some deceleration in order trends.

And so I think - and, of course, don’t forget when you look at Asia Pacific, in the prior quarter, you had Chinese New Year. 
So if you look back on the historic data, I would say it’s not unusual in this quarter to see Asia have much faster growth sequentially in North America and Europe. And other thing too is is that 1% to 2% sequential growth offers a very high revenue level would normally be considered pretty healthy quarter-to-quarter. And I think people have got used to in this recovery mode of seeing very large and sequential jumps. And - but one of the things I tried to highlight in the call is that, I think the fact that Molex now derives now over 60% of its business from Asia, I think if I had confidence in anything, it’s of ongoing economic growth in Asia. 
So if you combine that, I think ongoing moderate sequential growth in Europe and the Americas is still positive and stronger growth in Asia in my mind is what you should expect given the difference in the economic prospects of those areas. I absolutely agree with you in terms of the higher rates of growth in distribution certainly is based on restocking. But the good news is, through our SAP system, we have very good tracking of both the POS and the POP data. And so we can see what’s being sold through. So there isn’t a build up that we can see of our specific products. 
Now if end demand slows, obviously you would see that. So if you look at all that picture, I think what we’re going to see in our view is a fairly good quarter going into September. And I think then instead of seeing economic recovery driving the growth, we would then go back to normal seasonal trends. So you would expect to see sequential slower growth in the December and Chinese New Year quarter and then picking up again after that. So I think we’re getting back to more normal seasonal trends. I don’t think that means we’re going backwards. Next.

I think the real in terms of this whole demand cycle is as we hit the September-October periods, what it’s exactly in terms of end demand of the products that are being built. 
I mean, do we run into a horizon where more stuff is being built than people are ultimately going to buy and that drives a slowdown as we get close to Christmas. Our view is that if we maintain business at the current level, if you just multiplied our fourth quarter by four, for us, we would end up with still a very healthy growth rate for the - to the whole year. So I think it’s inevitable that the sequential quarters are going to show slower growth. Our overall pictures taking to customers and looking at our geographic mix is that, you’ll continue to see growth, but at a probably slower rate.

And, in fact, I think it’s a question that gets asked more generally about the dependence of Asian economies on the export markets. And, as you know, I lived in Asia for 10 years, and during those periods",242,"It’s a great question that we get asked a lot. And, in fact, I think it’s a question that gets asked more generally about the dependence of Asian economies on the export markets. And, as you know, I lived in Asia for 10 years, and during those periods, that customers were largely dependent upon export markets. We have some records that talk about the fact that about three years ago, more than 50% of the electronics that was made in Asia, now stays in Asia, and that percentage has obviously grown. 
And, I think if you look at the economic growth rates of the Asia economies - and I think one of the positive byproducts of the wage increases you’ve seen in China is that is going to put more Chinese across the tipping point what I can afford to buy consumer durable goods. So the downside of those wage rates is higher labor costs in China. The upside I think is increasing domestic market opportunity there. 
So our view is that more of it stays in Asia now than comes back. I think it’s very hard to get accurate data for that. And, certainly, we don’t have the ability go to every one of our customers and ask that question, because very often, we could be selling to a distributor or a CM who is telling to an end customer, so it’s very difficult to get a clear end picture.

So we don’t have any of the working environment or leading environment issue that you’ve read about in the press. And if you look at the wage increases that will make the impact is probably about $2 million to $3 million over a year. So, even though you talk about big percentages, the absolute dollars are not huge in terms of the standard increase that we go through.

Compared to the - that point in time, now, the spot price for gold is down just a hair and copper is about what it was, but still not much of a change even through today.
Just for the information if I may. We’ve put our hedges in place and we put our hedge in place for copper at $3.26 and we put our hedge in place for gold at $1,251 per Troy ounce, so those are - the copper hedges ever so slightly in the money and we’re well below that for gold today.

Before we start the main call, I just wanted to give all of you a quick update on our situation in Japan. As you know, we announced publicly on April 9 that we recently learned that Molex had been a victim of a fraud on the part of an individual in our Japanese subsidiary. We've engaged legal counsel, Jones Day, and they have in turn engaged forensic accountants, AlixPartners, to investigate this matter. Based on the investigators' input and the written and oral statements from the individual involved, we believe that he forged documentation that enabled him to borrow money from Japanese banks in Molex Japan's name on an unauthorized basis and then concealed those transactions. We believe he used the unauthorized borrowings primarily to fund losses on unauthorized security trades, also made in Molex's name. At this point, we believe that the total amount involved in this fraud scheme is approximately $193.2 million, of which we have recognized the loss in the quarter of $31 million and disclosed a contingent liability of $162.2 million. The contingent liability represents the current balance of unauthorized borrowings at Molex Japan.
Since this matter is the subject of an ongoing investigation, we hope that you will understand that we will not be able to answer any questions on this call relating to this fraud. But we will certainly update you as soon as we have appropriate information to release. Now let's turn our attention onto the quarter's results. If you could turn to Page 3, I'll start by talking about our order trend.
Overall bookings for the quarter were $838 million, up 8% sequentially and 77% year-over-year. Given that this comparison is to the low point of last year's downturn, we expected strong results. But these results are much stronger than our most optimistic projections. Excluding last year's downturn, our average sequential increase in bookings in Q3 versus Q2 is about 3% to 4% versus the 8% we saw this quarter. The ongoing recovery was clearly far more important than any seasonal factors this quarter. The year-over-year numbers were the strongest that I have ever seen in my career at Molex. And as you will hear shortly, our booking strength was very broad-based. It's worth noting that our March monthly bookings were a new record for the company, and our April run rate is above the level that we have reported for Q3.
To date, we have not seen any evidence of double ordering, but we have some distributors trying to rebuild inventory, strong orders for new product launches at some customers and some building of inventory in preparation for a predicted stronger second half to this calendar year. And I'll give you a few more data points on your concerns perhaps in that area later in my presentation. Overall, our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was a very strong 1.11. If you turn now to Page 4, I'll talk about the changes in our orders by industry segment for the March quarter.
Our booking strength, as you can see from the chart, was very broad-based. The percent of our bookings now coming from focused accounts is over 26% of the total. This is further evidence of the success of our focused account program, which is helping both our growth and our margins. Automotive bookings were up 8% sequentially and 80% year-over-year. We continue to benefit from incentive schemes in Japan and from some countries in Europe. Although, as I'm sure you know, the incentive schemes have now stopped in Germany. In North America, Q1, we saw vehicle sales increase for the whole market by 16% to 2.545 million vehicles. Molex's order increase for the same period was up over 60%.
In China, Q1 calendar year '10 passenger car production was approximately 3.5 million vehicles, up 84% from a year ago. Molex's growth over the same period is up over 120%. We believe there's very strong evidence that we are gaining share to increase sales of standard products across multiple platforms, particularly in Asia. And with increasing electronic content, particularly in telematics and safety and convenience applications, we see plenty of opportunities for this growth to continue. Global vehicle production is predicted to increase 8% percent in calendar year '10 to 61.4 million vehicles, and a further 8% to 66.6 million in calendar year '11.
Automotive Group remains a very large connector market. And with our new structure and our global footprint, we believe we can continue to grow fast in the market and operate far more profitably than we had in the recent past. 
If you now look at the Data segment, we were up 3% sequentially and 81% year-over-year. Calendar year '10 Q1 is normally a weak quarter for the data markets because of a lull following strong calendar year-end hardware purchases. Many companies obviously have capital budgets that are structured on the calendar year basis. This lull did not happen this year. Networking was very strong. And particularly, we had strong orders coming from all of the market leaders in that segment, so it was broad-based even within the Networking segment.
The service sector continues to strengthen, and we are seeing strong growth from new products, particularly our new range of IC sockets. In storage, the migration to new protocols such as SAS 2.0 and 16 gigabit fiber channel is very positive for Molex with the strong product range that we have in that area. Notebooks were also strong, with bookings up over 90% for the quarter year-over-year, and across the entire data sector, we believe that our strong new product portfolio and the strength of our global sales team that is now selling our entire product range is really helping us to gain share in this segment as well. Telecom was up 5% sequentially and 67% year-over-year. The smartphone sector continues to grow quickly, with Molex particularly benefiting from the Android platform sales. Mid-range was down this quarter, but is expected to recover in Q4. Entry-level phones in emerging markets remained strong, but only increasingly supported by local manufacturers and gray market phones.
Overall cell phone shipments were up only 2% sequentially calendar year '10 versus Q4 calendar year '09, but smartphones were up 15%. What's very obvious and has been very widely publicized is that the incremental revenue growth and profit opportunity in the cell phone market is clearly going to be in the cell phone segment where Molex is very strong. Overall, the market is expected to expand from 1.21 billion units in calendar year '09 to 1.4 billion units in calendar year '10. But some of the major manufacturers that we deal with in this segment are concerned about possible shortages of memory and LCD. If that happens, that obviously could limit the overall growth of the market.
If you look at the telecom equipment market, that was very, very strong last quarter, particularly with customers in Asia and customers supporting the Asian market. There are some players in both North America and Europe who have been very successful in Europe, and we have equally enjoyed that success with them. Migration to new platforms is really what is driving this, along with new product sales to Molex as a company.
Consumer Electronics was up 6% sequentially and 66% year-over-year. The growth here has been driven by consumers in Asia, particularly in the developing markets. Some particularly strong segments for us are the digital still camera market where a transition is taking place from digital still cameras to digital single-lens reflex cameras. The reason we bring up that particular difference is that if you look at the connector bond or the difference between DSC and DSLR is that the connector content is about 3x, and that obviously helps our sales in that segment. Flat-panel TVs where LED backlighting is becoming an increasing trend, obviously also increases the content in those devices, and that has helped us. 3D TV is still small but is growing rapidly. The other good segments for us in the consumer market are the gaming market, where we are doing very well with all three of the major players, pachinko and e-readers.
Our Q3 Industrial bookings were up sequentially a very strong 20%, and 80% year-over-year. And we actually had record bookings in March for the industrial sector. In a market that most people still think is generally weak, we are very excited to see such strong results from the Industrial segment. As we stated last quarter, we're starting to see the benefits of our Woodhead acquisition and the synergy with Molex where we're combining Woodhead's industrial experience with Molex's electronic technology. We've seen particularly strong growth in alternative energy markets, security networks, robotics and the semiconduction production equipment sectors. So we're really pleased to see this, and we're really pleased to see the benefit from our Woodhead acquisition coming through.
Finally, the medical and military markets, which are still small markets for Molex overall, we're up 15% sequentially but were up 188% year-over-year. We're seeing lots of new product wins in both sectors. We have very strong project pipeline in both sectors and we're really pleased to report that during the current quarter, one of the major military contractors named Molex as a preferred supplier. So you can expect to see us to continue to have growth in both of these sectors.
Please turn now to Page 5 where I'll talk about our order growth by channel and by geography. We saw strong growth across all channels, but distribution in EMS were much stronger than the OEM. It's worth noting that both of these channels made dramatic cutbacks in inventory levels in the same quarter last year. EMS did this because customers in some key segments took business back in-house to keep their own plants busy, and distributors' credit to them reacted very quickly so they slowed down their orders that they had placed on suppliers. We are seeing distributors continue to rebuild inventory levels to support increased end demand.
As I stated earlier, we've not seen any evidence of double ordering. But stronger end demand, slightly longer lead times and greater confidence in the back end of the year is obviously driving stronger orders than we expected. One data point here that might be helpful toward our analysts is that normally Molex has about 10% of its backlog, which is scheduled out beyond three months. At the end of March, that number had increased to 13%. So it's higher than normal. But as you can see, it's not materially higher, which gives us great confidence that our backlog is strong and it's certainly shippable. By geography, it should come as no surprise that the strongest year-over-year numbers came from Asia-Pacific sales. The surprise this quarter was the broad-based growth in all of our other regions and in particular, the strong sequential number in the Americas and Europe.
The sequential growth in the Americas was broad-based, and in Europe, it was driven primarily by industrial markets and by the automotive market.  APN, dominated by Japan, was sequentially the weakest, but saw a very good pickup at the end of the quarter as consumer customers started to launch new products for the current calendar year and the lead-in towards the selling season at the back end of the calendar year. By the end of this fiscal, I think it's worth pointing out that Molex will have more than 60% of its revenues coming from Asia, up from just 50% in fiscal year '07. I think that says a lot about the transitioning of the electronics industry to Asia and also the strong presence that Molex has in that very important end geography.
Now turning to Slide 6. Several of our key markets normally suffered in the March quarter. And looking back over the last couple of decades, we'd normally expect our third quarter revenue to be down sequentially 3% to 4%. That was clearly not the case this quarter as revenue increased 3.7% from the December quarter and almost 50% from the March quarter last year. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement, and we are now just 13% below our peak of $872 million that was achieved in the June 2008 quarter. And finally now for me, if you turn to Page 7, I'll talk very briefly about the changes in our revenue by industry.
As you can see on this chart, all of the markets improved substantially from the same quarter last year. On a sequential basis, the data, telecom and consumer markets were down between 1% and 2% from the December quarter, but that is much, much better than normal seasonality. Automotive was up 6% and Industrial was up 18%. Going forward, we expect to see the strongest sequential growth in the industrial market, as our growing market share in that segment continues. Consumer Electronics, Data and Telecom will exhibit above-average growth, and we expect Automotive could moderate somewhat, because clearly, some of the strength we've seen has been incentive-driven and the expectation is those incentives will be progressively withdrawn as they year continues. 
The June quarter is generally our strongest quarter of the year. And our order rates in April remain strong. We are, therefore, based on our March orders and the April trends we are seeing, providing a revenue guidance of $810 million to $830 million for the June quarter. Now let me turn the call over to Dave Johnson, who will take us through the finances in more detail."

As Martin mentioned, we are very pleased with the revenue results of $756.3 million, which is well above the top end of our guidance, and up sequentially in what was normally a down quarte",1235,"Thank you, Martin. Please turn now to Slide 8 for our P&L summary. As Martin mentioned, we are very pleased with the revenue results of $756.3 million, which is well above the top end of our guidance, and up sequentially in what was normally a down quarter seasonally.
Gross margin of 31.2% reflects favorable product mix, better-than-expected savings from restructuring and the continuation of a very good operating leverage that we have seen coming out of the downturn. SG&A, at $156.4 million, is up sequentially due to R&D costs and variable selling costs, not due to general admin spending. I will skip over restructuring and our loss on unauthorized activities in Molex Japan since we'll cover these on the next slide. Other expense is up sequentially due to higher interest expense, which was $2.3 million for the quarter, and a $1.8 million investment loss primarily due to our 20% ownership share in a Singaporean company that we account for on the equity method. This company is going through its own restructuring activity, which resulted in a loss in that business for that quarter and may continue into the next quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5%, which takes us to net income of $23.8 million or $0.14 per share on 174.8 million shares outstanding. 
The chart on Page 9 is our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. As just mentioned, GAAP EPS was $0.14, to which we add back $0.04 for our restructuring program and $0.11 for the unauthorized activities in Molex Japan that Martin explained. This resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.29. This is well above the midpoint of our previous guidance of $0.24 and is the highest EPS that we have reported in six quarters.
The slide on Page 10 details our balance sheet metrics. Our net cash has dropped to $160 million from $207 million in the December quarter. This is due primarily to the cash impact of the unauthorized activities in Molex Japan, working capital requirements to support the recent growth in our business and higher capital expenditures. The higher CapEx is related to production tooling for significant new product introductions and select capacity increases for production machinery to keep up with the rapidly increasing demand from our customers.
As one would expect in this demand environment, both accounts receivable and inventory were increasing in absolute dollar terms. However, accounts receivable's days sales outstanding has come down from 76 days last quarter to 73 days this quarter. Going in the other direction, inventory days have increased from 74 days last quarter to 80 days this quarter. Inventory increased at the quarter-end to support the record level of bookings that we experienced in March and really due to the buffer inventories for the final stage of our product transfer activities in connection with our restructuring program.  It's noteworthy that our vendor-managed inventory remains in very good shape at well below 30 days, and inventory at distributors has not yet increased above normal levels.
We have pulled together gross margin, SG&A and operating margin trends all on one chart on Page 11 primarily to demonstrate the progress we are making toward our goal of 14% operating margins. Gross margin has trended very well from a low of 18.5% a year ago to the current quarter of 31.2%. This really demonstrates the substantial operating leverage of our new cost structure even in the face of transition costs such as freight and duty that remain high and increasing commodity costs. We had better-than-expected cost savings resulting from our restructuring program, approximately $6 million in sequential savings in the quarter versus the $3 million that we had anticipated and most of these savings benefited the cost of sales line this quarter.
Price erosion was not a material factor in the quarter as we continue to see slight downward pressure on this metric, though still at the upper-end of our 3% to 5% annual expected range. SG&A, at 20.7%, reflects spending in absolute dollars of $156 million, which is approximately $4 million higher than anticipated. The much-faster-than-expected recovery in demand has resulted in higher spending for both R&D and variable selling costs, but administrative costs, which are all costs other than R&D and selling costs, actually declined sequentially.
In addition, it's interesting to note that the total SG&A salaries were flat sequentially. This demonstrates that the sequential increase in SG&A is clearly related to the non-people variable costs that I mentioned, which again is caused by the faster-than-expected recovery of our business. As year-over-year growth rates moderate, we expect these variable costs to stabilize.
Most importantly, our operating income margin has improved very steadily from the prior year to the current level of 10.5%, and we would expect a similar sequential increase in Q4 as we have seen in the past two quarters.
On Page 12, we showed a trend of our return on net assets metric or RONA, which increased from the low point of 3.7% in Q4 last year to 14.2% this quarter. This is the metric that, under our new division structure, we have introduced to monitor the overall progress of each division and business unit. This is intended to focus our operating units on the key factors that they can control to improve our return on assets, which are operating income, capital expenditure and working capital. Our internal goal has been to get back to 15% by the end of the year, and we are clearly on track to meet and exceed this number by the fourth quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 13. We are just one quarter away from the completion of our three-year restructuring program. We incurred $9 million in primarily cash charges in the quarter and expect to incur the final $11.5 million in Q4 to complete this $300 million project, which will result in annual savings of at least $205 million. As mentioned previously, we are very pleased to see savings brought forward into the third quarter from the fourth quarter. We had expected $3 million in sequential savings but actually recognized $6 million savings as I mentioned. This then leaves just $1 million of sequential savings for Q4 to get us to our full savings target, but we still expect some additional sequential savings in the first two quarters of fiscal year 2011.
We are down to one final plant closure in Slovakia. And then, of course, the completion and final setup and smooth transition of all the production transfers.
Our guidance for the coming quarter is shown on Slide 14. Based on our strong bookings and backlog position, we estimate that at the midpoint of our guidance, revenue is expected to increase by 8.4% to the range of $810 million to $830 million, as Martin mentioned. After eliminating the restructuring charge of $0.06, our non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.40. And it's important to note that this excludes any cost or charges related to the investigation process in Japan.
In summary, we had strong operating results for the quarter, and we are confident that we will continue to see improved operating results now in the fourth quarter. We will now open up the call for questions, and I would like to state, just once again, that we will not be able to answer any questions related to the fraud in Molex Japan due to the ongoing investigation."

I think the point we wanted to stress in the current quarter was that the increase in SG&A came from variable selling costs. And when you've got bookings growing year-over-year by 77%, you can imagine what that does to things like sales commissions and things like that. We expect that we're going to continue to grow, but the year-over-year growth rate is not going to be at a 77% rate. So we expect those variable commissions, and we've modeled that out will certainly slow down. And certainly, we've had an extraordinary amount of new product work going on and new product introductions. I think the R&D, hopefully, will continue to be strong. But we think we are very happy with what we're doing with our new structure and the fact that we've been able to maintain our direct people costs, and the admin costs actually sequentially went down. So we think we'll be having to leverage that going forward. So think about that staying very flat and thinking about the variable costs starting to moderate as we move forward.

As I said, interestingly enough, one of the best analysis we did, because we had a lot of questions about had we seen any evidence of double ordering and things like that. So one of us announced that we'd actually look to see how far out does our backlog go. And only about 10% of it goes out beyond the next three months. Typically, there's about 13% of it beyond that right now. So there's a little bit of forward ordering going on, but I wouldn't call that a large amount. I think it also reinforces the fact why we want to probably stick to quarterly guidance, because given how short-term the backlog is and how low the visibility in the electronics industry, it's hard to go out beyond that. Now, normally speaking, June is normally our strongest quarter, going to the end of our fiscal year. And we obviously see the markets that are consumer-driven, ongoing strength into the first quarter of next year. And then I think what happens as you go into Christmas in Q1 next year depends a lot on consumer demand. But certainly, capital spending across industries where I think it seems a lot of companies have come of out this downturn, flushed with cash, has driven a lot of purchase of data equipment. And consumer spending in Asia certainly seems to be very strong, and we're benefiting from both of those."

If you like to turn to page three, we have added a new slide to this quarter’s deck, where we have put in a one page summary of what we think are the key points emerging from the quarter we just finished.",2183,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon everybody. If you like to turn to page three, we have added a new slide to this quarter’s deck, where we have put in a one page summary of what we think are the key points emerging from the quarter we just finished.
The first point I obviously want to talk about is a quick update on unauthorized activities in Japan. As you already know, the unauthorized activity occurred many years ago when we restated our financial results in June 10-K to reflect the liability of this unauthorized activity.
During the quarter that we just completed, we were served notice of a lawsuit by the financial institution involved. We responded to this complaint and we intend to vigorously defend our position as these loans were unauthorized. This matter is now subject to ongoing litigation. We can’t provide additional details at this time or answer any more questions about this particular topic.
Now, we would like to spend the rest of the call talking about our operating results, and we are very pleased to announce the fact that we had record revenues and earnings per share in the September quarter.
Given where we were 18 months ago, this is quite an accomplishment and obviously reflects good progress by the company and tremendous recovery in the electronics industry generally.
Our orders declined from the record levels obtained in the June quarter; however, we still had one of our best quarters ever for orders and the level of business activity certainly remains quite strong.
During the quarter, we made progress reducing our unusual logistics costs as well as improving production efficiencies on transferred production. Corrective actions of these items are largely a function of time, time to build inventory to fill ceilings and time for our manufacturing operations to learn the nuances of working with new equipment.
We continue to improving in these areas, and we expect to see further progress in the December quarter. We also made progress reducing our backlog, which hit an all-time high in the June quarter due to the rapid recovery experienced over the last several quarters.
Backlog was reduced by $28 million from the June levels as we brought online additional capacity.
Finally, we announced a 15% increase in our dividend. We have a long-term commitment to our dividend and given the increase in earnings potential of our new organization and the projected future cash flows, we are very comfortable increasing the payout at this time.
You turn now to page four. I’ll talk a little bit about our revenue and order trend. Revenues for the September quarter were an all-time high of $898 million, 3% above the previous high reached in June of ‘08 and 6% above the June quarter and 33% above the same quarter last year.
Even though orders declined 5% sequentially from the record set in the June quarter at $868 million, we achieved our third best quarter ever for new orders and year-over-year orders were still up 20% and all of that growth was organic.
The order rate was slower during the early summer and strengthened during the September and that strength has continued into October. While previous quarters were helped by incentives and inventory restocking, we believe that our current order rate is now more reflective of end demand.
It’s also worth noting that our bookings in the June quarter were up 9% sequentially and 58% year-over-year, so on a sequential basis we’re comparing ourselves to a record quarter.
Given that the major economies in Europe and North America are recovering slowly, it’s apparent that the emerging markets, particularly China are driving most of the growth in the electronics sector.
Disposable income in China increased by over 80% during the last five years and this trend is expected to continue as the recovery becomes more consumption-oriented and less dependent on exports.
This shift coupled with the proliferation of mobile devices and related infrastructure, an uptick in enterprise spending on tech hardware, and many new product introductions, we believe we will provide good opportunities to continue to grow our business as we move forward.
You turn now to page five I’ll talk a little bit about the order trend by channel and by geography. By channel, orders from distribution decreased by the largest amount, by about 12% from the June quarter.
Distributors seem to have largely replenished their inventories and in my own view perhaps over-corrected on the down side of when the market took its plummet and about over-corrected on the upside and are now in the process of adjusting their inventory levels and the order rates accordingly.
Orders from OEMs and EMS were only down by 2% and 3% respectively. As I said before, we achieved record orders in the June quarter, so the slight decrease particularly in the OEM and EMS sectors is really not surprising in the current quarter.
By region, Europe decreased by 15% from the June rate largely due to the summer slowdown caused by vacations and holidays. Year-over-year Europe was only up 8% and that’s largely because Europe benefited the most from stimulus in the ‘09 period.
Orders in the Americas declined 9% since June, due to summer slowdown in July and August, and due to lower orders primarily from distribution. Asia North increased from the June quarter by 6%, this reflects a strong consumer electronics market for us and strong demand for mobile phones and particularly smartphones.
Asia South was down 4% from June again largely due to seasonal slowdown in orders, but we saw that those orders were up 32% year-over-year. So, our business level in Asia South remains very, very high. 64% of our total orders were from Asia in this quarter.
As a percent of our business coming from Asia just continues to increase as we move forward. This is somewhat explained by the relative strength in markets where production is largely in Asia, mainly mobile phones, consumer electronics and info tech.
It’s also the result of the increased consumption of those devices in emerging markets. It’s worth noting that our orders in the Asia-Pacific South region alone exceeded the total of our orders in North America and Europe combined in the last quarter.
Now, if you turn to page six, I’ll talk a little bit about the change in our revenue and orders by end market. Revenues for the automotive market declined 4% sequentially and orders declined 9% from the June quarter. This was not unexpected and that automotive production usually declines in the September quarter.
On a geographic basis, we’ve seen favorable results in North America, as the market seems to have stabilized and continues to rebound. September auto sales were the best in 13 months in North America and it’s worth noting that those records were achieved without incentives, and we’re now on a run rate to sell about 12.2 million vehicles in North America.
Europe slowed down in part due to the end of most of the stimulus packages across Europe, but also due to the summer holiday period which probably has the biggest impact in Europe.
We have also now fully, evenly balanced between our automotive revenues in North America, Europe and Asia, that business being slipped a third, a third, a third.
Going forward, we expect the North America and China will post the highest growth rates, while Europe and Japan will stay relatively flat. Longer term, we also believe that the increasing electronic content in vehicles will help to grow our automotive business. The data or info tech market performed as expected.
Revenues increased 6%, while orders decreased 3% from the June quarter. Revenue increased in large part due to backlog reductions, while the decrease in orders is due to a small buildup in inventory in the supply chain. This inventory is very product and customer-specific does not appear to be reflective in overall pullback in end market demand.
If you recall, many of the large players in the info tech market were impacted by components shortages earlier this year and at the same time, were very optimistic that demand would be very strong in the second half and that they would all gain market share.
Now that component shortages appear to have been resolved, there appear to be a modest inventory buildup that is being worked through and we believe will be worked through by the end of the calendar year.
Companies still need to upgrade their datacenters and add capacity and we think that that underlying trend will provide ongoing good business as we move into 2011.
We are also seeing just as an anecdote tremendous interest in cabinet computers. And I was recently visiting our operations in Japan, and looking at our customer relationship module. It’s interesting to note that we’re actively working on 50 different tablet computer programs. It just shows there’s some tremendous interest in that new format.
If you look now on page six, I’ll continue with the commentary relative to the end markets. The telecom market which included infrastructure, networking, as well as mobile phones, performed well overall with revenues increasing 10% and orders decreasing 4% from the June quarter.
Infrastructure revenue was down modestly, however, orders were down by 14%. This business tends to be very lumpy and chunky and has been very strong coming out of the downturn.
We announced seeing a pause in the level of business activity. However, both revenue and orders are well above the prior year levels. Revenue and orders for the mobile phone submarket were very, very strong. 30% up sequentially and 23% year-over-year. This is due into a large number of new products being introduced and a continued shift to smartphones as well as a strong seasonal influence.
Looking ahead, there are many new products in the horizon for the mobile phone market, including HD screen, 4G devices and continued share gains of smartphones as well as the introduction of Android and Windows 7 based devices.
Many of the major OEMs have also done a good job of penetrating new geographies with mobile phones. Overall, we believe that this trend will drive the need for infrastructure to support new devices as we move into calendar year ‘11.
Despite what you read in the press, the consumer market at least for us has been quite strong. Revenues increased 12% for the June quarter and orders declined a modest 1% which is below the normal seasonal trend that we would see. It is largely due to the number of new product introductions, backlog reductions and the strong influence of a pre-Christmas build.
Even in these difficult times, consumers are choosing to spend their discretionary income on an interesting array of devices, which have increased in connector content. For example, LCD panels, trends include now 3D technology, LED backlighting and an increasing use of these high definition displays in public domains.
While we do not know the exact percentage of end consumption in emerging markets, we do know that this percentage is increasing due to strong economic growth and a rise in consumers in developing countries. This is a long-term trend coupled with the recovery in the economies of the developing countries, and new products offerings will drive growth in 2011 and beyond.
Revenue in the industrial market increased 3% in the June quarter, while orders declined 8%. The reduction in orders from distribution had a profound impact on this market and this is very much a high-mix, low-volume market where distribution is a significant channel.
We continue to see opportunities in automotive and semiconductor equipment as well as with our Focus Accounts. Revenues in orders are up 50% and 43% respectively from the September quarter last year. So, overall relative to a year ago, this market is still very strong.
Orders from our Focus Accounts grew 3% sequentially versus the June quarter and we’re up 55% from the prior year, well above the growth rate for the total company. These AD [ph] accounts now represent 30% of total Molex orders. We increased the program by 26 accounts this year to further develop our focus markets and find new opportunities for growth. This quarter’s success represents another step forward in the success of this program.
As we move into the December quarter, we see strong activity in mobile phones and smartphones, a modest level of inventory in the info tech sector, which needs to be burned off, a slight pause in networking and a good, but not great, Christmas season developing for consumer goods.
This leads us to conclude that the December quarter will be the lull and normal season average in terms of sequential growth, but still at a very positive level relative to the prior year.
Our expectation is that bookings will be relatively flat from this point forward through Chinese New Year and based on discussions with our end customers, we’ll then pick up as we move into calendar year ‘11.
Let me now turn the call over to Dave Johnson, our CFO, who will give you greater details on the financial numbers that we’ve released.

As promised previously, this information is only shown on a GAAP basis beginning with this quarter and going forward. The elements that previously were excluded for non-GAAP reporting, specifically restructuring and unauthorized activities in Japan are separately listed on the statement so that you can easily compare the period shown. Both revenue and gross profit were all-time records for Molex.
On an organic basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue was up 5% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. SG&A decreased in absolute dollars by $1.6 million sequentially and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A decreased by $2.4 million. The unauthorized activities in Japan for September and June 2010 related to investigation and litigation costs.
The $5.5 million expense for the September quarter or $0.02 per share was higher than anticipated, but included all costs to wrap up the investigation phase. We are now moving into the litigation phase.
Looking ahead to the next quarter, we should expect the Japan litigation costs to be roughly half of the $5.5 million amount that we incurred in the September quarter.
The other noteworthy item in the P&L is other expense. This includes equity income and minority investments offset by a foreign exchange loss in the quarter. For the coming quarter, you should assume that this will be other income in the range of $3 million to $5 million and this is a result of the operational results of our equity investments, which are improving.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%. This includes the tax charge of $2.3 million or $0.01 per share, which is due to options that expired under water for which we had previously recognized the tax deduction. Without this charge, our effective tax rate would have been right at 30%.
Finally, we reported record net income of $75.1 million and record earnings per share of $0.43.
Page eight summarizes our balance sheet metrics. Net cash of $73 million reflects a reduction in cash to build our inventory for the conversion from air to sea shipments, also the payment of severance related to our restructuring program, as well as the higher than normal capital expenditure level, driven by new product releases and capital constraints.
I mentioned at our September 9th Analyst Meeting that positive free cash flow generation would begin in the second quarter, and we’re on track as planned to generate free cash flow, roughly equal to net income going forward. Because of our confidence in generating positive free cash flow, we have increased our dividend by almost 15% to an amount approximating $30 million per quarter.
I would also like to mention that during the quarter, we expanded our revolving credit facility by bringing in three additional banks and increasing the size of the facility to $270 million. At the end of the quarter, we had a $110 million drawn, and therefore, $160 million available under this facility.
The progress toward our 14% operating margin is shown on page nine. Our gross margin improved 70 basis points in the quarter to 30.6%. We reduced our freight expenses from the high level reported in the June quarter, but much of this benefit was offset by higher commodity costs and the impact of foreign currencies.
Commodities and currencies decreased our gross profit by $6 million sequentially after several quarters of nominal impact on these items. The two commodities that impact us the most are gold and copper, both of which increased throughout the quarter and have continued to increase up till the present time.
We have begun to benefit from the hedges, we put in place at the beginning of the quarter for gold and copper, but the hedge benefits are included in the sequential costs that I just mentioned.
With respect to foreign currencies, we net the translation impact, which is positive with a weaker dollar with the transaction impact, which for us is generally a negative with weaker dollar. The weakness of the U.S. dollar versus the yen, in particular, impacted us in the quarter, as for example, we manufacture in Japan, export to Hong Kong and sell into China in U.S. dollar.
We have modeled the impact of both commodities and currencies thus far in the second quarter and expect to have a similar sequential headwind in Q2, as we experienced in Q1 for these items.
SG&A at 17.5% reached an all-time low and exceeded our target goal of 18% for the first time. Looking forward, merit increases which went into effect on October 1 will increase salaries and wages by $4.2 million per quarter of which approximately $2.5 million are related to the SG&A line.
Of course, the ultimate goal is to improve our operating margin. We have steadily increased this metric from 6.8% a year ago to $12.5% in the current quarter. Note that the four previous quarters are adjusted for restructuring in Japan costs, but the current quarter includes a $5.5 million Japanese investigation litigation costs, which reduces the operating margin by 60 basis points.
I think it is also helpful to look back to the period before the downturn. In the June quarter of 2008, at our previous peak of $872 million in revenue our operating margin was 11.3%. We are well above that level today and progressing toward our 14% target.
We continue to show good progress in return on net assets trend, which is depicted on page 10. Despite the higher than usual inventory and capital expenditure levels, our return on net assets surpassed 19% and continues to move rapidly higher approaching our fiscal 2011 target of 20% to 25%.
Finally on page 11, we set forth our guidance for the December quarter. Consideration of the sequential falling of our bookings in the first quarter and the continued uncertainty in the global economic outlook, we have set the midpoint of our guidance to reflect a 3% sequential decline in revenue from the record level reported in the first quarter.
Our outlook for the quarter, therefore is revenue in the range of $850 million to $890 million with EPS in the range of $0.38 to $0.44. As noted on the chart, this assumes an effective tax rate of 30% and no change in foreign currency rates in commodity prices from today’s levels.
In conclusion, we are pleased with our progress in revenue, EPS and SG&A spending, all achieving new records. Gross margin continues to be a challenge for us, especially with the headwinds caused by recent currency and commodity price volatility.
However, we are intensely focused on achieving our 14% operating margin target through improvements to our global logistics operations, implementing more effective pricing strategies and mitigating the currency and commodity volatility through our hedging activities.
This concludes our prepared remarks and we will now open up the call for questions.

It varies a lot by customer, but you read a lot I think about in the summer, about some of the components shortages that existed, and in some sectors it appears that customers over ordered based on not being able to get product, and now they have more inventories than there end demand is going to use up and particularly in the last quarter. So I think that slowed down orders.
But when I talk to those companies, they are very confident about long-term end-demand and then they see this as an issue to burn through the inventory, particularly with kind of year-end capital spending. So, our expectation is as the bookings in that sector are going to be flat through the end of the year, perhaps through Chinese New Year it would pick up from there. I would say the bigger impact probably been in networking and storage, which is sort of notebook and server markets.

Honestly there is a number of moving factors here that we are trying to reconcile ourselves. Obviously, the concerns about consumer spending in North America and Europe are very well publicized and I think there is concern about how strong the Christmas season will be here.
The other side of the fence is that you go to Asia and consumer spending there is relatively strong and there seems to be primarily strong demand that the Chinese consumer seems to be very focused on brand-named. So the growth of that market, it tends to be best for the well known global brands where obviously we are well designed in.
So as you saw with our results, our consumer revenues were pretty good last quarter. We would typically see those bookings start to slow down because if it’s not ordered now, obviously, we’re not going to ship that in time for the consumer build season because people have got to build those products and get them into the market. So, our sense is that the Europe, North America will be weaker, Asia is pretty strong, and we kind of even build that out to say, it would be sort of flat going into this Christmas.

What I would say is that Q1 is typically back-end loaded and that happens because September was clearly the strongest month and bookings have continued to be strong in October. This quarter is normally front-end loaded. And then I think what happens in Q3 just looking back over the last 10 years is it depends largely around how inventory we come out of Christmas with.
We’ve seen here we’ve come out of Christmas with limited inventory and things pick up very quickly with the poorest for Chinese New Year, with customers asking to keep plants opened over Chinese New Year and we’ve seen the opposite extreme, where there is high inventory and people asking us not to keep the plants open. I think the good news though is that people seem to imagine the supply chain very tightly. And so I think the likelihood is coming out of Christmas with a huge inventory bubble is very slim.

I guess, when you look at the overall dollar impact of freights, we actually were able to reduce our freight by almost $6 million in this quarter sequentially. So, we did see some very good improvement in that area.
Longer term, of course, and the reason why our inventory is building is because we are converting from air freight to sea freight and we have gotten probably about 65% of that converted as of the first quarter. We expect to convert that to maybe 80% to 90% by the end of the second quarter, with the goal of being at 95% in the third quarter. So, that is where we’re focused.

Our inventory, $20 million of the increase in inventory was due just to exchange and $30 million of the increase in receivables was due to exchange. That’s a big portion of the increase in receivables, that’s why the days in receivables really haven’t changed. And I’d say I wouldn’t read much into the change in receivables other than as Martin pointed out, our sales and our business continues to grow in Asia where we have longer terms to our customers and that’s what driving that. So, receivables I think is still in very good shape. Exchange was the biggest factor for the period of time.
In terms of inventory, there’s really two things that have affected that over the last couple of quarters. Number one what you talked a lot about is just the completion of the restructuring and moving production to new locations, and the buildup of inventory to handle that, we are still going through some of that. So that is one of the factors. This very deliberate air to sea shipment process, which is paying dividends already, is increasing our inventory.
To give you just maybe a sense of that, I’ll give you a couple of numbers. Our in-transit inventory, that is the inventory that is on its way either in air on the shipment at the end of the period, is at the end of this quarter was $72 million. A year ago it was about half that level, which gives you a good indication of that. I guess other comments we talked often about the VMI, the Vendor Managed Inventory, hub inventory that is our inventory that’s on consignment, that inventory has not increased.

Now the U.S. dollar has declined about 16% in the last four months, and I think what it does do is it gives us a lot more leverage to make those price increases stick.
What the net impact is I mean, what I look at our results of the last quarter, frankly I think we’re really pleased that our new model has worked very well and has got our SG&A down below our $0.18 goal, and we proved that at the level of revenues we’re at, we can hold up our cost at that level. I think the gross margin was not where we wanted to be and it was because of those currency and ForEx impact and it is interesting we went back to 2006, and looked at where they stood then. Had foreign currencies and the commodities stayed flat since we started our restructuring program, our gross margin this quarter were then 34.6%. Now that’s not an excuse.
I think our restructuring was to give us a better cost structure. Now we know the pressure has got to be on the gross margin line and I think we attacked that through price increases, we attacked it by focusing old customers with better margins, which is a lot about what our Focus Account Program is and we attacked it through going after our logistics costs, which is also above the gross margin line. I don’t think there is any silver bullet there, but I think we’ve demonstrated through the restructuring that we can get our fixed cost structure in line. Now we’ve got to go after the gross margin and the fact as we face today are very different a very different from what we faced in ‘06. But we are not giving up on getting that goal. It just means we have to do some different things and work harder at those to close that gap.

As I mentioned, just to give you an order of magnitude, had ForEx and raw materials stayed where they were when we started the restructuring in ‘06 that gross margin this quarter would have been at 34.6%. In terms of rank ordering how we closed that gap I would say that short-term focusing on the logistics costs and operational efficiencies in our plants are the things that will benefit us the most in the current quarter. I would say the price increase would benefit us in Q3.
And then shifting out our customer mix and looking at some of the smaller fast-growing customers where perhaps the margin opportunities are better, which our focus account program is targeted at, is obviously something you see as you move into calendar year ‘11.

In total, we would have expected to see a slight decrease and we project bit prudently I think projected that based on what we saw in bookings trend over the last quarter.
Just seeing that like you see a 5% reduction in bookings, the biggest correlation with Molex generally is as we’ve looked over the years is sort of looking at what the trend is in bookings in the current quarter versus where revenues go in the next quarter. So, seeing the 5% reduction is why we felt that given the backlog we have to ship, we wouldn’t see that bigger drop or why we felt we would down about 3%.

We believe our inventory is higher than it should be. I’m not suggesting that we’re going to be running at 85 days for long, but it is very important for us to be able to bring down our transportation cost after moving so much production especially to China and that’s where the focus is to getting this transfer from air to sea.

First of all, it’s important to understand I think during this rapid recovery in the market, we have had a certain amount of production made on the outside, so its subcontracted to the end-user et cetera and we have also have about 25% of headcount around the world today, that’s either temporary or contract labor.
So in the events, our revenues did picked down somewhat and our view right now is that we could see it stabilize somewhat on the current levels through Chinese New Year and based on interactions the customers expected to pickup from there if that could easily be absorbed in turn of firstly reducing temporary or contract labor we need to do that and then brining in-house things that we use on the outside.
The other thing is you all know as we’ve moved tremendous amount of production around the world and what we’ve seen to help this is the operational efficiencies in those plants has continued to increase. So, I don’t think we would see a negative gross margin impact by any of the predicted revenue levels between now and Chinese New Year and certainly would pick up again from there based on normal trends.

I actually think looking back over the cycle we’ve been, distributors kind of overcorrected on the downside, they actually made the biggest corrections after Lehman Brothers who were bankrupted in the early part of ‘09 and then perhaps overcorrected on the upside. EMS companies, it’s more about actually getting components in place to meet end-customer demand and there where you see the fluctuation is when they are competing for market share versus end-customers. So, that’s a very different picture that tends to be customer specific versus the distributors that are obviously managing their overall inventory portfolio.

Before we start the main call, I just wanted to give all of you a quick update on our situation in Japan. As you know, we announced publicly on April 9 that we recently learned that Molex had been a victim of a fraud on the part of an individual in our Japanese subsidiary. We've engaged legal counsel, Jones Day, and they have in turn engaged forensic accountants, AlixPartners, to investigate this matter. Based on the investigators' input and written and oral statements from the individual involved, we believe that he forged documentation that enabled him to borrow money from Japanese banks in Molex Japan's name on an unauthorized basis and then conceal those transactions. We believe he used the unauthorized borrowings primarily to fund losses on unauthorized security trades, also made in Molex's name. At this point, we believe that the total amount involved in this fraud scheme is approximately $193.2 million, of which we have recognized a loss in the quarter of $31 million and disclosed a contingent liability of $162.2 million. The contingent liability represents the current balance of unauthorized borrowings at Molex Japan.
Since this matter is the subject of an ongoing investigation, we hope that you will understand that we will not be able to answer any questions on this call relating to this fraud. But we will certainly update you as soon as we have appropriate information to release. 
Now let's turn our attention on to the quarter's results. And if you could turn to Page 3, I'll start by talking about our order trend.
Overall bookings for the quarter were $838 million, up 8% sequentially and 77% year-over-year. Given that this comparison is to the low point of last year's downturn, we expected strong results. But these results are much stronger than our most optimistic projections. Excluding last year's downturn, our average sequential increase in bookings in Q3 versus Q2 is about 3% to 4% versus the 8% we saw this quarter. The ongoing recovery was clearly far more important than any seasonal factors this quarter. The year-over-year numbers were the strongest that I have ever seen in my career at Molex. And as you will hear shortly, our bookings strength was very broad-based. It's worth noting that our March monthly bookings were a new record for the company, and our April run rate is above the level that we have reported for Q3.
To date, we have not seen any evidence of double ordering, but we have some distributors trying to rebuild inventory, strong orders for new product launches at some customers and some building of inventory in preparation for a predicted stronger second half to this calendar year. And I'll give you a few more data points on your concerns perhaps in that area later in my presentation. Overall, our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was a very strong 1.11. 
If you turn now to Page 4, I'll talk about the changes in our orders by industry segment for the March quarter. Our booking strength, as you can see from the chart, was very broad-based. The percent of our bookings now coming from focused accounts is over 26% of the total. This is further evidence of the success of our focused account program, which is helping both our growth and our margins. Automotive bookings were up 8% sequentially and 80% year-over-year. We continue to benefit from incentive schemes in Japan and from some countries in Europe. Although, as I'm sure you know, the incentive schemes have now stopped in Germany. In North America, Q1, we saw vehicle sales increase for the whole market by 16% to 2.545 million vehicles. Molex's order increase for the same period was up over 60%.
In China, Q1 calendar year '10 passenger car production was approximately 3.5 million vehicles, up 84% from a year ago. Molex's growth over the same period is up over 120%. We believe there's very strong evidence that we are gaining share to increase sales of standard products across multiple platforms, particularly in Asia. And with increasing electronic content, particularly in telematics and safety and convenience applications, we see plenty of opportunities for this growth to continue. Global vehicle production is predicted to increase 8% percent in calendar year '10 to 61.4 million vehicles, and a further 8% to 66.6 million in calendar year '11.
Automotive Group remains a very large connector market. And with our new structure and our global footprint, we believe we can continue to grow fast in the market and operate far more profitably than we had in the recent past. 
If you now look at the Data segment, we were up 3% sequentially and 81% year-over-year. Calendar year '10 Q1 is normally a weak quarter for the data markets because of a lull following strong calendar year-end hardware purchases. Many companies obviously have capital budgets that are structured on the calendar year basis. This lull did not happen this year. Networking was very strong. And particularly, we had strong orders coming from all of the market leaders in that segment, so it was broad-based even within the Networking segment.
The service sector continues to strengthen, and we are seeing strong growth from new products, particularly our new range of IC sockets. In storage, the migration to new protocols such as SAS 2.0 and 16 gigabit fiber channel is very positive for Molex with the strong product range that we have in that area. Notebooks were also strong, with bookings up over 90% for the quarter year-over-year, and across the entire data sector, we believe that our strong new product portfolio and the strength of our global sales team that is now selling our entire product range is really helping us to gain share in this segment as well. Telecom was up 5% sequentially and 67% year-over-year. The Smart phone sector continues to grow quickly, with Molex particularly benefiting from the Android platform sales. Mid-range was down this quarter but is expected to recover in Q4. Entry-level phones in emerging markets remained strong, but only increasingly supported by local manufacturers and gray market phones.
Overall cell phone shipments were up only 2% sequentially calendar year '10 versus Q4 calendar year '09, but Smart phones were up 15%. What's very obvious and has been very widely publicized is that the incremental revenue growth and profit opportunity in the cell phone market is clearly going to be in the cell phone segment where Molex is very strong. Overall, the market is expected to expand from 1.21 billion units in calendar year '09 to 1.4 billion units in calendar year '10. But some of the major manufacturers that we deal with in this segment are concerned about possible shortages of memory and LCD. If that happens, that obviously could limit the overall growth of the market.
If you look at the telecom equipment market, that was very, very strong last quarter, particularly with customers in Asia and customers supporting the Asian market. There are some players in both North America and Europe who have been very successful in Europe, and we have equally enjoyed that success with them. Migration to new platforms is really what is driving this, along with new product sales for Molex as a company.
Consumer Electronics was up 6% sequentially and 66% year-over-year. The growth here has been driven by consumers in Asia, particularly in the developing markets. Some particularly strong segments for us are the digital still camera market where a transition is taking place from digital still cameras to digital single-lens reflex cameras. The reason we bring up that particular difference is that if you look at the connector bond on the difference between DSC and DSLR is that the connector content is about 3x, and that obviously helps our sales in that segment. Flat-panel TVs where LED backlighting is becoming an increasing trend, obviously, also increases the content in those devices, and that has helped us. 3D TV is still small but is growing rapidly. The other good segments for us in the consumer market are the gaming market, where we are doing very well with all three of the major players, pachinko and e-readers.
Our Q3 Industrial bookings were up sequentially a very strong 20% and 80% year-over-year. And we actually had record bookings in March for the industrial sector. In a market that most people still think is generally weak, we are very excited to see such strong results from the Industrial segment. As we stated last quarter, we're starting to see the benefits of our Woodhead acquisition and the synergy with Molex where we're combining Woodhead's industrial experience with Molex's electronic technology. We've seen particularly strong growth in alternative energy markets, security networks, robotics and the semiconduction production equipment sectors. So we're really pleased to see this, and we're really pleased to see the benefit from our Woodhead acquisition coming through.
Finally, the medical and military markets, which are still small markets for Molex overall, we're up 15% sequentially but were up 188% year-over-year. We're seeing lots of new product wins in both sectors. We have very strong project pipeline in both sectors and we're really pleased to report that during the current quarter, one of the major military contractors named Molex as a preferred supplier. So you can expect to see us to continue to have growth in both of these sectors.
Please turn now to Page 5 where I'll talk about our order growth by channel and by geography. We saw strong growth across all channels, but distribution in EMS were much stronger than the OEM. It's worth noting that both of these channels made dramatic cutbacks in inventory levels in the same quarter last year. EMS did this because customers in some key segments took business back in-house to keep their own plants busy, and distributors' credit to them reacted very quickly so they slowed down their orders that they had placed on suppliers. We are seeing distributors continue to rebuild inventory levels to support increased end demand.
As I stated earlier, we've not seen any evidence of double ordering. But stronger end demand, slightly longer lead times and greater confidence in the back end of the year is obviously driving stronger orders than we expected. One data point here that might be helpful toward our analysts is that normally Molex has about 10% of its backlog, which is scheduled out beyond three months. At the end of March, that number had increased to 13%. So it's higher than normal. But as you can see, it's not materially higher, which gives us great confidence that our backlog is strong and it's certainly shippable. By geography, it should come as no surprise that the strongest year-over-year numbers came from Asia-Pacific sales. The surprise this quarter was the broad-based growth in all of our other regions and in particular, the strong sequential number in the Americas and Europe.
The sequential growth in the Americas was broad-based, and in Europe, it was driven primarily by industrial markets and by the automotive market.  APN, dominated by Japan, was sequentially the weakest, but saw a very good pickup at the end of the quarter as consumer customers started to launch new products for the current calendar year and the lead-in towards the selling season at the back end of the calendar year. By the end of this fiscal, I think it's worth pointing out that Molex will have more than 60% of its revenues coming from Asia, up from just 50% in fiscal year '07. I think that says a lot about the transitioning of the electronics industry to Asia and also the strong presence that Molex has in that very important end geography.
Now turning to Slide 6. Several of our key markets normally suffered in the March quarter. And looking back over the last couple of decades, we'd normally expect our third quarter revenue to be down sequentially 3% to 4%. That was clearly not the case this quarter as revenue increased 3.7% from the December quarter and almost 50% from the March quarter last year. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement, and we are now just 13% below our peak of $872 million that was achieved in the June 2008 quarter. 
And finally now for me, if you turn to Page 7, I'll talk very briefly about the changes in our revenue by industry. As you can see on this chart, all of the markets improved substantially from the same quarter last year. On a sequential basis, the data, telecom and consumer markets were down between 1% and 2% from the December quarter, but that is much, much better than normal seasonality. Automotive was up 6% and Industrial was up 18%. Going forward, we expect to see the strongest sequential growth in the industrial market, as our growing market share in that segment continues. Consumer Electronics, Data and Telecom will exhibit above-average growth, and we expect Automotive could moderate somewhat, because clearly, some of the strength we've seen has been incentive-driven and the expectation is those incentives will be progressively withdrawn as they year continues. 
The June quarter is generally our strongest quarter of the year. And our order rates in April remain strong. We are, therefore, based on our March orders and the April trends we are seeing, providing a revenue guidance of $810 million to $830 million for the June quarter. 
Now let me turn the call over to Dave Johnson, who will take us through the finances in more detail."
108522,100489418,90250,"Molex Inc., Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-27-2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Molex, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Martin. Please turn now to Slide 8 for our P&L summary. As Martin mentioned, we are very pleased with the revenue results of $756.3 million, which is well above the top end of our guidance and up sequentially in what was normally a down quarter",1236,"Thank you, Martin. Please turn now to Slide 8 for our P&L summary. As Martin mentioned, we are very pleased with the revenue results of $756.3 million, which is well above the top end of our guidance and up sequentially in what was normally a down quarter seasonally.
Gross margin of 31.2% reflects favorable product mix, better-than-expected savings from restructuring and the continuation of a very good operating leverage that we have seen coming out of the downturn. SG&A, at $156.4 million, is up sequentially due to R&D costs and variable selling costs, not due to general admin spending. I will skip over restructuring and our loss on unauthorized activities in Molex Japan since we'll cover these on the next slide. Other expense is up sequentially due to higher interest expense, which was $2.3 million for the quarter, and a $1.8 million investment loss primarily due to our 20% ownership share in a Singaporean company that we account for on the equity method. This company is going through its own restructuring activities, which resulted in a loss in that business for that quarter and may continue into the next quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5%, which takes us to net income of $23.8 million or $0.14 per share on 174.8 million shares outstanding. 
The chart on Page 9 is our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. As just mentioned, GAAP EPS was $0.14, to which we add back $0.04 for our restructuring program and $0.11 for the unauthorized activities in Molex Japan that Martin explained. This results in a non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.29. This is well above the midpoint of our previous guidance of $0.24, and it's the highest EPS that we have reported in six quarters.
The slide on Page 10 details our balance sheet metrics. Our net cash has dropped to $160 million from $207 million in the December quarter. This is due primarily to the cash impact of the unauthorized activities in Molex Japan, working capital requirements to support the recent growth in our business and higher capital expenditures. The higher CapEx is related to production tooling for significant new product introductions and select capacity increases for production machinery to keep up with the rapidly increasing demand from our customers.
As one would expect in this demand environment, both accounts receivable and inventory were increasing in absolute dollar terms. However, accounts receivable's days sales outstanding has come down from 76 days last quarter to 73 days this quarter. Going in the other direction, inventory days have increased from 74 days last quarter to 80 days this quarter. Inventory increased at the quarter-end to support the record level of bookings that we experienced in March and really due to the buffer inventories for the final stage of our product transfer activities in connection with our restructuring program. It's noteworthy that our vendor-managed inventory remains in very good shape at well below 30 days, and inventory at distributors has not yet increased above normal levels.
We have pulled together gross margin, SG&A and operating margin trends all on one chart on Page 11 primarily to demonstrate the progress we are making toward our goal of 14% operating margins. Gross margin has trended very well from a low of 18.5% a year ago to the current quarter of 31.2%. This really demonstrates the substantial operating leverage of our new cost structure even in the face of transition costs such as freight and duty that remain high and increasing commodity costs. We had better-than-expected cost savings resulting from our restructuring program, approximately $6 million in sequential savings in the quarter versus the $3 million that we had anticipated and most of these savings benefited the cost of sales line this quarter.
Price erosion was not a material factor in the quarter as we continue to see slight downward pressure on this metric, though still at the upper-end of our 3% to 5% annual expected range. SG&A, at 20.7%, reflects spending in absolute dollars of $156 million, which is approximately $4 million higher than anticipated. The much-faster-than-expected recovery in demand has resulted in higher spending for both R&D and variable selling costs, but administrative costs, which are all costs other than R&D and selling costs, actually declined sequentially.
In addition, it's interesting to note that the total SG&A salaries were flat sequentially. This demonstrates that the sequential increase in SG&A is clearly related to the non-people variable costs that I mentioned, which again is caused by the faster-than-expected recovery of our business. As year-over-year growth rates moderate, we expect these variable costs to stabilize.
Most importantly, our operating income margin has improved very steadily from the prior year to the current level of 10.5%, and we would expect a similar sequential increase in Q4 as we have seen in the past two quarters.
On Page 12, we showed a trend of our return on net assets metric or RONA, which increased from the low point of 3.7% in Q4 last year to 14.2% this quarter. This is the metric that, under our new division structure, we have introduced to monitor the overall progress of each division and business unit. This is intended to focus our operating units on the key factors that they can control to improve our return on assets, which are operating income, capital expenditure and working capital. Our internal goal has been to get back to 15% by the end of the year, and we are clearly on track to meet and exceed this number by the fourth quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 13. We are just one quarter away from the completion of our three-year restructuring program. We incurred $9 million in primarily cash charges in the quarter and expect to incur the final $11.5 million in Q4 to complete this $300 million project, which will result in annual savings of at least $205 million. As mentioned previously, we are very pleased to see savings brought forward into the third quarter from the fourth quarter. We had expected $3 million in sequential savings but actually recognized $6 million savings as I mentioned. This then leaves just $1 million of sequential savings for Q4 to get us to our full savings target, but we still expect some additional sequential savings in the first two quarters of fiscal year 2011.
We are down to one final plant closure in Slovakia. And then, of course, the completion and final setup and smooth transition of all the production transfers.
Our guidance for the coming quarter is shown on Slide 14. Based on our strong bookings and backlog position, we estimate that at the midpoint of our guidance, revenue is expected to increase by 8.4% to the range of $810 million to $830 million, as Martin mentioned. After eliminating the restructuring charge of $0.06, our non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.36 to $0.40. And it's important to note that this excludes any cost or charges related to the investigation process in Japan.
In summary, we had strong operating results for the quarter, and we are confident that we will continue to see improved operating results now in the fourth quarter. We will now open up the call for questions, and I would like to state, just once again, that we will not be able to answer any questions related to the fraud in Molex Japan due to the ongoing investigation."

So we expect those variable commissions, and we've modeled that out, will certainly slow down.

I think the automotive market, it's hard to tell, because it's hard to see the impact of the incentives there. But we certainly think that as the automotive market has shifted to Asia and as you know, China is now producing more cars than there are in North America, our strong presence in Asia benefits us there. I think if you're asking the question how are we doing versus our competitors, I think one of the things that came out of this downturn is that some of the smaller players, and there are 2,000 connector companies around the world, have financially found it tough to get through that downturn. And I think the major customers continue to reduce their supply base. So I think if you're a major global supplier, you have the chance to gain share at those customers, and I think Molex is doing that."

Typically, there's about 13% of it beyond that right now. So there's a little bit of forward ordering going on, but I wouldn't call that a large amount. I think it also reinforces the fact why we want to probably stick to quarterly guidance, because given how short-term the backlog is and how low the visibility in the electronics industry, it's hard to go out beyond that. Now normally speaking, June is normally our strongest quarter, going to the end of our fiscal year. And we obviously see the markets that are consumer-driven, ongoing strength into the first quarter of next year. And then I think what happens as you go into Christmas in Q1 next year depends a lot on consumer demand.

The first",2185,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everybody. If you like to turn to Page 3, we've added a new slide to this quarter's deck where we've put in a one page summary of what we think are the key points emerging from the quarter we just finished. The first point I obviously want to talk about is a quick update on our unauthorized activities in Japan. As you already know, the unauthorized activity occurred many years ago. And we restated our financial results in the June 10-k to reflect the liability of this unauthorized activity. During the quarter that was just completed, we were served notice of a lawsuit by the financial institution involved. We responded to this complaint, and we intend to vigorously defend our position that these loans were unauthorized. this matter is now subject to ongoing litigation, we can't provide additional details at this time or answer any more questions about this particular topic. 
Now we'd like to spend the rest of the call talking about our operating results. And we're very pleased to announce the fact that we had record revenues and earnings per share in the September quarter. Given where we were 18 months ago, this is quite an accomplishment and obviously reflects good progress by the company and tremendous recovery in the electronics industry generally. 
Our orders declined from the record levels attained in the June quarter. However, we still had one of our best quarters ever for orders, and a level of business activity certainly remains quite strong. During the quarter, we made progress reducing our unusual logistics costs as well as improving production efficiencies on transferred production. Corrective actions of these items are largely a function of time: time to build inventory to fill ceilings and time for our manufacturing operations to learn nuances of working with new equipment. We continue to improve in these areas, and we expect to see further progress in the December quarter. 
We also made progress reducing our backlog, which hit an all-time high in the June quarter due to the rapid recovery experienced over the last several quarters. Backlog was reduced by $28 million from the June levels as we brought online additional capacity. 
Finally, we announced the 15% increase in our dividend. We have a long-term commitment to our dividend. And given the increase in earnings potential of our new organization and the projected future cash flows, we are very comfortable increasing the payout at this time. 
If you turn now to Page 4, I'll talk a little bit about our revenue and order trend. Revenues for the September quarter were an all-time high of $898 million, 3% above the previous high reached in June of '08 and 6% above the June quarter and 33% above the same quarter last year. Even though orders declined 5% sequentially from the record set in the June quarter at $868 million, we achieved our third best quarter ever for new orders. And year-over-year orders were still up 20%, and all of that growth was organic. The order rate was slower during the early summer and strengthened during the September, and that strength has continued into October. While previous quarters were helped by incentives and inventory restocking, we believe that our current order rate is now more reflective of end demand. 
It's also worth noting that our bookings in the June quarter were up 9% sequentially and 58% year-over-year. So on sequential basis, we're comparing ourselves to a record quarter. Given that the major economies in Europe and North America are recovering slowly, it's apparent that the emerging markets, particularly China, are driving most of the growth in the electronics sector. Disposable income in China increased by over 80% during the last 5 years. And this trend is expected to continue as the recovery becomes more consumption-oriented and less dependent on exports. This shift, coupled with the proliferation of mobile devices and related infrastructure and uptick in enterprise spending on tech hardware and many new product introductions, we believe will provide good opportunity to continue to grow our business as we move forward. 
If you turn now to Page 5, I'll talk a little bit about the order trend by channel and by geography. By channel, orders from distribution decreased by the largest amount, by about 12% from the June quarter. Distributors seem to have largely replenished their inventories, and in my own view, perhaps overcorrected on the downside of when the the market took its plummet and about overcorrected on the upside and are now in the process of adjusting their inventory levels and their order rates accordingly. Orders from the OEMs and EMS were only down by 2% and 3%, respectively. We reached -- as I said before, we achieved record orders in the June quarter, so a slight decrease particularly in the OEM and EMS sectors is really not surprising in the current quarter. 
By region, Europe decreased by 15% from the June rate, largely due to the summer slowdown caused by vacations and holidays. Year-over-year, Europe was only up 8%, and that's largely because Europe benefited the most from stimuluses in the '09 period. Orders in the Americas declined 9% from June due to summer slowdown in July and August and due to lower orders primarily from distribution. 
Asia North increased from the June quarter by 6%. This reflects a strong consumer electronics market for us and strong demand for mobile phones and particularly smartphones. Asia South was down 4% from June, again largely due to seasonal slowdown in orders. But we saw that those orders were up 32% year-over-year. So our business level in Asia South remains very, very high. 64% of our total orders were from Asia in this quarter, and the percent of our business coming from Asia just continues to increase as we move forward. This is somewhat explained by the relative strength in markets where production is largely in Asia, mainly mobile phones, consumer electronics and infotech. It's also the result of some increased consumer electronic devices in emerging markets, increased consumption of those devices. It's worth noting that our orders in the Asia Pacific South region alone exceeded the total of our orders in North America and Europe combined in the last quarter. 
Now if you turn to Page 6, I'll talk a little bit about the change in our revenue and orders by end market. Revenues for the automotive market declined 4% sequentially and orders declined 9% from the June quarter. This is not expected -- unexpected in that automotive production usually declines in the September quarter. On a geographic basis, we've seen favorable results in North America as the market seems to have stabilized and continues to rebound. September auto sales were the best in 13 months in North America, and it's worth noting that those records were achieved without incentives. And we're now on a run rate to sell about 12.2 million vehicles in North America. Europe slowed down in part due to the end of most of the stimulus packages across Europe, but also due to the summer holiday period, which probably has the biggest impact in Europe. We have also now fully evenly balanced between our automotive revenues in North America, Europe and Asia, that business being split 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. Going forward, we expect that North America and China will post the highest growth rates, while Europe and Japan will stay relatively flat.  Longer term, we also believe that the increasing electronic content in vehicles will help to grow our automotive business. 
The data for infotech market performed as expected. Revenues increased 6% while orders decreased 3% from the June quarter. Revenue increased in large part due to backlog reduction, while the decrease in orders is due to a small buildup in inventory in the supply chain. This inventory is very product- and customer-specific and does not appear to be reflective of overall pullback in end market demand. If you recall, many of the large players in the infotech market were impacted by components shortages earlier this year. And at the same time, we're very optimistic that demand would be very strong in the second half that they would all gain market share. Now that component shortages appear to have been resolved, there would appear to be modest inventory buildup that is being worked through and we believe will be worked through by the end of the calendar year. Companies still need to upgrade their data centers and add capacity. And we think that, that underlying trend will provide ongoing good business as we move into 2011. We have also seen, just as an anecdote, tremendous interest in tablets computers. And I was recently visiting our operations in Japan and looking at our customer relationship module, it's interesting to note that we're actively working on 50 different tablet program computer -- tablets computer programs. It just shows tremendous interest in that new format. 
If you look now on Page 6, I'll continue the commentary relative to the end market. The telecom market, which included infrastructure, networking as well as mobile phones performed overall with revenues increasing 10% and orders decreasing 4% from the June quarter. Infrastructure revenue was down modestly. However, orders were down by 14%. This business tends to be very lumpy and chunky and has been very strong coming out of the downturn. We're now seeing a pause in the level of business activity. However, both revenue and orders are well above the prior year levels. 
Revenue and orders for the mobile phone submarket were very, very strong, 30% up sequentially and 20% -- 23% year-over-year. This is due in to a large number of new products being introduced and a continued shift to smartphones, as well as a strong seasonal influence. Looking ahead, there are many new products in the horizon for the mobile phone market including HD screen, 4G devices and continued share gains of smartphones, as well as the introduction of Android and Windows 7-based devices. Many of the major OEMs are also doing a good job of penetrating new geographies with mobile phones. Overall, we believe that this trend will drive the need for infrastructure to support new devices as we move into calendar year '11. 
Despite what you read in the press, the consumer market, at least for us, has been quite strong. Revenues increased 12% for the June quarter and orders declined a modest 1%, which is below the normal seasonal trend that we would see. This is largely due to the number of new product introductions, backlog reductions and the strong influence of a pre-Christmas build. Even in these difficult times, consumers are choosing to spend their discretionary income on an interesting array of devices, which have increasing connective content. For example, LCD panels trends include now 3D technology, LED backlighting and an increasing use of these high-definition displays in public domains. While we do not know the exact percentage of end consumption in emerging markets, we do know that this percentage is increasing due to strong economic growth and a rise in consumers in developing countries. This is a long-term trend, that coupled with a recovery in the economies of the developing countries and new product offerings, will drive growth in 2011 and beyond. 
Revenue in the industrial market increased 3% from the June quarter, while orders declined 8%. The reduction in orders from distributors had a profound impact on this market, and this is very much a high-mix, low-volume market where distribution is a significant channel. We continue to see opportunities in automotive and semiconductor equipment as well as with our Focus Accounts. Revenues in orders are up 50% and 43%, respectively, from the September quarter last year. So overall relative to a year ago, this market is still very strong. 
Orders from our Focus Accounts grew 3% sequentially versus the June quarter and were up 55% from the prior year, well above the growth rate for the total company. These AD accounts now represent 30% of total Molex orders. We increased the program by 26 accounts this year to further develop our focus markets and find new opportunities for growth.  This quarter's success represents another step forward in the success of this program. 
As we move into the December quarter, we see strong activity in mobile phones and smartphones; a modest level of inventory in the infotech sector, which needs to be burned off; a slight pause in networking; and a good but not great Christmas season developing for consumer goods. This leads us to conclude that the December quarter will be below our normal seasonal average in terms of sequential growth, but at still at a very positive level relative to the prior year. Our expectation is that bookings would be relatively flat from this point forward through Chinese New Year and based on discussions with our end customers will then pick up as we move into calendar year '11. 
Let me now turn the call over to Dave Johnson, our CFO, who will give you greater details on the financial numbers that we've released."
108522,114139726,162910,"Molex Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Molex, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Martin. Please turn to Slide 7, which details our key income statement items. As promised previously, this information is only shown on a GAAP basis beginning with this quarter and going forward. The elements that previously were excluded for n",1156,"Thank you, Martin. Please turn to Slide 7, which details our key income statement items. As promised previously, this information is only shown on a GAAP basis beginning with this quarter and going forward. The elements that previously were excluded for non-GAAP reporting, specifically for restructuring and unauthorized activities in Japan, are separately listed on statement so that you can easily compare the periods shown. 
Both revenue and gross profit were all-time records for Molex. On an organic basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue was up 5% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. SG&A decreased in absolute dollars by $1.6 million sequentially. And excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A decreased by $2.4 million. 
The unauthorized activities in Japan for September and June 2010 related to investigation and litigation costs. The $5.5 million expense for the September quarter, or at $0.02 per share, was higher than anticipated but included all costs to wrap up the investigation phase. We are now moving into the litigation phase.  Looking ahead to the next quarter, we should expect the Japan litigation costs to be roughly half of the $5.5 million amount that we incurred in the September quarter. 
The other noteworthy item in the P&L is other expense. This includes equity income and minority investments, offset by a foreign exchange loss in the quarter. For the coming quarter, you should assume that this will be other income in the range of $3 million to $5 million, and this is a result of the operational results of our equity investments, which are improving. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%. This includes the tax charge of $2.3 million or $0.01 per share, which is due to options that expired under water for which we had previously recognized the tax deduction. Without this charge, our effective tax rate would have been right at 30%. 
And finally, we reported net income, record net income of $75.1 million and a record earnings per share of $0.43. 
Page 8 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. Net cash of $73 million reflects a reduction in cash to build our inventory for the conversion from air to sea shipments, also the payment of severance related to our restructuring program, as well as a higher-than-normal capital expenditure level driven by new product releases and capital constraints. 
I mentioned in our September 9 Analyst Meeting that positive free cash flow generation would begin in the second quarter. And we are on track as planned to generate free cash flow roughly equal to net income going forward. And because of our confidence in generating positive free cash flow, we have increased our dividend by almost 15% to an amount approximating $30 million for the quarter. 
I would also like to mention that during the quarter, we expanded our revolving credit facility by bringing in 3 additional banks and increasing the size of the facility to $270 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $110 million drawn and therefore, $160 million available under the facility. 
The progress toward our 14% operating margin is shown on Page 9. Our gross margin improved 70 basis points in the quarter to 30.6%. We reduced our freight expenses from the high level reported in the June quarter, but much of this benefit was offset by higher commodity costs and the impact of foreign greetings. Commodities and currencies decreased our gross profit by $6 million sequentially, after several quarters of nominal impact from these items. The 2 commodities that impact us the most are gold and copper, both of which increased throughout the quarter and have continued to increase after the present time. We have begun to benefit from the hedges we've put in place at the beginning of the quarter for gold and copper, with the hedge benefits are included in the sequential costs that I mentioned. 
With respect to foreign currencies, we net the translation impact, which is positive with the weaker dollar; with the transaction impact, which for us is generally weaker -- a negative with the weaker dollar. The weakness of the U.S. dollar versus the yen in particular impacted us in the quarter as, for example, we manufacture in Japan, export to Hong Kong and sell into China in U.S. dollars. We have modeled the impact of both commodities and currencies thus far in the second quarter and expect to have a similar sequential headwind in Q2 as we experienced in Q1 for these items. 
SG&A at 17.5% reached an all-time low and exceeded our target goal of 18% for the first time. Looking forward, merit increases, which went into effect on October 1, will increase salaries and wages by $4.2 million per quarter, of which approximately $2.5 million are related to the SG&A line. 
Of course, the ultimate goal is to improve our operating margin. We have steadily increased this metric from 6.8% a year ago to 12.5% in the current quarter. Note that the 4 previous quarters are adjusted for restructuring and Japan costs at the current quarter includes the $5.5 million the Japanese investigation litigation costs, which reduces the operating margin by 60 basis points.  I think it is also helpful to look back to the period before the downturn. In the June quarter of 2008 at our previous peak of $872 million in revenue, our operating margin was 11.3%. We are well above that level today and progressing toward our 14% target. 
We continue to show good progress in our return on net assets trend, which is depicted on Page 10. Despite the higher-than-usual inventory and capital expenditure level, our return on net assets surpassed 19% and continues to move rapidly higher, approaching our fiscal 2011 target of 20% to 25%. 
And finally on Page 11, we set forth our guidance for the December quarter. In consideration of the sequential swing in our bookings in the first quarter and the continued uncertainty in the global economic outlook, we have set the midpoint of our guidance to reflect a 3% sequential decline in revenue from the record level reported in the first quarter. Our outlook for the quarter therefore, is revenue in the range of $850 to $890 million, with EPS in the range of $0.38 to $0.44. As noted on the chart, this assumes an effective tax rate of 30% and no change in foreign currency rates and commodity prices from today's levels. 
IN conclusion, we are pleased with our progress in revenue, EPS and SG&A spending all achieving new records. Gross margin continues to be a challenge for us, especially with the headwinds caused by recent currency and commodity price volatility. However, we are intently focused on achieving our 14% operating margin target through improvements to our global logistics operations, implementing more effective pricing strategies and mitigating the currency and commodity volatility through our hedging activities. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open up the call for questions."

But you read a lot, I think, about in the summer about some of the components shortages that existed. And in some sectors, it appears that customers over-ordered based on not being able to get product and now have more inventory than they think end demand is going to use up, particularly in the last quarter. And so I think that slowed down orders. But when I talked to those companies, they are very confident about long-term end demand. And they see it as an issue to burn through the inventory, particularly with kind of year )end capital spending. So our expectation is that the bookings in that sector are going to be flat through the end of the year, perhaps to Chinese New Year. It will pick up from there. I would say the bigger impact probably been in networking and storage versus sort of notebook and server markets."

And there seems to be primarily strong demand that the Chinese consumer seems to be very focused on brand named goods. And so the growth of that market, it tends to be best for the well-known global brands, where obviously we're well designed in. So as you saw with our results, our consumer revenues were pretty good last quarter. We would typically see those bookings start to slow down because if it's not ordered now, obviously we're not going to ship it in time for the consumer build season, because people have to build those products and get them into the market. So our sense is that Europe, North America will be weaker. Asia is pretty strong and we kind of even that out to say sort of flat going to this Christmas."

But we've seen the years we've come out of Christmas with limited inventory and things picked up very quickly. But of course, the Chinese New Year with customers asking to keep plants over Chinese New Year, and we've seen the opposite extreme where there is high inventory and people asking us not to keep the plants open. I think the good news though is that people seem to imagine the supply chain very tightly. And so I think the likelihood of coming out of Christmas with a huge inventory bubble is very slim."

Our inventory $20 million of the increase in inventory was due just to exchange. And $30 million of the increase in receivables was due to exchange. So that's why a big portion of the increase in receivables -- that's why the days in receivables really haven't changed. And I'd say I wouldn't read much into the change in receivables other than, as Martin pointed out, our sales and business continues to grow in Asia, where we have longer terms to our customers, and that's what's driving that. So receivables I think it's is still in very good shape, and exchange was the biggest factor for the period of time. In terms of inventory, yes, there's really 2 things that affected that over the last couple of quarters. Number one, which we've talked a lot about, is just the completion of the restructuring and moving production to new locations and the buildup of inventory to handle that. We're still going through some of that, so that is one of the factors. And this very deliberate air to sea shipment process, which is paying dividends already in increasing our inventory. To give you just maybe a sense of that, I'll give you a couple of numbers. Our in-transit inventory, that is the inventory that is on its way either in air on shipment at the end of the period, is at the end of this quarter was $72 million. A year ago, it was about half that level, which gives you a good indication of that. I guess other comments we talked often about the VMI, the vendor-managed inventory, hub inventory that is our inventory that's on consignment. That inventory has not increased. That is down, still below 30 days and is in quite good control. Anyway that's, just some color on the inventories side."

We proved at the level of revenues we're at, we can hold up our costs at that level. I think the gross margin was not where we wanted it to be. And it was because of all of those currency and ForEx impacts. And has interesting we went back to 2006 and looked at where they stood then. Had foreign currencies and commodities stayed flat since we started our restructuring program, our gross margin this quarter within 34.6%. Now, that's not an excuse. I think our restructuring was to give us a better cost structure. Now we know the pressure's got to be in the gross margin line. And I think we attacked that through price increases. We attack it by focusing on customers with better margins, which is a lot about what Focus Account program is. And we attack it through going logistics costs, which is also above the gross margin line. I don't think there are any silver bullets there. But I think we demonstrated through the restructuring that we can get our fixed costs structure in line. Now we've got to go after the gross margin. And the factors that we face today are very different from what we faced in '06.

But we're not using that as an excuse to say that doesn't mean we're going to hit our 14% goal in the long run.

As I mentioned just to give you an order of magnitude, had ForEx and raw materials stayed where they were when we started the restructuring, the gross margin this quarter would have been at 34.6%. And in terms of rank ordering how we closed that gap, I would say that short term, focusing on the logistics costs and operational efficiencies in our plants are the things that will benefit us the most in the current quarter. I would say the price increase would benefit us in Q3.

And the other thing that's if you look back to the 10-year period, economic cycle kind of distorted where the seasonal trend will be. In total, we would normally have expected to see a slight increase. expect to a slight decrease, and we project, prudently I think based on what we saw in bookings trend over the last quarter, seemed if we see a 5% reduction in bookings. The biggest correlation with Molex generally is as we looked over the years is sort of looking at what the trend is in bookings in the current quarter versus where revenues go in the next quarter. So seeing the 5% reduction is why we felt that given the backlog we have to ship, we wouldn't see that bigger drop or why we felt we would be down about 3%."

And we have also have about 25% of headcount around the world today of either temporary or contract labor. So in the event that our revenue did pick down somewhat. And our view right now is that we could see it stabilize somewhat in the current levels through Chinese New Year. And based on interaction with customers, expect it to pick up from there. fact, it could easily be absorbed in terms of firstly reducing temporary or contract labor. We need to do that. And then bringing in-house things that we used to do on the outside. And the other thing as you all know, is we've moved tremendous amount of production around the world. And what we're seeing is the operational efficiencies in those plants have contained to increase.

They actually made the biggest corrections, after Lehman Brothers who bankrupted early part of '09, and perhaps overcorrected on the upside. EMS companies, it's more about actually I think getting components in place to meet end customer demand.

We responded to this complaint, and we intend to vigorously defend our position that these loans were unauthorized. This matter is now subject to ongoing litigation. We can't provide additional details at this time or answer any more questions about this particular topic. 
Now we'd like to spend the rest of the call talking about our operating results. And we're very pleased to announce the fact that we had record revenues and earnings per share in the September quarter. Given where we were 18 months ago, this is quite an accomplishment and obviously reflects good progress by the company and tremendous recovery in the electronics industry generally. 
Our orders declined from the record levels attained in the June quarter. However, we still had one of our best quarters ever for orders, and our level of business activity certainly remains quite strong. During the quarter, we made progress reducing our unusual logistics costs as well as improving production efficiencies on transferred production. Corrective actions to these items are largely a function of time: time to build inventory to fill ceilings and time for our manufacturing operations to learn the nuances of working with new equipment. We continue to improve in these areas, and we expect to see further progress in the December quarter. 
We also made progress reducing our backlog, which hit an all-time high in the June quarter due to the rapid recovery experienced over the last several quarters. Backlog was reduced by $28 million from the June levels as we brought online additional capacity. 
Finally, we announced the 15% increase in our dividend. We have a long-term commitment to our dividend. And given the increase in earnings potential of our new organization and the projected future cash flows, we are very comfortable increasing the payout at this time. 
If you turn now to Page 4, I'll talk a little bit about our revenue and order trend. Revenues for the September quarter were an all-time high of $898 million, 3% above the previous high reached in June of '08 and 6% above the June quarter and 33% above the same quarter last year. Even though orders declined 5% sequentially from the record set in the June quarter at $868 million, we achieved our third best quarter ever for new orders. And year-over-year orders were still up 20%, and all of that growth was organic. The order rate was slower during the early summer and strengthened during the September, and that strength has continued into October. While previous quarters were helped by incentives and inventory restocking, we believe that our current order rate is now more reflective of end demand. 
It's also worth noting that our bookings in the June quarter were up 9% sequentially and 58% year-over-year. So on a sequential basis, we're comparing ourselves to a record quarter. Given that the major economies in Europe and North America are recovering slowly, it's apparent that the emerging markets, particularly China, are driving most of the growth in the electronics sector. Disposable income in China increased by over 80% during the last 5 years. And this trend is expected to continue as the recovery becomes more consumption-oriented and less dependent on exports. This shift, coupled with the proliferation of mobile devices and related infrastructure and uptick in enterprise spending on tech hardware and many new product introductions, we believe will provide good opportunities to continue to grow our business as we move forward. 
If you turn now to Page 5, I'll talk a little bit about the order trend by channel and by geography. By channel, orders from distribution decreased by the largest amount, by about 12% from the June quarter. Distributors seem to have largely replenished their inventories, and in my own view, perhaps overcorrected on the downside of when the market took its plummet and about overcorrected on the upside, and they are now on the process of adjusting their inventory levels and their order rates accordingly. Orders from OEMs and EMS went only down by 2% and 3%, respectively. We reached -- as I said before, we achieved record orders in the June quarter, so a slight decrease, particularly in the OEM and EMS sectors, is really not surprising in the current quarter. 
By region, Europe decreased by 15% from the June rate largely due to the summer slowdown caused by vacations and holidays. Year-over-year, Europe was only up 8%, and that's largely because Europe benefited the most from stimuluses in the '09 period. Orders in the Americas declined 9% from June due to summer slowdown in July and August and due to lower orders primarily from distribution. 
Asia North increased from the June quarter by 6%. This reflects a strong consumer electronics market for us and strong demand for mobile phones and particularly smartphones. Asia South was down 4% from June, again largely due to seasonal slowdown in orders. But we saw that those orders were up 32% year-over-year, so our business level in Asia South remains very, very high. 64% of our total orders were from Asia in this quarter, and the percent of our business coming from Asia just continues to increase as we move forward. This is somewhat explained by the relative strength in markets where production is largely in Asia, mainly mobile phones, consumer electronics and infotech. It's also the result of increased consumer electronic devices in emerging markets -- increased consumption of those devices. It's worth noting that our orders in the Asia Pacific South region alone exceeded the total of our orders in North America and Europe combined in the last quarter. 
Now if you turn to Page 6, I'll talk a little bit about the change in our revenue and orders by end market. Revenues for the automotive market declined 4% sequentially, and orders declined 9% from the June quarter. This is not expected -- unexpected in that automotive production usually declines in the September quarter. On a geographic basis, we've seen favorable results in North America as the market seems to have stabilized and continues to rebound. September auto sales were the best in 13 months in North America, and it's worth noting that those records were achieved without incentives. And we're now on a run rate to sell about 12.2 million vehicles in North America. Europe slowed down in part due to the end of most of the stimulus packages across Europe, but also due to the summer holiday period, which probably has the biggest impact in Europe. We have also now fully evenly balanced between our automotive revenues in North America, Europe and Asia, that business being split 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. Going forward, we expect that North America and China will post the highest growth rates, while Europe and Japan will stay relatively flat. Longer term, we also believe that the increasing electronic content in vehicles will help to grow our automotive business. 
The data for infotech market performed as expected. Revenues increased 6%, while orders decreased 3% from the June quarter. Revenue increased in large part due to backlog reduction, while the decrease in orders is due to a small buildup in inventory in the supply chain. This inventory is very product and customer-specific and does not appear to be reflective of overall pullback in end market demand. If you recall, many of the large players in the infotech market were impacted by components shortages earlier this year. And at the same time, we're very optimistic that demand would be very strong in the second half and that they would all gain market share. Now that component shortages appear to have been resolved, there would appear to be a modest inventory buildup that is being worked through and we believe will be worked through by the end of the calendar year. Companies still need to upgrade their data centers and add capacity. And we think that, that underlying trend will provide ongoing good business as we move into 2011. We have also seen, just as an anecdote, tremendous interest in tablet computers. And I was recently visiting our operations in Japan. And looking at our customer  relationship module, it's interesting to note that we're actively working on 50 different tablet program computers -- tablet computer programs. It just shows the tremendous interest in that new format. 
If you look now on Page 6, I'll continue the commentary relative to the end market. The telecom market, which include infrastructure, networking as well as mobile phones, performed well overall, with revenues increasing 10% and orders decreasing 4% from the June quarter. Infrastructure revenue was down modestly. However, orders were down by 14%. This business tends to be very lumpy and chunky and has been very strong coming out of the downturn. We're now seeing a pause in the level of business activity. However, both revenue and orders are well above the prior year levels. 
Revenue and orders for the mobile phone submarket were very, very strong, 30% up sequentially and 20% -- 23% year-over-year. This is due in to a large number of new products being introduced and  continued shift to smartphones, as well as a strong seasonal influence. Looking ahead, there are many new products in the horizon for the mobile phone market, including HD screen, 4G devices and continued share gains for smartphones, as well as the introduction of Android and Windows 7-based devices. Many of the major OEMs are also doing a good job of penetrating new geographies with mobile phones. Overall, we believe that this trend will drive the need for infrastructure to support new devices as we move into calendar year '11. 
Despite what you read in the press, the consumer market, at least for us, has been quite strong. Revenues increased 12% for the June quarter and orders declined a modest 1%, which is below the normal seasonal trend that we would see. This is largely due to the number of new product introductions, backlog reductions and the strong influence of a pre-Christmas build. Even in these difficult times, consumers are choosing to spend their discretionary income on an interesting array of devices, which have increasing connective content. For example, LCD panels trends include now 3D technology, LED backlighting and an increasing use of these high-definition displays in public domains. While we do not know the exact percentage of end consumption in emerging markets, we do know that this percentage is increasing due to strong economic growth and  rise in consumers in the developing countries. This is a long-term trend, that coupled with a recovery in the economies of the developing countries and new product offerings, will drive growth in 2011 and beyond. 
Revenue in the industrial market increased 3% from the June quarter, while orders declined 8%. The reduction in orders from distributors had a profound impact on this market, and this is very much a high-mix, low-volume market where distribution is a significant channel. We continue to see opportunities in automotive and semiconductor equipment as well as with our Focus Accounts. Revenues in orders are up 50% and 43%, respectively, from the September quarter last year. So overall relative to a year ago, this market is still very strong. 
Orders from our Focus Accounts grew 3% sequentially versus the June quarter and were up 55% from the prior year, well above the growth rate for the total company. These AD accounts now represent 30% of total Molex orders. We increased the program by 26 accounts this year to further develop our focus markets and find new opportunities for growth. This quarter's success represents another step forward in the success of this program. 
As we move into the December quarter, we see strong activity in mobile phones and smartphones; a modest level of inventory in the infotech sector, which needs to be burned off; a slight pause in networking; and a good but not great Christmas season developing for consumer goods. This leads us to conclude that the December quarter will be below our normal seasonal average in terms of sequential growth, but still at a very positive level relative to the prior year. Our expectation is that bookings would be relatively flat from this point forward through Chinese New Year and, based on discussions with our end customers, will then pick up as we move into calendar year '11. 
Let me now turn the call over to Dave Johnson, our CFO, who will give you greater details on the financial numbers that we released."
108522,114139726,163048,"Molex Inc., Q1 2011 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Molex, LLC","Executives","Thank you, Martin. Please turn to Slide 7, which details our key income statement items. As promised previously, this information is only shown on a GAAP basis beginning with this quarter and going forward. The elements that previously were excluded for n",1157,"Thank you, Martin. Please turn to Slide 7, which details our key income statement items. As promised previously, this information is only shown on a GAAP basis beginning with this quarter and going forward. The elements that previously were excluded for non-GAAP reporting, specifically restructuring and unauthorized activities in Japan, are separately listed on a statement so that you can easily compare the periods shown. 
Both revenue and gross profit were all-time records for Molex. On an organic basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue was up 5% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. SG&A decreased in absolute dollars by $1.6 million sequentially. And excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A decreased by $2.4 million. 
The unauthorized activities in Japan for September and June 2010 related to investigation and litigation costs. The $5.5 million expense for the September quarter, or at $0.02 per share, was higher than anticipated but included all costs to wrap up the investigation phase. We are now moving into the litigation phase. Looking ahead to the next quarter, we should expect the Japan litigation costs to be roughly half of the $5.5 million amount that we incurred in the September quarter. 
The other noteworthy item in the P&L is Other Expense. This includes equity income in minority investments, offset by a foreign exchange loss in the quarter. For the coming quarter, you should assume that this will be other income in the range of $3 million to $5 million, and this is a result of the operational results of our equity investments, which are improving. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%. This includes the tax charge of $2.3 million or $0.01 per share, which is due to options that expired under water for which we had previously recognized the tax deduction. Without this charge, our effective tax rate would have been right at 30%. 
And finally, we reported net income, record net income of $75.1 million and a record earnings per share of $0.43. 
Page 8 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. Net cash of $73 million reflects a reduction in cash to build our inventory for the conversion from air to sea shipments, also the payment of severance related to our restructuring program, as well as a higher-than-normal capital expenditure level driven by new product releases and capital constraints. 
I mentioned at our September 9 Analyst Meeting that positive free cash flow generation would begin in the second quarter. And we are on track as planned to generate free cash flow roughly equal to net income going forward. And because of our confidence in generating positive free cash flow, we have increased our dividend by almost 15% to an amount approximating $30 million for the quarter. 
I would also like to mention that during the quarter, we expanded our revolving credit facility by bringing in 3 additional banks and increasing the size of the facility to $270 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $110 million drawn and therefore $160 million available under this facility. 
The progress toward our 14% operating margin is shown on Page 9. Our gross margin improved 70 basis points in the quarter to 30.6%. We reduced our freight expenses from the high level reported in the June quarter, but much of this benefit was offset by higher commodity costs and the impact of foreign currencies. Commodities and currencies decreased our gross profit by $6 million sequentially, after several quarters of nominal impact from these items. The 2 commodities that impact us the most are gold and copper, both of which increased throughout the quarter and have continued to increase after the present time. We have begun to benefit from the hedges we've put in place at the beginning of the quarter for gold and copper, but the hedge benefits are included in the sequential costs that I just mentioned. 
With respect to foreign currencies, we net the translation impact, which is positive with the weaker dollar; with the transaction impact, which for us is generally weaker -- a negative with the weaker dollar. The weakness of the U.S. dollar versus the yen in particular impacted us in the quarter as, for example, we manufacture in Japan, export to Hong Kong and sell into China in U.S. dollars. We have modeled the impact of both commodities and currencies thus far in the second quarter and expect to have a similar sequential headwind in Q2 as we experienced in Q1 for these items. 
SG&A at 17.5% reached an all-time low and exceeded our target goal of 18% for the first time. Looking forward, merit increases, which went into effect on October 1, will increase salaries and wages by $4.2 million per quarter, of which approximately $2.5 million are related to the SG&A line. 
Of course, the ultimate goal is to improve our operating margin. We have steadily increased this metric from 6.8% a year ago to 12.5% in the current quarter. Note that the 4 previous quarters are adjusted for restructuring and Japan costs. But the current quarter includes the $5.5 million Japanese investigation litigation costs, which reduces the operating margin by 60 basis points.  
I think it is also helpful to look back to the period before the downturn. In the June quarter of 2008 at our previous peak of $872 million in revenue, our operating margin was 11.3%. We are well above that level today and progressing toward our 14% target. 
We continue to show good progress in our return on net assets trend, which is depicted on Page 10. Despite the higher-than-usual inventory and capital expenditure level, our return on net assets surpassed 19% and continues to move rapidly higher, approaching our fiscal 2011 target of 20% to 25%. 
And finally on Page 11, we set forth our guidance for the December quarter. In consideration of the sequential swing [ph] of our bookings in the first quarter and the continued uncertainty in the global economic outlook, we have set the midpoint of our guidance to reflect a 3% sequential decline in revenue from the record level reported in the first quarter. Our outlook for the quarter, therefore, is revenue in the range of $850 to $890 million, with EPS in the range of $0.38 to $0.44. As noted on the chart, this assumes an effective tax rate of 30% and no change in foreign currency rates and commodity prices from today's levels. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with our progress in revenue, EPS and SG&A spending, all achieving new records. Gross margin continues to be a challenge for us, especially with the headwinds caused by recent currency and commodity price volatility. However, we are intently focused on achieving our 14% operating margin target through improvements to our global logistics operations, implementing more effective pricing strategies and mitigating the currency and commodity volatility through our hedging activities. 
This concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open up the call for questions."

But you read a lot, I think, about in the summer about some of the components shortages that existed. And in some sectors, it appears that customers over-ordered based on not being able to get product and now have more inventory than they think end demand is going to use up, particularly in the last quarter. And so I think that slowed down orders. But when I talked to those companies, they are very confident about long-term end demand. And they see this as an issue to burn through the inventory, particularly with kind of year-end capital spending. So our expectation is that the bookings in that sector are going to be flat through the end of the year, perhaps to Chinese New Year. It will pick up from there. I would say the bigger impact has  probably been in networking and storage versus sort of notebook and server markets."

And I think there is concern about how strong the Christmas season will be here. The other side of the fence is that you go to Asia and consumer spending there is relatively strong. And there seems to be primarily strong demand that the Chinese consumer seems to be very focused on brand-name goods. And so the growth of that market, it tends to be best for the well-known global brands, where obviously we're well designed in. And so as you saw with our results, our consumer revenues were pretty good last quarter. We would typically see those bookings start to slow down because if it's not ordered now, obviously we're not going to ship it in time for the consumer build season, because people have caught up, build those products and get them into the market. So our sense is that Europe, North America will be weaker, Asia is pretty strong, and we kind of even build that out to say it would be sort of flat going into this Christmas."

But we've seen years, we've come out at Christmas with limited inventory, and things picked up very quickly to the point [ph] that at Chinese New Year, with customers asking to keep plants open over Chinese New Year. And we've seen the opposite extreme where there is high inventory and people asking us not to keep the plants open.

Our inventory -- $20 million of the increase in inventory was due just to exchange. And $30 million of the increase in receivables was due to exchange. So that's why -- that's a big portion of the increase in receivables, that's why the days in receivables really haven't changed. And I'd say, I wouldn't read much into the change in receivables other than, as Martin pointed out, our sales and our business continues to grow in Asia, where we have longer terms to our customers, and that's what's driving that. So receivables I think is still in very good shape. Exchange was the biggest factor for that for the period of time. In terms of inventory, yes, there's really 2 things that have affected that over the last couple of quarters. Number one, which we've talked a lot about, is just the completion of the restructuring and moving production to new locations and the buildup of inventory to handle that. We are still going through some of that, so that is one of the factors. And this very deliberate air to sea shipment process, which is paying dividends already, is increasing our inventory. To give you just maybe a sense of that, I'll give you a couple of numbers. Our in-transit inventory, that is the inventory that is on its way either in air or on a shipment at the end of the period, is at the end of this quarter was $72 million. A year ago, it was about half that level, which gives you a good indication of that. I guess other comments we've talked often about, the VMI, the vendor-managed inventory, hub inventory that is -- our inventory that's on consignment. That inventory has not increased. That is down, still below 30 days and is in quite good control. Anyway that's just some color on the inventories side."

And I think what it does do is it gives us a lot more leverage to make those price increases stick. What the net impact is, I think, overall -- I mean, what I look at our results at the last quarter, frankly, I think we're really pleased that our new model has worked very well. It's got our SG&A down below our 18% goal. We proved that at the level of revenues we're at, that we can hold up our costs at that level. I think the gross margin was not where we wanted it to be, and it was because of all of those currency and ForEx impacts. And it's interesting, we went back to 2006 and looked at where they stood then, had foreign currencies and the commodities stayed flat since we started our restructuring program, our gross margin this quarter within 34.6%. Now, that's not an excuse. I think our restructuring was to give us a better cost structure. Now we know the pressure's got to be on the gross margin line. And I think we attacked that through price increases. We attacked it by focusing on customers with better margins, which is a lot about what our Focus Account program is. And we attacked it through going after our logistics cost, which is also above the gross margin line. I don't think there are any silver bullets there. But I think we demonstrated through the restructuring that we can get our fixed costs structure in line. Now we've got to go after the gross margin. And the factors we face today are very different from what we faced in '06. But we're not giving up on getting that goal.

But we're not using that as an excuse to say that doesn't mean we're going to hit our 14% goal in the long run. It means that we've got to do some things differently, I think, to close the gap between the 30.5% we're at now and this 32% target we would have been at. As I mentioned, just to give you an order of magnitude, had ForEx and raw materials stayed where they were when we started the restructuring, the gross margin this quarter would have been at 34.6%. And in terms of rank ordering how we close that gap, I would say that short term, focusing on the logistics costs and operational efficiencies in our plants are the things that will benefit us the most in the current quarter. I would say the price increase would benefit us in Q3. And then shifting out our customer mix and looking at some of the smaller fast-growing customers where perhaps the margin opportunities are better, which our Focus Account program is targeted at, is obviously something you see as you move into calendar year '11."

I would say that the one factor that's different is that if you look at the bookings that we had in the June quarter, which were an all-time record and were up to almost 60% year-over-year, and where our revenues are now, I think we've had an unusually high trend. And the other thing, that's because if we look back to that 10-year period, we've had some economic cycles that is kind of distorted where the seasonal trend will be. In total, we would normally have expected to see a slight increase. We expect it to be a slight decrease, so we project -- prudently I think, projected that based on what we saw in bookings trend over the last quarter, just saying that if we see a 5% reduction in bookings. The biggest correlation with Molex generally is -- as we've looked over the years, is sort of looking at what the trend is in bookings in the current quarter versus where revenues go in the next quarter. So seeing the 5% reduction is why we felt that, given the backlog we have to ship, we wouldn't see that bigger drop or why we felt we would be down about 3%."

First of all, it's important to understand, I think, during this rapid recovery in the market, we have had a fair amount of production made on the outside so it's subcontracted to vendors, et cetera. And we have also had about 25% of headcount around the world today of either temporary or contract labor. So in the event that our revenue did pick down somewhat, and our view right now is that we could see it stabilize somewhat in the current levels through Chinese New Year. And based on interaction with customers, it is expected to pick up from there. If that could easily be absorbed in terms of, firstly, reducing temporary or contract labor, we need to do that. And then bringing in-house things that we've used on the outside. And the other thing, as you all know, is we've moved tremendous amount of production around the world. And what we've seen that helped us is the operational efficiencies in those plants have continued to increase, so I don't think we would see a negative gross margin impact by any of the predicted revenue levels between now and Chinese New Year. And certainly, it would pick up again from there based on normal trends."

The firs",2188,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everybody. If you'd like to turn to Page 3, we've added a new slide to this quarter's deck where we've put in a one-page summary of what we think are the key points emerging from the quarter we just finished. The first point I obviously want to talk about is a quick update on our unauthorized activities in Japan. As you already know, the unauthorized activity occurred many years ago. And we've restated our financial results in the June 10-K to reflect the liability to this unauthorized activity. During the quarter that was just completed, we were served notice of a lawsuit by the financial institution involved. We responded to this complaint, and we intend to vigorously defend our position that these loans were unauthorized. This matter is now subject of ongoing litigation. We can't provide additional details at this time or answer any more questions about this particular topic. 
Now we'd like to spend the rest of the call talking about our operating results. And we're very pleased to announce the fact that we had record revenues and earnings per share in the September quarter. Given where we were 18 months ago, this is quite an accomplishment and obviously reflects good progress by the company and tremendous recovery in the electronics industry generally. 
Our orders declined from the record levels attained in the June quarter. However, we still had one of our best quarters ever for orders, and the level of business activity certainly remains quite strong. During the quarter, we made progress reducing our unusual logistics costs as well as improving production efficiencies on transferred production. Corrective actions to these items are largely a function of time: time to build inventory to fill ceilings and time for our manufacturing operations to learn the nuances of working with new equipment. We continue to improve in these areas, and we expect to see further progress in the December quarter. 
We also made progress reducing our backlog, which hit an all-time high in the June quarter due to the rapid recovery experienced over the last several quarters. Backlog was reduced by $28 million from the June levels as we brought online additional capacity. 
Finally, we announced the 15% increase in our dividend. We have a long-term commitment to our dividend. And given the increase in earnings potential of our new organization and the projected future cash flows, we are very comfortable increasing the payout at this time. 
If you turn now to Page 4, I'll talk a little bit about our revenue and order trend. Revenues for the September quarter were an all-time high of $898 million, 3% above the previous high reached in June of '08 and 6% above the June quarter and 33% above the same quarter last year. Even though orders declined 5% sequentially from the record set in the June quarter at $868 million, we achieved our third best quarter ever for new orders. And year-over-year orders were still up 20%, and all of that growth was organic. The order rate was slower during the early summer and strengthened during the September, and that strength has continued into October. While previous quarters were helped by incentives and inventory restocking, we believe that our current order rate is now more reflective of end demand. 
It's also worth noting that our bookings in the June quarter were up 9% sequentially and 58% year-over-year. So on a sequential basis, we're comparing ourselves to a record quarter. Given that the major economies in Europe and North America are recovering slowly, it's apparent that the emerging markets, particularly China, are driving most of the growth in the electronics sector. Disposable income in China increased by over 80% during the last 5 years. And this trend is expected to continue as the recovery becomes more consumption-orientated and less dependent on exports. This shift, coupled with the proliferation of mobile devices and related infrastructure, an uptick in enterprise spending on tech hardware and many new product introductions, we believe will provide good opportunities to continue to grow our business as we move forward. 
If you turn now to Page 5, I'll talk a little bit about the order trend by channel and by geography. By channel, orders from distribution decreased by the largest amount, by about 12% from the June quarter. Distributors seem to have largely replenished their inventories, and in my own view, perhaps overcorrected on the downside of when the market took its plummet and about overcorrected on the upside, and they are now in the process of adjusting their inventory levels and their order rates accordingly. Orders from OEMs and EMS went only down by 2% and 3%, respectively. We reached -- as I said before, we achieved record orders in the June quarter, so a slight decrease, particularly in the OEM and EMS sectors, is really not surprising in the current quarter. 
By region, Europe decreased by 15% from the June rate largely due to the summer slowdown caused by vacations and holidays. Year-over-year, Europe was only up 8%, and that's largely because Europe benefited the most from stimuluses in the '09 period. Orders in the Americas declined 9% from June due to summer slowdown in July and August and due to lower orders primarily from distribution. 
Asia North increased from the June quarter by 6%. This reflects a strong consumer electronics market for us and strong demand for mobile phones and particularly smartphones. Asia South was down 4% from June, again largely due to seasonal slowdown in orders. But we saw that those orders were up 32% year-over-year, so our business level in Asia South remains very, very high. 64% of our total orders were from Asia in this quarter, and the percent of our business coming from Asia just continues to increase as we move forward. This is somewhat explained by the relative strength in markets where production is largely in Asia, mainly mobile phones, consumer electronics and infotech. It's also the result of increased consumer electronic devices in emerging markets -- the increased consumption of those devices. It's worth noting that our orders in the Asia Pacific South region alone exceeded the total of our orders in North America and Europe combined in the last quarter. 
Now if you turn to Page 6, I'll talk a little bit about the change in our revenue and orders by end market. Revenues for the automotive market declined 4% sequentially, and orders declined 9% from the June quarter. This was not expected -- unexpected in that automotive production usually declines in the September quarter. On a geographic basis, we've seen favorable results in North America as the market seems to have stabilized and continues to rebound. September auto sales were the best in 13 months in North America, and it's worth noting that those records were achieved without incentives. And we're now on a run rate to sell about 12.2 million vehicles in North America. Europe slowed down in part due to the end of most of the stimulus packages across Europe, but also due to the summer holiday period, which probably has the biggest impact in Europe. We have also now fully evenly balanced between our automotive revenues in North America, Europe and Asia, that business being split 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. Going forward, we expect that North America and China will post the highest growth rates, while Europe and Japan will stay relatively flat. Longer term, we also believe that the increasing electronic content in vehicles will help to grow our automotive business. 
The data or infotech market performed as expected. Revenues increased 6%, while orders decreased 3% from the June quarter. Revenue increased in large part due to backlog reduction, while the decrease in orders is due to a small buildup in inventory in the supply chain. This inventory is very product and customer-specific and does not appear to be reflective of overall pullback in end market demand. If you recall, many of the large players in the infotech market were impacted by component shortages earlier this year. And at the same time, were very optimistic that demand would be very strong in the second half and that they would all gain market share. Now that component shortages appear to have been resolved, there would appear to be a modest inventory buildup that is being worked through and we believe will be worked through by the end of the calendar year. Companies still need to upgrade their data centers and add capacity. And we think that, that underlying trend will provide ongoing good business as we move into 2011. We have also seen, just as an anecdote, tremendous interest in tablet computers. And I was recently visiting our operations in Japan. And looking at our customer  relationship module, it's interesting to note that we're actively working on 50 different tablet program computers -- tablet computer programs. It just shows the tremendous interest in that new format. 
If you look now at Page 6, I'll continue the commentary relative to the end markets. The telecom market, which include infrastructure, networking as well as mobile phones, performed well overall, with revenues increasing 10% and orders decreasing 4% from the June quarter. Infrastructure revenue was down modestly. However, orders were down by 14%. This business tends to be very lumpy and chunky and has been very strong coming out of the downturn. We're now seeing a pause in the level of business activity. However, both revenue and orders are well above the prior year levels. 
Revenue and orders for the mobile phone submarket were very, very strong, 30% up sequentially and 20% -- 23% year-over-year. This is due in to a large number of new products being introduced and  continued shift to smartphones, as well as a strong seasonal influence. Looking ahead, there are many new products in the horizon for the mobile phone market, including HD screen, 4G devices and continued share gains for smartphones, as well as the introduction of Android and Windows 7-based devices. Many of the major OEMs are also doing a good job of penetrating new geographies with mobile phones. Overall, we believe that this trend will drive the need for infrastructure to support new devices as we move into calendar year '11. 
Despite what you read in the press, the consumer market, at least for us, has been quite strong. Revenues increased 12% for the June quarter and orders declined a modest 1%, which is below the normal seasonal trend that we would see. This is largely due to the number of new product introductions, backlog reductions and the strong influence of a pre-Christmas build. Even in these difficult times, consumers are choosing to spend their discretionary income on an interesting array of devices, which have increasing connective content. For example, LCD panels trends include now 3D technology, LED backlighting and an increasing use of these high-definition displays in public domains. While we do not know the exact percentage of end consumption in emerging markets, we do know that this percentage is increasing due to strong economic growth and rise in consumers in the developing countries. This is a long-term trend, that coupled with a recovery in the economies of the developing countries and new product offerings, will drive growth in 2011 and beyond. 
Revenue in the industrial market increased 3% from the June quarter, while orders declined 8%. The reduction in orders from distributors had a profound impact on this market, and this is very much a high-mix, low-volume market where distribution is a significant channel. We continue to see opportunities in automotive and semiconductor equipment as well as with our Focus Accounts. Revenues in orders are up 50% and 43%, respectively, from the September quarter last year. So overall relative to a year ago, this market is still very strong. 
Orders from our Focus Accounts grew 3% sequentially versus the June quarter and were up 55% from the prior year, well above the growth rate for the total company. These AD accounts now represent 30% of total Molex orders. We increased the program by 26 accounts this year to further develop our focus markets and find new opportunities for growth. This quarter's success represents another step forward in the success of this program. 
As we move into the December quarter, we see strong activity in mobile phones and smartphones; a modest level of inventory in the infotech sector, which needs to be burned off; a slight pause in networking; and a good but not great Christmas season developing for consumer goods. This leads us to conclude that the December quarter will be below our normal seasonal average in terms of sequential growth, but still at a very positive level relative to the prior year. Our expectation is that bookings will be relatively flat from this point forward through Chinese New Year and, based on discussions with our end customers, will then pick up as we move into calendar year '11. 
Let me now turn the call over to Dave Johnson, our CFO, who will give you greater details on the financial numbers that we released."

Please turn to Slide 7, which details our key income statement items. As promised previously, this information is only shown on a GAAP basis beginning with this quarter and going forward. The elements that previously were excluded for n",1156,"Thank you, Martin. Please turn to Slide 7, which details our key income statement items. As promised previously, this information is only shown on a GAAP basis beginning with this quarter and going forward. The elements that previously were excluded for non-GAAP reporting, specifically restructuring and unauthorized activities in Japan, are separately listed on the statement so that you can easily compare the periods shown. 
Both revenue and gross profit were all-time records for Molex. On an organic basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue was up 5% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. SG&A decreased in absolute dollars by $1.6 million sequentially. And excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A decreased by $2.4 million. 
The unauthorized activities in Japan for September and June 2010 related to investigation and litigation costs. The $5.5 million expense for the September quarter, or at $0.02 per share, was higher than anticipated but included all costs to wrap up the investigation phase. We are now moving into the litigation phase. Looking ahead to the next quarter, we should expect the Japan litigation costs to be roughly half of the $5.5 million amount that we incurred in the September quarter. 
The other noteworthy item in the P&L is Other Expense. This includes equity income in minority investments, offset by a foreign exchange loss in the quarter. For the coming quarter, you should assume that this will be other income in the range of $3 million to $5 million, and this is a result of the operational results of our equity investments, which are improving. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%. This includes the tax charge of $2.3 million or $0.01 per share, which is due to options that expired under water for which we had previously recognized the tax deduction. Without this charge, our effective tax rate would have been right at 30%. 
And finally, we reported net income, record net income of $75.1 million and record earnings per share of $0.43. 
Page 8 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. Net cash of $73 million reflects a reduction in cash to build our inventory for the conversion from air to sea shipments, also the payment of severance related to our restructuring program, as well as a higher-than-normal capital expenditure level driven by new product releases and capital constraints. 
I mentioned at our September 9 Analyst Meeting that positive free cash flow generation would begin in the second quarter. And we are on track as planned to generate free cash flow roughly equal to net income going forward. And because of our confidence in generating positive free cash flow, we have increased our dividend by almost 15% to an amount approximating $30 million per quarter. 
I would also like to mention that during the quarter, we expanded our revolving credit facility by bringing in 3 additional banks and increasing the size of the facility to $270 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $110 million drawn and therefore $160 million available under this facility. 
The progress toward our 14% operating margin is shown on Page 9. Our gross margin improved 70 basis points in the quarter to 30.6%. We reduced our freight expenses from the high level reported in the June quarter, but much of this benefit was offset by higher commodity costs and the impact of foreign currencies. Commodities and currencies decreased our gross profit by $6 million sequentially, after several quarters of nominal impact from these items. The 2 commodities that impacted us the most are gold and copper, both of which increased throughout the quarter and have continued to increase up to the present time. We have begun to benefit from the hedges we put in place at the beginning of the quarter for gold and copper, but the hedge benefits are included in the sequential costs that I just mentioned. 
With respect to foreign currencies, we net the translation impact, which is positive with the weaker dollar; with the transaction impact, which for us is generally weaker -- a negative with the weaker dollar. The weakness of the U.S. dollar versus the yen in particular impacted us in the quarter as, for example, we manufacture in Japan, export to Hong Kong and sell into China in U.S. dollars. We have modeled the impact of both commodities and currencies thus far in the second quarter and expect to have a similar sequential headwind in Q2 as we experienced in Q1 for these items. 
SG&A at 17.5% reached an all-time low and exceeded our target goal of 18% for the first time. Looking forward, merit increases, which went into effect on October 1, will increase salaries and wages by $4.2 million per quarter, of which approximately $2.5 million are related to the SG&A line. 
Of course, the ultimate goal is to improve our operating margin. We have steadily increased this metric from 6.8% a year ago to 12.5% in the current quarter. Note that the 4 previous quarters are adjusted for restructuring and Japan costs. But the current quarter includes the $5.5 million Japanese investigation litigation costs, which reduces the operating margin by 60 basis points.  
I think it is also helpful to look back to the period before the downturn. In the June quarter of 2008 at our previous peak of $872 million in revenue, our operating margin was 11.3%. We are well above that level today and progressing toward our 14% target. 
We continue to show good progress in our return on net assets trend, which is depicted on Page 10. Despite the higher-than-usual inventory and capital expenditure level, our return on net assets surpassed 19% and continues to move rapidly higher, approaching our fiscal 2011 target of 20% to 25%. 
And finally on Page 11, we set forth our guidance for the December quarter. In consideration of the sequential swing [ph] of our bookings in the first quarter and the continued uncertainty in the global economic outlook, we have set the midpoint of our guidance to reflect a 3% sequential decline in revenue from the record level reported in the first quarter. Our outlook for the quarter, therefore, is revenue in the range of $850 to $890 million, with EPS in the range of $0.38 to $0.44. As noted on the chart, this assumes an effective tax rate of 30% and no change in foreign currency rates and commodity prices from today's levels. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with our progress in revenue, EPS and SG&A spending, all achieving new records. Gross margin continues to be a challenge for us, especially with the headwinds caused by recent currency and commodity price volatility. However, we are intently focused on achieving our 14% operating margin target through improvements to our global logistics operations, implementing more effective pricing strategies and mitigating the currency and commodity volatility through our hedging activities. 
This concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open up the call for questions."

But you read a lot, I think, about in the summer about some of the component shortages that existed. And in some sectors, it appears that customers over-ordered based on not being able to get product and now have more inventory than they think end demand is going to use up, particularly in the last quarter. And so I think that slowed down orders. But when I talked to those companies, they are very confident about long-term end demand. And they see this as an issue to burn through the inventory, particularly with kind of year-end capital spending. So our expectation is that the bookings in that sector are going to be flat through the end of the year, perhaps through Chinese New Year. It will pick up from there. I would say the bigger impact has  probably been in networking and storage versus sort of the notebook and server markets."

Honestly, there's a number of moving factors here that we're trying to reconcile ourselves in that obviously the concerns about consumer spending in North America and Europe are very well publicized. And I think there is concern about how strong the Christmas season will be here. The other side of the fence is that you go to Asia and consumer spending there is relatively strong. And there seems to be primarily strong demand that the Chinese consumer seems to be very focused on brand-name goods. And so the growth of that market, it tends to be best for the well-known global brands, where obviously we're well designed in. And so as you saw with our results, our consumer revenues were pretty good last quarter. We would typically see those bookings start to slow down because if it's not ordered now, obviously we're not going to ship it in time for the consumer build season, because people have got to build those products and get them into the market. So our sense is that Europe, North America will be weaker, Asia is pretty strong, and we kind of evened all that out to say it would be sort of flat going into this Christmas."

And what I would say is that Q1 is typically back-end loaded, and that happened because September was clearly the strongest month and bookings have continued to be strong in October. This quarter is normally front-end loaded. And then I think what happens in Q3, just looking back over the last 10 years, it depends largely around how much inventory we come out of Christmas with. But we've seen years, we've come out of Christmas with limited inventory, and things pick up very quickly with a pause for Chinese New Year, with customers asking to keep plants open over Chinese New Year. And we've seen the opposite extreme where there is high inventory and people asking us not to keep the plants open.

So we did see some very good improvement in that area. Longer term, of course, our -- and the reason why our inventory is building is because we are converting from sea freight -- from air freight to sea freight, and we have gotten probably about 65% of that converted as of the first quarter. We expect to convert that to maybe 80% to 90% by the end of the second quarter, with the goal of being at 95% in the third quarter, so that is where we're focused.

Our inventory -- $20 million of the increase in inventory was due just to exchange. And $30 million of the increase in receivables was due to exchange. So that's why -- that's a big portion of the increase in receivables, that's why the days in receivables really haven't changed. And I'd say, I wouldn't read much into the change in receivables other than, as Martin pointed out, our sales and our business continues to grow in Asia, where we have longer terms to our customers, and that's what's driving that. So receivables I think is still in very good shape. Exchange was the biggest factor for the period of time. In terms of inventory, yes, there's really 2 things that have affected that over the last couple of quarters. Number one, which we've talked a lot about, is just the completion of the restructuring and moving production to new locations and the buildup of inventory to handle that. We are still going through some of that, so that is one of the factors. And this very deliberate air to sea shipment process, which is paying dividends already, is increasing our inventory. To give you just maybe a sense of that, I'll give you a couple of numbers. Our in-transit inventory, that is the inventory that is on its way either in air or on a shipment at the end of the period, is at the end of this quarter was $72 million. A year ago, it was about half that level, which gives you a good indication of that. I guess other comments we've talked often about, the VMI, the vendor-managed inventory, hub inventory that is -- our inventory that's on consignment. That inventory has not increased. That is down, still below 30 days and is in quite good control. Anyway that's just some color on the inventories side."

And I think what it does do is it gives us a lot more leverage to make those price increases stick. What the net impact is, I think, overall -- I mean, what I look at our results at the last quarter, frankly, I think we're really pleased that our new model has worked very well and it's got our SG&A down below our 18% goal. We proved that at the level of revenues we're at, that we can hold up our costs at that level. I think the gross margin was not where we wanted it to be, and it was because of all of those currency and ForEx impacts. And it's interesting, we went back to 2006 and looked at where they stood then, had foreign currencies and the commodities stayed flat since we started our restructuring program, our gross margin this quarter within 34.6%. Now, that's not an excuse. I think our restructuring was to give us a better cost structure. Now we know the pressure's got to be on the gross margin line. And I think we attacked that through price increases. We attack it by focusing on customers with better margins, which is a lot about what our Focus Account program is. And we attack it through going after our logistics cost, which is also above the gross margin line. I don't think there are any silver bullets there. But I think we demonstrated through the restructuring that we can get our fixed costs structure in line. Now we've got to go after the gross margin. And the factors we face today are very different from what we faced in '06. But we're not giving up on getting that goal.

I think I made the same comment to an earlier question, and that is, I think we were pleased with our SG&A. And I think we've proven that the new global structure we have in place and the restructuring we've done enabled us to hit the 18% goal that we established. I think -- but for the ForEx and the raw material costs, we would have hit the gross margin target too, but didn't do that this quarter. But we're not using that as an excuse to say that doesn't mean we're going to hit our 14% goal in the long run. It means that we've got to do some things differently, I think, to close the gap between the 30.5% we're at now and the 32% target we would have been at. As I mentioned, just to give you an order of magnitude, had ForEx and raw materials stayed where they were when we started the restructuring in '06, that gross margin this quarter would have been at 34.6%. And in terms of rank ordering how we close that gap, I would say that short term, focusing on the logistics costs and operational efficiencies in our plants are the things that will benefit us the most in the current quarter. I would say the price increase would benefit us in Q3. And then shifting of our customer mix and looking at some of the smaller fast-growing customers where perhaps the margin opportunities are better, which our Focus Account program is targeted at, is obviously something you see as you move into calendar year '11."

I would say that the one factor that's different is that if you looked at the bookings that we had in the June quarter, which were an all-time record and were up to almost 60% year-over-year, and where our revenues are now, I think we've had an unusually high trend. And the other thing, that's because if we look back to that 10-year period, we've had some economic cycles that has kind of distorted where the seasonal trend will be. In total, we would normally have expected to see a slight increase. We expect it to be a slight decrease, so we project -- prudently I think, projected that based on what we saw in bookings trend over the last quarter, just seemed that if we see a 5% reduction in bookings. The biggest correlation with Molex generally is -- as we've looked over the years, is sort of looking at what the trend is in bookings in the current quarter versus where revenues go in the next quarter. So seeing the 5% reduction is why we felt that, given the backlog we have to ship, we wouldn't see that bigger drop or why we felt we would be down about 3%."

First of all, it's important to understand, I think, during this rapid recovery in the market, we have had a certain amount of production made on the outside so subcontracted to vendors, et cetera. And we have also had about 25% of headcount around the world today is either temporary or contract labor. So in the event that our revenue did tick down somewhat, and our view right now is that we could see it stabilize somewhat at the current levels through Chinese New Year. And based on interaction with customers, expect it to pick up from there. If that could easily be absorbed in terms of, firstly, reducing temporary or contract labor, we need to do that. And then bringing in-house things that we've used on the outside. And the other thing, as you all know, is we've moved tremendous amount of production around the world. And what we've seen that helped us is the operational efficiencies in those plants has continued to increase, so I don't think we would see a negative gross margin impact by any of the predicted revenue levels between now and Chinese New Year.

And you don't get the big bubbles build-up that you used to have before and people correct very quickly the moment they see the number of days increase. I actually think, looking back over the cycle we've been, distributors kind of overcorrected on the downside, that they actually made the biggest corrections after Lehman Brothers were bankrupted in the early part of '09, and then perhaps overcorrected on the upside. EMS companies, it's more about, actually, I think, getting components in place to meet end customer demand. And there, where you see the fluctuations is when they're competing for market share versus end customers. And so that's a very different picture that tends to be customer-specific versus the distributors that are obviously managing their overall inventory portfolio."

The firs",2188,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everybody. If you'd like to turn to Page 3, we've added a new slide to this quarter's deck where we've put in a one-page summary of what we think are the key points emerging from the quarter we just finished. The first point I obviously want to talk about is a quick update on our unauthorized activities in Japan. As you already know, the unauthorized activity occurred many years ago. And we've restated our financial results in the June 10-K to reflect the liability to this unauthorized activity. During the quarter that was just completed, we were served notice of a lawsuit by the financial institution involved. We responded to this complaint, and we intend to vigorously defend our position that these loans were unauthorized. This matter is now subject of ongoing litigation. We can't provide additional details at this time or answer any more questions about this particular topic. 
Now we'd like to spend the rest of the call talking about our operating results. And we're very pleased to announce the fact that we had record revenues and earnings per share in the September quarter. Given where we were 18 months ago, this is quite an accomplishment and obviously reflects good progress by the company and tremendous recovery in the electronics industry generally. 
Our orders declined from the record levels attained in the June quarter. However, we still had one of our best quarters ever for orders, and the level of business activity certainly remains quite strong. During the quarter, we made progress reducing our unusual logistics costs as well as improving production efficiencies on transferred production. Corrective actions to these items are largely a function of time: time to build inventory to fill ceilings and time for our manufacturing operations to learn the nuances of working with new equipment. We continue to improve in these areas, and we expect to see further progress in the December quarter. 
We also made progress reducing our backlog, which hit an all-time high in the June quarter due to the rapid recovery experienced over the last several quarters. Backlog was reduced by $28 million from the June levels as we brought online additional capacity. 
Finally, we announced the 15% increase in our dividend. We have a long-term commitment to our dividend. And given the increase in earnings potential of our new organization and the projected future cash flows, we are very comfortable increasing the payout at this time. 
If you turn now to Page 4, I'll talk a little bit about our revenue and order trend. Revenues for the September quarter were an all-time high of $898 million, 3% above the previous high reached in June of '08 and 6% above the June quarter and 33% above the same quarter last year. Even though orders declined 5% sequentially from the record set in the June quarter at $868 million, we achieved our third best quarter ever for new orders. And year-over-year orders were still up 20%, and all of that growth was organic. The order rate was slower during the early summer and strengthened during the September, and that strength has continued into October. While previous quarters were helped by incentives and inventory restocking, we believe that our current order rate is now more reflective of end demand. 
It's also worth noting that our bookings in the June quarter were up 9% sequentially and 58% year-over-year. So on a sequential basis, we're comparing ourselves to a record quarter. Given that the major economies in Europe and North America are recovering slowly, it's apparent that the emerging markets, particularly China, are driving most of the growth in the electronics sector. Disposable income in China increased by over 80% during the last 5 years. And this trend is expected to continue as the recovery becomes more consumption-orientated and less dependent on exports. This shift, coupled with the proliferation of mobile devices and related infrastructure, an uptick in enterprise spending on tech hardware and many new product introductions, we believe will provide good opportunities to continue to grow our business as we move forward. 
If you turn now to Page 5, I'll talk a little bit about the order trend by channel and by geography. By channel, orders from distribution decreased by the largest amount, by about 12% from the June quarter. Distributors seem to have largely replenished their inventories, and in my own view, perhaps overcorrected on the downside of when the market took its plummet and about overcorrected on the upside, and they are now in the process of adjusting their inventory levels and their order rates accordingly. Orders from OEMs and EMS went only down by 2% and 3%, respectively. We reached -- as I said before, we achieved record orders in the June quarter, so a slight decrease, particularly in the OEM and EMS sectors, is really not surprising in the current quarter. 
By region, Europe decreased by 15% from the June rate largely due to the summer slowdown caused by vacations and holidays. Year-over-year, Europe was only up 8%, and that's largely because Europe benefited the most from stimuluses in the '09 period. Orders in the Americas declined 9% from June due to summer slowdown in July and August and due to lower orders primarily from distribution. 
Asia North increased from the June quarter by 6%. This reflects a strong consumer electronics market for us and strong demand for mobile phones and particularly smartphones. Asia South was down 4% from June, again largely due to seasonal slowdown in orders. But we saw that those orders were up 32% year-over-year, so our business level in Asia South remains very, very high. 64% of our total orders were from Asia in this quarter, and the percent of our business coming from Asia just continues to increase as we move forward. This is somewhat explained by the relative strength in markets where production is largely in Asia, mainly mobile phones, consumer electronics and infotech. It's also the result of increased consumer electronic devices in emerging markets -- the increased consumption of those devices. It's worth noting that our orders in the Asia Pacific South region alone exceeded the total of our orders in North America and Europe combined in the last quarter. 
Now if you turn to Page 6, I'll talk a little bit about the change in our revenue and orders by end market. Revenues for the automotive market declined 4% sequentially, and orders declined 9% from the June quarter. This was not expected -- unexpected in that automotive production usually declines in the September quarter. On a geographic basis, we've seen favorable results in North America as the market seems to have stabilized and continues to rebound. September auto sales were the best in 13 months in North America, and it's worth noting that those records were achieved without incentives. And we're now on a run rate to sell about 12.2 million vehicles in North America. Europe slowed down in part due to the end of most of the stimulus packages across Europe, but also due to the summer holiday period, which probably has the biggest impact in Europe. We have also now fully evenly balanced between our automotive revenues in North America, Europe and Asia, that business being split 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. Going forward, we expect that North America and China will post the highest growth rates, while Europe and Japan will stay relatively flat. Longer term, we also believe that the increasing electronic content in vehicles will help to grow our automotive business. 
The data or infotech market performed as expected. Revenues increased 6%, while orders decreased 3% from the June quarter. Revenue increased in large part due to backlog reduction, while the decrease in orders is due to a small buildup in inventory in the supply chain. This inventory is very product and customer-specific and does not appear to be reflective of overall pullback in end market demand. If you recall, many of the large players in the infotech market were impacted by component shortages earlier this year. And at the same time, were very optimistic that demand would be very strong in the second half and that they would all gain market share. Now that component shortages appear to have been resolved, there would appear to be a modest inventory buildup that is being worked through and we believe will be worked through by the end of the calendar year. Companies still need to upgrade their data centers and add capacity. And we think that, that underlying trend will provide ongoing good business as we move into 2011. We have also seen, just as an anecdote, tremendous interest in tablet computers. And I was recently visiting our operations in Japan. And looking at our customer  relationship module, it's interesting to note that we're actively working on 50 different tablet program computers -- tablet computer programs. It just shows the tremendous interest in that new format. 
If you look now at Page 6, I'll continue the commentary relative to the end markets. The telecom market, which include infrastructure, networking as well as mobile phones, performed well overall, with revenues increasing 10% and orders decreasing 4% from the June quarter. Infrastructure revenue was down modestly. However, orders were down by 14%. This business tends to be very lumpy and chunky and has been very strong coming out of the downturn. We're now seeing a pause in the level of business activity. However, both revenue and orders are well above the prior year levels. 
Revenue and orders for the mobile phone submarket were very, very strong, 30% up sequentially and 20% -- 23% year-over-year. This is due in to a large number of new products being introduced and  continued shift to smartphones, as well as a strong seasonal influence. Looking ahead, there are many new products in the horizon for the mobile phone market, including HD screen, 4G devices and continued share gains for smartphones, as well as the introduction of Android and Windows 7-based devices. Many of the major OEMs are also doing a good job of penetrating new geographies with mobile phones. Overall, we believe that this trend will drive the need for infrastructure to support new devices as we move into calendar year '11. 
Despite what you read in the press, the consumer market, at least for us, has been quite strong. Revenues increased 12% for the June quarter and orders declined a modest 1%, which is below the normal seasonal trend that we would see. This is largely due to the number of new product introductions, backlog reductions and the strong influence of a pre-Christmas build. Even in these difficult times, consumers are choosing to spend their discretionary income on an interesting array of devices, which have increasing connective content. For example, LCD panels trends include now 3D technology, LED backlighting and an increasing use of these high-definition displays in public domains. While we do not know the exact percentage of end consumption in emerging markets, we do know that this percentage is increasing due to strong economic growth and rise in consumers in the developing countries. This is a long-term trend, that coupled with a recovery in the economies of the developing countries and new product offerings, will drive growth in 2011 and beyond. 
Revenue in the industrial market increased 3% from the June quarter, while orders declined 8%. The reduction in orders from distributors had a profound impact on this market, and this is very much a high-mix, low-volume market where distribution is a significant channel. We continue to see opportunities in automotive and semiconductor equipment as well as with our Focus Accounts. Revenues in orders are up 50% and 43%, respectively, from the September quarter last year. So overall relative to a year ago, this market is still very strong. 
Orders from our Focus Accounts grew 3% sequentially versus the June quarter and were up 55% from the prior year, well above the growth rate for the total company. These AD accounts now represent 30% of total Molex orders. We increased the program by 26 accounts this year to further develop our focus markets and find new opportunities for growth. This quarter's success represents another step forward in the success of this program. 
As we move into the December quarter, we see strong activity in mobile phones and smartphones; a modest level of inventory in the infotech sector, which needs to be burned off; a slight pause in networking; and a good but not great Christmas season developing for consumer goods. This leads us to conclude that the December quarter will be below our normal seasonal average in terms of sequential growth, but still at a very positive level relative to the prior year. Our expectation is that bookings will be relatively flat from this point forward through Chinese New Year and, based on discussions with our end customers, will then pick up as we move into calendar year '11. 
Let me now turn the call over to Dave Johnson, our CFO, who will give you greater details on the financial numbers that we released."

As promised previously, this information is only shown on a GAAP basis beginning with this quarter and going forward. The elements that previously were excluded for non-GAAP reporting, specifically restructuring and unauthorized activities in Japan, are separately listed on the statement so that you can easily compare the periods shown. 
Both revenue and gross profit were all-time records for Molex. On an organic basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, revenue was up 5% sequentially and 32% year-over-year. SG&A decreased in absolute dollars by $1.6 million sequentially. And excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, SG&A decreased by $2.4 million. 
The unauthorized activities in Japan for September and June 2010 related to investigation and litigation costs. The $5.5 million expense for the September quarter, or at $0.02 per share, was higher than anticipated but included all costs to wrap up the investigation phase. We are now moving into the litigation phase. Looking ahead to the next quarter, we should expect the Japan litigation costs to be roughly half of the $5.5 million amount that we incurred in the September quarter. 
The other noteworthy item in the P&L is Other Expense. This includes equity income in minority investments, offset by a foreign exchange loss in the quarter. For the coming quarter, you should assume that this will be other income in the range of $3 million to $5 million, and this is a result of the operational results of our equity investments, which are improving. 
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.2%. This includes the tax charge of $2.3 million or $0.01 per share, which is due to options that expired under water for which we had previously recognized the tax deduction. Without this charge, our effective tax rate would have been right at 30%. 
And finally, we reported net income, record net income of $75.1 million and record earnings per share of $0.43. 
Page 8 summarizes our balance sheet metrics. Net cash of $73 million reflects a reduction in cash to build our inventory for the conversion from air to sea shipments, also the payment of severance related to our restructuring program, as well as a higher-than-normal capital expenditure level driven by new product releases and capital constraints. 
I mentioned at our September 9 Analyst Meeting that positive free cash flow generation would begin in the second quarter. And we are on track as planned to generate free cash flow roughly equal to net income going forward. And because of our confidence in generating positive free cash flow, we have increased our dividend by almost 15% to an amount approximating $30 million per quarter. 
I would also like to mention that during the quarter, we expanded our revolving credit facility by bringing in 3 additional banks and increasing the size of the facility to $270 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $110 million drawn and therefore $160 million available under this facility. 
The progress toward our 14% operating margin is shown on Page 9. Our gross margin improved 70 basis points in the quarter to 30.6%. We reduced our freight expenses from the high level reported in the June quarter, but much of this benefit was offset by higher commodity costs and the impact of foreign currencies. Commodities and currencies decreased our gross profit by $6 million sequentially, after several quarters of nominal impact from these items. The 2 commodities that impacted us the most are gold and copper, both of which increased throughout the quarter and have continued to increase up to the present time. We have begun to benefit from the hedges we put in place at the beginning of the quarter for gold and copper, but the hedge benefits are included in the sequential costs that I just mentioned. 
With respect to foreign currencies, we net the translation impact, which is positive with the weaker dollar; with the transaction impact, which for us is generally weaker -- a negative with the weaker dollar. The weakness of the U.S. dollar versus the yen in particular impacted us in the quarter as, for example, we manufacture in Japan, export to Hong Kong and sell into China in U.S. dollars. We have modeled the impact of both commodities and currencies thus far in the second quarter and expect to have a similar sequential headwind in Q2 as we experienced in Q1 for these items. 
SG&A at 17.5% reached an all-time low and exceeded our target goal of 18% for the first time. Looking forward, merit increases, which went into effect on October 1, will increase salaries and wages by $4.2 million per quarter, of which approximately $2.5 million are related to the SG&A line. 
Of course, the ultimate goal is to improve our operating margin. We have steadily increased this metric from 6.8% a year ago to 12.5% in the current quarter. Note that the 4 previous quarters are adjusted for restructuring and Japan costs. But the current quarter includes the $5.5 million Japanese investigation litigation costs, which reduces the operating margin by 60 basis points.  
I think it is also helpful to look back to the period before the downturn. In the June quarter of 2008 at our previous peak of $872 million in revenue, our operating margin was 11.3%. We are well above that level today and progressing toward our 14% target. 
We continue to show good progress in our return on net assets trend, which is depicted on Page 10. Despite the higher-than-usual inventory and capital expenditure level, our return on net assets surpassed 19% and continues to move rapidly higher, approaching our fiscal 2011 target of 20% to 25%. 
And finally on Page 11, we set forth our guidance for the December quarter. In consideration of the sequential swing [ph] of our bookings in the first quarter and the continued uncertainty in the global economic outlook, we have set the midpoint of our guidance to reflect a 3% sequential decline in revenue from the record level reported in the first quarter. Our outlook for the quarter, therefore, is revenue in the range of $850 to $890 million, with EPS in the range of $0.38 to $0.44. As noted on the chart, this assumes an effective tax rate of 30% and no change in foreign currency rates and commodity prices from today's levels. 
In conclusion, we are pleased with our progress in revenue, EPS and SG&A spending, all achieving new records. Gross margin continues to be a challenge for us, especially with the headwinds caused by recent currency and commodity price volatility. However, we are intently focused on achieving our 14% operating margin target through improvements to our global logistics operations, implementing more effective pricing strategies and mitigating the currency and commodity volatility through our hedging activities. 
This concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open up the call for questions."

But you read a lot, I think, about in the summer about some of the component shortages that existed. And in some sectors, it appears that customers over-ordered based on not being able to get product and now have more inventory than they think end demand is going to use up, particularly in the last quarter. And so I think that slowed down orders. But when I talked to those companies, they are very confident about long-term end demand. And they see this as an issue to burn through the inventory, particularly with kind of year-end capital spending. So our expectation is that the bookings in that sector are going to be flat through the end of the year, perhaps through Chinese New Year. It will pick up from there. I would say the bigger impact has  probably been in networking and storage versus sort of the notebook and server markets."

Honestly, there's a number of moving factors here that we're trying to reconcile ourselves in that obviously the concerns about consumer spending in North America and Europe are very well publicized. And I think there is concern about how strong the Christmas season will be here. The other side of the fence is that you go to Asia and consumer spending there is relatively strong. And there seems to be primarily strong demand that the Chinese consumer seems to be very focused on brand-name goods. And so the growth of that market, it tends to be best for the well-known global brands, where obviously we're well designed in. And so as you saw with our results, our consumer revenues were pretty good last quarter. We would typically see those bookings start to slow down because if it's not ordered now, obviously we're not going to ship it in time for the consumer build season, because people have got to build those products and get them into the market. So our sense is that Europe, North America will be weaker, Asia is pretty strong, and we kind of evened all that out to say it would be sort of flat going into this Christmas."

And what I would say is that Q1 is typically back-end loaded, and that happened because September was clearly the strongest month and bookings have continued to be strong in October. This quarter is normally front-end loaded. And then I think what happens in Q3, just looking back over the last 10 years, it depends largely around how much inventory we come out of Christmas with. But we've seen years, we've come out of Christmas with limited inventory, and things pick up very quickly with a pause for Chinese New Year, with customers asking to keep plants open over Chinese New Year. And we've seen the opposite extreme where there is high inventory and people asking us not to keep the plants open. I think the good news though is that people seem to imagine the supply chain very tightly. And so I think the likelihood of coming out at Christmas with a huge inventory bubble is very slim."

Our inventory -- $20 million of the increase in inventory was due just to exchange. And $30 million of the increase in receivables was due to exchange. So that's why -- that's a big portion of the increase in receivables, that's why the days in receivables really haven't changed. And I'd say, I wouldn't read much into the change in receivables other than, as Martin pointed out, our sales and our business continues to grow in Asia, where we have longer terms to our customers, and that's what's driving that. So receivables I think is still in very good shape. Exchange was the biggest factor for the period of time. In terms of inventory, yes, there's really 2 things that have affected that over the last couple of quarters. Number one, which we've talked a lot about, is just the completion of the restructuring and moving production to new locations and the buildup of inventory to handle that. We are still going through some of that, so that is one of the factors. And this very deliberate air to sea shipment process, which is paying dividends already, is increasing our inventory. To give you just maybe a sense of that, I'll give you a couple of numbers. Our in-transit inventory, that is the inventory that is on its way either in air or on a shipment at the end of the period, is at the end of this quarter was $72 million. A year ago, it was about half that level, which gives you a good indication of that. I guess other comments we've talked often about, the VMI, the vendor-managed inventory, hub inventory that is -- our inventory that's on consignment. That inventory has not increased. That is down, still below 30 days and is in quite good control. Anyway that's just some color on the inventories side."

And I think what it does do is it gives us a lot more leverage to make those price increases stick. What the net impact is, I think, overall -- I mean, what I look at our results at the last quarter, frankly, I think we're really pleased that our new model has worked very well and it's got our SG&A down below our 18% goal. We proved that at the level of revenues we're at, that we can hold up our costs at that level. I think the gross margin was not where we wanted it to be, and it was because of all of those currency and ForEx impacts. And it's interesting, we went back to 2006 and looked at where they stood then, had foreign currencies and the commodities stayed flat since we started our restructuring program, our gross margin this quarter within 34.6%. Now, that's not an excuse. I think our restructuring was to give us a better cost structure. Now we know the pressure's got to be on the gross margin line. And I think we attacked that through price increases. We attack it by focusing on customers with better margins, which is a lot about what our Focus Account program is. And we attack it through going after our logistics cost, which is also above the gross margin line. I don't think there are any silver bullets there. But I think we demonstrated through the restructuring that we can get our fixed costs structure in line. Now we've got to go after the gross margin. And the factors we face today are very different from what we faced in '06. But we're not giving up on getting that goal.

I think I made the same comment to an earlier question, and that is, I think we were pleased with our SG&A. And I think we've proven that the new global structure we have in place and the restructuring we've done enabled us to hit the 18% goal that we established. I think -- but for the ForEx and the raw material costs, we would have hit the gross margin target too, but didn't do that this quarter. But we're not using that as an excuse to say that doesn't mean we're going to hit our 14% goal in the long run. It means that we've got to do some things differently, I think, to close the gap between the 30.5% we're at now and the 32% target we would have been at. As I mentioned, just to give you an order of magnitude, had ForEx and raw materials stayed where they were when we started the restructuring in '06, that gross margin this quarter would have been at 34.6%. And in terms of rank ordering how we close that gap, I would say that short term, focusing on the logistics costs and operational efficiencies in our plants are the things that will benefit us the most in the current quarter. I would say the price increase would benefit us in Q3. And then shifting of our customer mix and looking at some of the smaller fast-growing customers where perhaps the margin opportunities are better, which our Focus Account program is targeted at, is obviously something you see as you move into calendar year '11."

I would say that the one factor that's different is that if you looked at the bookings that we had in the June quarter, which were an all-time record and were up to almost 60% year-over-year, and where our revenues are now, I think we've had an unusually high trend. And the other thing, that's because if we look back to that 10-year period, we've had some economic cycles that has kind of distorted where the seasonal trend will be. In total, we would normally have expected to see a slight increase. We expect it to be a slight decrease, so we project -- prudently I think, projected that based on what we saw in bookings trend over the last quarter, just seemed that if we see a 5% reduction in bookings. The biggest correlation with Molex generally is -- as we've looked over the years, is sort of looking at what the trend is in bookings in the current quarter versus where revenues go in the next quarter. So seeing the 5% reduction is why we felt that, given the backlog we have to ship, we wouldn't see that bigger drop or why we felt we would be down about 3%."

And we have also had about 25% of headcount around the world today is either temporary or contract labor. So in the event that our revenue did tick down somewhat, and our view right now is that we could see it stabilize somewhat at the current levels through Chinese New Year. And based on interaction with customers, expect it to pick up from there. If that could easily be absorbed in terms of, firstly, reducing temporary or contract labor, we need to do that. And then bringing in-house things that we've used on the outside. And the other thing, as you all know, is we've moved tremendous amount of production around the world. And what we've seen that helped us is the operational efficiencies in those plants has continued to increase, so I don't think we would see a negative gross margin impact by any of the predicted revenue levels between now and Chinese New Year.

And a 5% decline from record levels, we're certainly not panicking about that, particularly given that September picked up again and October seems to be going pretty well. And largely as you saw, it was -- could be explained by some summer slowdowns and some specific end markets. So I think if business would continue at the current levels, plus or minus a little bit, I don't see any big cause for panic about that. And to expect that bookings really continue sequentially growing at the rate it had the previous 6 quarters on an organic basis is just not realistic."

And you don't get the big bubbles build-up that you used to have before and people correct very quickly the moment they see the number of days increase. I actually think, looking back over the cycle we've been, distributors kind of overcorrected on the downside, that they actually made the biggest corrections after Lehman Brothers were bankrupted in the early part of '09, and then perhaps overcorrected on the upside. EMS companies, it's more about, actually, I think, getting components in place to meet end customer demand. And there, where you see the fluctuations is when they're competing for market share versus end customers. And so that's a very different picture that tends to be customer-specific versus the distributors that are obviously managing their overall inventory portfolio."
