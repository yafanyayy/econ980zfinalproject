Thank you for joining us on the call today. Based on the feedback we've received from some of you, we've added the tables in the back section of the release, which presents five quarter trends for the income statement",2374,"Thank you, Don, and welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Based on the feedback we've received from some of you, we've added the tables in the back section of the release, which presents five quarter trends for the income statement and the balance sheet. Hopefully, we've made your analysis a little easier. I know it's been a busy day for some of you so let's go through the highlights quickly and get to your questions.For the full year of 2009, diluted earnings per common share were $2.89 compared with $5.01 for 2008. Net income for 2009 was $380 million compared with $556 million in 2008. Included in our GAAP earnings for 2009 were after-tax merger-related expenses net of the gain from the Bradford acquisition of $36 million or $0.31 per common share. There are $2 million or $0.02 per share of merger-related expenses in 2008. Also included in GAAP earnings for the past year was after-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $39 million or $0.34 per common share. This compares with $41 million or $0.36 per share in 2008.Net operating income, which we believe helps investors understand the effect of acquisitions on our results, and which excludes the amortization of intangibles as well as merger-related items, was $455 million or $3.54 per common share for 2009 compared with $599 million or $5.39 per share in 2008. In accordance with the SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including intangible assets and equity.Turning to the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per common share were $1.04 in the fourth quarter of 2009, improved from $0.97 earned in the third quarter of 2009. Net income for the recent quarter was $137 million, up from $128 million in the linked quarter. After-tax merger-related expenses in the quarter relating to both Provident and Bradford Bank acquisitions were $4 million or $0.03 per common share in the recent quarter. This compares with net after-tax merger-related benefits of $9 million or $0.08 per common share in the third quarter of 2009, which came as a result of our acquisition of Bradford Bank. We expect no further merger-related expenses from either of the two acquisitions.The amortization of core deposits and other intangible assets amounted to $0.09 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2009 and in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share, excluding the amortization of core deposits and other intangibles, as well as merger related items that I just mentioned were $1.16 per common share for the recent quarter, up 18% from $0.98 in the linked quarter. M&T's net operating income for the quarter was $151 million, an increase of 17% from $129 million in the linked quarter.Next, I'd like to cover a few highlights from the balance sheet and the income statement. Intangible equivalent net interest income was $565 million for the fourth quarter, an 8% annualized increase from $553 million in the linked quarter and an increase of 15% from $491 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The net interest margin continued to expand during the fourth quarter, averaging 3.71%, up from 3.61% in the third quarter. Approximately four basis points of the margin expansion came from repricing on consumer time deposits. An additional four basis points came from a shift in our funding mix, with higher non-maturity savings and  commercial DDA balances replacing time deposits and wholesale borrowing. The remainder of the expansion came from lower rates on wholesale borrowing. Notable during the quarter was a rise in yields on commercial & industrial loans, up nine basis points compared with the third quarter. Looking forward, we expect further widening of the margin for 2010. As for the balance sheet, average loans for the fourth quarter declined approximately $200 million from $52.3 billion, in the third quarter to $52.1 billion. Compared with this year's third quarter, changes in average loans by category were as follows. Commercial & industrial loans declined by 8%. Average loans to auto dealers to finance new model and year inventory grew by an annualized 18% as compared with the third quarter of 2009, while remaining C&I loans balances declined an annualized 10%. The decline in this latter category was exacerbated by pay-downs, charge-offs in both the third and fourth quarters and a reduction in certain non-core customer exposures. Commercial real estate loans and residential real estate loans each grew by an annualized 2%, and consumer loans declined by an annualized 3%. This includes a 14% annualized decline of indirect auto loans, reflecting continued run-off in the out-of-footprint part of that portfolio. This was partially offset by a modest mid-single-digit growth in our home equity lines of credit.Recently, we experienced low single-digit annualized growth in upstate New York, while experiencing low to mid-single-digit decline in the New York City metro region and in Pennsylvania. The decline in commercial and industrial loans from pay downs, charge-offs and exits were concentrated in the mid-Atlantic. Excluding those items, loans in the mid-Atlantic were relatively flat. We continue to see strong growth in core deposits. Average core customer deposits in the fourth quarter, which excludes foreign deposits and CDs over $100,000, as well as excluding any acquisition impact, increased by an annualized 15% from the third quarter, with growth coming in every geographic region. Also notable is the fact that the average non-interest-bearing deposits in the fourth quarter of '09 were up 50% compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. This also excludes the impact from acquisitions.Turning to non-interest income, excluding securities gains and losses and the third quarter $29 million gain from the Bradford acquisition, non-interest income was $300 million for the recent quarter compared with $296 million in the third quarter. Mortgage banking fees were $50 million for the quarter, up from $48 million in the linked quarter. This reflects the impact of wider gain-on-sale margins, partially offset by slightly lower origination volume. Service charges on deposit accounts were $127 million during the quarter, compared with $129 million in the linked quarter. The decline came primarily on the commercial side and was largely attributable to fewer processing days in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter.M&T's share of operating results of Bayview Lending Group or BLG was a loss of $11 million, unchanged from the linked quarter. BLG's recent performance was largely attributable to an increase in loan loss provisioning. Securities in the fourth quarter amounted to $34 million, predominantly reflecting an additional other-than-temporary impairment charges on our available-for-sale securities portfolio. This was down from $47 million of other-than-temporary impairment charges in the third quarter.Operating expenses were well-controlled during the recent quarter. Excluding merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets, operating expenses were $455 million, down from $469 million in the third quarter of '09. The decline was primarily attributable to lower compensation expense, including core salaries, as well as incentive compensation. The fourth quarter's result included a $4 million reversal of a valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. This compares to no adjustments to the valuation allowance in the third quarter of '09 and a $19 million addition to the allowance in the fourth quarter of 2008. As of the end of 2009, we have reversed substantially all of the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing revenue. Excluding the benefit from the MSR, other operating expenses also declined slightly.The operating efficiency ratio, which excludes security gains and losses, as well as merger-related items and intangible amortization was 52.7% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 55.2% in the linked quarter and 57% in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decline in efficiency ratio from the fourth quarter of 2008 is impressive, given that it reflects an $18 million increase in the FDIC assessment relative to the fourth quarter of 2008.Overall, credit -- let's turn to credit. Overall credit trends progressed as expected, with stable net charge-offs and a modest increase in non-performing assets. Non-accrual loans increased to $1.3 billion or 2.56% of loans at the end of the recent quarter, up $103 million from $1.2 billion or 2.35% of loans at the end of the previous quarter, an increase of about 8%. Substantially, all of the linked-quarter increase relates to a single commercial real estate loan for $104 million in Manhattan. This represents one of only two non-accrual loans of any significance in our greater New York City Metropolitan area. This particular loan is one I mentioned on the October earnings conference call and for which the recent appraisals indicate that the value of the property continues to be in excess of the loan balance. Despite the move to non-performing status, our outlook with regard to the resolution of this particular credit hasn't changed much. We continue to view the loss content as low and based on our original underwriting. Other non-performing assets, consisting of assets taken into foreclosure of defaulted loans, were $95 million as of December 31, compared with $85 million as of September 30.Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were $135 million, down from $141 million in the third quarter of 2009. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of loans were 1.03%, improved from 1.07% in the linked quarter. Charge-offs for commercial and industrial loans were $31 million in the fourth quarter, down from $71 million in the linked quarter. Net charge-offs for residential builder construction loans were $40 million for the recent quarter, compared with $13 million in the prior quarter. For the full year of 2009, net charge-offs on residential construction credits totaled $92 million, down from $100 million in 2008. Net charge-offs for all other commercial real estate loans were $11 million, compared with $8 million in the third quarter. Net charge-offs on residential real estate loans were $21 million in the fourth quarter, up just $1 million from the linked quarter and net charge-offs on consumer loans was $32 million in the fourth quarter compared with $30 million in the linked quarter. The provision for credit losses was $145 million for the fourth quarter, compared with $154 million in the linked quarter. Provision exceeded net charge-offs by $10 million and increased the allowance of loan losses to $878 million as of the end of 2009. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to legacy M&T loans, which exclude acquired loans in which there's already a credit mark, was up 1.83%, up from 1.81% in the linked quarter. As of December 31, 2008, that ratio was 1.61%.For the full year 2009, charge-offs were $514 million or 1.01% of average loans. We believe this represents the lowest rate among large regional and super regional banks. The loan-loss allowance as of December 31, 2009, was 1.7 times net charge-offs for the past year.Loans past due 90 days are still accruing with $208 million at the end of the recent quarter and included $193 million of loans guaranteed by government-related entities. Those figures were $183 million and $173 million respectively at the end of the sequential quarter. M&T's tangible common equity ratio was 5.13% at the end of the fourth quarter, an increase of 24 basis points from 4.89% at the end of the quarter. Unrealized, pre-tax losses on our available-for-sale investment portfolio were $293 million at the end of the quarter, compared with $313 million at the end of the third quarter and $806 million at the end of 2008.Turning to our outlook, as most of you know, we don't offer much in the way of earnings guidance, but we'll share our thoughts on some general trends. While the economy appears to be stable, the pace of recovery is slow. As a result, we expect both loan and overall earnings [indiscernible] growth to be in the low single digits. With the current trends being slightly negative, we'll need to see a turnaround in the current trends by the middle of the year in order to be able to achieve that growth. The demand for credit from customers, whether to build inventories or to expand plant capacity just isn't there yet, and when combined with the portfolios that we have that are in run-off mode, like parts of our indirect auto and asset growth, should be relatively modest. The strong inflows of deposits, particularly on the commercial side, are also an indication that businesses aren't ready to increase investment. As I mentioned earlier, the outlook for interest margin is for additional widening, as two fundamental trends remain in effect. Turnover in the loan portfolio, that is to, say, repayments and renewals is pricing in the benefit from today's wider credit spread, and the continued inflows of non-interest-bearing deposits I just mentioned are also a positive. We'd expect less impact, going forward, from the favorable repricing of time deposits.While credit costs remain elevated as the current credit cycle continues to play out, our inflows of loans into non-accruals status and our loss experience continues to be very manageable. Over the past several quarters, it appears that the consumer and the residential real estate credit terms [ph] have stabilized, but they're not improving yet. Fortunately, our exposure to these portfolios is relatively modest. We had the lowest charge-off rate among large regional and super regional banks in this year's third quarter. And given our underwriting culture, our habit of addressing problem areas proactively and the trends we've seen in our criticized loan portfolio, we believe we'll continue to report strong relative performance in 2010. As you know, we've always placed a priority on operating efficiency and will continue to do so. That said, as we plan for the future, the area of most uncertainty is in the rising cost of regulation.Finally, I'll remind you that normalized for unusual items, the first quarter's results have attended to be seasonally low for us, reflecting fewer days and higher expenses associated with FICA, accelerated recognition of option expense or equity expense and the 401(k) match. Of course, all of these projections are subject to a number of uncertainties, various assumptions regarding national economic growth, changes in interest rates, political event and other macro-economic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future. We'll now open up the call to questions, before which Christie will briefly review the instructions."

And the way you think about that is that when you think about the opportunities that we have on the distribution side, that just takes some time. So with seven months through the transaction, I would think that 2010, particularly for our retail folks, we'll be continuing to sort of work through the distribution-type issues, which at the end of the day, will result in additional expense savings. I think we're more than halfway through the expense savings. In fact, I know we're well more than halfway through the expense savings. On the revenue side, I think that the same is true there. The idea of sort of optimizing the work you do on the revenue side, particularly with sort of offering all your services to the new customers, I think that takes a little time. So we would hope that there's continued opportunity through the year 2010 on that side, as well. It's harder to identify it on the revenue side."

It's a tough question to answer because when you look at the renewals, if you think about what we do, it matters what year that they're coming from. So the thing that helps us most is that from, say, 2004 through the third quarter of 2007, we kept our commercial real estate portfolio relatively flat. So maybe the numbers in December will fall at something like $5.1 billion. By the time we got to September of '07 we're at about $5.3 billion, somewhere in that range. We've put some stuff on in the fourth quarter of '07. So the average life of our portfolio, my guess would be somewhere around five years, but if you think about what's coming to renewal next year, a lot of it would be things that were de-booked as far as long ago as 10 years. What's good about that is that they're not booked in anywhere near the roughly [ph] times. And so you have much more equity component in there. If you go back to 2004, if you think of our portfolio as a five-year portfolio, it would give you kind of an average, let's say an average life of five years. You're basically saying we must have booked $1 billion a year to do that. I would say in 2004, for example, we booked half of that because we just couldn't figure out what was going on. So on the renewals that we'll see this year, I would guess that the most of them are coming from things that were booked way before 2004. And we're still doing our work on the schedules. I think at some point we're going to publish that maturity schedule, but the more we get into it, in order to sort of give you something that gives you a sense of our portfolio, just sort of takes us a little bit of time. So that's on that sense. In terms of the portfolio, as I said the last call, we had a couple of credits that we sort of have -- what I would call in our watch list. One of them came into non-performing this quarter. There hasn't been anything new that we've seen through our portfolio reviews. And our portfolio reviews are pretty granular. I think the thing to think about is that because we're so granular and focused on getting ahead of the problem, and because the lead time is long, my sense is that to the extent that we have additional credits that go into non-performing, you're going to sort of hear about them so much before they happen. So no real change, we haven't seen any sort of additional problem credits and delinquencies in the New York City portfolio. Last thing I'll say on this, if I could, is that reflecting back on 2009, actually you learn a lot. Right? So we have no losses in the portfolio in 2009. And we actually had nothing rolling to non-performing but for this last credit that we just took this quarter. So when you look back at that, really, one of the most significant factors is not that actual credit wasn't weakening in New York City, it was that most, if not all of our sponsors, were willing to step up because they saw real value in the properties, and they're willing to kick in additional resources if they were needed in order to keep the project moving forward. So when we look at '09 and we look at our sponsors behave and what the result was, we felt pretty good about sort of where we are today."

But what is starting to happen now, and I kind of made that comment that while we didn't see the yield rise much on earnings assets, underlying, you do have this sort of trend where you're repricing your commercial loan book and even the rest of your book. And you saw on the C&I book that nine-basis-point rise in the yield, right? So I think what you're going to get is some shifting over to the asset side, where you're going to start to see some of that benefit from there. So that should that should pick up a little bit of the slack. And then I think that we've yet to see -- it's amazing -- we've yet to see that this trend in non-interest-bearing deposits keep growing. So my sense is that yes, you're probably right. I mean, if I were to guess again, I'd say, ""Yes, it's going to slow."" But going into the quarter, we didn't see much slowing. So my sense is it will be a little slower than we've seen on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Maybe we'll be somewhere -- I'd be surprised if we were above 3 85, 3 80 for the full year. I'd be surprised by that."

On the commercial side, what's interesting is that, we often get a lot of questions about our provisioning, our allowance, and the thing that you saw, this -- that you can't see even though the non-performers went up is that the classified loan book was down, probably, $200 million to $300 million underneath. So there was a bit of progress there. And I guess when you step back and look at that and do all the way back to mid-year. It means sort of the second half of the year, the rising pace of criticized or classified loans actually slowed dramatically, and it really wasn't much of an increase from June 30 to December 31. So all the trends are, I guess, from where we've been, positive right? But we also don't see a dramatic rebound in credit."

And I think for a 200 basis point gradual increase, we've got something like a 2% positive. It's about 2% positive. But having said that, that all depends on what you end up doing with your deposit rates, right? And so the way I like to think about it is that, if we get to a situation where rates are rising, it will either result in a higher net interest margin or it gives us a lot of powder in terms of pricing deposits in doing what we want to do there, right? Because we can make that neutral pretty easily. So I like to kind of think of it as we're sort of well-positioned for deposit growth or for actually arising margins in that event. I talked about the net interest margin over time, I think the thing that's going to work well for banks like M&T that do a lot of plain vanilla banking is that as long as the securitization markets are shut down, it means credit spreads are wider. And it takes a long time for sort of that repricing to roll through our books based on the terms of the credit that we have on our book. So I think it -- a lot of it depends on how long the securitization markets in Wall Street remain quiet. And quite frankly, that's just not come back yet. And it tends to be a help to regional banks. Will it be 10 basis points a quarter? I find that hard to believe. But I don't have much more insight than that on the actual magnitude."

But the actual losses that we'd experienced, breaks in the bonds is about $7 million. And what we're doing every quarter is we're projecting out when the mortgage and how the market is going to turn and what the delinquencies are likely to be. And because we haven't seen any change, really, in those trends, as time goes by, if you don't see a change, there's a probability that in the future you may have more losses, right?

Let me think about it, then I'll come back to that. The loan that we took to non-accrual this year, if you go back to what we did, it's a loan that we booked in 2007, so December of 2007. And we booked it as a bridge loan. And if you remember -- so we hadn't done much when the capital markets sort of shut down, the CMBS market has been shut down ever since. At that point in time, we saw a lot of folks coming to us with different credits. This is one of the ones that we did. And I think it's probably a pretty good case of sort of the culture of M&T. We actually booked that loan at a loan-to-value of between 43% to 50%. The range is dependent upon whether you want to do it just on the face value of the loan or on the cost to maintain it and improve it and get it ready for use over time, right? So when you look at it, we booked that loan of $100 million, we had more than $100 million of ownership equity in front of us in terms of loss content, right? So you hear a lot about commercial real estate being down by large percentages in New York City. Most of those are quoting things that are off of the 2007 high in terms of rent. But for us, we tend not to focus on sort of market value of current rent and we focus on pure historical value, in this case, it's the Class B space. And we intended to underwrite it relatively conservatively. So here we had an event where we're taking non-performing but because of the way we structured the deal, in our minds, the loss content is low, if any."

So having said that, the biggest issue is simply that when you look at places where we need to pay down credit or we sort of exited credits or had a couple of larger charge-offs, particularly the C&I, the one that we mentioned last quarter for $40 million, they were just concentrated in those portfolios. And so what you're getting is much more about payoffs. And then finally, much more lower utilization, right? Where people are just not making as much in the way of investments.

Well the issue there was everybody was lending and money was relatively cheap and so you couldn't get much growth. Now we're at the opposite end of the spectrum, and I think there's probably a lot of ground in the middle. And I think that for regional banks, it will be somewhat of a favorable environment relative to competition for some time.

Thank you for joining us on the call today. Based on the feedback we've received from some of you, we've added the tables in the back section of the release, which presents five quarter trends for the income statement",2374,"Thank you, Don, and welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Based on the feedback we've received from some of you, we've added the tables in the back section of the release, which presents five quarter trends for the income statement and the balance sheet. Hopefully, we've made your analysis a little easier. I know it's been a busy day for some of you so let's go through the highlights quickly and get to your questions.For the full year of 2009, diluted earnings per common share were $2.89 compared with $5.01 for 2008. Net income for 2009 was $380 million compared with $556 million in 2008. Included in our GAAP earnings for 2009 were after-tax merger-related expenses net of the gain from the Bradford acquisition of $36 million or $0.31 per common share. There are $2 million or $0.02 per share of merger-related expenses in 2008. Also included in GAAP earnings for the past year was after-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $39 million or $0.34 per common share. This compares with $41 million or $0.36 per share in 2008.Net operating income, which we believe helps investors understand the effect of acquisitions on our results, and which excludes the amortization of intangibles as well as merger-related items, was $455 million or $3.54 per common share for 2009 compared with $599 million or $5.39 per share in 2008. In accordance with the SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including intangible assets and equity.Turning to the fourth quarter, diluted earnings per common share were $1.04 in the fourth quarter of 2009, improved from $0.97 earned in the third quarter of 2009. Net income for the recent quarter was $137 million, up from $128 million in the linked quarter. After-tax merger-related expenses in the quarter relating to both Provident and Bradford Bank acquisitions were $4 million or $0.03 per common share in the recent quarter. This compares with net after-tax merger-related benefits of $9 million or $0.08 per common share in the third quarter of 2009, which came as a result of our acquisition of Bradford Bank. We expect no further merger-related expenses from either of the two acquisitions.The amortization of core deposits and other intangible assets amounted to $0.09 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2009 and in the linked quarter. Diluted net operating earnings per common share, excluding the amortization of core deposits and other intangibles, as well as merger related items that I just mentioned were $1.16 per common share for the recent quarter, up 18% from $0.98 in the linked quarter. M&T's net operating income for the quarter was $151 million, an increase of 17% from $129 million in the linked quarter.Next, I'd like to cover a few highlights from the balance sheet and the income statement. Intangible equivalent net interest income was $565 million for the fourth quarter, an 8% annualized increase from $553 million in the linked quarter and an increase of 15% from $491 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. The net interest margin continued to expand during the fourth quarter, averaging 3.71%, up from 3.61% in the third quarter. Approximately four basis points of the margin expansion came from repricing on consumer time deposits. An additional four basis points came from a shift in our funding mix, with higher non-maturity savings and  commercial DDA balances replacing time deposits and wholesale borrowing. The remainder of the expansion came from lower rates on wholesale borrowing. Notable during the quarter was a rise in yields on commercial & industrial loans, up nine basis points compared with the third quarter. Looking forward, we expect further widening of the margin for 2010. As for the balance sheet, average loans for the fourth quarter declined approximately $200 million from $52.3 billion, in the third quarter to $52.1 billion. Compared with this year's third quarter, changes in average loans by category were as follows. Commercial & industrial loans declined by 8%. Average loans to auto dealers to finance new model and year inventory grew by an annualized 18% as compared with the third quarter of 2009, while remaining C&I loans balances declined an annualized 10%. The decline in this latter category was exacerbated by pay-downs, charge-offs in both the third and fourth quarters and a reduction in certain non-core customer exposures. Commercial real estate loans and residential real estate loans each grew by an annualized 2%, and consumer loans declined by an annualized 3%. This includes a 14% annualized decline of indirect auto loans, reflecting continued run-off in the out-of-footprint part of that portfolio. This was partially offset by a modest mid-single-digit growth in our home equity lines of credit.Recently, we experienced low single-digit annualized growth in upstate New York, while experiencing low to mid-single-digit decline in the New York City metro region and in Pennsylvania. The decline in commercial and industrial loans from pay downs, charge-offs and exits were concentrated in the mid-Atlantic. Excluding those items, loans in the mid-Atlantic were relatively flat. We continue to see strong growth in core deposits. Average core customer deposits in the fourth quarter, which excludes foreign deposits and CDs over $100,000, as well as excluding any acquisition impact, increased by an annualized 15% from the third quarter, with growth coming in every geographic region. Also notable is the fact that the average non-interest-bearing deposits in the fourth quarter of '09 were up 50% compared with the fourth quarter of 2008. This also excludes the impact from acquisitions.Turning to non-interest income, excluding securities gains and losses and the third quarter $29 million gain from the Bradford acquisition, non-interest income was $300 million for the recent quarter compared with $296 million in the third quarter. Mortgage banking fees were $50 million for the quarter, up from $48 million in the linked quarter. This reflects the impact of wider gain-on-sale margins, partially offset by slightly lower origination volume. Service charges on deposit accounts were $127 million during the quarter, compared with $129 million in the linked quarter. The decline came primarily on the commercial side and was largely attributable to fewer processing days in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter.M&T's share of operating results of Bayview Lending Group or BLG was a loss of $11 million, unchanged from the linked quarter. BLG's recent performance was largely attributable to an increase in loan loss provisioning. Securities losses in the fourth quarter amounted to $34 million, predominantly reflecting an additional other-than-temporary impairment charges on our available-for-sale securities portfolio. This was down from $47 million of other-than-temporary impairment charges in the third quarter.Operating expenses were well-controlled during the recent quarter. Excluding merger-related expenses and the amortization of intangible assets, operating expenses were $455 million, down from $469 million in the third quarter of '09. The decline was primarily attributable to lower compensation expense, including core salaries, as well as incentive compensation. The fourth quarter's result included a $4 million reversal of the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing rights. This compares to no adjustments to the valuation allowance in the third quarter of '09 and a $19 million addition to the allowance in the fourth quarter of 2008. As of the end of 2009, we have reversed substantially all of the valuation allowance for capitalized residential mortgage servicing revenue. Excluding the benefit from the MSR, other operating expenses also declined slightly.The operating efficiency ratio, which excludes security gains and losses, as well as merger-related items and intangible amortization was 52.7% in the fourth quarter of 2009 compared with 55.2% in the linked quarter and 57% in the fourth quarter of 2008. The decline in efficiency ratio from the fourth quarter of 2008 is impressive, given that it reflects an $18 million increase in the FDIC assessment relative to the fourth quarter of 2008.Overall, credit -- let's turn to credit. Overall credit trends progressed as expected, with stable net charge-offs and a modest increase in non-performing assets. Non-accrual loans increased to $1.3 billion or 2.56% of loans at the end of the recent quarter, up $103 million from $1.2 billion or 2.35% of loans at the end of the previous quarter, an increase of about 8%. Substantially, all of the linked-quarter increase relates to a single commercial real estate loan for $104 million in Manhattan. This represents one of only two non-accrual loans of any significance in our greater New York City Metropolitan area. This particular loan is one I mentioned on the October earnings conference call and for which the recent appraisals indicate that the value of the property continues to be in excess of the loan balance. Despite the move to non-performing status, our outlook with regard to the resolution of this particular credit hasn't changed much. We continue to view the loss content as low and based on our original underwriting. Other non-performing assets, consisting of assets taken into foreclosure of defaulted loans, were $95 million as of December 31, compared with $85 million as of September 30.Net charge-offs for the fourth quarter were $135 million, down from $141 million in the third quarter of 2009. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of loans were 1.03%, improved from 1.07% in the linked quarter. Charge-offs for commercial and industrial loans were $31 million in the fourth quarter, down from $71 million in the linked quarter. Net charge-offs for residential builder construction loans were $40 million for the recent quarter, compared with $13 million in the prior quarter. For the full year of 2009, net charge-offs on residential construction credits totaled $92 million, down from $100 million in 2008. Net charge-offs for all other commercial real estate loans were $11 million, compared with $8 million in the third quarter. Net charge-offs on residential real estate loans were $21 million in the fourth quarter, up just $1 million from the linked quarter and net charge-offs on consumer loans was $32 million in the fourth quarter compared with $30 million in the linked quarter. The provision for credit losses was $145 million for the fourth quarter, compared with $154 million in the linked quarter. Provision exceeded net charge-offs by $10 million and increased the allowance for loan losses to $878 million as of the end of 2009. The ratio of allowance for credit losses to legacy M&T loans, which exclude acquired loans against which there's already a credit mark, was up 1.83%, up from 1.81% in the linked quarter. As of December 31, 2008, that ratio was 1.61%.For the full year 2009, charge-offs were $514 million or 1.01% of average loans. We believe this represents the lowest rate among large regional and super regional banks. The loan-loss allowance as of December 31, 2009, was 1.7 times net charge-offs for the past year.Loans past due 90 days are still accruing with $208 million at the end of the recent quarter and included $193 million of loans guaranteed by government-related entities. Those figures were $183 million and $173 million respectively at the end of the sequential quarter. M&T's tangible common equity ratio was 5.13% at the end of the fourth quarter, an increase of 24 basis points from 4.89% at the end of the quarter. Unrealized, pre-tax losses on our available-for-sale investment portfolio were $293 million at the end of the quarter, compared with $313 million at the end of the third quarter and $806 million at the end of 2008.Turning to our outlook, as most of you know, we don't offer much in the way of earnings guidance, but we'll share our thoughts on some general trends. While the economy appears to be stable, the pace of recovery is slow. As a result, we expect both loan and overall earnings, asset growth to be in the low single digits. With the current trends being slightly negative, we'll need to see a turnaround in the current trends by the middle of the year in order to be able to achieve that growth. The demand for credit from customers, whether to build inventories or to expand plant capacity just isn't there yet, and when combined with the portfolios that we have that are in run-off mode, like parts of our indirect auto and asset growth, should be relatively modest. The strong inflows of deposits, particularly on the commercial side, are also an indication that businesses aren't ready to increase investment. As I mentioned earlier, the outlook for interest margin is for additional widening, as two fundamental trends remain in effect. Turnover in the loan portfolio, that is to say, repayments and renewals is pricing in the benefit from today's wider credit spread, and the continued inflows of non-interest-bearing deposits I just mentioned are also a positive. We'd expect less impact, going forward, from the favorable repricing of time deposits.While credit costs remain elevated as the current credit cycle continues to play out, our inflows of loans into non-accruals status and our loss experience continues to be very manageable. Over the past several quarters, it appears that the consumer and the residential real estate credit trends have stabilized, but they're not improving yet. Fortunately, our exposure to these portfolios is relatively modest. We had the lowest charge-off rate among large regional and super regional banks in this year's third quarter. And given our underwriting culture, our habit of addressing problem areas proactively and the trends we've seen in our criticized loan portfolio, we believe we'll continue to report strong relative performance in 2010. As you know, we've always placed a priority on operating efficiency and will continue to do so. That said, as we plan for the future, the area of most uncertainty is in the rising cost of regulation.Finally, I'll remind you that normalized for unusual items, the first quarter's results have tended to be seasonally low for us, reflecting fewer days and higher expenses associated with FICA, accelerated recognition of option expense or equity expense and the 401(k) match. Of course, all of these projections are subject to a number of uncertainties, various assumptions regarding national economic growth, changes in interest rates, political event and other macro-economic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future. We'll now open up the call to questions, before which Christie will briefly review the instructions."

And the way you think about that is that when you think about the opportunities that we have on the distribution side, that just takes some time. So with seven months through the transaction, I would think that 2010, particularly for our retail folks, we'll be continuing to sort of work through the distribution-type issues, which at the end of the day, will result in additional expense savings. I think we're more than halfway through the expense savings. In fact, I know we're well more than halfway through the expense savings. On the revenue side, I think that the same is true there. The idea of sort of optimizing the work you do on the revenue side, particularly with sort of offering all your services to the new customers, I think that takes a little time. So we would hope that there's continued opportunity through the year 2010 on that side, as well. It's harder to identify it on the revenue side."

It's a tough question to answer because when you look at the renewals, if you think about what we do, it matters what year that they're coming from. So the thing that helps us most is that from, say,",615,"Well, let me start I think your questions in the order. It's a tough question to answer because when you look at the renewals, if you think about what we do, it matters what year that they're coming from. So the thing that helps us most is that from, say, 2004 through the third quarter of 2007, we kept our commercial real estate portfolio relatively flat. So maybe the numbers in December will fall at something like $5.1 billion. By the time we got to September of '07 we're at about $5.3 billion, somewhere in that range. We've put some stuff on in the fourth quarter of '07. So the average life of our portfolio, my guess would be somewhere around five years, but if you think about what's coming to renewal next year, a lot of it would be things that were de-booked as far as long ago as 10 years. What's good about that is that they're not booked in anywhere near the roughly [ph] times. And so you have much more equity component in there. If you go back to 2004, if you think of our portfolio as a five-year portfolio, it would give you kind of an average, let's say an average life of five years. You're basically saying we must have booked $1 billion a year to do that. I would say in 2004, for example, we booked half of that because we just couldn't figure out what was going on. So on the renewals that we'll see this year, I would guess that the most of them are coming from things that were booked way before 2004. And we're still doing our work on the schedules. I think at some point we're going to publish that maturity schedule, but the more we get into it, in order to sort of give you something that gives you a sense of our portfolio, just sort of takes us a little bit of time. So that's on that sense. In terms of the portfolio, as I said the last call, we had a couple of credits that we sort of have -- what I would call in our watch list. One of them came into non-performing this quarter. There hasn't been anything new that we've seen through our portfolio reviews. And our portfolio reviews are pretty granular. I think the thing to think about is that because we're so granular and focused on getting ahead of the problem, and because the lead time is long, my sense is that to the extent that we have additional credits that go into non-performing, you're going to sort of hear about them so much before they happen. So no real change, we haven't seen any sort of additional problem credits and delinquencies in the New York City portfolio. Last thing I'll say on this, if I could, is that reflecting back on 2009, actually you learn a lot. Right? So we have no losses in the portfolio in 2009. And we actually had nothing rolling to non-performing but for this last credit that we just took this quarter. So when you look back at that, really, one of the most significant factors is not that actual credit wasn't weakening in New York City, it was that most, if not all of our sponsors, were willing to step up because they saw real value in the properties, and they're willing to kick in additional resources if they were needed in order to keep the project moving forward. So when we look at '09 and we look at our sponsors behave and what the result was, we felt pretty good about sort of where we are today."

And you saw on the C&I book that nine-basis-point rise in the yield, right? So I think what you're going to get is some shifting over to the asset side, where you're going to start to see some of that benefit from there. So that should that should pick up a little bit of the slack. And then I think that we've yet to see -- it's amazing -- we've yet to see that this trend in non-interest-bearing deposits keep growing. So my sense is that yes, you're probably right. I mean, if I were to guess again, I'd say, ""Yes, it's going to slow."" But going into the quarter, we didn't see much slowing.

But having said that, that all depends on what you end up doing with your deposit rates, right?

Because we can make that neutral pretty easily. So I like to kind of think of it as we're sort of well-positioned for deposit growth or for actually arising margins in that event. I talked about the net interest margin over time, I think the thing that's going to work well for banks like M&T that do a lot of plain vanilla banking is that as long as the securitization markets are shut down, it means credit spreads are wider. And it takes a long time for sort of that repricing to roll through our books based on the terms of the credit that we have on our book. So I think it -- a lot of it depends on how long the securitization markets in Wall Street remain quiet. And quite frankly, that's just not come back yet. And it tends to be a help to regional banks. Will it be 10 basis points a quarter? I find that hard to believe. But I don't have much more insight than that on the actual magnitude."

But the actual losses that we'd experienced, breaks in the bonds is about $7 million.

Let me think about it, then I'll come back to that. The loan that we took to non-accrual this year, if you go back to what we did, it's a loan that we booked in 2007, so December of 2007. And we booked it as a bridge loan. And if you remember -- so we hadn't done much when the capital markets sort of shut down, the CMBS market has been shut down ever since. At that point in time, we saw a lot of folks coming to us with different credits. This is one of the ones that we did. And I think it's probably a pretty good case of sort of the culture of M&T. We actually booked that loan at a loan-to-value of between 43% to 50%. The range is dependent upon whether you want to do it just on the face value of the loan or on the cost to maintain it and improve it and get it ready for use over time, right? So when you look at it, we booked that loan of $100 million, we had more than $100 million of ownership equity in front of us in terms of loss content, right? So you hear a lot about commercial real estate being down by large percentages in New York City. Most of those are quoting things that are off of the 2007 high in terms of rent. But for us, we tend not to focus on sort of market value of current rent and we focus on pure historical value, in this case, it's the Class B space. And we intended to underwrite it relatively conservatively. So here we had an event where we're taking non-performing but because of the way we structured the deal, in our minds, the loss content is low, if any."

So there's still a lot of help up here in Upstate New York and we never saw the sort of big problems here. So you got a firm and a healthy company. So having said that, the biggest issue is simply that when you look at places where we need to pay down credit or we sort of exited credits or had a couple of larger charge-offs, particularly the C&I, the one that we mentioned last quarter for $40 million, they were just concentrated in those portfolios. And so what you're getting is much more about payoffs. And then finally, much more lower utilization, right? Where people are just not making as much in the way of investments. If you were to look at commitments, we'll continue to book new commitments and we're growing. But people are just not drawing down on them. So I would say that there's probably not that much of a difference in the two portfolios. And I would say if you were to look at it on raw commitments, that my guess would be that we are actually probably doing more new raw commitments in the Maryland area."

272285,100753564,56460,"M&T Bank Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-19-2010",2010-04-19,"Earnings Calls","M&T Bank Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Don, and welcome everyone.  Thank you for joining us on the call today.  Some of you may have noticed that we've departed from a long tradition today by announcing first quarter earnings on the day before our annual meeting of stockholders inst",2097,"Thank you, Don, and welcome everyone.  Thank you for joining us on the call today.  Some of you may have noticed that we've departed from a long tradition today by announcing first quarter earnings on the day before our annual meeting of stockholders instead of on the same day.  Hopefully this change will allow investors to assimilate our results in advance of the meeting instead of during the meeting.  So, let's get to the highlights.
The first quarter of 2010 diluted earnings per common share were $1.15, up from $1.04 in the previous quarter and $0.49 in the first quarter of 2009.  Net income for the recent quarter was $151¬†million compared with $137¬†million in the linked quarter and $64¬†million in last year's first quarter.  
Included in our GAAP earnings for this year's first quarter was after-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $10¬†million or $0.08 per common share.  This compares with $10¬†million or $0.09 per common share in the linked quarter and $9¬†million or $0.09 per common share in the yearago quarter.  There were no merger-related expenses in the first quarter of 2010, but we did incur after-tax merger related expenses of $4¬†million or $0.03 per common share in the fourth quarter of 2009 and $1¬†million or $0.01 per common share in last year's first quarter.  
Net operating income, which excludes the amortization of intangibles as well as merger-related items, was $161¬†million or $1.23 per common share for the first quarter of 2010 compared with $151¬†million or $1.16 per common share in the linked quarter and $75¬†million or $0.59 per common share in last year's first quarter.
In accordance with SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contained a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results including tangible assets and equity.  Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement, tangible equivalent net interest income was $562¬†million for the first quarter, down from $565¬†million in the linked quarter and up 24% from $453¬†million in the first quarter of 2009.
The linked quarter decline relates to the lower day count in the first quarter as compared with the fourth.  The net interest margin continued to expand during the first quarter, rising to 3.78% from 3.71% in the fourth quarter of 2009 and up significantly from 3.19% in last year's first quarter.  
Taking a simple view, the improvement in the margin from the fourth quarter can be attributed to the following factors.  Approximately 3 basis points of the margin expansion came from repricing on consumer time deposits.  An additional 3 basis points came as a result of the reduced day count compared with last quarter.  The remainder of the expansion came from a shift in our funding mix with a higher nonmaturity savings and DDA balances replacing time deposits.
From a broader perspective, credit spends on new and renewed commitments remain higher than we've seen over the past several years.  As a result, despite the drop in funding rates, asset yields have remained relatively stable.  Looking forward, our view of the margin remains consistent with our remarks on the January conference call, which is to say we'd expect the margin to be relatively stable with only a slight bias to the upside for the remainder of the year.
As for the balance sheet, average earnings assets declined by $120¬†million or less than 1% annualized as compared with the fourth quarter of 2009.  Earnings assets were not materially impacted by our adoption of new accounting requirements related to off balance sheet entities at the beginning of 2010.  The result was the addition of approximately $416¬†million of resident mortgage loans partially offset by a $355¬†million decline in investment securities.  
After adjusting for the impact from the adoption of the new accounting rules, average loans for the first quarter declined by an annualized 4% as compared with last year's fourth quarter.  The change in average loans for each of the loan categories as compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 were as follows.  
Commercial and industrial loans declined an annualized 4%.  Commercial real estate loans declined an annualized 2%.  Residential real estate loans, after adjusting for the new accounting rules, declined by an annualized 10%, primarily the result of lower mortgage loans held for sale.  Consumer loans declined an annualized 7% driven by a lower level of indirect auto loans reflecting both the continued runoff in the off footprint part of that portfolio as well as our decision to slow originations within our footprint in response to very aggressive price competition.  
For some time, we've been discussing several loan portfolios that we were not looking to grow and which, by design, are being allowed to run off.  These include obviously residential construction, the Alt-A mortgage portfolio, and, as I just mentioned, our indirect portfolio, particularly the portion outside of our core markets.  Excluding these portfolios as well as the impacts of the accounting change I referenced, average loans declined just 1% annualized.  
This compares quite favorably with the trends experienced nationally as seen through the Fed's H8 releases which indicate that loans industry-wide declined about 7% in the first quarter.  Thus it appears that we are outpacing the broader economy, and we are likely gaining share within some of our core markets.
We continue to see growth in core deposits, but at a somewhat lower pace than last year.  Average customer deposits in the first quarter, which exclude foreign deposits and CDs over $100,000, increased by an annualized 6% from the fourth quarter and included a very healthy 11% annualized growth in demand deposits.
Turning to noninterest income, noninterest income was $258¬†million for the recent quarter and included $26¬†million of securities losses.  This compares with $266¬†million in the linked quarter which included $34¬†million of securities losses.  In both periods, the securities losses primarily reflected additional other than temporary impairment charges on our available for sale securities portfolio relating to privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities.
Mortgage banking fees were $41¬†million for the quarter compared with $50¬†million in the linked quarter.  Origination volumes were lower and, at the same time, we experienced a slight decline in the gain on sale margins.  That said, gain on sale margins remained wide compared to where they've been historically.
Service charges on deposit accounts were $120¬†million during the quarter compared with $127¬†million in the linked quarter.  The decline came primarily on the consumer side and was attributable to a seasonal decline in customer transaction volumes as well as fewer processing days in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter.
M&T share of the operating results of Bayview Lending Group, or BLG, was a loss of $5.7¬†million compared to a loss of $10.6¬†million in the linked quarter.  
Turning to expenses, operating expenses which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and merger-related expenses were $473¬†million compared with $455¬†million in the linked quarter.
This quarter's results reflect our usually seasonally high salary and benefits cost which includes accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement eligible employees as well as higher FICA expense, unemployment insurance, and expenses related to our 401K match.  In aggregate, the expense from these items was some $21¬†million higher than in the linked quarter.  This is consistent with our experience in each of the past four years.
The quarter's results include no material change in the valuation allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights compared with a $4¬†million reversal from the valuation allowance in last year's fourth quarter.  
All other categories of expense were well controlled, essentially unchanged from the linked quarter.  The operating efficiency ratio which excludes securities gains or losses as well as merger-related items and intangible amortization was 55.9% in the first quarter of 2010 compared with 52.7% in the linked quarter.  It was improved by 2.8 percentage points from last year's first quarter.
Next let's turn to credit.  Overall credit trends were positive.  Nonaccrual loans increased to $1.34¬†billion or 2.6% of total loans at the end of the recent quarter, up just $8¬†million from $1.33¬†billion or 2.56% of loans at the end of the previous quarter, an increase of less than 1%.
Loans acquired in connection with the Provident and Bradford transactions classified as nonaccrual and which have already been marked to fair value increased by $35¬†million, while nonaccrual loans associated with the legacy M&T portfolio declined by $26¬†million.
Other nonperforming assets consisting of assets taken in foreclosure or defaulted loans were $95¬†million as of March¬†31, unchanged from December¬†31 and down $5¬†million from last year's first quarter.
Net chargeoffs for the quarter were $95¬†million, down from $135¬†million in the fourth quarter of 2009.  Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 74 basis points, improved from 1.03% in the linked quarter.
Net charge-offs for commercial and industrial loans were $18¬†million in the first quarter, down from $31¬†million in the linked quarter.  Net charge-offs for residential builder construction loans were $22¬†million for the recent quarter compared with $40¬†million in the previous quarter.  Net charge-offs for all other commercial real estate loans were $8¬†million, down from $11¬†million in the fourth quarter.  
Net charge-offs on residential real estate loans were $15¬†million in the first quarter, down from $21¬†million in the linked quarter.  Net charge-offs on consumer loans were $31¬†million in the first quarter compared with $32¬†million in the linked quarter.
Provision for credit losses was $105¬†million for the first quarter compared with $145¬†million in the linked quarter.  The allowance for loan losses increased to $891¬†million at the end of the first quarter.  The ratio of allowance for credit losses to legacy M&T loans, which excludes acquired loans against which there is a credit mark, was 1.86%, up 3 basis points from 1.83% in the linked quarter.
The loan loss allowance as of March¬†31, 2010, was 2.3 times annualized net charge-offs for the recent quarter, up from 1.7 times net charge-offs for the full year of 2009.  Put another way, the allowance at the end of March was sufficient to absorb more than 2 years of net charge-offs at our current annualized loss rate.
We disclosed loans past due 90 days still accruing separately from nonaccrual loans because they are deemed to be well secured and in the process of collection which is to say there is minimal risk of principal loss.  In our case, that's particularly true.  Although loans 90 days past due were $203¬†million at the end of the recent quarter, they included $195¬†million of loans guaranteed by government-related entities.  Those figures were $208¬†million and $193¬†million, respectively, at the end of last year.
M&T's tangible common equity ratio was 5.43% at the end of the first quarter, an increase of 30 basis points from 5.13% at the end of December.  The majority of the improvement was the result of earnings well in excess of dividends combined with a flattish balance sheet.  An additional 10 basis points came from the continued improvement in unrealized losses on our securities portfolio.  Recall that since unrealized losses on securities are already deducted from capital, the other than temporary impairment charges in our income statement do not result in further reductions of capital.
Turning to our outlook, we have clearly seen a number of signs that the economy is improving across most of our business segments; but the pace of economic recovery is slow as seen in the decline in loan activity being reported at a national level.  We've heard anecdotal evidence that manufacturers are starting to build inventories, but that doesn't appear to be reflected in the numbers yet; and we will need to see a turnaround in the second half of 2010 to realize loan growth for the full year.
Our outlook for net interest margin is unchanged which is to say wider for 2010 than for 2009.  We are pleased with the consistent credit results that we have reported over the past several quarters.  That is particularly true for these first quarter figures.  The continued decline in criticized loans is also encouraging.  Which respect to future quarters, it's important to remind you that credit performance can be lumpy from quarter to quarter.
The uptick in the efficiency ratio this quarter as compared with the linked quarter was entirely related to seasonal factors and, in fact, improved nicely from last year's first quarter which contained the same seasonal factors.  We remain focused on improving that ratio as we move forward.  
Of course, all of these projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events, and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.  We will now open up to call to questions.

Our desire is to pay it back, but really there are sort of two things that we're looking to in the future.  Obviously, we're very pleased with our first quarter results; but problem loans and nonperforming assets still remain pretty high in the industry.  We'd like to see more evidence that there's a turn in the economy.  
Two, we said for some time that it would be helpful to have some clarity as to where things are going to go on the regulatory front before we make changes to our capital structure.  Why I think we have to ability to do that is because we actually are growing capital.  We're doing it sort of by generating it.  As long as we continue to do that, I think that helps us.  But our view would be that if we're going to change our capital structure, we would like to do it once.  That's the efficient way to do it.  And to do that, we have to sort of get a little bit more clarity around what some of the pending regulation will be.  I would expect that's not all that far off on the horizon.

Really the issue there is that to the extent that there's not a lot of improvement in the economy, then as time passes, you get further into it.  We've not actually seen a principal writedown on any of those securities.  
As the housing prices have stabled, the thing that really hasn't changed until recently is the roll rate.  On the 30-day delinquent roll rate, they're rolling from 30 to 60.  Having said that, in the last few days we've begun to see in our portfolio that we've had nice improvements in the 30-day delinquencies.

As we've talked about, we continue to manage that portfolio very closely doing numerous reviews.  I think what you see is that when we look at the quarter, we did have a couple, beyond what I have mentioned, a couple of, a few more loans that rolled into our criticized loan catalog.  That catalog, remember, is on a scale of 1 to 15 is our loan grades.  When something goes from 10 to 11, it rolls into the catalog.  
There were a few, but at the end of the day I think what the broader issue seems to be is that the number of things that, dare I say, are being teed up and actually being cured on the C&I side is actually a much greater issue than the number of, than any weakness we might see in CRE.  In fact, it seems to be dwarfing the issue.  
One of the things that we did do this quarter is we finished, our credit guys finished, the base work for our stress testing work.  What you can kind of see in the portfolio when you look at all of our real estate across all of our footprints, take out the owner occupied, which is really C&I, take out the construction, which we kind of look at a little bit separately, and you've got just under $10¬†billion there.  
I would say the loan to values of that book are in the low 60s.  I would say debt service coverage is somewhere almost as high as 2.5%.  So, at the end of the day, the way we underwrote that portfolio has a lot to do with sort of why it's performing pretty well.  Even as we see problems that sort of roll into the portfolio in terms of payment problems, we continue to think that the loss content is on the lower side.¬†¬†Not a lot of new news.

Closed volume went from $1.25¬†billion down to less than a billion, so 25% or so, 22% drop.  I think that's going to just move along with what happens with rates and volume.

But in terms of the second part of your question, particularly in New York City, at origination we have always done stress tests and look at what the credit can absorb in terms of rate shocks, and we do that during the underwriting.  
What we've most recently done, think of it this way, we have got a very robust process that is all geared towards identifying problems very quickly.  It's based on an RM coming to us and saying something doesn't seem quite right or I am a little bit concerned here.  It's tied to our grading system.  
What we've done with our stress tests is, on top of all of that process, we have said let's stress for drop in values by each community.  I am not sure if we did rate.  We did repayment risk, maturity risk, and valuation drops.  We also did revenue drops at the property.  Then what we do is we see if anything falls through the cracks in these screens, and then we go back and look if we've already seen it or not.  In the cases where new things crop up, then we'll go and do a specific dive on that property.  We're always doing a fair amount of stress tests, but think of it as a risk management tool that backs up our overall risk capture process.
With respect to the portfolio, that's a tough question.  I have it on total loans, but I don't think that's what you are looking for.

Start there with that knowledge, what we refer to is particularly is in the commodity like spaces with indirect auto, where, how do I say this?  People aren't coming to us because of the M&T name.  It's more the price when they go to the dealer.  That's where we've actually seen the most competitiveness.  I think because it's a two-year relatively very creditworthy asset, and it's easy for people to go after.  We've seen price competition there.
I will point out that what I noticed that quarter in our commercial book, we keep pretty robust data on a summary of everything that goes to the committee in the quarter.  When you look at it, the number of deals that went to our credit committee that quarter versus last really didn't change much.  It was down a couple of deals.  The total commitments that went to the committee was maybe up 5%.  Even though there are fewer borrowers, they were borrowing a little bit more.  And if you were to look at the margin on those, it did drop about 11 basis points, the sort of new origination margin.  
What struck me is we also look at based on the grade and the structure and the collateral content of the deal.  We have a risk-adjusted measure.  The risk adjusted return on these deals went up.  What that means is that the people we were extended credit to this quarter were structurally more sound and better rated credit on the whole.  That's probably why the margin was a little bit lighter.  I think you're seeing that because my guess is that there are very few people borrowing, and everybody is chasing those same individuals.  It's a bit anecdotal, but that's my guess.

That part of the business, the commercial part of the business is much more a factor of what's happening with rates in my mind.  I think people, because they've not yet started investing, they're holding on to a lot of cash.  
But on top of that, much of the money that at one point was housed in the money fund has actually moved back into the bank.  The people are not able to sort of get more than one basis point in the money fund.  I think we'll see as part of the overall turn, if the economy turns, we'll begin to see, that's where you will begin to see it.  You will begin to see it in behavior on commercial balances and movements there.
On the other side, again there's nothing really all that unusual in what we've seen so far in the consumer side.  It's just too early to tell what the impact will be on the NSF thing because it depends on the behavior of the consumer, whether they decide to opt in or out.  
Over the long term, it's not something that I worry about in the sense it's an industry-wide thing.  Our job over the next two quarters is to educate our workforce so that they can educate the consumer and that we can have good customer service through this pretty big change in the industry.

Thank you for joining us on the call today.

Thank you for joining us on the call today. Some of you may have noticed that we've departed from a long tradition today by announcing first quarter earnings on the day before our annual meeting of stockholders instead of on the same day. Hopefully, this change will allow investors to assimilate our results in advance of the meeting instead of during the meeting. So let's get to the highlights.
The first quarter of 2010, diluted earnings per common share were $1.15, up from $1.04 in the previous quarter and $0.49 in the first quarter of 2009. Net income for the recent quarter was $151 million compared with $137 million in the link quarter and $64 million in last year's first quarter. Included in our GAAP earnings for this year's first quarter was after-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $10 million, or $0.08 per common share. This compares with $10 million or $0.09 per common share in the link quarter and $9 million or $0.09 per common share in the year-ago quarter. There were no merger-related expenses in the first quarter of 2010, but we did incur after-tax merger-related expenses of $4 million or $0.03 per common share in the fourth quarter of '09 and $1 million or $0.01 per common share in last year's first quarter. 
Net operating income, which excludes the amortization of intangibles as well as the merger-related items, was $161 million or $1.23 per common share for the first quarter of 2010, compared with $151 million or $1.16 per common share in the link quarter and $75 million or $0.59 per common share in last year's first quarter.
In accordance with SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. 
Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement, tangible-equivalent net interest income was $562 million for the first quarter, down from $565 million in the link quarter and up 24% from $453 million in the first quarter of 2009. The link quarter decline relates to the lower day count in the first quarter as compared with the fourth. The net interest margin continued to expand during the first quarter, rising to 3.78% from 3.71% in the fourth quarter of '09 and up significantly from 3.19% in last year's first quarter. 
Taking a simple view, the improvement in the margin from the fourth quarter can be attributed to the following factors: approximately three basis points of the margin expansion came from re-pricing on consumer time deposits; an additional three basis points came as a result of the reduced day count compared with last quarter; and the remainder of the expansion came from a shift in our funding mix with a higher non-maturity savings and DDA balances replacing time deposits. 
From a broader perspective, credit spreads on new and renewed commitments remain higher than we've seen over the past several years. And as a result, despite the drop in funding rates, asset yields have remained relatively stable. 
Looking forward, our view of the margin remains consistent with our remarks on the January conference call, which is to say we'd expect the margin to be relatively stable, with only a slight bias to the upside for the remainder of the year. 
As for the balance sheet, average earnings assets declined by $120 million or less than 1% annualized as compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. Earnings assets were not materially impacted by our adoption of new accounting requirements related to off-balance-sheet entities at the beginning of 2010. The result was the addition of approximately $416 million of residential mortgage loans, partially offset by a $355 million decline in investment securities. 
After adjusting for the impact from the adoption of the new accounting rules, average loans for the first quarter declined by an annualized 4% as compared with last year's fourth quarter. The change in average loans for each of the loan categories as compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 were as follows. Commercial & industrial loans declined an annualized 4%. Commercial real estate loans declined an annualized 2%, while residential real estate loans, after adjusting for the new accounting rules, declined by an annualized 10%, primarily the result of lower mortgage loans held for sale. Consumer loans declined an annualized 7%, driven by a lower level of indirect auto loans, reflecting both the continued run-off in the out-of-footprint part of that portfolio, as well as our decision to slow originations within our footprint in response to very aggressive price competition. 
For some time, we've been discussing several loan portfolios that we were not looking to grow and which, by design, are being allowed to run off. These include, obviously, residential construction, the Alt-A mortgage portfolio and as I just mentioned, our indirect portfolio, particularly the portion outside of our core markets. Excluding these portfolios, as well as the impact from the accounting change I referenced, average loans declined just 1% annualized. This compares quite favorably with the trends experienced nationally as seen through the Fed‚Äôs H.8 releases, which indicate that loans industry-wide declined about 7% in the first quarter. Thus, it appears that we are outpacing the broader economy and we are likely gaining share within some of our core markets. 
We continue to see growth in core deposits but at a somewhat slower pace than last year. Average core customer deposits in the first quarter, which excludes foreign deposits and CDs over $100,000, increased by an annualized 6% from the fourth quarter and included a very healthy 11% annualized growth in demand deposits.
Turning to non-interest income, non-interest income was $258 million for the recent quarter and included $26 million of securities losses. This compares with $266 million in the link quarter, which included $34 million of securities losses. In both periods, the securities losses primarily reflected additional other-than-temporary impairment charges on our available-for-sale securities portfolio, relating to privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities. 
Mortgage banking fees were $41 million for the quarter, compared with $58 million [ph] in the link quarter. Origination volumes were lower, and at the same time, we experienced a slight decline and a gain on sale margin. That said, gain on sale margins remained wide, compared to where they‚Äôve been historically.
Service charges on deposit accounts were $120 million during the quarter, compared with $127 million in the link quarter. The decline came primarily on the consumer side and was attributable to a seasonal decline in customer transaction volumes, as well as fewer processing days in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter. 
M&T‚Äôs share of the operating results of Bayview Lending Group, or BLG, was a loss of $5.7 million, compared to a loss of $10.6 million in the link quarter.
Turning to expenses, operating expenses, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and merger-related expenses, were $473 million, compared with $455 million in the link quarter. This quarter's results reflect our usually seasonally high salary and benefit costs, which include accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement-eligible employees, as well as higher FICA expense on employment insurance and expenses related to our 401(k) match. In aggregate, the expense from these items was some $21 million higher than in the link quarter, and this is consistent with our experience in each of the past four years. 
The quarter's results include no material change in the valuation allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights, compared with a $4 million reversal from the valuation allowance in last year's fourth quarter. All other categories of expense were well-controlled, essentially unchanged from the link quarter. 
The operating efficiency ratio, which excluded securities gains or losses, as well as merger-related items and intangible amortization, was 55.9% in the first quarter of 2010, compared with 52.7% in the link quarter. It was improved by 2.8 percentage points from last year's first quarter.
Next, let's turn to credit. Overall, credit trends were positive. Non-accrual loans increased to $1.34 billion or 2.6% of total loans at the end of the recent quarter, up just $8 million from $1.33 billion or 2.56% of loans at the end of the previous quarter, an increase of less than 1%. Loans acquired in connection with the Provident and Bradford transactions classified as non-accrual and which have already been marked to fair value, increased by $35 million, while non-accrual loans associated with the legacy M&T portfolio declined by $26 million. 
Other non-performing assets, consisting of assets taken in foreclosure or defaulted loans, were $95 million as of March 31, unchanged from December 31, and down $5 million from last year's first quarter. 
Net charge-offs for the quarter were $95 million, down from $135 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 74 basis points, improved from 1.03% in the link quarter. Net charge-offs for commercial and industrial loans were $18 million in the first quarter, down from $31 million in the link quarter. Net charge-offs for residential builder construction loans were $22 million for the recent quarter, compared with $40 million in the previous quarter. Net charge-offs for all other commercial real estate loans were $8 million, down from $11 million in the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs on residential real estate loans were $15 million in the first quarter, down from $21 million in the link quarter. And net charge-offs on consumer loans were $31 million in the first quarter compared with $32 million in the link quarter. 
Provision for credit losses was $105 million for the first quarter, compared with $145 million in the link quarter. The allowance for loan losses increased to $891 million at the end of the first quarter. The ratio of allowance to credit -- the allowance for credit losses to legacy M&T loans, which excludes acquired loans against which there is a credit mark, was 1.86%, up three basis points from 1.83% in the link quarter. The loan-loss allowance as of March 31, 2010, was 2.3x annualized net charge-offs for the recent quarter, up from 1.7x net charge-offs for the full year of 2009. Put another way, the allowance at the end of March was sufficient to absorb more than two years of net charge-offs at our current annualized loss rate. 
We disclosed loans past due 90 days but still accruing separately from non-accrual loans, because they are deemed to be well-secured and in the process of collection, which is to say, there is minimal risk of principal loss. In our case, that's particularly true. Although loans 90 days past due were $203 million at the end of the recent quarter, they included $195 million of loans guaranteed by government-related entities. Those figures were $208 million and $193 million, respectively, at the end of last year.
M&T's tangible common equity ratio was 5.43% at the end of first the quarter, an increase of 30 basis points from 5.13% at the end of December. The majority of the improvement was a result of earnings well in excess of dividends, combined with a flattish balance sheet. An additional 10 basis points came from the continued improvement in unrealized losses on our securities portfolio. Recall that since unrealized losses on securities are already deducted from capital, the other-than-temporary impairment charges in our income statement did not result in further reductions of capital.
Turning to our outlook, we've seen clearly seen a number of signs that the economy's improving across most of our business segments. But the pace of economic recovery is slow, as seen in the decline in loan activity being reported at a national level. We've heard anecdotal evidence that manufacturers are starting to build inventories, but that doesn't appear to be reflected in the numbers yet and we‚Äôll need to see a turnaround in the second half of 2010 to realize loan growth for the full year. 
Our outlook for net interest margin is unchanged, which is to say, wider for 2010 than for 2009. And we are pleased with the consistent credit results that we have reported over the past several quarters, and that is particularly true for these first quarter figures. The continued decline in criticized loans is also encouraging. With respect to future quarters, it's important to remind you that credit performance can be lumpy from quarter to quarter. 
The uptick in the efficiency ratio this quarter, as compared with the link quarter, was entirely related to seasonal factors and, in fact, improved nicely from last year's first quarter, which contains the same seasonal factors. We remain focused on improving that ratio as we move forward. 
Of course, all of these projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national, regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future. 
We'll now open up the call to questions, before which Paula will briefly review the instructions."

But really, there are sort of two things that we're looking to in the future. Obviously, we're very pleased with our first quarter results, but problem loans and the non-performing assets still remain pretty high in the industry, and so we'd like to see more evidence that there‚Äôs a turn in the economy. And two, we've said for some time that it would be helpful to have some clarity as to where things are going to go on the regulatory front before we make changes to our capital structure. Why we have that -- I think we have that ability to do that, is because we actually are growing capital. We're doing it sort of by generating it, right? And so as long as we continue to do that, I think that helps us. But our view would be that if we're going to change our capital structure, we'd like to do it once. That's the efficient way to do it, and then to do that, we have to sort of feel a little bit -- get a little bit more clarity around what some of the pending regulation will be. So I would expect that that‚Äôs not all that far off on the horizon."

And really, the issue there is that to the extent that there's not a lot of improvement in the economy, then as time passes, you get further into it. We've not actually seen a principal write-down on any of those securities. As the housing prices have stabled, the thing that really hasn't changed until recently is the roll rate on -- on 30-day delinquent roll rate rolling from 30 to 60. But having said that, in the last few days, we've begun to see in our portfolio that we've had nice improvements in the 30-day delinquency. So I would guess what needs to happen is you need to see a change in the roll rate in a positive direction, and you need to see unemployment -- we need to actually see some employment, right, that affects the consumer in a positive way."

As we've talked about, we continue to manage that portfolio very closely, doing numerous reviews. And I think what you see is that when we look at the quarter, we did have a couple of -- beyond what I've mentioned, a few more loans that rolled into our criticized loan catalog, and that catalog, remember, is on a scale of one to 15 as our loan grade. So when something goes from 10 to 11, it rolls into the catalog. So there were a few. But at the end of the day, I think what the broader issue seems to be is that the number of things that are, dare I say, sort of ‚Äì that are being teed up and actually being cured on the C&I side is actually a much greater issue than the number of -- than any weakness we might see in CRE. In fact, it seems to be dwarfing the issue. 
One of the things that we did do this quarter is we finished in -- our credit guys finished the base work for our stress testing work. And what you can kind of see in the portfolio, when you look at all of our real estate across all of our footprint -- so take out the owner-occupied, which is really C&I, take out the construction, which we kind of look at a little bit separately, and you've got just under $10 billion there. I would say the loan-to-values of that book are in the low 60s, and I would say that debt service coverage is somewhere almost as high as 2 1/2%, right? So at the end of the day, the way we underwrote that portfolio has a lot to do with sort of why it's performing pretty well. And even as we see problems that sort of roll into the portfolio in terms of payment problems, we continue to think that the loss content is on the lower side. So not a lot of new news."

And every time we originate a mortgage, we're going to set aside a reserve, a small reserve on the chance that that could be repurchased.‚Äù So we have those two components.

On the mortgage, really much of the decline in our mortgage was driven by lower volume. When you take a look at like applications went from $2 billion down to $1.7 billion in the quarter. Closed volumes went from $1.25 billion, down to less than $1 billion, right? So 22% drop. So I think that's going to just move along with what happens with rates and volumes.

But in terms of the second part of your question, particularly in New York City, we have origination. We've always done stress tests and looking at what the credit can absorb in terms of rate shocks, and we do that during the underwriting. What we've most recently done -- think of it this way, we've got a very robust process that is all geared towards identifying problems very quickly. And it's based on an RM coming to us and saying, ‚ÄúJeez, something doesn't seem quite right, or I'm a little bit concerned here, tied to our grading system.‚Äù What we've done with our stress test is we‚Äôve -- on top of all that process, we‚Äôve said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs stress for drop in values by each community -- let's do‚Äù -- I'm not sure if we did rate. We did repayment risk, maturity risk and valuation drops. And, I‚Äôm sorry, we also did revenue drops at the property. And then what we do is if we see anything falls through the cracks in those screens, and then we go back and look if we've already seen it or not. In the cases where new things crop up, then we‚Äôll go and do a specific dive on that property. So we're always doing a fair amount of stress tests, but it‚Äôs really -- think of it as a risk management tool that backs up our overall risk capture process. 
With respect to the portfolio, I mean, that's a tough question. I have it on total loans, but I don't think that's what you're looking for."

So if you sort of start there with that knowledge, what we've referred to is -- particularly is in the commodity-like spaces with indirect auto, where, how do I say this, people aren‚Äôt coming to us because of it‚Äôs the M&T name. It‚Äôs more the price when they go to the dealer. That's where we've actually seen the most competitiveness. I think because it's a two-year relatively very creditworthy asset, and it's easy for people to go after. So we've seen price competition there. I will point out that what I noticed this quarter in our commercial book, we keep pretty robust data on a summary of everything that goes to committee in the quarter. And when you look at it, the number of deals that went to our credit committee this quarter versus last really didn't change much. It was down a couple of deals. The total commitments that went to the committee was maybe up 5%. So even though there were fewer borrowers, they were borrowing a little bit more. And if you were to look at the margin on those, it did drop about 11 basis points to sort of new origination margin. But what struck me is we also look at, based on the grade and the structure and the collateral content of the deal, we have a risk-adjusted measure. And the risk-adjusted return on those deals went up. So what that means is that the people that we were extending credit to this quarter were structurally more sound and better rated credits on the whole, and that's probably why the margin was a little bit lighter. And I think you're seeing that because my guess is that there are very few people borrowing, and everybody is chasing those same individuals. But it's a big anecdotal, but that's my guess."

And so, all of the sort of business side of things are not affected by that in any way, shape or form. And that part of the business, the commercial part of the business, is much more a factor of what's happening with rates in my mind. I think people, because they've not yet started investing, they're holding on to a lot of cash, but on top of that, much of the money that at one point in time was housed in the money funds, have actually moved back into the bank, because they‚Äôre -- the people are not able to sort of get more than one basis point in the money fund. So I think we'll see, as part of the overall turn, if the economy turns, we'll begin to see -- that's where you'll begin to see it, right? You‚Äôll begin to see it in behavior on commercial balances and movements there. On the other side, again, there's nothing really all that unusual in what we've seen so far on the consumer side. And it's just too early to tell what the impact will be on the NSF thing, because it depends on the behavior of the consumer, just whether they decide to opt in or out. Over the long term, it's not something that I worry about because, I mean, in the sense -- it's an industry-wide thing. Our job is to -- over the next two quarters is to educate our workforce so that they can educate the consumer and that we can have good customer service through this pretty big change in the industry.

Thank you for joining us on the call today. Some of you may have noticed that we've departed from a long tradition today by announcing first quarter earnings on the day before our annual meeting of stockholders instea",2160,"Thank you, Don, and welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. Some of you may have noticed that we've departed from a long tradition today by announcing first quarter earnings on the day before our annual meeting of stockholders instead of on the same day. Hopefully, this change will allow investors to assimilate our results in advance of the meeting instead of during the meeting. So let's get to the highlights.
The first quarter of 2010, diluted earnings per common share were $1.15, up from $1.04 in the previous quarter and $0.49 in the first quarter of 2009. Net income for the recent quarter was $151 million compared with $137 million in the link quarter and $64 million in last year's first quarter. Included in our GAAP earnings for this year's first quarter was after-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $10 million, or $0.08 per common share. This compares with $10 million or $0.09 per common share in the link quarter and $9 million or $0.09 per common share in the year-ago quarter. There were no merger-related expenses in the first quarter of 2010, but we did incur after-tax merger-related expenses of $4 million or $0.03 per common share in the fourth quarter of '09 and $1 million or $0.01 per common share in last year's first quarter. 
Net operating income, which excludes the amortization of intangibles as well as the merger-related items, was $161 million or $1.23 per common share for the first quarter of 2010 compared with $151 million or $1.16 per common share in the link quarter and $75 million or $0.59 per common share in last year's first quarter.
In accordance with SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity. 
Turning to the balance sheet and the income statement, tangible-equivalent net interest income was $562 million for the first quarter, down from $565 million in the link quarter and up 24% from $453 million in the first quarter of 2009. The link quarter decline relates to the lower day count in the first quarter as compared with the fourth. The net interest margin continued to expand during the first quarter, rising to 3.78% from 3.71% in the fourth quarter of '09 and up significantly from 3.19% in last year's first quarter. 
Taking a simple view, the improvement in the margin from the fourth quarter can be attributed to the following factors: approximately three basis points of the margin expansion came from re-pricing on consumer time deposits; an additional three basis points came as a result of the reduced day count compared with last quarter; and the remainder of the expansion came from a shift in our funding mix with a higher non-maturity savings and DDA balances replacing time deposits. 
From a broader perspective, credit spreads on new and renewed commitments remain higher than we've seen over the past several years. And as a result, despite the drop in funding rates, asset yields have remained relatively stable. 
Looking forward, our view of the margin remains consistent with our remarks on the January conference call, which is to say we'd expect the margin to be relatively stable, with only a slight bias to the upside for the remainder of the year. 
As for the balance sheet, average earnings assets declined by $120 million or less than 1% annualized as compared with the fourth quarter of 2009. Earnings assets were not materially impacted by our adoption of new accounting requirements related to off-balance-sheet entities at the beginning of 2010. The result was the addition of approximately $416 million of residential mortgage loans, partially offset by a $355 million decline in investment securities. 
After adjusting for the impact from the adoption of the new accounting rules, average loans for the first quarter declined by an annualized 4% as compared with last year's fourth quarter. The change in average loans for each of the loan categories as compared with the fourth quarter of 2009 were as follows. Commercial & industrial loans declined an annualized 4%. Commercial real estate loans declined an annualized 2%, while residential real estate loans, after adjusting for the new accounting rules, declined by an annualized 10%, primarily the result of lower mortgage loans held for sale. Consumer loans declined an annualized 7%, driven by a lower level of indirect auto loans, reflecting both the continued run-off in the out-of-footprint part of that portfolio, as well as our decision to slow originations within our footprint in response to very aggressive price competition. 
For some time, we've been discussing several loan portfolios that we were not looking to grow and which, by design, are being allowed to run off. These include, obviously, residential construction, the Alt-A mortgage portfolio and as I just mentioned, our indirect portfolio, particularly the portion outside of our core markets. Excluding these portfolios, as well as the impact from the accounting change I referenced, average loans declined just 1% annualized. This compares quite favorably with the trends experienced nationally as seen through the Fed‚Äôs H.8 releases, which indicate that loans industry-wide declined about 7% in the first quarter. Thus, it appears that we are outpacing the broader economy and we are likely gaining share within some of our core markets. 
We continue to see growth in core deposits but at a somewhat slower pace than last year. Average core customer deposits in the first quarter, which exclude foreign deposits and CDs over $100,000, increased by an annualized 6% from the fourth quarter and included a very healthy 11% annualized growth in demand deposits.
Turning to non-interest income. Non-interest income was $258 million for the recent quarter and included $26 million of securities losses. This compares with $266 million in the linked quarter, which included $34 million of securities losses. In both periods, the securities losses primarily reflected additional other-than-temporary impairment charges on our available-for-sale securities portfolio, relating to privately issued residential mortgage-backed securities. 
Mortgage banking fees were $41 million for the quarter compared with $50 million in the link quarter. Origination volumes were lower, and at the same time, we experienced a slight decline and a gain on sale margin. That said, gain on sale margins remained wide compared to where they‚Äôve been historically.
Service charges on deposit accounts were $120 million during the quarter compared with $127 million in the link quarter. The decline came primarily on the consumer side and was attributable to a seasonal decline in customer transaction volumes, as well as fewer processing days in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter. 
M&T‚Äôs share of the operating results of Bayview Lending Group, or BLG, was a loss of $5.7 million compared to a loss of $10.6 million in the link quarter.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and merger-related expenses, were $473 million compared with $455 million in the linked quarter. This quarter's results reflect our usually seasonally high salary and benefit costs, which includes accelerated recognition of equity compensation expense for certain retirement-eligible employees, as well as higher FICA expense on employment insurance and expenses related to our 401(k) match. In aggregate, the expense from these items was some $21 million higher than in the linked quarter, and this is consistent with our experience in each of the past four years. 
The quarter's results include no material change in the valuation allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights compared with a $4 million reversal from the valuation allowance in last year's fourth quarter. All other categories of expense were well-controlled, essentially unchanged from the link quarter. 
The operating efficiency ratio, which excluded securities gains or losses, as well as merger-related items and intangible amortization, was 55.9% in the first quarter of 2010 compared with 52.7% in the linked quarter. It was improved by 2.8 percentage points from last year's first quarter.
Next, let's turn to credit. Overall, credit trends were positive. Non-accrual loans increased to $1.34 billion or 2.6% of total loans at the end of the recent quarter, up just $8 million from $1.33 billion or 2.56% of loans at the end of the previous quarter, an increase of less than 1%. Loans acquired in connection with the Provident and Bradford transactions classified as non-accrual and which have already been marked to fair value, increased by $35 million, while non-accrual loans associated with the legacy M&T portfolio declined by $26 million. 
Other non-performing assets, consisting of assets taken in foreclosure or defaulted loans, were $95 million as of March 31, unchanged from December 31, and down $5 million from last year's first quarter. 
Net charge-offs for the quarter were $95 million, down from $135 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 74 basis points, improved from 1.03% in the link quarter. Net charge-offs for commercial and industrial loans were $18 million in the first quarter, down from $31 million in the link quarter. Net charge-offs for residential builder construction loans were $22 million for the recent quarter compared with $40 million in the previous quarter. Net charge-offs for all other commercial real estate loans were $8 million, down from $11 million in the fourth quarter. Net charge-offs on residential real estate loans were $15 million in the first quarter, down from $21 million in the link quarter. And net charge-offs on consumer loans were $31 million in the first quarter compared with $32 million in the link quarter. 
Provision for credit losses was $105 million for the first quarter compared with $145 million in the link quarter. The allowance for loan losses increased to $891 million at the end of the first quarter. The ratio of allowance to credit -- the allowance for credit losses to legacy M&T loans, which excludes acquired loans against which there is a credit mark, was 1.86%, up three basis points from 1.83% in the link quarter. The loan-loss allowance as of March 31, 2010, was 2.3x annualized net charge-offs for the recent quarter, up from 1.7x net charge-offs for the full year of 2009. Put another way, the allowance at the end of March was sufficient to absorb more than two years of net charge-offs at our current annualized loss rate. 
We disclosed loans past due 90 days but still accruing separately from non-accrual loans, because they are deemed to be well-secured and in the process of collection, which is to say, there is minimal risk of principal loss. In our case, that's particularly true. Although loans 90 days past due were $203 million at the end of the recent quarter, they included $195 million of loans guaranteed by government-related entities. Those figures were $208 million and $193 million, respectively, at the end of last year.
M&T's tangible common equity ratio was 5.43% at the end of first the quarter, an increase of 30 basis points from 5.13% at the end of December. The majority of the improvement was a result of earnings well in excess of dividends, combined with a flattish balance sheet. An additional 10 basis points came from the continued improvement in unrealized losses on our securities portfolio. Recall that since unrealized losses on securities are already deducted from capital, the other-than-temporary impairment charges in our income statement did not result in further reductions of capital.
Turning to our outlook, we've seen clearly seen a number of signs that the economy's improving across most of our business segments. But the pace of economic recovery is slow, as seen in the decline in loan activity being reported at a national level. We've heard anecdotal evidence that manufacturers are starting to build inventories, but that doesn't appear to be reflected in the numbers yet and we‚Äôll need to see a turnaround in the second half of 2010 to realize loan growth for the full year. 
Our outlook for net interest margin is unchanged, which is to say, wider for 2010 than for 2009. And we are pleased with the consistent credit results that we have reported over the past several quarters, and that is particularly true for these first quarter figures. The continued decline in criticized loans is also encouraging. With respect to future quarters, it's important to remind you that credit performance can be lumpy from quarter to quarter. 
The uptick in the efficiency ratio this quarter, as compared with the link quarter, was entirely related to seasonal factors and, in fact, improved nicely from last year's first quarter, which contains the same seasonal factors. We remain focused on improving that ratio as we move forward. 
Of course, all of these projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national, regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future. 
We'll now open up the call to questions, before which Paula will briefly review the instructions."

But really, there are sort of two things that we're looking to in the future. Obviously, we're very pleased with our first quarter results, but problem loans and the non-performing assets still remain pretty high in the industry, and so we'd like to see more evidence that there‚Äôs a turn in the economy. And two, we've said for some time that it would be helpful to have some clarity as to where things are going to go on the regulatory front before we make changes to our capital structure. Why we have that -- I think we have that ability to do that, is because we actually are growing capital. We're doing it sort of by generating it, right? And so as long as we continue to do that, I think that helps us. But our view would be that if we're going to change our capital structure, we'd like to do it once. That's the efficient way to do it, and then to do that, we have to sort of feel a little bit -- get a little bit more clarity around what some of the pending regulation will be.

And really, the issue there is that to the extent that there's not a lot of improvement in the economy, then as time passes, you get further into it. We've not actually seen a principal write-down on any of those securities. As the housing prices have stabled, the thing that really hasn't changed until recently is the roll rate on -- on 30-day delinquent roll rate rolling from 30 to 60. But having said that, in the last few days, we've begun to see in our portfolio that we've had nice improvements in the 30-day delinquencies. So I would guess what needs to happen is you need to see a change in the roll rates in a positive direction, and you need to see unemployment -- we need to actually see some employment, right? That affects the consumer in a positive way."

As we've talked about, we continue to manage that portfolio very closely, doing numerous reviews. And I think what you see is that when we look at the quarter, we did have a couple of -- beyond what I've mentioned, a few more loans that rolled into our criticized loan catalog, and that catalog, remember, is on a scale of one to 15 as our loan grade. So when something goes from 10 to 11, it rolls into the catalog. So there were a few. But at the end of the day, I think what the broader issue seems to be is that the number of things that are, dare I say, sort of -- that are being teed up and actually being cured on the C&I side is actually a much greater issue than the number of -- than any weakness we might see in CRE. In fact, it seems to be dwarfing the issue. One of the things that we did do this quarter is we finished in -- our credit guys finished the base work for our stress testing work. And what you can kind of see in the portfolio, when you look at all of our real estate across all of our footprints, so take out the owner-occupied, which is really C&I; take out the construction, which we kind of look at a little bit separately, and you've got just under $10 billion there. And I would say the loan-to-values of that book are in the low 60s, and I would say that debt service coverage is somewhere almost as high as 2 1/2%, right? So at the end of the day, the way we underwrote that portfolio has a lot to do with sort of why it's performing pretty well. And even as we see problems that sort of roll into the portfolio in terms of payment problems, we continue to think that the loss content is on a lower side. So not a lot of new news."

Closed volumes went from $1.25 billion, down to less than $1 billion, right? So 22% drop. So I think that's going to just move along with what happens with rates and volumes.

So if you sort of start there with that knowledge, what we've referred to is -- particularly is in the commodity-like spaces with indirect auto, where, how do I say this, people aren‚Äôt coming to us because of it‚Äôs the M&T name. It‚Äôs more the price when they go to the dealer. That's where we've actually seen the most competitiveness. I think because it's a two-year relatively very creditworthy asset, and it's easy for people to go after. So we've seen price competition there. I will point out that what I noticed this quarter in our commercial book, we keep pretty robust data on a summary of everything that goes to committee in the quarter. And when you look at it, the number of deals that went to our credit committee this quarter versus last really didn't change much. It was down a couple of deals. The total commitments that went to the committee was maybe up 5%. So even though there were fewer borrowers, they were borrowing a little bit more. And if you were to look at the margin on those, it did drop about 11 basis points to sort of new origination margin. But what struck me is we also look at, based on the grade and the structure and the collateral content of the deal, we have a risk-adjusted measure. And the risk-adjusted return on those deals went up. So what that means is that the people that we were extending credit to this quarter were structurally more sound and better rated credits on the whole, and that's probably why the margin was a little bit lighter. And I think you're seeing that because my guess is that there are very few people borrowing, and everybody is chasing those same individuals. But it's a big anecdotal, but that's my guess."

And then importantly, just kind of remind us of the split between kind of commercial deposits versus consumer deposits and whether or not there was any either pricing changes made in the quarter or planned in the coming quarters as it relates to the pending Reg E changes?"

The past several quarters has been largely driven, sort of outweighed by the commercial side.

And so, all of the sort of business side of things are not affected by that in any way, shape or form. And that part of the business, the commercial part of the business, is much more a factor of what's happening with rates in my mind. I think people, because they've not yet started investing, they're holding on to a lot of cash, but on top of that, much of the money that at one point in time was housed in the money funds, have actually moved back into the bank, because they‚Äôre -- the people are not able to sort of get more than one basis point in the money fund. So I think we'll see, as part of the overall turn, if the economy turns, we'll begin to see -- that's where you'll begin to see it, right? You‚Äôll begin to see it in behavior on commercial balances and movements there. On the other side, again, there's nothing really all that unusual in what we've seen so far on the consumer side. And it's just too early to tell what the impact will be on the NSF thing, because it depends on the behavior of the consumer, just whether they decide to opt in or out. Over the long term, it's not something that I worry about because, I mean, in the sense -- it's an industry-wide thing. Our job is to -- over the next two quarters is to educate our workforce so that they can educate the consumer and that we can have good customer service through this pretty big change in the industry. At the end of the day, people need banking services. We provide pretty good ones, pretty good service, so I think we'll come out fine."

272285,109427655,68207,"M&T Bank Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-21-2010",2010-07-21,"Earnings Calls","M&T Bank Corporation","Executives","Thank you Don, and welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I know that there have already been several earning calls this morning conducted by our peers, so you will certainly have a lot to digest. Let me cover the highlights briefly",2206,"Thank you Don, and welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I know that there have already been several earning calls this morning conducted by our peers, so you will certainly have a lot to digest. Let me cover the highlights briefly, after which I‚Äôll your questions.
For the second quarter of 2010, diluted earnings per common share were $1.46, up from $1.15 in the previous quarter, and $0.36 in the second quarter of 2009. Net income for the recent quarter was $189 million compared with $151 million in the linked quarter and $51 million in last year's second quarter. 
You‚Äôll recall that our GAAP results for the second quarter of 2009 included $40 million of after-tax merger related expenses arising from the Provident acquisition. There were no merger related expenses in this year‚Äôs first or second quarters.
Our results for the second quarter of 2010 included after-tax expenses from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $9 million or $0.07 per share. This compares with $10 million or $0.08 per common share in the linked quarter and $9 million or $0.08 per common share in the year-ago quarter.
Net operating income, which excludes the amortization of intangibles as well as the merger-related expenses in last year‚Äôs second quarter was $198 million for the recent quarter, up from $161 million in the linked quarter and $101 million in last year's second quarter.
Diluted net operating income per share was $1.53 for the second quarter of 2010, up 24% from the $1.23 per share in prior quarter and up 94% from the $0.79 per share in the second quarter of 2009. In accordance with the SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results including tangible assets and equity.
Turning to the balance sheet and income statement, taxable equivalent net interest income was $573 million for the second quarter, up 2% from $562 million in the linked quarter and up 13% from $507 million in the second quarter of 2009. The net interest margin expanded slightly during the second quarter rising to 3.84% from 3.78% in the first quarter of 2010 and was up significantly from 3.43% in last year's second quarter.
In comparing this year‚Äôs second quarter with the linked quarter, there were a lot of moving parts, but the six basis point increase could be simplified down to a few factors. More of our margin expansion came from the asset side this quarter. The higher average one-month LIBOR rate combined with higher prepayment penalties, some feels and interest received on pay downs and payoffs of non-accrual loans, all contributed to an eight basis point increase in the loan yield as compared with the linked quarter. 
This was dampened by higher wholesale funding costs, also primarily driven by higher one and three months LIBOR rates. There was also a modest negative impact from a one additional day in the quarter.
Our comments earlier this year indicated a stable outlook for the net interest margin from the first quarter levels with a small bias to the upside. That outlook was based on the forward curve, which indicated action by the Fed to increase short-term rates in the second half of the year. What we saw during the second quarter was no action by the Fed, but nevertheless an increase in short-term LIBOR rates in the marketplace, which led to slightly more upside in the margin for the quarter, given our asset-sensitive position.
As for the balance sheet, average earnings assets declined by $520 million or about 3.5% annualized as compared to the first quarter of 2010. A $203 million increase in investment securities was more than offset by a $670 million decline in average loan balances. On an end of period basis, total loans for this year‚Äôs second quarter declined by $383 million. The majority of that decline resulted from the pay down, payoff, charge-off or foreclosure of non-accrual loans during the quarter, which I‚Äôll discuss in more detail in a moment.
Overall, the 3% annualized decline compares slightly favorable to the annualized 3.8% decline for the entire banking sector as indicated by the Fed‚Äôs AJ reports for the second quarter. On the same basis by category, commercial and industrial loans declined by $203 million on a annualized 6%, commercial real estate loans declined by $111 million or 2%, consumer loans declined by $134 million or 5% driven primarily by lower indirect auto lending, while residential real estate loans grew by $65 millions or 5% annualized.
Growth in core deposits also continued, but at a slower pace. Average core customer deposits in the second quarter, which excludes foreign deposits in CDs greater than a 100,000 increased by an annualized 4% from the first quarter, and included 10% annualized growth in demand deposits.
Turning to non-interest income, non-interest income was $274 million for the recent quarter, up from $258 million in the linked quarter. The recent quarter‚Äôs results included $22 million of securities losses compared with $26 million in the prior quarter. The securities losses for the recent quarter included $12 million of other than temporary impairment charges related to the American Depository Shares or ADSs of Allied Irish Banks.
Prior to its acquisition by M&T in 2003, Allfirst granted equity compensation to certain employees, which was linked to the U.S. ADS for our Allied Irish Banks. As a hedge against this obligation, Allfirst owned the ADSs directly at the time of the acquisition by M&T. The securities are held and M&T is available for sale securities portfolio and had previously been marked to fair value in accordance with GAAP. This quarter‚Äôs action recognizes the other than temporary nature of the loss in value.
Mortgage banking fees were $47 million for the quarter compared with $41 million in the linked quarter. Origination volumes were up 12% during the quarter, reflecting in part the near record low interest rates, gain on sale margins remain relatively wide.
Service charges on deposit accounts were $129 million during the recent quarter compared with $120 million in the linked quarter. The increase reflected a return to normal levels of activity following seasonally low levels we experienced in the first quarter. M&T share of operating results in Bayview Lending Group or BLG, was a loss of $6 million unchanged from the linked quarter.
Turning to expenses, operating expenses, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets and merger related expenses were $461 million compared with $473 million in the linked quarter. Recall that the first quarter results included seasonally high compensation and benefit expenses, which declined over the remainder of the year.
Our operating expenses for the second quarter of 2009 were $482 million and included $33 million special one-time FDIC assessment. This year‚Äôs second quarter results included a $2 million addition to the impairment allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights, compared with no charge to the valuation allowance in the first quarter. Last year‚Äôs second quarter results included a $13 million reversal of the impairment allowance.
Excluding the impact of changes to the impairment allowance, as well as the special FDIC assessment from operating expenses in the second quarter of 2009, operating expenses actually declined by $3 million or 1% on a year-over-year basis. The efficiency ratio which excludes securities gains or losses, as well as merger related items and intangible amortization was 53.06% in the second quarter of 2010, improved from 55.8% in the linked quarter, which included the seasonally high compensation and benefit expenses that I mentioned earlier.
Next, let‚Äôs turn to credit. Overall credit trends continue to be positive. Non-accrual loans declined to $1.09 billion or 2.13% of total loan at the end of the recent quarter, down $250 million from $1.34 billion or 2.60% of total loans at the end of the previous quarter.
During the second quarter, our largest non-performing loan was reclassified to foreclosed assets. The net result of this action was $104 million reduction in non-accrual loans and then $98 million in the foreclosed property. The difference, of course is charge-off reflecting the appraised value, less the cost of disposition of that property. 
The non-performing asset ratio, which is a non-performing assets divided by total loans, plus real estate and other foreclosed assets was 2.50% as of June 30, 2010, improved from 2.78% at March 31.
Net charge-offs for the second quarter were $82 million dollars, down from $95 million in the first quarter of 2010. Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans were 64 basis points, improved from 74 basis points in the linked quarter. Net charge-offs for commercial and industrial loans were $13 million in the second quarter, down from $18 million in the linked quarter.
Net charge offs for residential builder construction loans were $17 million for the recent quarter compared with $22 million in the prior quarter. Charge-offs for all other commercial real estate loans were $15 million including $7 million charge related to the property that I mentioned earlier, and that all compares with $8 million of charge-offs in the first quarter for all other real estate. </TAG>
Net charge-offs on residential real estate loans were $13 million in the second quarter, down from $15 million in the linked quarter, and net charge-offs on consumer loans were $24 million in the second quarter, compared with $31 million in the linked quarter. The provision for credit losses was $85 million for the second quarter compared with $105 million in linked quarter. The allowance for loan losses increased to $895 million as of the end of the second quarter.
The ratio of allowance to credit losses to legacy loans, which excludes acquired loans, which were marked-to-fair value at acquisition, was unchanged at 1.86% as compared with the linked quarter. The loan loss allowance as of June 30, was 2.7 times annualized net charge-offs for the recent quarter and 2.5 times annualized net charge-offs for the first half of 2010. Put in another way, the allowance at the end of June was sufficient to absorb more than two and a half years of net charge-offs at our annualized loss rate.
We disclosed loans past due 90 days, but still accruing separately from non-accrual loans because they are deemed to be well-secured and in the process of collection, which is to say there is minimal risk of principal loss. In our case, that‚Äôs particularly true.
Loans 90 days past due were $203 million at the end of the recent quarter, of these loans $188 million or 93% are guaranteed by government related entities. Those figures were $203 million and $195 million respectively at the end of March. M&T‚Äôs tangible common equity ratio was 5.75% at end of the second quarter, an increase of 32 basis points from 5.43% at the end of March.
Turning to our outlook, while we continue to see improvement across most of our business segments, the pace of economic growth recovery remains low and customers are managing their financial position conservatively. This is reflected in the modest demand for loans and the continued growth in deposits. Our outlook regarding the full year net interest margin for 2010 is still consistent with the view we expressed on the January earnings call and that seems to be holding up which is to say, we‚Äôd be surprised if the full-year margin was much higher than 380 to 385.
We‚Äôve seen signs of improvement on the credit side and virtually all of our portfolios. One is attempted to be optimistic regarding the charge-offs in non-performing asset formation, however the economy is turning around slowly, unemployment remains very high and we are still at a point where a single large credit relationship can cause an increased in the net charge-offs, despite generally improving trends.
I know many of you are also wondering how the new overdraft rules will impact us, since we haven‚Äôt reached the changeover date for most customers, it‚Äôs still too soon to say exactly what the impact on our revenues will be. We‚Äôve been engaged in a fairly robust outreach program to our customers, particularly those who are frequent users of overdraft services. Generally, of those who you‚Äôve spoken to, more customers are opting in that not with slightly higher opt-in rates for frequent users. However, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we saw a decline in our service charge revenue of 10% to 15% in the third quarter.
As to the longer term, we continue to have a positive view on the deposit business generally and are continuing to spend and invest to enhance our product offerings around deposits and payment services. The combination of these last two factors makes it difficult to see near term improvement in our efficiency ratio and that said, we‚Äôll continue to manage the bank as we always have, scrutinizing discretionary, spending closely and seeking opportunities to transform our processes so as to improve efficiency ratio over time.
Of course, all of these projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding nationals and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.
We‚Äôll now open up the call to questions, before which Christy will briefly review the instructions.

So, what you‚Äôve got is on July 1, for new customers, the new rule kicked in and then you go for the remaining customers that occur on August 15.
So, if you think about what the process is, is it really for us anyway a massive outreach program where we are calling customers, asking if they understand the services, and what you‚Äôve seen is we are pretty pleased with the percentage of customers who we actually get a hold of, who actually opt in and then, you are right, you get a normalizing effect as you get to the fourth quarter, but remember, because the customer opts, if you don‚Äôt contact them, they actually opt out. 
There is probably only upside as you move beyond the fourth quarter, right. So, it‚Äôs so hard to tell because what will likely happen is somebody who we tried to contact and couldn‚Äôt get a hold of will not have noticed the change in payment behavior, and because what we are finding is that the majority of people who we do speak to understand the service and are saying, yes, okay I‚Äôll opt in, I think you get some sort of normalizing effect starting post-August 15 which is a positive factor.
So, it‚Äôs really, really hard to tell. I mean, technically you‚Äôre right; you are going to get more of an effect in the fourth quarter, but you are not necessarily considering everything, so it‚Äôs hard to say. 
I‚Äôd also point out that the transaction volume was up, when you look at second to third and when you look at year-over-year second quarter. So, that‚Äôs the other piece that‚Äôs pretty hard to predict.

Then, as you sort of get to the new regulations, which we‚Äôve been all sort of waiting to hear about, I mean what we really heard doesn‚Äôt help us much because what it told us is one form of capital that we use which is regulatory capital is now going to be disallowed in the future, but what we don‚Äôt know is how much core common equity we need, and as you follow the bank for a long time, every decision we make is on tangible equity.
So, we don‚Äôt really know more than we knew before, but what we are very pleased with is just the capital generation rate of M&T has really never stopped, right and so we are generating capital very quickly and as you start to think the time that it will take to actually change the regulations, I‚Äôd be surprised if capital is just not sort of one of the things that we are worried about today.

Other than the fact that, as we talked about, when you charge that down and move, you can kind of see that the loss content is low and it‚Äôs probably characteristic of what we have in the portfolio.
Then much of the rest were actually pay down. So, we had a $100 plus million of loans that were non-performing previously that just paid down, and they sort of fell in several categories. Do give me one second, I have a sheet here somewhere, yes, so if you kind of look through C&I accounted for maybe $77 million of the drop quarter-over-quarter, commercial real estate was $170 of which $100 was that one credit and we also saw in the consumer side was down as well with no change really in residential real estate, maybe $3 million up, some small number.
So generally, we saw positives across the board and a lot of the improvement came from pay-offs and pay-downs. Why that‚Äôs important to me is the drop that we are seeing in our loan balances is on loans that aren‚Äôt paying us. So, it‚Äôs a fact that‚Äôs also contributing to the higher margin, right.

The reality is, is that the market is really flush with capital from all the issuances. The market‚Äôs also flushed with liquidity relative to the past, but customers just are not necessarily having great demands for borrowing. So, probably more important than the volume of loans which we really can do much about is that you are beginning to see competitive pressure on pricing. 
So, I think that‚Äôs probably the biggest story out there, but no change in demand I guess is probably the way I would put the loan side.

Remember, on the residential development projects, you are going to get stuff from the portfolios that we purchased, right. So, there are already marked to full value.

So, today, there is a lot of discussion about NFS and legislation and all of that, but at the end of the day, what I think we have learned especially from the crisis is the strength of the franchise is all about your deposit base. I think that‚Äôs probably also true when it comes to thinking about over long term period what your revenue growth looks like. 
So, we have been spending and we‚Äôll begin even more so to spend a lot on things that are related to deposit services, payment services because we think that sort of what you can -- it‚Äôs hard to grow much more than you grow than your deposit base without actually taking outsize risk on your loan portfolio. 
So, if you keep your deposit base fine and nothing is happening there on the revenue side, I guess the economy can come back and you can lend more. I guess you can get more aggressive and risky and the types of loans you are lending and put more yield on and more volume, but as you see that doesn‚Äôt work, right. So, from our perspective, it‚Äôs all about the deposit.
The second thing is we don‚Äôt look at revenue growth. We look at revenue growth per share. So it‚Äôs why we are very conservative and thoughtful around how we treat our capital base, and you kind of see that today. I mean if think of the fact that we‚Äôve been growing our capital overtime organically, had we done a big capital raise, now that there‚Äôs no demand for loans, that would be more of a hit to revenue growth per share than the actual loan issue, but today, when it comes back we‚Äôll deal with it and if we need capital because we need growth for some reason, acquisitions, we‚Äôll do that.

Thank you for joining us on the call today.

I‚Äôd like to cover the highlights of the recent quarter, after which I‚Äôll take your questions. For the third quarter of 2010, diluted earnings per common share were $1.48, up from $1.46 in the previous quarter, and $0.97 in the third quarter of 2009. Net income for the recent quarter was $192 million, up from 189 million in the linked quarter and $128 million in last year‚Äôs third quarter.
Recall that our GAAP results for the third quarter of ‚Äô09 included $9 million of after tax merger related benefit arising from a gain on the Bradford Bank acquisition, which was partially offset by merger related expenses arising from both the Provident and Bradford transactions. There were no merger related expenses in this year‚Äôs second or third quarter.
Our results for the third quarter of 2010 included after tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $8 million or $0.07 per share. This compares to $9 million and $0.07 per common share in the linked quarter and $10 million or $0.09 per common share in the year ago quarter.
Net operating income, which excludes the amortization of intangibles, as well as the net merger related benefit in last year‚Äôs third quarter was $200 million for the recent quarter, up from $198 million in the linked quarter and $129 million in last year‚Äôs third quarter.
Diluted net operating income per share was at $1.55 for the third quarter of 2010, up from $1.53 per share in the prior quarter and up 58% from the $0.98 per share in last year‚Äôs third quarter. And according to SEC guidelines, this morning‚Äôs press release contains a tabular reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP results including tangible assets and equity.
Turning to the balance sheet and income statement, taxable equivalent net interest income was $576 million for the third quarter, up from $573 million in the linked quarter and up 4% from 553 million in the third quarter of 2009. The net interest margin expanded slightly during the quarter, rising to 3.87% from 3.84% in the second quarter of 2010 and was up 26 basis points from the 3.61% in last year‚Äôs third quarter.
The yield on earnings assets was up about 2 basis points during the quarter, primarily reflecting favorable loan re-pricing. We also realized the benefit of prepayment penalties and the recognition of cash interest payments on non-accruing loans that was comparable to the levels that we saw in the second quarter.
The cost of funds declined by 1 basis point, reflecting the benefit of a shift in mix of core deposits from time deposits to non maturity savings product.
Looking forward, we seem to be on track with our previous comments back in January that our full year margin would not likely be higher than 380 to 385. Through the first 9 months of 2010, the margin was 3.83%.
As for the balance sheet, average earnings assets declined by an annualized 5% as compared to the second quarter of 2010 and this included the impact from $382 million decrease in investment securities and a $443 million or 3% annualized decline in average loan balances.
On an end of period basis, total loans for this year‚Äôs third quarter declined by 270 million or 2% annualized from the end of the prior quarter. On the same basis by category, C&I loans declined by 229 million or 7% annualized. Commercial real estate loans declined by $33 million or 1%. Consumer loans also declined by $33 million or 1% while residential real estate loans grew by $25 million or 2%. Despite the overall pressure on loan volumes, we‚Äôve seen a few encouraging signs. On an end of period basis, the pace of decline in total loans is flowed from rates seen in each of this year‚Äôs first and second quarters. In the final month of the quarter, we saw a growth in commercial and industrial loans and stable commercial real estate loans.
Finally, much of the quarterly decline appeared to be driven by lower utilization rates as overall commitments rose.
Turning to non-interest income, our non-interest income was 290 million for the recent quarter, up from 274 million in the linked quarter, and the recent quarter‚Äôs results included $8 million of securities losses compared with 22 million in the prior quarter. Mortgage banking fees was $61 million for the third quarter compared with 47 million in the linked quarter.
Origination volumes were up 29% during the recent quarter, reflecting, in part, the record low interest rates while gain on sale margins widened further from this year‚Äôs second quarter. Service charges on deposit accounts were $118 million during the recent quarter, compared with 129 million in the linked quarter. The 9% decline was attributable to the implementation of the new regulation. The customer response to the new regulation has been consistent with or perhaps slightly better than our expectations.
Our decision not to charge NSF fees on transactions less than $10 has had a negative impact on overall fees but has met with a favorable response from our customers.
Turning to expenses, operating expenses, which excludes the amortization and tangible assets were $467 million compared with 461 million in the linked quarter. This year‚Äôs third quarter results included a $3 million addition to the impairment allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights, compared with the $2 million addition in the allowance in the second quarter, last year‚Äôs third quarter results included no adjustment to the impairment allowance.
The efficiency ratio, which excludes securities gains and losses as well as intangible amortization was 53.4% in the third quarter, up just slightly from the 53.1% in the linked quarter. 
Next let‚Äôs turn to credit. Overall credit trends remain stable with the linked quarter and considerably improved from the prior year. Criticize and classified loans declined for the fourth consecutive quarter. Non-accrual loans were 1.1 billion or 2.16% of loans at the end of the recent quarter, compared with 1.09 billion or 2.13% of loans at the end of the previous quarter.
Foreclosed assets were unchanged from the previous quarter at quarter end at $193 million and non-performing asset ratio, which is non-performing assets divided by total loans plus real estate and other foreclosed assets was 2.53% as of September 30, 2010 compared with 2.50% at June 30.
Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of loans were 73 basis points in the third quarter compared with 64 basis points in the linked quarter for the 9 months ended September 30 annualized net charge-offs were 70 basis points, down from 100 basis points in the year earlier period.
Net charge-offs for commercial and industrial loans were 33 million in the third quarter compared with 9 million in the linked quarter. Net charge-offs for residential builder construction loans were 11 million for the recent quarter compared with 17 million in the prior quarter.
Net charge-offs for all other commercial real estate loans were 7 million, down from 19 million in the second quarter. Net charge-offs in residential real estate loans were 17 million in the third quarter compared to 13 million in the linked quarter and net charge-offs on consumer loans were 25 million in the third quarter compared to 24 million in the linked quarter.
The provision for credit losses was $93 million in the third quarter compared with 85 million in the linked quarter. The allowance for loan losses was unchanged at 895 million at the end of the third quarter. The ratio of allowance to credit losses to Legacy M&T loans, which excludes acquired loans that were marked to value add at the acquisition was also unchanged at 1.86% as compared to June 30th. The loan loss allowance as at September 30 was 2.4 times annual net charge-offs for the recent quarter and 2.5 times annualized net charge-offs year-to-date.
We disclosed loans past due 90 days but still accruing separately from non-accrual loans because they are deemed to be well secured and in the process of collection, which is to say that there is minimal risk of principal loss. In our case, that‚Äôs particularly true. Loans 90 days past due were 215 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these, 194 million or 90% are guaranteed by government related entities. Those figures were 203 million and 188 million respectively at the end of June.
M&T‚Äôs tangible common equity ratio was 5.96% at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 21 basis points from 5.75% at the end of June. The Tier 1 common ratio was an estimated 6.4% as of the end of the recent quarter, improved from 6.15% at the end of the second quarter.
Turning to our outlook, M&T‚Äôs credit trends continue to compare favorably with those of the industry overall and we‚Äôre seeing signs that the economy continues to stabilize although unemployment remains high. The decline in loan volumes has continued to moderate and we expect that trend to continue but at a slow pace.
Late in the third quarter, we began to retain conforming mortgages originated through our retail network to hold on the balance sheet. With the run off in our securities book, our level of sensitivity has been getting a little higher than we like. We believe that it makes more sense in the current environment to retain our own production of mortgage loans rather than to sell them and simultaneously purchase securities from others. For the near term, this actually will reduce our residential gain on sale revenues, which ultimately will be offset by higher net interest income in subsequent periods.
We‚Äôre also thinking through the best approach to collateralize seasonal inflows of government deposits to the extent that we choose to use repurchase agreements, we‚Äôd expect a modest benefit to net interest income in the future and the reduction of net interest margin by a few basis points.
Finally, 2 weeks ago, Allied Irish Banks took their initial steps to divest their shareholding in M&T that they‚Äôve held since we bought all First Financial from them in 2003. In doing so, they sold 26.7 million notes convertible into 26.7 million shares of M&T stock following the approval by AIB shareholders. The notes were priced at $77.50 each, valuing the at 2.5 times our June 30 tangible book value and 20.2 million of those notes were sold to 123 institutional investors so 6.5 million of the notes were sold to the retail channel. We believe that successful completion of this offering demonstrates the strength of M&T‚Äôs access to the capital markets.
In closing, I would remind you that all of our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future.
We‚Äôll now open up the call to questions, before which Paula will briefly review the instructions.

But having said that, we long sort of viewed residential mortgages as substitute for securities. We have the same profile and we clump them all into our discretionary portfolio so what is unusual today is that there‚Äôs a big difference in both rates and yields and returns that you can get on mortgages and securities today and so if you start thinking about it, it really doesn‚Äôt make sense for us to be selling assets at the same time we‚Äôre buying them because we‚Äôre basically just giving up the transaction spread. So economically, the best thing to sort of do to balance out your portfolio is just slow down the amount that you‚Äôre selling and it sort of helps to keep ourselves neutral. So it‚Äôs the cheapest way to keep the balance sheet where we like it.

I think all that is happening. It‚Äôs just happening at a much slower pace. So that‚Äôs why I mentioned the fact that if you look at first the second, second the third and then now this last quarter, you see a moderation in the decline. The other thing that I think is relatively encouraging is that when we look at this quarter‚Äôs decline, almost all of it on the commercial side is lower utilization, and I think what you‚Äôre seeing if we kind of work our way across the commercial bank, we‚Äôve seen for example in the Mid Atlantic a number of customers who are paying down debt, repositioning themselves. We‚Äôve seen in the commercial real estate space a number of pretty well healed commercial real estate folks actually just looking at the liquidity and their portfolio, maybe selling down some projects to improve the overall liquidity position. But overall, our commitments are up so I think people are just on hold. The rates are low, they‚Äôre trying to lock in some credit today but they‚Äôre not necessarily using it because they‚Äôre not yet investing. I would guess if the trends continue to improve but I wouldn‚Äôt expect a big spike up in loan growth all of a sudden.
The other thing I‚Äôd point out is that in the volume of loans that run through our senior loan committee, they were higher than last quarter and the returns were better.

Thank you for joining us on the call today. I believe with the last call this morning, among our regional and subregional peers, so when we're finished you can settle down and try to assess what it all means. I'd like",1858,"Thank you, Don, and welcome everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I believe with the last call this morning, among our regional and subregional peers, so when we're finished you can settle down and try to assess what it all means. I'd like to cover the highlights of the recent quarter, after which, I'll take your questions. For the third quarter of 2010, diluted earnings per common share were $1.48, up from $1.46 in the previous quarter and $0.97 in the third quarter of 2009. Net income for the recent quarter was $192 million, up from $189 million in the link quarter and $128 million in last year's third quarter.
Recall that our GAAP results for the third quarter of '09, included $9 million of after-tax merger related benefit, arising from a gain on the Bradford Bank acquisition, which was partially offset by a merger related expenses arising from both the Provident and Bradford transactions. There were no merger related expenses in this year's second quarter or third quarter. Our results for the third quarter of 2010 included after-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $8 million or $0.07 per share. This compares to $9 million and $0.07 per common share in the linked quarter and $10 million or $0.09 per common share in the year ago quarter.
Net operating income, which excludes the amortization of intangibles, as well as the net merger related benefit in last year's third quarter, was $200 million for the recent quarter, up from $198 million in the linked quarter and $129 million in last year's third quarter.
Diluted net operating income per share was $1.55 for the third quarter of 2010, up from $1.53 per share in the prior quarter and, up 58% from the $0.98 per share in last year's third quarter. And according to the SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contained a tabular reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results, including intangible assets and equity.
Turning to the balance sheet and income statement, taxable equivalent net interest income was $576 million for the third quarter, up from $573 million in the linked quarter and up 4% from $553 million in the third quarter of 2009. The net interest margin expanded slightly during the third quarter, rising to 3.87% from 3.84% in the second quarter of 2010 and was up 26 basis points from the 3.61% in last year's third quarter.
The yield on earnings asset was up about 2 basis points during the quarter, primarily reflecting favorable loan repricing. We also realized that benefit of prepayment penalties and the recognition of cash interest payments on non-accruing loans that was comparable to the levels that we saw in the second quarter.
The cost of funds declined by 1 basis points, reflecting the benefit of a shift in mix of core deposits from time deposits to non-maturity savings product.
Looking forward, we seem to be on track with our previous comments back in January, that our full year margin would not likely be higher than 3.80% through 3.85%. Through the first 9 months of 2010, the margin was a 3.83%.
As for the balance sheet, average earnings assets declined by an annualized 5%, as compared to the second quarter of 2010, and this included the impact from $382 million decrease in investment securities and a $443 million or 3% annualized decline in average loan balances.
On an end of period basis, total loans for this year's third quarter declined by $270 million or 2% annualized from the end of period of the prior quarter. On the same basis by category, C&I loans declined by $229 million or 7% annualized. Commercial real estate loans declined by $33 million or 1%. Consumer loans also declined by $33 million or 1%, while Residential real estate loans grew by $25 million or 2%. Despite the overall pressure on loan volumes, we've seen a few encouraging signs. On an end of period basis, the pace of decline in total loans is flowed from rates seen in each of this year's first and second quarters. In the final month of the quarter, we saw a growth in commercial and industrial loan and stable commercial real estate loans.
Finally, much of the quarterly decline appeared to be driven by lower utilization rates as overall commitments rose.
Turning to non-interest income, non-interest income was $290 million for the recent quarter, up from $274 million in the linked quarter, and the recent quarters results included $8 million of securities losses, compared with $22 million in the prior quarter. Mortgage banking fees were $61 million for the third quarter, compared with $47 million in the linked quarter.
Origination volumes were up 29% during the recent quarter, reflecting in part the record low interest rates while a gain on sale margins widened further from this year's second quarter. Service charges on deposit accounts were $118 million during the recent quarter, compared with $129 million in the linked quarter. The 9% decline was attributable to the implementation of the new Regulation E. The customer response to the new regulation has been consistent with or perhaps slightly better than our expectation.
Our decision not to charge NSF fees on transactions less than $10 has had a negative impact on overall fees but has met with the favorable response from our customers.
Turning to expenses, operating expenses, which exclude the amortization of tangible assets were $467 million compared with $461 million in the linked quarter. This year's third quarter results included a $3 million addition to the impairment allowance for capitalize mortgage servicing rights, compared with the $2 million addition in the allowance in the second quarter, last year's third quarter results included no adjustment to the impairment allowance.
The efficiency ratio, which excludes securities gains and losses, as well as intangible amortization was 53.4% in the third quarter, up just slightly from the 53.1% in the linked quarter.
Next let's turn to credit. Overall credit trends remained stable with the linked quarter and considerably improve from the prior year. Criticized and classified loans decline for the fourth consecutive quarter. Non-accrual loans were $1.1 billion or 2.16% of loans at the end of the recent quarter, compared with $1.09 billion or 2.13% of loans at the end of the previous quarter. Foreclosed assets were unchanged from the previous quarter at quarter end, at $193 million, and nonperforming asset ratio, which is nonperforming assets divided by total loans plus real estate and other foreclosed assets was 2.53% as of September 30, 2010, compared with 2.50% at June 30.
Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of loans were 73 basis points in the third quarter, compared with 64 basis points in the linked quarter. For the 9 months ended September 30, annualized net charge-offs were 70 basis points, down from 100 basis points into the year earlier period.
Net charge-offs for commercial and industrial loans were $33 million in the third quarter compared with $9 million in the linked quarter. Net charge offs for residential builder construction loans were $11 million for the recent quarter compared with $17 million in the prior quarter.
Net charge-offs for all other commercial real estate loans were $7 million, down from $19 million in the second quarter. Net charge-offs in residential real estate loans were $17 million in the third quarter compared to $13 million in linked quarter and net charge-offs on consumer loans were $25 million in the third quarter compared to $24 million in the linked quarter.
The Provision for Credit Losses was $93 million in the third quarter, compared with $85 million in the link quarter. The allowance for loan losses was unchanged at $895 million at the end of the third quarter. The ratio of allowance to credit losses to Legacy M&T loans, which excludes acquired loans that were marked to fair value at the acquisition was also unchanged at 1.86%, as compared to June 30. The loan loss allowance as of September 30, was 2.4x and while net charge-offs for the recent quarter and 2.5x annualized net charge-offs year-to-date.
We disclosed loans past due 90 days but still accruing separately from non-accrual loans because they are deemed to be well-secured and in the process of collection, which is to say that there is a minimal risk of principal loss. In our case, that's particularly true. Loans 90 days past due were $215 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these, $194 million or 90% are guaranteed by government-related entities. Those figures were $203 million and $188 million, respectively, at the end of June.
M&T's tangible common equity ratio was 5.96% at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 21 basis points from 5.75% at the end of June. The Tier 1 common ratio was an estimated 6.4% as of the end of the recent quarter, improved from 6.15% at the end of the second quarter.
Turning to our outlook, M&T's credit trends continue to compare favorably with those of the industry overall and we're seeing signs that the economy continues to stabilize, although unemployment remains high. The decline in loan volumes has continued to moderate, and we expect that trend to continue but at a slow pace.
Late in the third quarter, we began to retain conforming mortgages originated through our retail network to hold on the balance sheet. With the run-off in our securities book, our level of asset sensitivity has been getting a little higher than we'd like. We believe that it makes more sense in the current environment to retain our own production of mortgage loans rather than to sell them and simultaneously purchase securities from others. For the near term, this action will reduce our residential gain on sale revenues, which ultimately will be offset by higher net interest income in subsequent periods.
We're also thinking through the best approach to collateralized seasonal inflows of government deposits, to the extent that we choose to use repurchase agreements, we'd expect a modest benefit to net interest income in the future and the reduction of net interest margin by a few basis points.
Finally, 2 weeks ago, Allied Irish Banks took their initial steps to divest their shareholdings in M&T, that they held since we bought Allfirst Financial from them in 2003. In doing so, they sold $26.7 million notes convertible into 26.7 million shares of M&T stock following the approval of AIB shareholders. The notes were priced at $77.50 each, valuing them at 2.5x our June 30 tangible book value and $20.2 million of those notes were sold to 123  institutional investors, so $6.5 million of the notes were sold through the retail channel. We believe the successful completion of this offering demonstrates the strength of M&T's access to the capital markets.
In closing, I would remind you that all our projections a subject the number of uncertainties and various assumption regarding national and economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future. We'll now open up the call to questions, before, which Paula will briefly review the instructions."

We've not changed our thinking. We still have the same view of what the returns generally are on residential mortgage, especially given the role of standing, but having said that, we long sort of viewed residential mortgage as substitute for securities. They have the same profile and we lumped them all into our discretionary portfolio, so what is unusual today is that there's a big difference in both rates and yields and returns that you can get on mortgages and securities today, and so if you start thinking about it, it really doesn't make sense for us to be selling assets at the same time, we're buying them because we're basically just giving up the transaction spread. So economically, the best thing to sort of do to balance out your portfolio is just slow down the amount that you're selling. It sort of help to keep ourselves neutral, so it's the cheapest way to keep the balance sheet where we like it."

And then the second half of it, is your question is sort of what happens with capital, and as you know, we really won't find out probably for another 6 months exactly what the rules will be around that so I realized that they'll probably lose their capital content, but I guess the big question really is what is the sort of where all the rules around this grading and when you think of them and see, if you were so stack up our capital structure versus everybody's else, much more of our Tier 1 risk rate is capital or less a Tier 1 common equity is just depending upon common equity, so we're never -- with our likely thinking is going to be thinking about the risk grading of our balance sheet and in our minds, it's the risk grading today appropriate or do we need to have a different 1, which would basically mean maybe you'd hold more than residential mortgages or some other types of securities slightly. In terms of what we do with the rest of it, it depends on what the rules are, but it's all callable, so we would take it out if it was necessary, but I don't think you still have enough information around what the exact rules are going to be to make that decision today."

I think all that's happening, it's just happening in a much slower pace, so that's why I mentioned that the fact that if you looked at first, to second, second to third and then now, this last quarter, you see a moderation in the decline. The other thing that I think is relatively encouraging is that when we look at this quarter's decline, almost all of it on the commercial side is lower utilization, and I think what you're seeing is it kind of work our way across the commercial bank. We've seen, for example, in the mid-Atlantic, a number of customers who are paying down debt, repositioning themselves. We've seen in the commercial real estate space a number of pretty well, healed commercial real estate folks actually just looking at the liquidity in their portfolio, maybe signing down some projects to improve the overall liquidity position. But overall, our commitments are up. So I think people are just on hold. The rates are low, they're trying to lock in some credit today but they're not necessarily using it because they're not yet investing. I would guess that the trends continue to improve but I wouldn't expect a big spike up in loan growth all of a sudden. The other thing I'd point that is that in the volume of loans that went through our senior loan committee, they were higher than last quarter and the returns were better."

The continued positive trend was that C&I was down $17 million, so when we look at construction and development, this is a portfolio that we've marked before, or portfolio that we sort of taken we reserved for in the balance sheet and so there really no surprises there. So I think as Don has been saying for sometime, you're just going to get some lumpiness as we move our way and the things improve.

I believe with the last call this morning, among our regional and subregional peers, so when we're finished you can settle down and try to assess what it all means. I'd like to cover the highlights of the recent quarter, after which I'll take your questions. 
For the third quarter of 2010, diluted earnings per common share were $1.48, up from $1.46 in the previous quarter and $0.97 in the third quarter of 2009. Net income for the recent quarter was $192 million, up from $189 million in the linked quarter and $128 million in last year's third quarter.
Recall that our GAAP results for the third quarter of '09 included $9 million of after-tax merger-related benefit, arising from a gain on the Bradford Bank acquisition, which was partially offset by merger-related expenses arising from both the Provident and Bradford transactions. There were no merger-related expenses in this year's second quarter or third quarter. 
Our results for the third quarter of 2010 included after-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $8 million or $0.07 per share. This compares to $9 million and $0.07 per common share in the linked quarter and $10 million or $0.09 per common share in the year-ago quarter.
Net operating income, which excludes the amortization of intangibles, as well as the net merger-related benefit in last year's third quarter, was $200 million for the recent quarter, up from $198 million in the linked quarter and $129 million in last year's third quarter. Diluted net operating income per share was $1.55 for the third quarter of 2010, up from $1.53 per share in the prior quarter and up 58% from the $0.98 per share in last year's third quarter. And according to the SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contained a tabular reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results, including intangible assets and equity.
Turning to the balance sheet and income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $576 million for the third quarter, up from $573 million in the linked quarter and up 4% from $553 million in the third quarter of 2009. The net interest margin expanded slightly during the third quarter, rising to 3.87% from 3.84% in the second quarter of 2010 and was up 26 basis points from the 3.61% in last year's third quarter.
The yield on earnings assets was up about 2 basis points during the quarter, primarily reflecting favorable loan repricing. We also realized that benefit of prepayment penalties and the recognition of cash interest payments on non-accruing loans that was comparable to the levels that we saw in the second quarter. The cost of funds declined by 1 basis points, reflecting the benefit of a shift in mix of core deposits from time deposits to non-maturity savings product.
Looking forward, we seem to be on track with our previous comments back in January, that our full year margin would not likely be higher than 3.80% through 3.85%. Through the first 9 months of 2010, the margin was a 3.83%.
As for the balance sheet. Average earnings assets declined by an annualized 5% as compared to the second quarter of 2010, and this included the impact from $382 million decrease in investment securities and a $443 million or 3% annualized decline in average loan balances. On an end-of-period basis, total loans for this year's third quarter declined by $270 million or 2% annualized from the end of period of the prior quarter. On the same basis by category, C&I loans declined by $229 million or 7% annualized. Commercial real estate loans declined by $33 million or 1%. Consumer loans also declined by $33 million or 1%, while residential real estate loans grew by $25 million or 2%. 
Despite the overall pressure on loan volumes, we've seen a few encouraging signs. On an end-of-period basis, the pace of decline in total loans has slowed from rates seen in each of this year's first and second quarters. In the final month of the quarter, we saw a growth in commercial and industrial loan and stable commercial real estate loans. Finally, much of the quarterly decline appeared to be driven by lower utilization rates as overall commitments rose.
Turning to non-interest income, non-interest income was $290 million for the recent quarter, up from $274 million in the linked quarter, and the recent quarter's results included $8 million of securities losses compared with $22 million in the prior quarter. Mortgage banking fees were $61 million for the third quarter compared with $47 million in the linked quarter.
Origination volumes were 29 million -- excuse me. Origination volumes were up 29% during the recent quarter, reflecting in part the record low interest rates, while gain on sale margins widened further from this year's second quarter. Service charges on deposit accounts were $118 million during the recent quarter compared with $129 million in the linked quarter. The 9% decline was attributable to the implementation of the new Regulation E. The customer response to the new regulation has been consistent with or perhaps slightly better than our expectation. Our decision not to charge NSF fees on transactions less than $10 has had a negative impact on overall fees, but has met with the favorable response from our customers.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses, which exclude the amortization of tangible assets, were $467 million compared with $461 million in the linked quarter. This year's third quarter results included a $3 million addition to the impairment allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights. Compared with the $2 million addition in the allowance in the second quarter, last year's third quarter results included no adjustment to the impairment allowance.
The efficiency ratio, which excludes securities gains and losses, as well as intangible amortization, was 53.4% in the third quarter, up just slightly from the 53.1% in the linked quarter.
Next, let's turn to credit. Overall, credit trends remained stable with the linked quarter and considerably improved from the prior year. Criticized and classified loans declined for the fourth consecutive quarter. Non-accrual loans were $1.1 billion or 2.16% of loans at the end of the recent quarter compared with $1.09 billion or 2.13% of loans at the end of the previous quarter. 
Foreclosed assets were unchanged from the previous quarter at quarter end at $193 million. The nonperforming asset ratio, which is nonperforming assets divided by total loans plus real estate and other foreclosed assets, was 2.53% as of September 30, 2010, compared with 2.50% at June 30.
Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of loans were 73 basis points in the third quarter compared with 64 basis points in the linked quarter. For the 9 months ended September 30, annualized net charge-offs were 70 basis points, down from 100 basis points in the year earlier period.
Net charge-offs for commercial and industrial loans were $33 million in the linked quarter compared with $9 million -- in the third quarter compared with $9 million in the linked quarter. Net charge offs for residential builder construction loans were $11 million for the recent quarter compared with $17 million in the prior quarter.
Net charge-offs for all other commercial real estate loans were $7 million, down from $19 million in the second quarter. Net charge-offs in residential real estate loans were $17 million in the third quarter compared to $13 million in the linked quarter, and net charge-offs on consumer loans were $25 million in the third quarter compared to $24 million in the linked quarter.
The provision for credit losses was $93 million in the third quarter compared with $85 million in the linked quarter. The allowance for loan losses was unchanged at $895 million at the end of the third quarter. The ratio of allowance to credit losses to legacy M&T loans, which excludes acquired loans that were marked to fair value at the acquisition, was also unchanged at 1.86% as compared to June 30. The loan loss allowance as of September 30 was 2.4x annual net charge-offs for the recent quarter and 2.5x annualized net charge-offs year-to-date.
We disclosed loans past due 90 days but still accruing separately from non-accrual loans because they are deemed to be well secured and in the process of collection, which is to say that there is a minimal risk of principal loss. In our case, that's particularly true. Loans 90 days past due were $215 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these, $194 million or 90% are guaranteed by government-related entities. Those figures were $203 million and $188 million, respectively, at the end of June.
M&T's tangible common equity ratio was 5.96% at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 21 basis points from 5.75% at the end of June. The Tier 1 common ratio was an estimated 6.4% as of the end of the recent quarter, improved from 6.15% at the end of the second quarter.
Turning to our outlook. M&T's credit trends continue to compare favorably with those of the industry overall, and we're seeing signs that the economy continues to stabilize, although unemployment remains high. The decline in loan volumes has continued to moderate, and we expect that trend to continue but at a slow pace.
Late in the third quarter, we began to retain conforming mortgages originated through our retail network to hold on the balance sheet. With the run-off in our securities book, our level of asset sensitivity has been getting a little higher than we like. We believe that it makes more sense in the current environment to retain our own production of mortgage loans rather than to sell them and simultaneously purchase securities from others. For the near term, this action will reduce our residential gain on sale revenues, which ultimately will be offset by higher net interest income in subsequent periods.
We're also thinking through the best approach to collateralize seasonal inflows of government deposits. And to the extent that we choose to use repurchase agreements, we'd expect a modest benefit to net interest income in the future and the reduction of net -- in the net interest margin by a few basis points.
Finally, 2 weeks ago, Allied Irish Banks took their initial steps to divest their shareholdings in M&T that they've held since we bought Allfirst Financial from them in 2003. In doing so, they sold 26.7 million notes convertible into 26.7 million shares of M&T stock following the approval by AIB shareholders. The notes were priced at $77.50 each, valuing them at 2.5x our June 30 tangible book value and 20.2 million of those notes were sold to 123 institutional investors, so 6.5 million of the notes were sold through the retail channel. We believe the successful completion of this offering demonstrates the strength of M&T's access to the capital markets.
In closing, I would remind you that all of our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors, which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future. We'll now open up the call to questions, before which Paula will briefly review the instructions."

I think that we don't have a difference in change. We've not changed our thinking. We still have the same view of what the returns generally are on residential mortgage, given the role -- especially given the role of Freddie and Fannie, but having said that, we long sort of viewed residential mortgage as substitute for securities. They have the same profile, and we lumped them all into our discretionary portfolio. So what is unusual today is that there's a big difference in both rates and yields and returns that you can get on mortgages and securities today. And so if you start thinking about it, it really doesn't make sense for us to be selling assets at the same time we're buying them because we're basically just giving up the transaction spread. So economically, the best thing to sort of do to balance out your portfolio is just slow down the amount that you're selling, and it sort of helps keep ourselves neutral. So it's the cheapest way to keep the balance sheet where we'd like it."

So I realized that they'll probably lose their capital content, but I guess the big question really is what is the sort of -- what are all the rules around risk-weighting. And when you think of them and see, if you were to sort of stack up our capital structure versus everybody else, much more of our Tier 1 risk-weighted capital or let's say Tier 1 common equity is just dependent upon common equity, right, so we've never -- what our likely thinking is going to be to think about the risk-weighting of our balance sheet. And in our minds, is the risk-weighting today appropriate, or do we need to have a different one, which would basically mean maybe you'd hold more residential mortgages or some other types of securities slightly. In terms of what we do with the rest of it, it depends on what the rules are, but it's all callable, so we would take it out if it was necessary. But I don't think you still have enough information around what the exact rules are going to be to make that decision today."

I think all of that is happening. It's just happening in a much slower pace. So that's why I mentioned the fact that if you look at first, to second, second to third, and then now, this last quarter, you see a moderation in the decline. The other thing that I think is relatively encouraging is that when we look at this quarter's decline, almost all of it on the commercial side is lower utilization, and I think what you're seeing is we're kind of working our way across the commercial bank. We've seen, for example, in the mid-Atlantic, a number of customers who are paying down debt, repositioning themselves. We've seen in the commercial real estate space a number of pretty well-healed commercial real estate folks actually just looking at the liquidity in their portfolio, maybe selling down some projects to improve the overall liquidity position. But overall, our commitments are up. So I think people are just on hold. The rates are low; they're trying to lock in some credit today, but they're not necessarily using it because they're not yet investing. And I would guess that the trends will continue to improve, but I wouldn't expect a big spike up in loan growth all of a sudden. The other thing I'd point out is that in the volume of loans that went through our senior loan committee, they were higher than last quarter, and the returns were better."

And I think what's most interesting to me is that in that $9 million increase, there was a $27 million increase in construction and development. And of that $27 million increase in construction and development, $15 million came from the Provident loans in the mark-to-market, right, so you're not going to see a lot of content coming from there. The continued positive trend was that C&I was down $17 million; right? So when we look at construction and development, this is a portfolio that we've marked before, or a portfolio that we've sort of taken -- we reserved for in the balance sheet. And so there are really no surprises there. So I think as Don has been saying for sometime, you're just going to get some lumpiness as we move our way and things improve. It will take some time, and this is one of the quarters where we saw some more of the C&D actually fall from the classified book into nonperforming."

We don't see any problem with rolling them over, but pretty much, we don't expect much of a change. I would say if you look 12 months out maybe we will lessen them over and use a little bit more short term, but I don't expect much of a change, and the borrowing costs really hasn't changed much for the last 6 months in those periods because LIBOR has been flat, and they're all LIBOR-based borrowings."

I believe we‚Äôre the last call this morning among our regional and superregional peers, so when we're finished, you can settle down and try to assess what it all means. I'd like to cover the highlights of the recent quarter, after which I'll take your questions. 
For the third quarter of 2010, diluted earnings per common share were $1.48, up from $1.46 in the previous quarter and $0.97 in the third quarter of 2009. Net income for the recent quarter was $192 million, up from $189 million in the linked quarter and $128 million in last year's third quarter.
Recall that our GAAP results for the third quarter of '09 included $9 million of after-tax merger-related benefit, arising from a gain on the Bradford Bank acquisition, which was partially offset by merger-related expenses arising from both the Provident and Bradford transactions. There were no merger-related expenses in this year's second quarter or third quarter. 
Our results for the third quarter of 2010 included after-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $8 million or $0.07 per share. This compares to $9 million and $0.07 per common share in the linked quarter and $10 million or $0.09 per common share in the year-ago quarter.
Net operating income, which excludes the amortization of intangibles, as well as the net merger-related benefit in last year's third quarter, was $200 million for the recent quarter, up from $198 million in the linked quarter and $129 million in last year's third quarter. Diluted net operating income per share was $1.55 for the third quarter of 2010, up from $1.53 per share in the prior quarter and up 58% from the $0.98 per share in last year's third quarter. In accordance with SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contained a tabular reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.
Turning to the balance sheet and income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $576 million for the third quarter, up from $573 million in the linked quarter and up 4% from $553 million in the third quarter of 2009. The net interest margin expanded slightly during the third quarter, rising to 3.87% from 3.84% in the second quarter of 2010 and was up 26 basis points from the 3.61% in last year's third quarter.
The yield on earnings assets was up about 2 basis points during the quarter, primarily reflecting favorable loan repricing. We also realized the benefit of prepayment penalties and the recognition of cash interest payments on non-accruing loans that was comparable to the levels that we saw in the second quarter. The cost of funds declined by 1 basis point, reflecting the benefit of a shift in mix of core deposits from time deposits to non-maturity savings product.
Looking forward, we seem to be on track with our previous comments back in January, that our full year margin would not likely be higher than 3.80% through 3.85%. Through the first 9 months of 2010, the margin was 3.83%.
As for the balance sheet. Average earnings assets declined by an annualized 5% as compared to the second quarter of 2010, and this included the impact from a $382 million decrease in investment securities and a $443 million or 3% annualized decline in average loan balances. On an end-of-period basis, total loans for this year's third quarter declined by $270 million or 2% annualized from the end of period of the prior quarter. On the same basis by category, C&I loans declined by $229 million or 7% annualized. Commercial real estate loans declined by $33 million or 1%. Consumer loans also declined by $33 million or 1%, while residential real estate loans grew by $25 million or 2%. 
Despite the overall pressure on loan volumes, we've seen a few encouraging signs. On an end-of-period basis, the pace of decline in total loans has slowed from rates seen in each of this year's first and second quarters. In the final month of the quarter, we saw a growth in commercial and industrial loans and stable commercial real estate loans. Finally, much of the quarterly decline appeared to be driven by lower utilization rates as overall commitments rose.
Turning to non-interest income, non-interest income was $290 million for the recent quarter, up from $274 million in the linked quarter, and the recent quarter's results included $8 million of securities losses compared with $22 million in the prior quarter. Mortgage banking fees were $61 million for the third quarter compared with $47 million in the linked quarter.
Origination volumes were 29 million -- excuse me. Origination volumes were up 29% during the recent quarter, reflecting in part the record low interest rates, while gain on sale margins widened further from this year's second quarter. Service charges on deposit accounts were $118 million during the recent quarter compared with $129 million in the linked quarter. The 9% decline was attributable to the implementation of the new Regulation E. The customer response to the new regulation has been consistent with or perhaps slightly better than our expectations. Our decision not to charge NSF fees on transactions less than $10 has had a negative impact on overall fees but has met with a favorable response from our customers.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets, were $467 million compared with $461 million in the linked quarter. This year's third quarter results included a $3 million addition to the impairment allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights. Compared with the $2 million addition in the allowance in the second quarter, last year's third quarter results included no adjustment to the impairment allowance.
The efficiency ratio, which excludes securities gains and losses, as well as intangible amortization, was 53.4% in the third quarter, up just slightly from the 53.1% in the linked quarter.
Next, let's turn to credit. Overall, credit trends remained stable with the linked quarter and considerably improved from the prior year. Criticized and classified loans declined for the fourth consecutive quarter. Non-accrual loans were $1.1 billion or 2.16% of loans at the end of the recent quarter compared with $1.09 billion or 2.13% of loans at the end of the previous quarter. 
Foreclosed assets were unchanged from the previous quarter at quarter end at $193 million. The nonperforming asset ratio, which is nonperforming assets divided by total loans plus real estate and other foreclosed assets, was 2.53% as of September 30, 2010, compared with 2.50% at June 30.
Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of loans were 73 basis points in the third quarter compared with 64 basis points in the linked quarter. For the 9 months ended September 30, annualized net charge-offs were 70 basis points, down from 100 basis points in the year earlier period.
Net charge-offs for commercial and industrial loans were $33 million in the linked quarter compared with $9 million -- in the third quarter compared with $9 million in the linked quarter. Net charge offs for residential builder construction loans were $11 million for the recent quarter compared with $17 million in the prior quarter.
Net charge-offs for all other commercial real estate loans were $7 million, down from $19 million in the second quarter. Net charge-offs in residential real estate loans were $17 million in the third quarter compared to $13 million in the linked quarter, and net charge-offs on consumer loans were $25 million in the third quarter compared to $24 million in the linked quarter.
The provision for credit losses was $93 million in the third quarter compared with $85 million in the linked quarter. The allowance for loan losses was unchanged at $895 million at the end of the third quarter. The ratio of allowance to credit losses to legacy M&T loans, which excludes acquired loans that were marked to fair value at the acquisition, was also unchanged at 1.86% as compared to June 30. The loan loss allowance as of September 30 was 2.4x annual net charge-offs for the recent quarter and 2.5x annualized net charge-offs year-to-date.
We disclosed loans past due 90 days but still accruing separately from non-accrual loans because they are deemed to be well secured and in the process of collection, which is to say that there is a minimal risk of principal loss. In our case, that's particularly true. Loans 90 days past due were $215 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these, $194 million or 90% are guaranteed by government-related entities. Those figures were $203 million and $188 million, respectively, at the end of June.
M&T's tangible common equity ratio was 5.96% at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 21 basis points from 5.75% at the end of June. The Tier 1 common ratio was an estimated 6.4% as of the end of the recent quarter, improved from 6.15% at the end of the second quarter.
Turning to our outlook. M&T's credit trends continue to compare favorably with those of the industry overall, and we're seeing signs that the economy continues to stabilize, although unemployment remains high. The decline in loan volumes has continued to moderate, and we expect that trend to continue but at a slow pace.
Late in the third quarter, we began to retain conforming mortgages originated through our retail network to hold on the balance sheet. With the run-off in our securities book, our level of asset sensitivity has been getting a little higher than we like. We believe that it makes more sense in the current environment to retain our own production of mortgage loans rather than to sell them and simultaneously purchase securities from others. For the near term, this action will reduce our residential gain on sale revenues, which ultimately will be offset by higher net interest income in subsequent periods.
We're also thinking through the best approach to collateralize seasonal inflows of government deposits. And to the extent that we choose to use repurchase agreements, we'd expect a modest benefit to net interest income in the future and a reduction of net -- in the net interest margin by a few basis points.
Finally, 2 weeks ago, Allied Irish Banks took their initial steps to divest their shareholdings in M&T that they've held since we bought Allfirst Financial from them in 2003. In doing so, they sold 26.7 million notes convertible into 26.7 million shares of M&T stock following the approval by AIB shareholders. The notes were priced at $77.50 each, valuing them at 2.5x our June 30 tangible book value, and 20.2 million of those notes were sold to 123 institutional investors. Some 6.5 million of the notes were sold through the retail channel. We believe the successful completion of this offering demonstrates the strength of M&T's access to the capital markets.
In closing, I would remind you that all of our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future. We'll now open up the call to questions, before which Paula will briefly review the instructions."

I think that we don't have a difference in change. We've not changed our thinking. We still have the same view of what the returns generally are on residential mortgage, given the role -- especially given the role of Freddie and Fannie, but having said that, we long sort of viewed residential mortgage as substitutes for securities. They have the same profile, and we lump them all into our discretionary portfolio. So what is unusual today is that there's a big difference in both rates and yields and returns that you can get on mortgages and securities today. And so if you start thinking about it, it really doesn't make sense for us to be selling assets at the same time we're buying them because we're basically just giving up the transaction spread. So economically, the best thing to sort of do to balance out your portfolio is to just slow down the amount that you're selling, and it sort of helps keep ourselves neutral. So it's the cheapest way to keep the balance sheet where we'd like it."

So I realize that they'll probably lose their capital content, but I guess the big question really is what is the sort of -- what are all the rules around risk-weighting. And when you think of M&T, if you were to sort of stack up our capital structure versus everybody else, much more of our Tier 1 risk-weighted capital or let's say Tier 1 common equity is just dependent upon common equity, right, so we've never -- what our likely thinking is going to be to think about the risk-weighting of our balance sheet. And in our minds, is the risk-weighting today appropriate, or do we need to have a different one, which would basically mean maybe you'd hold more residential mortgages or some other types of securities slightly? In terms of what we do with the rest of it, it depends on what the rules are, but it's all callable, so we would take it out if it was necessary. But I don't think you still have enough information around what the exact rules are going to be to make that decision today."

I think all of that is happening. It's just happening at a much slower pace. So that's why I mentioned the fact that if you look at first, to second, second to third, and then now, this last quarter, you see a moderation in the decline. The other thing that I think is relatively encouraging is that when we look at this quarter's decline, almost all of it on the commercial side is lower utilization, and I think what you're seeing, if we kind of work our way across the commercial bank, we've seen, for example, in the mid-Atlantic, a number of customers who are paying down debt, repositioning themselves. We've seen in the commercial real estate space a number of pretty well-healed commercial real estate folks actually just looking at the liquidity in their portfolio and maybe selling down some projects to improve the overall liquidity position. But overall, our commitments are up. So I think people are just on hold. The rates are low. They're trying to lock in some credit today, but they're not necessarily using it because they're not yet investing. And I would guess that the trends will continue to improve, but I wouldn't expect a big spike up in loan growth all of a sudden. The other thing I would point out is that in the volume of loans that went through our senior loan committee, they were higher than last quarter, and the returns were better."

The continued positive trend was that C&I was down $33 million, all right? So when we look at construction and development, either this is a portfolio that we've marked before or a portfolio that we've sort of taken -- we reserved for on the balance sheet. And so there are really no surprises there. So I think as Don has been saying for some time, you're just going to get some lumpiness as we move our way and things improve.

Thank you for joining us on the call today.

I believe we‚Äôre the last call this morning among our regional and superregional peers, so when we're finished, you can settle down and try to assess what it all means. I'd like to cover the highlights of the recent quarter, after which I'll take your questions. 
For the third quarter of 2010, diluted earnings per common share were $1.48, up from $1.46 in the previous quarter and $0.97 in the third quarter of 2009. Net income for the recent quarter was $192 million, up from $189 million in the linked quarter and $128 million in last year's third quarter.
Recall that our GAAP results for the third quarter of '09 included $9 million of after-tax merger-related benefit, arising from a gain on the Bradford Bank acquisition, which was partially offset by merger-related expenses arising from both the Provident and Bradford transactions. There were no merger-related expenses in this year's second quarter or third quarter. 
Our results for the third quarter of 2010 included after-tax expense from the amortization of intangible assets amounting to $8 million or $0.07 per share. This compares to $9 million and $0.07 per common share in the linked quarter and $10 million or $0.09 per common share in the year-ago quarter.
Net operating income, which excludes the amortization of intangibles, as well as the net merger-related benefit in last year's third quarter, was $200 million for the recent quarter, up from $198 million in the linked quarter and $129 million in last year's third quarter. Diluted net operating income per share was $1.55 for the third quarter of 2010, up from $1.53 per share in the prior quarter and up 58% from the $0.98 per share in last year's third quarter. In accordance with SEC guidelines, this morning's press release contained a tabular reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results, including tangible assets and equity.
Turning to the balance sheet and income statement. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $576 million for the third quarter, up from $573 million in the linked quarter and up 4% from $553 million in the third quarter of 2009. The net interest margin expanded slightly during the third quarter, rising to 3.87% from 3.84% in the second quarter of 2010 and was up 26 basis points from the 3.61% in last year's third quarter.
The yield on earnings assets was up about 2 basis points during the quarter, primarily reflecting favorable loan repricing. We also realized the benefit of prepayment penalties and the recognition of cash interest payments on non-accruing loans that was comparable to the levels that we saw in the second quarter. The cost of funds declined by 1 basis point, reflecting the benefit of a shift in mix of core deposits from time deposits to non-maturity savings product.
Looking forward, we seem to be on track with our previous comments back in January, that our full year margin would not likely be higher than 3.80% through 3.85%. Through the first 9 months of 2010, the margin was 3.83%.
As for the balance sheet. Average earnings assets declined by an annualized 5% as compared to the second quarter of 2010, and this included the impact from a $382 million decrease in investment securities and a $443 million or 3% annualized decline in average loan balances. On an end-of-period basis, total loans for this year's third quarter declined by $270 million or 2% annualized from the end of period of the prior quarter. On the same basis by category, C&I loans declined by $229 million or 7% annualized. Commercial real estate loans declined by $33 million or 1%. Consumer loans also declined by $33 million or 1%, while residential real estate loans grew by $25 million or 2%. 
Despite the overall pressure on loan volumes, we've seen a few encouraging signs. On an end-of-period basis, the pace of decline in total loans has slowed from rates seen in each of this year's first and second quarters. In the final month of the quarter, we saw a growth in commercial and industrial loans and stable commercial real estate loans. Finally, much of the quarterly decline appeared to be driven by lower utilization rates as overall commitments rose.
Turning to non-interest income, non-interest income was $290 million for the recent quarter, up from $274 million in the linked quarter, and the recent quarter's results included $8 million of securities losses compared with $22 million in the prior quarter. Mortgage banking fees were $61 million for the third quarter compared with $47 million in the linked quarter.
Origination volumes were 29 million -- excuse me. Origination volumes were up 29% during the recent quarter, reflecting in part the record low interest rates, while gain on sale margins widened further from this year's second quarter. Service charges on deposit accounts were $118 million during the recent quarter compared with $129 million in the linked quarter. The 9% decline was attributable to the implementation of the new Regulation E. The customer response to the new regulation has been consistent with or perhaps slightly better than our expectations. Our decision not to charge NSF fees on transactions less than $10 has had a negative impact on overall fees but has met with a favorable response from our customers.
Turning to expenses. Operating expenses, which exclude the amortization of intangible assets, were $467 million compared with $461 million in the linked quarter. This year's third quarter results included a $3 million addition to the impairment allowance for capitalized mortgage servicing rights. Compared with the $2 million addition in the allowance in the second quarter, last year's third quarter results included no adjustment to the impairment allowance.
The efficiency ratio, which excludes securities gains and losses, as well as intangible amortization, was 53.4% in the third quarter, up just slightly from the 53.1% in the linked quarter.
Next, let's turn to credit. Overall, credit trends remained stable with the linked quarter and considerably improved from the prior year. Criticized and classified loans declined for the fourth consecutive quarter. Non-accrual loans were $1.1 billion or 2.16% of loans at the end of the recent quarter compared with $1.09 billion or 2.13% of loans at the end of the previous quarter. 
Foreclosed assets were unchanged from the previous quarter at quarter end at $193 million. The nonperforming asset ratio, which is nonperforming assets divided by total loans plus real estate and other foreclosed assets, was 2.53% as of September 30, 2010, compared with 2.50% at June 30.
Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of loans were 73 basis points in the third quarter compared with 64 basis points in the linked quarter. For the 9 months ended September 30, annualized net charge-offs were 70 basis points, down from 100 basis points in the year earlier period.
Net charge-offs for commercial and industrial loans were $33 million in the linked quarter compared with $9 million -- in the third quarter compared with $9 million in the linked quarter. Net charge offs for residential builder construction loans were $11 million for the recent quarter compared with $17 million in the prior quarter.
Net charge-offs for all other commercial real estate loans were $7 million, down from $19 million in the second quarter. Net charge-offs in residential real estate loans were $17 million in the third quarter compared to $13 million in the linked quarter, and net charge-offs on consumer loans were $25 million in the third quarter compared to $24 million in the linked quarter.
The provision for credit losses was $93 million in the third quarter compared with $85 million in the linked quarter. The allowance for loan losses was unchanged at $895 million at the end of the third quarter. The ratio of allowance to credit losses to legacy M&T loans, which excludes acquired loans that were marked to fair value at the acquisition, was also unchanged at 1.86% as compared to June 30. The loan loss allowance as of September 30 was 2.4x annual net charge-offs for the recent quarter and 2.5x annualized net charge-offs year-to-date.
We disclosed loans past due 90 days but still accruing separately from non-accrual loans because they are deemed to be well secured and in the process of collection, which is to say that there is a minimal risk of principal loss. In our case, that's particularly true. Loans 90 days past due were $215 million at the end of the recent quarter. Of these, $194 million or 90% are guaranteed by government-related entities. Those figures were $203 million and $188 million, respectively, at the end of June.
M&T's tangible common equity ratio was 5.96% at the end of the third quarter, an increase of 21 basis points from 5.75% at the end of June. The Tier 1 common ratio was an estimated 6.4% as of the end of the recent quarter, improved from 6.15% at the end of the second quarter.
Turning to our outlook. M&T's credit trends continue to compare favorably with those of the industry overall, and we're seeing signs that the economy continues to stabilize, although unemployment remains high. The decline in loan volumes has continued to moderate, and we expect that trend to continue but at a slow pace.
Late in the third quarter, we began to retain conforming mortgages originated through our retail network to hold on the balance sheet. With the run-off in our securities book, our level of asset sensitivity has been getting a little higher than we like. We believe that it makes more sense in the current environment to retain our own production of mortgage loans rather than to sell them and simultaneously purchase securities from others. For the near term, this action will reduce our residential gain on sale revenues, which ultimately will be offset by higher net interest income in subsequent periods.
We're also thinking through the best approach to collateralize seasonal inflows of government deposits. And to the extent that we choose to use repurchase agreements, we'd expect a modest benefit to net interest income in the future and a reduction of net -- in the net interest margin by a few basis points.
Finally, 2 weeks ago, Allied Irish Banks took their initial steps to divest their shareholdings in M&T that they've held since we bought Allfirst Financial from them in 2003. In doing so, they sold 26.7 million notes convertible into 26.7 million shares of M&T stock following the approval by AIB shareholders. The notes were priced at $77.50 each, valuing them at 2.5x our June 30 tangible book value, and 20.2 million of those notes were sold to 123 institutional investors. Some 6.5 million of the notes were sold through the retail channel. We believe the successful completion of this offering demonstrates the strength of M&T's access to the capital markets.
In closing, I would remind you that all of our projections are subject to a number of uncertainties and various assumptions regarding national and regional economic growth, changes in interest rates, political events and other macroeconomic factors which may differ materially from what actually unfolds in the future. We'll now open up the call to questions, before which Paula will briefly review the instructions."

I think that we don't have a difference in change. We've not changed our thinking. We still have the same view of what the returns generally are on residential mortgage, given the role -- especially given the role of Freddie and Fannie, but having said that, we long sort of viewed residential mortgage as substitutes for securities. They have the same profile, and we lump them all into our discretionary portfolio. So what is unusual today is that there's a big difference in both rates and yields and returns that you can get on mortgages and securities today. And so if you start thinking about it, it really doesn't make sense for us to be selling assets at the same time we're buying them because we're basically just giving up the transaction spread. So economically, the best thing to sort of do to balance out your portfolio is to just slow down the amount that you're selling, and it sort of helps keep ourselves neutral. So it's the cheapest way to keep the balance sheet where we'd like it."

And then the second part of that, second half of it is, your question is, sort of what happens with capital, and as you know, we really won't find out probably for another 6 months exactly what the rules will be around that. So I realize that they'll probably lose their capital content, but I guess the big question really is what is the sort of -- what are all the rules around risk-weighting. And when you think of M&T, if you were to sort of stack up our capital structure versus everybody else, much more of our Tier 1 risk-weighted capital or let's say Tier 1 common equity is just dependent upon common equity, right, so we've never -- what our likely thinking is going to be to think about the risk-weighting of our balance sheet. And in our minds, is the risk-weighting today appropriate, or do we need to have a different one, which would basically mean maybe you'd hold more residential mortgages or some other types of securities slightly? In terms of what we do with the rest of it, it depends on what the rules are, but it's all callable, so we would take it out if it was necessary. But I don't think you still have enough information around what the exact rules are going to be to make that decision today."

I think all of that is happening. It's just happening at a much slower pace. So that's why I mentioned the fact that if you look at first, to second, second to third, and then now, this last quarter, you see a moderation in the decline. The other thing that I think is relatively encouraging is that when we look at this quarter's decline, almost all of it on the commercial side is lower utilization, and I think what you're seeing, if we kind of work our way across the commercial bank, we've seen, for example, in the mid-Atlantic, a number of customers who are paying down debt, repositioning themselves. We've seen in the commercial real estate space a number of pretty well-healed commercial real estate folks actually just looking at the liquidity in their portfolio and maybe selling down some projects to improve the overall liquidity position. But overall, our commitments are up. So I think people are just on hold. The rates are low. They're trying to lock in some credit today, but they're not necessarily using it because they're not yet investing. And I would guess that the trends will continue to improve, but I wouldn't expect a big spike up in loan growth all of a sudden. The other thing I would point out is that in the volume of loans that went through our senior loan committee, they were higher than last quarter, and the returns were better."

And I think what's most interesting to me is that in that $9 million increase, there was a $27 million increase in construction and development. And of that $27 million increase in construction and development, $15 million came from the Provident loans in the mark-to-market, right, so you're not going to see a lot of loss content coming from that. The continued positive trend was that C&I was down $33 million, all right? So when we look at construction and development, either this is a portfolio that we've marked before or a portfolio that we've sort of taken -- we reserved for on the balance sheet. And so there are really no surprises there. So I think as Don has been saying for some time, you're just going to get some lumpiness as we move our way and things improve. It will take some time, and this is one of the quarters where we saw some more of the C&D actually fall from the classified book into nonperforming."

And then we had some smaller sort of $4 million or less in terms of charge-offs around companies who are manufacturers, providers of entertainment -- not entertainment businesses but smaller venues. So there isn't really a theme in the C&I book. As I said, the overall seems to be improving in the middle market space. I think it's interesting you mentioned small business because that's sort of the one place as we look over quarter-over-quarter where you really don't see much, if any, improvement in the business banking space. In fact, I think our charge-offs in the business banking were probably went from like -- something like $12 million to $15 million, right? And what you're seeing there is that as the economy remains very, very slow, there's uncertainty, those are the guys that are most affected. And as the length of the downturn remains very long, you just continue to put more and more pressure on those small businesses. For us, as you can see, kind of $12 million to $15 million is not really all that material, but it does tell you a lot about the broader economy. That's where all the jobs come from, right?"
