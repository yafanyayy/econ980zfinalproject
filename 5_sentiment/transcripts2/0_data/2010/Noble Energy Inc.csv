I thought maybe it would be helpful to step back a bit as we open this call up and take a big picture look at 2009. There certainly are a number of things to reflect upon. It's certainly easy to predict -- forget the predicament all of us were facing at this time a year ago, probably because most of us has spent all year trying to forget them. But in reflection, I believe we at Noble Energy made some of our best decisions ever as we entered into 2009, decisions that were certainly not made easily and not without pain.First of all, we knew a year ago at this time that we are experiencing an incredible run of exploration success. Success that was delivering formidable inventory of major projects to us. These projects certainly have the potential to bring huge growth to our company over the next decade. I think second at that time, it was clear that we were bearish on U.S. natural gas. As a result, it made no sense for us to spend a lot of money drilling up our U.S. gas inventory in the environment that we face. So at the beginning of last year, we cut capital. We cut it hard. Initially from $2.3 billion in 2008 to $1.6 billion. And later, we lowered our 2009 budget to $1.4 billion. And then we held the line. Actually ending 2009 at $1.3 billion. Hardest hit with these reductions were our U.S. onshore programs, which suffered close to a 40% cut in organic spending last year from the 2008 level.Looking back, I believe we would make these calls over and over again. These decisions kept us positioned well to execute our major project program. We're able to generate free cash flow for the year, strengthen our balance sheet, ending with a debt-to-book capital ratio, net of cash, of 14%. And we retained substantial financial firepower, which opened the door to make, what I believe, was a great acquisition at the end of the year. So I think, we can't be happier with where we are today.Of course, the offset was that we had to take a time out on growth. Onshore in the U.S., even with the severe capital cuts, we are able to grow our volumes led by our liquid-rich Wattenberg field. We also increased our onshore footprint, adding to our large acreage positions and increasing our core Wattenberg and the growing DJ Basin opportunity set. And we achieved positive initial results on our East Texas Haynesville program, while our teams continue to improve drilling time in a number of plays throughout our portfolio.In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, exploration results at Santa Cruz and the subsequent sanctioning of the old development at Galapagos are important steps for Noble Energy. Success at the deepwater lease sale also allowed us to increase our inventory of exploration prospects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which now contain more than $1.6 billion barrels of net unrisked potential resources. Late in the year, we initiated drilling on two significant exploration prospects from this portfolio.Internationally, we had tremendous exploration success in Israel, with our largest discovery ever at Tamar and the subsequent Dalit find. Contracting for the sale of Tamar's resources is ongoing. We announced signed letters of intent covering some $10.5 billion in gross expected revenues with less than a third of the resources committed. And we immediately moved forward with the development plans that should lead to the sanction of Tamar this year.  In Equatorial Guinea, we had an oil discovery at Carmen and we sanctioned our first West African project, the Aseng oil field.Even with our significantly reduced capital program from a drill bit perspective, we'll be able to replace production with new reserves. However, that's only half the story as the new rules require average pricing and at proved and undeveloped reserves be developed within five years drove one-time negative revisions for us. I believe, we have taken an appropriately conservative position, especially regarding the proven undeveloped rule, but time will tell. Regardless, these revisions which shifted proven reserves to probable are expected to reverse back to proven with higher gas prices and continued development. In addition, we have just now started to book some reserves from our recent exploration successes, and we would expect significant reserve additions in 2010. Dave will be covering this a bit more later in the call.With that, let's touch on the fourth quarter results before going to our outlook for 2010. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter 2009 was $178 million or $1.01 per share diluted after removing the adjustment items. By now, you're familiar with the unrealized mark-to-market impacts on us and I won't go through those, nor will I spend any time on the return of deepwater royalty payments due to the resolution of some litigation that's been well-publicized and benefited a number of oil and gas producers during this period. But I did want to quickly comment on the impairment items. In the U.S., we impaired two gas properties. One was Paxton in the New Albany shale, and that was due to the reduced gas pricing outlook. The other was our Raton gas development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico where we experienced a mechanical failure on a gravel pack that affected well performance there.Outside the U.S., we took a hard look at Ecuador, given the increasingly unsettled economic and political environment there, as well as recent actions by the government that could lead to termination of our production sharing contract. While will certainly vigorously act to protect our interests, we determined that on a risk-weighted basis, the carrying value of our Ecuador investments exceeded the fair value. And we wrote it down accordingly.Sales volumes for the fourth quarter averaged 206,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down slightly from our expectations, primarily due to our North Sea and Israel properties. In the North Sea, lower-than-expected oil volumes resulted from the timing of the FPSO repairs and the completion of the field optimization work at Dumbarton. Fortunately, those repairs have now been completed. And also the first well at Lochranza is online as well. Natural gas volumes in the Israel were lower than expected. This was due to a couple of reasons. One was warmer-than-normal weather. Also, we had increased imports of competing Egyptian gas. And also, our customer there, Israel Electric, had some downtime on one of their power plants.Volumes in West Africa remained stable for both liquids and natural gas. And in the U.S., we continue to have strong liquid production from our deepwater properties and from our liquid-focused drilling programs onshore. Overall, our results continue to be supported by good exposure to liquids, which ultimately make up about 40% of our total volumes. Higher natural gas liquids prices continue and enhance our net nat [natural] gas prices in certain U.S. locations, and higher oil prices have helped us in Israel. In fact, our national gas pricing in Israel this past quarter was a record for us.With respect to cost, we wrapped up a good year of performance in the fourth quarter. Our lease operating expense, DD&A, exploration, G&A, all came in generally in line with our expectations. Our effective tax rate for the quarter on an adjusted basis was a little lower than guidance.Capital expenditures for the quarter were $384 million, making the total for 2009 just over $1.3 billion. With discretionary cash flow for the year of nearly $1.7 billion, we generated about $375 million of free cash flow, certainly a very impressive result given the environment and challenges we faced this past year. Total debt at the end of the year was down to $2 billion, and we ended the year with $2.7 billion in liquidity. That's between our cash and our available credit facility.Before touching on our capital and guidance, let me just mention four key objectives that really frame our 2010 programs. First is that we want to make sure that we progress the development and assessment of our major projects. These are clearly our most leveraging investments. Second on the list is to maintain our strong existing production base. Such that when the major projects do come on stream, that they deliver true incremental growth. Third is to continue the momentum from exploration. And in that regard, we'll be testing high-impact opportunities in all three of our main exploration basins this year. And finally, we want to make sure we retain our strong financial capacity.These objectives are what we are focused on as we move our company forward this year. And I think we are in excellent position to deliver in all of those. In 2010, our capital program is planned to be $2.5 billion and of course, excludes the purchase price for the DJ Basin assets. And it also excludes the non-cash capital that's being accrued for the Aseng FPSO's capitalized lease. We continue to increase the allocation of our capital to long-term investments. Our major projects development and exploration capital will make up some 60% of our program in 2010, up from just over 40% last year. The execution of our major projects come with significant capital outlays of about $1 billion in 2010 but of course, the majority being allocated to Galapagos, Aseng and Tamara. Galapagos is expected to come on production next year and both Aseng and Tamara, in the following year in 2012.20% of our capital program in 2010 are about $500 million, just focused on exploration and appraisal activities, targeting an estimated 700 million barrels of net unrisked new resources that we could potentially add to the portfolio. This represents a continued commitment to a significant exploration program for Noble Energy.In addition to the large investments in new acreage and seismic data, we'll be participating in seven high-impact wells, with five of them being in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, one in Equatorial Guinea and one in Eastern Mediterranean. As I mentioned before, we have two tests under way at Deep Blue and Double Mountain in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We'll also be appraising our large Gunflint discovery with one or two wells this year, and participating in at least one other tests in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In Equatorial Guinea, we'll be drilling an additional oil prospects. And late in the year, we anticipate resuming exploration in the Eastern Med [Mediterranean] looking to build on our tremendous success that we've had already there in Israel.So we have a lot of important and impactful things on the exploration and appraisal front. And we certainly expect continuous activity throughout the year. We anticipate 2010 daily production to average between 211,000 and 224,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with the mid-point of the range being up about 3.5% from our 2009 level. In the U.S., we expect slight overall growth led by our onshore development programs, which again are focused on liquid-rich development as well as emerging plays, as well, of course, is folding in a partial year's production from the DJ asset acquisition. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we expect natural decline in our existing properties in 2010 but of course, are looking forward to deepwater production additions in 2011 with the Galapagos startup.Internationally, we expect slight growth overall led by increased natural gas demand in Israel and from our developments on the North Sea in China, offset by some decreases at Alba in Equatorial Guinea, resulting from scheduled facility maintenance there. So there's a lot on our plate for 2010 as we move forward in developing these world-class major projects, as we build on our exploration success with new discoveries and certainly, keeping ourselves well-positioned as we enter this new decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave."

I first want to briefly highlight our recent acquisition that it's still expected to close toward the end of the first quarter. These assets are a great fit with our Wattenberg position, and also continue to expand our",2658,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I first want to briefly highlight our recent acquisition that it's still expected to close toward the end of the first quarter. These assets are a great fit with our Wattenberg position, and also continue to expand our position outside of this field in the DJ Basin. This opportunity was made possible by a tremendous effort on both sides to quickly evaluate, negotiate and reach a definitive agreement over the holidays.Looking at what this acquisition contributes, we're excited about adding over 50 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves in this area by the end of the first quarter, with potential to at least double that number through development of the large inventory of probable and possible opportunities. With a couple of thousand projects and a high liquid yield, we expect to ramp up the rig activity on these properties from currently one operated rig to three by mid-year, with additional increases next year. This will drive a production growth profile from around 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day currently to an average of 20,000 in 2012.We already own some interest in a number of these properties in Wattenberg. And this [indiscernible] allows us to implement a growth program for this asset, similar to what we accomplished with the 2006 U.S. exploration assets. In addition, the acreage outside the Wattenberg field comes with some existing seismic that is currently being processed, and will help us evaluate additional running room in the DJ Basin.Turning to our current operations at Wattenberg, our drilling activity was increased in the fourth quarter to five rigs. And we have since added a sixth rig early in 2010. Record drill times in Wattenberg continue to be achieved on the order of three days spud to spud. After the acquisition closes, we expect to add two additional rigs to the field mid-year, and plan on operating at least eight and up to nine rigs in the field for the remainder of 2010. As we continue to focus on the liquid potential of this field, we conducted a three-well horizontal Niobrara program late in 2009 after extensive study of this opportunity and looking at the results from an early 2009 test. Two of the recent wells have been completed with the third completion scheduled to commence in the next couple of weeks. The initial oil results have been encouraging, and we plan to have one rig in Wattenberg focused on horizontal Niobrara drilling throughout the year. As most are aware, there's been a lot of interest in horizontal Niobrara running room in the DJ Basin. Applying the same geoscience processes and technical discipline that has proven successful in our other exploration plays, we will drill some horizontal Niobrara oil test outside of the Wattenberg field during the second half of the year.Our future drilling efforts in the basin will be assisted by having over 300 square miles of 3D seismic by the end of the year. Including our holdings in the Wattenberg field, we've built a substantial acreage position of over 700,000 net acres in the central DJ Basin. Overall, we will allocate $480 million for continued development of Wattenberg in 2010, targeting over a thousand total projects including new drills, refracs and trifacs. Approximately 20 of the new drills will be horizontal Niobrara test, and we will continue to look for additional potential in other zones of this prolific field as well.At our Iron Horse field in Wyoming, we finished the two pads 16-well program late last year. The first pad of wells has been completed with the second pad scheduled to come online in early March. Based on the results we have seen so far, we will return to drilling in the second half of 2010, with plans for about 15 new drills neutrals targeting this liquid-rich play. In East Texas, our first Haynesville completion continues to perform well and we drilled our second and third wells in the Shelby County during the fourth quarter. The second well, the piece [ph] No. 1 was completed at the end of January. In the first two weeks of sales, the well averaged 7 million cubic feet per day, but exhibited drawdown behaviors every bit as strong as the first well. We are purposely constraining the flow-back rate to test ways to maximize recoveries from this area. Completion operations are underway at the third well, and we're currently drilling the fourth.Noble Energy has now taken over operatorship on the joint venture acreage. And we just recently brought in a second rig, as we target 11 Haynesville new drills in 2010. Overall, we will be operating an average of 12 to 13 rigs onshore during 2010. As mentioned, we will run about eight on average in the Wattenberg area, two on East Texas, two for Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. And then our final rig which is currently operating in Piceance and moved to Iron Horse in the second half of the year. Total U.S. onshore capital excluding the acquisition costs will be approximately $860 million, around the third of our company capital.Moving to deepwater, fourth quarter operations included a successful sidetrack at our Swordfish property. You will remember we had a gas well that watered out during the third quarter last year, and we brought a rig in to sidetrack into an oil zone. Results were very positive and the full impact of the well, up to 2,500 barrels of oil per day net, is expected at the end of the first quarter. The well just started flowing at a curtailed rate of about 1,500 barrels of oil per day net, as full production has been delayed due to a third-party export pipeline repair. We anticipate spending about 22% of our 2010 capital in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico with a focus on three key areas. One will be moving forward our sanctioned Galapagos project with a target of about 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net in mid- 2011. Our shared rig ENSCO 8501 is expected to arrive later this quarter and initiate drilling on the Santiago exploration test, a lower risk prospect in the Galapagos complex. The rig will then move to the completion of the two to three producers. As a reminder, development plans include subsea tieback to BP's Na Kika facility.Second, as Chuck mentioned, we will have a very active exploration year in 2010 with at least three significant new exploration test, two of which are currently underway at Deep Blue and Double Mountain. We also anticipate participating in another large third-party prospect in the second half of the year. Noble operates Deep Blue and BHP operates Double Mountain. At Deep Blue, another block that contained a portion of the prospect was brought into the unit during the fourth quarter. We now hold a 33.75% interest in this prospect, which we have characterized as greater than 200 million barrels and our largest deepwater Gulf of Mexico predrilled prospect to date. Both wells are drilling ahead, and we should have results by the next earnings call.The third area of deepwater focus in 2010 is the appraisal of our large Gunflint discovery. After Deep Blue, our rig will proceed to drill one and possibly two appraisal wells at Gunflint. Designed to really help us understand the extent and size of the structure, wells with [ph][indiscernible] planning for development. Adding in the three significant exploration test, we will have five impactful exploration and appraisal wells in the Gulf of Mexico this year. With one operated full-time rig and a second operated rig on the same [ph] arrangement, we'll be very active in the deepwater in 2010.Now let's move to international, which comprises about 45% of our 2010 planned capital program. Fourth quarter sales volumes were lower than expected in Israel as we were impacted by warmer-than-normal weather, larger allocations of current demand being met by gas imports and downtime at the Hagit power plant. A Hagit combined cycle unit went down in the middle of the fourth quarter and it's expected back online later this quarter.  Net impact during this outage is 10 million to 20 million cubic feet per day. The weather trend has continued through January as temperatures have been about five degrees warmer than normal, much different than what we've experienced here in the States. Although Israel saw some brief periods of more normal winter weather earlier this month, it has returned to milder temperatures recently.New natural gas deliveries from Mary-B to Israel Chemicals Ltd. commenced late in the fourth quarter, and volumes are still in the commissioning phase. We expect these volumes to ramp up over the year, ultimately accounting for 15 million cubic feet per day net. Late this quarter, we will begin drilling two additional development wells at Mary-B. These two wells will be completed by mid-year and designed to be able to produce 150 million to 200 million cubic feet per day each. This will help ensure that the Mary-B field can maintain full platform deliverability around 600 million cubic feet per day until Tamar comes online. This wells will also have the added benefit of providing for future storage injection capability.We're continuing to move Tamar forward on schedule, targeting first deliveries in 2012. Some very positive progress on the marketing side has been made, now having secured two LOIs for the sale of natural gas. We have ongoing discussions with a number of potential customers. And I would expect we will continue to sign additional agreements over the next year. Our plans are still to sanction Tamar this year, based on continued progress and securing better cost estimates for our development plan and further progress in defining an onshore receiving terminal.We recently completed our 3D seismic acquisition in the region, our focus now on processing the data over the next few months. Based on the final processing, our current plan is to drill a significant exploration prospect late this year before moving the rig to complete our development drilling at Tamar. Prospect to be tested depends on the 3D interpretation and the discussions we'll be having with our partners. In total, we were expanding approximately $530 million, just over 20% of our capital in the Eastern Med in 2010. In the North Sea, repairs at the FPSO were completed, which resulted in downtime at Dumbarton for most of the fourth quarter. In addition, the facility modifications designed to debottleneck the Dumbarton field and tie in Lochranza were finished. The first well at Lochranza is online, bringing current total net production from the complex to 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The second well at Lochranza is currently drilling with additional production estimate that come on at the end of this quarter. Further development work at Dumbarton is planned for 2010, with additional production impact in the second half of the year. As we have mentioned before, we're conducting a market test for our North Sea asset. As of yet, we haven't seen an offer that is compelling enough to move forward with the vesting. So although open to the possibility of a sale, we will continue optimizing the production from these oil assets which generate significant cash flow. In China, we're completing the second of two additional horizontal wells from our existing platform at the CDX field. The rig will then move to a program of production and injection wells designed to be hooked up to a second platform, which will be installed late in 2010, with expected production impact mainly in 2011.Turning to West Africa, the capital budget for 2010 is approximately $440 million, excluding the non-cash capital associated with the FPSO conversion for our liquid discoveries. We have a rig at Aseng beginning our 10-well development program, which includes the mix of gas injectors, water injectors and horizontal production wells. Second rig is scheduled to be in the field to assist with development by midyear. The FPSO conversion is proceeding along as planned and we're still expecting a 2012 production startup. We're targeting initial net oil production of 16,500 barrels of oil per day, with design capacity for about 26,000 barrels of oil per day net. At the same time, we have a second West Africa project team working Belinda, moving towards the sanction in 2010, while another group is working separately with the Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon governments to evaluate gas monetization options for the large resource base we have discovered in this region.Our 2010 exploration plans for West Africa include a couple of potential oil tests and some additional 3D seismic. We're currently adding an exploration tail to one of our development oils at Aseng, targeting a separate Miocene oil prospect named Sophia[ph], a nice tie-in candidate to the Aseng development is successful. At the same time, we're continuing to look at a significant oil exploration test later in the year. Depending on our rig schedules and final approvals, we are targeting a fourth quarter test for this Miocene prospect. We'll also be shooting some 3D seismic in the first half of the year in our Cameroon acreage. So West Africa will continue to be an active exciting area for us in 2010.Just a quick mention on the shape of our 2010 volumes. Of note, the first quarter will be lowest quarter of the year, as there are significant scheduled downtime planned for equipment maintenance, upgrades and replacements at the Alba field and downstream plants in Equatorial Guinea. This activity was budgeted with the first quarter net effect estimated to be about 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, lower than typical run rate, impacting both our liquid and natural gas production proportionally. We expect total company production in the first quarter to range from 195,000 to 201,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as a result. As the plants come back online, Israel demand increases, continued Rockies growth, including the impact from the asset acquisition, and enhancements at Dumbarton-Lochranza, the second half of the year should average 220,000 to 230,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Finishing up with our reserves picture, we reported year-end proved reserves under the new SEC rules were $820 million barrels oil equivalent. Despite constraining our capital spending and emphasizing capital discipline, we replaced over 100% of both our U.S. and international production through drilling and project development. This includes removing $5 million barrels oil equivalent as a result of our decision to plug and abandon our Main Pass field. However, proved reserves were significantly impacted by the new SEC price rules and our conservative application of the new five-year requirement for PUD development. We did not assume significant increases in onshore U.S. capital spending over the next five years. As a result, for our onshore U.S. reserves, our proved undeveloped percentage actually decreased from 35% to 32% this year.Our overall reserves remain well balanced between liquids and gas, as well as between the U.S. and international. In the U.S., additions were driven largely by development programs in the Rockies, as well as from the Galapagos project and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Internationally, additions benefited by partial bookings at Aseng.Looking to 2010, we expect significant reserve additions from Tamar and Belinda, positive gas price improvements and closing the recent acquisition. This year is positioned to be one of the most exciting and noteworthy years for Noble Energy. The combination of sanctioning Tamar and Belinda, drilling at least seven impact deepwater wells around the globe and expanding our DJ Basin activity will provide a high level of interest each quarter. In each of our four focus areas, onshore U.S., deepwater Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Eastern Med [Eastern Mediterranean], we're applying our successful geoscience processes to further explore our large adjacent acreage positions. We've also developed strong project teams and processes to execute our portfolio of major projects on time and on schedule.At this time, James, we'd like to go ahead and open the call to questions."

And I would say that it's still an very attractive area for us, one that we would be interesting in growing our position. But as we've said many times in the past, it has to be at the appropriate value. As far as East Texas versus Rockies, I think there has been one thing that's changed a bit over the past year. Number one is the market, in the Rockies in terms of the natural gas portion, has certainly improved. We've seen differentials come back. And I think with the decreases in gas drilling in the Rockies, it's allowed that gas market to dramatically improve. And there's probably less fear now of trapped Rockies gas than what there was maybe a year ago. But the other thing which, of course, you're well aware of is, is just that there's the liquid-rich plays there. The opportunity we saw to add this property in the Wattenburg area was very positive. And there's other plays that are obviously being evaluated by the industry. So it's that same old go-to-where-the-best-value-is. We like the U.S. Onshore business.

I thought maybe it would be helpful to step back a bit as we open this call up and take a big picture look at 2009. There certainly are a number of things to reflect upon. It's certainly easy to predict -- forget the predicament all of us were facing at this time a year ago, probably because most of us has spent all year trying to forget them. But in reflection, I believe we at Noble Energy made some of our best decisions ever as we entered into 2009, decisions that were certainly not made easily and not without pain.First of all, we knew a year ago at this time that we are experiencing an incredible run of exploration success. Success that was delivering formidable inventory of major projects to us. These projects certainly have the potential to bring huge growth to our company over the next decade. I think second at that time, it was clear that we were bearish on U.S. natural gas. As a result, it made no sense for us to spend a lot of money drilling up our U.S. gas inventory in the environment that we face. So at the beginning of last year, we cut capital. We cut it hard, initially from $2.3 billion in 2008 to $1.6 billion. And later, we lowered our 2009 budget to $1.4 billion. And then we held the line, actually ending 2009 at $1.3 billion. Hardest hit with these reductions were our U.S. onshore programs, which suffered close to a 40% cut in organic spending last year from the 2008 levels.Looking back, I believe we would make these calls over and over again. These decisions kept us positioned well to execute our major project program. We're able to generate free cash flow for the year, strengthen our balance sheet, ending with a debt-to-book capital ratio, net of cash, of 14%. And we retained substantial financial firepower, which opened the door to make what I believe was a great acquisition at the end of the year. So I think we can't be happier with where we are today.Of course, the offset was that we had to take a time out on growth. Onshore in the U.S., even with the severe capital cuts, we are able to grow our volumes led by our liquid-rich Wattenberg field. We also increased our onshore footprint, adding to our large acreage positions and increasing our core Wattenberg and the growing DJ Basin opportunity set. And we achieved positive initial results on our East Texas Haynesville program, while our teams continue to improve drilling times in a number of plays throughout our portfolio.In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, exploration results at Santa Cruz and the subsequent sanctioning of the old development at Galapagos are important steps for Noble Energy. Success at the deepwater lease sale also allowed us to increase our inventory of exploration prospects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which now contain more than $1.6 billion barrels of net unrisked potential resources. Late in the year, we initiated drilling on two significant exploration prospects from this portfolio.Internationally, we had tremendous exploration success in Israel, with our largest discovery ever at Tamar and the subsequent Dalit find. Contracting for the sale of Tamar's resources is ongoing. We announced signed letters of intent covering some $10.5 billion in gross expected revenues with less than a third of the resources committed. And we immediately moved forward with the development plans that should lead to the sanction of Tamar this year.  In Equatorial Guinea, we had an oil discovery at Carmen and we sanctioned our first West African project, the Aseng oil field.Even with our significantly reduced capital program from a drill bit perspective, we'll be able to replace production with new reserves. However, that's only half the story as the new rules require average pricing and at proved and undeveloped reserves be developed within five years drove one-time negative revisions for us. I believe, we have taken an appropriately conservative position, especially regarding the proven undeveloped rule, but time will tell. Regardless, these revisions which shifted proven reserves to probable are expected to reverse back to proven with higher gas prices and continued development. In addition, we have just now started to book some reserves from our recent exploration successes, and we would expect significant reserve additions in 2010. Dave will be covering this a bit more later in the call.With that, let's touch on the fourth quarter results before going to our outlook for 2010. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter 2009 was $178 million or $1.01 per share diluted after removing the adjustment items. By now, you're familiar with the unrealized mark-to-market impacts on us and I won't go through those, nor will I spend any time on the return of deepwater royalty payments due to the resolution of some litigation that's been well-publicized and benefited a number of oil and gas producers during this period. But I did want to quickly comment on the impairment items. In the U.S., we impaired two gas properties. One was Paxton in the New Albany shale, and that was due to the reduced gas pricing outlook. The other was our Raton gas development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico where we experienced a mechanical failure on a gravel pack that affected well performance there.Outside the U.S., we took a hard look at Ecuador, given the increasingly unsettled economic and political environment there, as well as recent actions by the government that could lead to termination of our production sharing contract. While will certainly vigorously act to protect our interests, we determined that on a risk-weighted basis, the carrying value of our Ecuador investments exceeded the fair value. And we wrote it down accordingly.Sales volumes for the fourth quarter averaged 206,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down slightly from our expectations, primarily due to our North Sea and Israel properties. In the North Sea, lower-than-expected oil volumes resulted from the timing of the FPSO repairs and the completion of the field optimization work at Dumbarton. Fortunately, those repairs have now been completed. And also the first well at Lochranza is online as well. Natural gas volumes in the Israel were lower than expected. This was due to a couple of reasons. One was warmer-than-normal weather. Also, we had increased imports of competing Egyptian gas. And also, our customer there, Israel Electric, had some downtime on one of their power plants.Volumes in West Africa remained stable for both liquids and natural gas. And in the U.S., we continue to have strong liquid production from our deepwater properties and from our liquid-focused drilling programs onshore. Overall, our results continue to be supported by good exposure to liquids, which ultimately make up about 40% of our total volumes. Higher natural gas liquids prices continue and enhance our net nat [natural] gas prices in certain U.S. locations, and higher oil prices have helped us in Israel. In fact, our national gas pricing in Israel this past quarter was a record for us.With respect to cost, we wrapped up a good year of performance in the fourth quarter. Our lease operating expense, DD&A, exploration, G&A, all came in generally in line with our expectations. Our effective tax rate for the quarter on an adjusted basis was a little lower than guidance.Capital expenditures for the quarter were $384 million, making the total for 2009 just over $1.3 billion. With discretionary cash flow for the year of nearly $1.7 billion, we generated about $375 million of free cash flow, certainly a very impressive result given the environment and challenges we faced this past year. Total debt at the end of the year was down to $2 billion, and we ended the year with $2.7 billion in liquidity. That's between our cash and our available credit facility.Before touching on our capital and guidance, let me just mention four key objectives that really frame our 2010 programs. First is that we want to make sure that we progress the development and assessment of our major projects. These are clearly our most leveraging investments. Second on the list is to maintain our strong existing production base, such that when the major projects do come on stream, that they deliver true incremental growth. Third is to continue the momentum from exploration. And in that regard, we'll be testing high-impact opportunities in all three of our main exploration basins this year. And finally, we want to make sure we retain our strong financial capacity. These objectives are what we are focused on as we move our company forward this year and I think we are in excellent position to deliver on all of those. In 2010, our capital program is planned to be $2.5 billion and of course, excludes the purchase price for the DJ Basin assets. And it also excludes the non-cash capital that's being accrued for the Aseng FPSO's capitalized lease. We continue to increase the allocation of our capital to long-term investments. Our major projects' development and exploration capital will make up some 60% of our program in 2010, up from just over 40% last year. The execution of our major projects come with significant capital outlays of about $1 billion in 2010 but of course, the majority being allocated to Galapagos, Aseng and Tamara. Galapagos is expected to come on production next year and both Aseng and Tamara in the following year in 2012.20% of our capital program in 2010 or about $500 million, is focused on exploration and appraisal activities, targeting an estimated 700 million barrels of net unrisked new resources that we could potentially add to the portfolio. This represents a continued commitment to a significant exploration program for Noble Energy.In addition to the large investments in new acreage and seismic data, we'll be participating in seven high-impact wells, with five of them being in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, one in Equatorial Guinea and one in Eastern Mediterranean. As I mentioned before, we have two tests under way at Deep Blue and Double Mountain in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We'll also be appraising a large Gunflint discovery with one or two wells this year, and participating in at least one other test in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In Equatorial Guinea, we'll be drilling an additional oil prospects. And late in the year, we anticipate resuming exploration in the Eastern Med [Mediterranean] looking to build on our tremendous success that we've had already there in Israel.So we have a lot of important and impactful things on the exploration and appraisal front and we certainly expect continuous activity throughout the year. We anticipate 2010 daily production to average between 211,000 and 224,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with the mid-point of the range being up about 3.5% from our 2009 level. In the U.S., we expect slight overall growth led by our onshore development programs, which again are focused on liquid-rich development as well as emerging plays, as well, of course, as folding in a partial year's production from the DJ asset acquisition. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we expect natural declines in our existing properties in 2010 but of course, are looking forward to deepwater production additions in 2011 with the Galapagos startup.Internationally, we expect slight growth overall led by increased natural gas demand in Israel and from our developments on the North Sea in China, offset by some decreases at Alba in Equatorial Guinea, resulting from scheduled facility maintenance there. So there's a lot on our plate for 2010 as we move forward in developing these world-class major projects, as we build on our exploration success with new discoveries and certainly, keeping ourselves well-positioned as we enter this new decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave."

I first want to briefly highlight our recent acquisition that it's still expected to close toward the end of the first quarter. These assets are a great fit with our Wattenberg position and also continue to expand our position outside of this field in the DJ Basin. This opportunity was made possible by a tremendous effort on both sides to quickly evaluate, negotiate and reach a definitive agreement over the holidays.Looking at what this acquisition contributes, we're excited about adding over 50 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves in this area by the end of the first quarter, with potential to at least double that number through development of the large inventory of probable and possible opportunities. With a couple of thousand projects and a high liquid yield, we expect to ramp up the rig activity on these properties from currently one operated rig to three by mid-year, with additional increases next year. This will drive a production growth profile from around 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day currently to an average of 20,000 in 2012.We already own some interest in a number of these properties in Wattenberg. And this bolt-on [ph] allows us to implement a growth program for this asset, similar to what we accomplished with the 2006 U.S. exploration assets. In addition, the acreage outside the Wattenberg field comes with some existing seismic that is currently being processed, and will help us evaluate additional running room in the DJ Basin.Turning to our current operations at Wattenberg, our drilling activity was increased in the fourth quarter to five rigs. And we have since added a sixth rig early in 2010. Record drill times in Wattenberg continue to be achieved on the order of three days, spud to spud. After the acquisition closes, we expect to add two additional rigs to the field mid-year, and plan on operating at least eight and up to nine rigs in the field for the remainder of 2010. As we continue to focus on the liquid potential of this field, we conducted a three-well horizontal Niobrara program late in 2009 after extensive study of this opportunity and looking at the results from an early 2009 test. Two of the recent wells have been completed with the third completion scheduled to commence in the next couple of weeks. The initial well results have been encouraging, and we plan to have one rig in Wattenberg focused on horizontal Niobrara drilling throughout the year. As most are aware, there's been a lot of interest in horizontal Niobrara running room in the DJ Basin. Applying the same geoscience processes and technical discipline that has proven successful in our other exploration plays, we will drill some horizontal Niobrara oil test outside of the Wattenberg field during the second half of the year.Our future drilling efforts in the basin will be assisted by having over 300 square miles of 3D seismic by the end of the year. Including our holdings in the Wattenberg field, we've built a substantial acreage position of over 700,000 net acres in the central DJ Basin. Overall, we will allocate $480 million for continued development of Wattenberg in 2010, targeting over a thousand total projects including new drills, refracs and trifracs. Approximately 20 of the new drills will be horizontal Niobrara test, and we will continue to look for additional potential in other zones of this prolific field as well.At our Iron Horse field in Wyoming, we finished the two-pad, 16-well program late last year. The first pad of wells has been completed with the second pad scheduled to come online in early March. Based on the results we have seen so far, we will return to drilling in the second half of 2010, with plans for about 15 new drills targeting this liquid-rich play. In East Texas, our first Haynesville completion continues to perform well and we drilled our second and third wells in the Shelby County during the fourth quarter. The second well, the Peace No. 1 was completed at the end of January. In the first two weeks of sales, the well averaged 7 million cubic feet per day, but exhibited drawdown behaviors every bit as strong as the first well. We are purposely constraining the flow-back rate to test ways to maximize recoveries from this area. Completion operations are underway at the third well, and we're currently drilling the fourth.  Noble Energy has now taken over operatorship on the joint venture acreage. And we just recently brought in a second rig, as we target 11 Haynesville new drills in 2010. Overall, we will be operating an average of 12 to 13 rigs onshore during 2010. As mentioned, we will run about eight on average in the Wattenberg area, two on East Texas, two for Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. And then our final rig which is currently operating in Piceance and moved to Iron Horse in the second half of the year. Total U.S. onshore capital, excluding the acquisition cost, will be approximately $860 million, around the third of our company capital.Moving to deepwater, fourth quarter operations included a successful sidetrack at our Swordfish property. You will remember we had a gas well that watered out during the third quarter last year, and we brought a rig in to sidetrack into an oil zone. Results were very positive and the full impact of the well, up to 2,500 barrels of oil per day net, is expected at the end of the first quarter. The well just started flowing at a curtailed rate of about 1,500 barrels of oil per day net, as full production has been delayed due to a third-party export pipeline repair. We anticipate spending about 22% of our 2010 capital in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico with a focus on three key areas. One will be moving forward our sanctioned Galapagos project with a target of about 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net in mid- 2011. Our shared rig ENSCO 8501 is expected to arrive later this quarter and initiate drilling on the Santiago exploration test, a lower risk prospect in the Galapagos complex. The rig will then move to the completion of the two to three producers. As a reminder, development plans include subsea tieback to BP's Na Kika facility.Second, as Chuck mentioned, we will have a very active exploration year in 2010 with at least three significant new exploration test, two of which are currently underway at Deep Blue and Double Mountain. We also anticipate participating in another large third-party prospect in the second half of the year. Noble operates Deep Blue and BHP operates Double Mountain. At Deep Blue, another block that contained a portion of the prospect was brought into the unit during the fourth quarter. We now hold a 33.75% interest in this prospect, which we have characterized as greater than 200 million barrels and our largest deepwater Gulf of Mexico predrilled prospect to date. Both wells are drilling ahead, and we should have results by the next earnings call.The third area of deepwater focus in 2010 is the appraisal of our large Gunflint discovery. After Deep Blue, our rig will proceed to drill one and possibly two appraisal wells at Gunflint. Designed to really help us understand the extent and size of the structure, wells with this in [ph] the ultimate planning for development. Adding in the three significant exploration test, we will have five impactful exploration and appraisal wells in the Gulf of Mexico this year. With one operated full-time rig and a second operated rig on a sharing arrangement, we'll be very active in the deepwater in 2010.Now let's move to international, which comprises about 45% of our 2010 planned capital program. Fourth quarter sales volumes were lower than expected in Israel as we were impacted by warmer-than-normal weather, larger allocations of current demand being met by gas imports and downtime at the Hagit power plant. A Hagit combined cycle unit went down in the middle of the fourth quarter and it's expected back online later this quarter.  Net impact during this outage is 10 million to 20 million cubic feet per day. The weather trend has continued through January as temperatures have been about five degrees warmer than normal, much different than what we've experienced here in the States. Although Israel saw some brief periods of more normal winter weather earlier this month, it has returned to milder temperatures recently.New natural gas deliveries from Mary-B to Israel Chemicals Ltd. commenced late in the fourth quarter, and volumes are still in the commissioning phase. We expect these volumes to ramp up over the year, ultimately accounting for 15 million cubic feet per day net. Late this quarter, we will begin drilling two additional development wells at Mary-B. These two wells will be completed by mid-year and designed to be able to produce 150 million to 200 million cubic feet per day each. This will help ensure that the Mary-B field can maintain full platform deliverability around 600 million cubic feet per day until Tamar comes online. This wells will also have the added benefit of providing for future storage injection capability.We're continuing to move Tamar forward on schedule, targeting first deliveries in 2012. Some very positive progress on the marketing side has been made, now having secured two LOIs for the sale of natural gas. We have ongoing discussions with a number of potential customers. And I would expect we will continue to sign additional agreements over the next year. Our plans are still to sanction Tamar this year, based on continued progress and securing better cost estimates for our development plan and further progress in defining an onshore receiving terminal.We recently completed our 3D seismic acquisition in the region, our focus now on processing the data over the next few months. Based on the final processing, our current plan is to drill a significant exploration prospect late this year before moving the rig to complete our development drilling at Tamar. Prospect to be tested depends on the 3D interpretation and the discussions we'll be having with our partners. In total, we were expanding approximately $530 million, just over 20% of our capital in the Eastern Med in 2010. In the North Sea, repairs at the FPSO were completed, which resulted in downtime at Dumbarton for most of the fourth quarter. In addition, the facility modifications designed to debottleneck the Dumbarton field and tie in Lochranza were finished. The first well at Lochranza is online, bringing current total net production from the complex to 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The second well at Lochranza is currently drilling with additional production estimate that come on at the end of this quarter. Further development work at Dumbarton is planned for 2010, with additional production impact in the second half of the year. As we have mentioned before, we're conducting a market test for our North Sea asset. As of yet, we haven't seen an offer that is compelling enough to move forward with the vesting. So although open to the possibility of a sale, we will continue optimizing the production from these oil assets which generate significant cash flow. In China, we're completing the second of two additional horizontal wells from our existing platform at the CDX field. The rig will then move to a program of production and injection wells designed to be hooked up to a second platform, which will be installed late in 2010, with expected production impact mainly in 2011.Turning to West Africa, the capital budget for 2010 is approximately $440 million, excluding the non-cash capital associated with the FPSO conversion for our liquid discoveries. We have a rig at Aseng beginning our 10-well development program, which includes the mix of gas injectors, water injectors and horizontal production wells. Second rig is scheduled to be in the field to assist with development by midyear. The FPSO conversion is proceeding along as planned and we're still expecting a 2012 production startup. We're targeting initial net oil production of 16,500 barrels of oil per day, with design capacity for about 26,000 barrels of oil per day net. At the same time, we have a second West Africa project team working Belinda, moving towards the sanction in 2010, while another group is working separately with the Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon governments to evaluate gas monetization options for the large resource base we have discovered in this region.Our 2010 exploration plans for West Africa include a couple of potential oil tests and some additional 3D seismic. We're currently adding an exploration tail to one of our development oils at Aseng, targeting a separate Miocene oil prospect named Sophia [ph], a nice tie-in candidate to the Aseng development if successful. At the same time, we're continuing to look at a significant oil exploration test later in the year. Depending on our rig schedules and final approvals, we are targeting a fourth quarter test for this Miocene prospect. We'll also be shooting some 3D seismic in the first half of the year in our Cameroon acreage. So West Africa will continue to be an active exciting area for us in 2010.Just a quick mention on the shape of our 2010 volumes. Of note, the first quarter will be lowest quarter of the year, as there are significant scheduled downtime planned for equipment maintenance, upgrades and replacements at the Alba field and downstream plants in Equatorial Guinea. This activity was budgeted with the first quarter net effect estimated to be about 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, lower than typical run rate, impacting both our liquid and natural gas production proportionally. We expect total company production in the first quarter to range from 195,000 to 201,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as a result. As the plants come back online, Israel demand increases, continued Rockies growth, including the impact from the asset acquisition, and enhancements at Dumbarton-Lochranza, the second half of the year should average 220,000 to 230,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Finishing up with our reserves picture, we reported year-end proved reserves under the new SEC rules were $820 million barrels oil equivalent. Despite constraining our capital spending and emphasizing capital discipline, we replaced over 100% of both our U.S. and international production through drilling and project development. This includes removing $5 million barrels oil equivalent as a result of our decision to plug and abandon our Main Pass field. However, proved reserves were significantly impacted by the new SEC price rules and our conservative application of the new five-year requirement for PUD development. We did not assume significant increases in onshore U.S. capital spending over the next five years. As a result, for our onshore U.S. reserves, our proved undeveloped percentage actually decreased from 35% to 32% this year.Our overall reserves remain well balanced between liquids and gas, as well as between the U.S. and international. In the U.S., additions were driven largely by development programs in the Rockies, as well as from the Galapagos project and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Internationally, additions benefited by partial bookings at Aseng.Looking to 2010, we expect significant reserve additions from Tamar and Belinda, positive gas price improvements and closing the recent acquisition. This year is positioned to be one of the most exciting and noteworthy years for Noble Energy. The combination of sanctioning Tamar and Belinda, drilling at least seven impact deepwater wells around the globe and expanding our DJ Basin activity will provide a high level of interest each quarter. In each of our four focus areas, onshore U.S., deepwater Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Eastern Med [Eastern Mediterranean], we're applying our successful geoscience processes to further explore our large adjacent acreage positions. We've also developed strong project teams and processes to execute our portfolio of major projects on time and on schedule.At this time, James, we'd like to go ahead and open the call to questions."

But as we've said many times in the past, it has to be at the appropriate value. As far as East Texas versus Rockies, I think there has been one thing that's changed a bit over the past year. Number one is the market in the Rockies in terms of the natural gas portion, has certainly improved. We've seen differentials come back. And I think with the decreases in gas drilling in the Rockies, it's allowed that gas market to dramatically improve. And there's probably less fear now of trapped Rockies gas than what there was maybe a year ago. But the other thing which, of course, you're well aware of is, is just that there's the liquid-rich plays there. The opportunity we saw to add this property in the Wattenburg area was very positive.

I thought maybe it would be helpful to step back a bit as we open this call up and take a big picture look at 2009. There certainly are a number of things to reflect upon. It's certainly easy to predict -- forget the predicament all of us were facing at this time a year ago, probably because most of us has spent all year trying to forget them. But in reflection, I believe we at Noble Energy made some of our best decisions ever as we entered into 2009, decisions that were certainly not made easily and not without pain.First of all, we knew a year ago at this time that we are experiencing an incredible run of exploration success. Success that was delivering formidable inventory of major projects to us. These projects certainly have the potential to bring huge growth to our company over the next decade. I think second at that time, it was clear that we were bearish on U.S. natural gas. As a result, it made no sense for us to spend a lot of money drilling up our U.S. gas inventory in the environment that we face. So at the beginning of last year, we cut capital. We cut it hard, initially from $2.3 billion in 2008 to $1.6 billion. And later, we lowered our 2009 budget to $1.4 billion. And then we held the line, actually ending 2009 at $1.3 billion. Hardest hit with these reductions were our U.S. onshore programs, which suffered close to a 40% cut in organic spending last year from the 2008 levels.Looking back, I believe we would make these calls over and over again. These decisions kept us positioned well to execute our major project program. We're able to generate free cash flow for the year, strengthen our balance sheet, ending with a debt-to-book capital ratio, net of cash, of 14%. And we retained substantial financial firepower, which opened the door to make what I believe was a great acquisition at the end of the year. So I think we can't be happier with where we are today.Of course, the offset was that we had to take a time out on growth. Onshore in the U.S., even with the severe capital cuts, we are able to grow our volumes led by our liquid-rich Wattenberg field. We also increased our onshore footprint, adding to our large acreage positions and increasing our core Wattenberg and the growing DJ Basin opportunity set. And we achieved positive initial results on our East Texas Haynesville program, while our teams continue to improve drilling times in a number of plays throughout our portfolio.In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, exploration results at Santa Cruz and the subsequent sanctioning of the old development at Galapagos are important steps for Noble Energy. Success at the deepwater lease sale also allowed us to increase our inventory of exploration prospects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, which now contain more than $1.6 billion barrels of net unrisked potential resources. Late in the year, we initiated drilling on two significant exploration prospects from this portfolio.Internationally, we had tremendous exploration success in Israel, with our largest discovery ever at Tamar and the subsequent Dalit find. Contracting for the sale of Tamar's resources is ongoing. We announced signed letters of intent covering some $10.5 billion in gross expected revenues with less than a third of the resources committed. And we immediately moved forward with the development plans that should lead to the sanction of Tamar this year.  In Equatorial Guinea, we had an oil discovery at Carmen and we sanctioned our first West African project, the Aseng oil field.Even with our significantly reduced capital program from a drill bit perspective, we'll be able to replace production with new reserves. However, that's only half the story as the new rules require average pricing and at proved and undeveloped reserves be developed within five years drove one-time negative revisions for us. I believe, we have taken an appropriately conservative position, especially regarding the proven undeveloped rule, but time will tell. Regardless, these revisions which shifted proven reserves to probable are expected to reverse back to proven with higher gas prices and continued development. In addition, we have just now started to book some reserves from our recent exploration successes, and we would expect significant reserve additions in 2010. Dave will be covering this a bit more later in the call.With that, let's touch on the fourth quarter results before going to our outlook for 2010. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter 2009 was $178 million or $1.01 per share diluted after removing the adjustment items. By now, you're familiar with the unrealized mark-to-market impacts on us and I won't go through those, nor will I spend any time on the return of deepwater royalty payments due to the resolution of some litigation that's been well-publicized and benefited a number of oil and gas producers during this period. But I did want to quickly comment on the impairment items. In the U.S., we impaired two gas properties. One was Paxton in the New Albany shale, and that was due to the reduced gas pricing outlook. The other was our Raton gas development in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico where we experienced a mechanical failure on a gravel pack that affected well performance there.Outside the U.S., we took a hard look at Ecuador, given the increasingly unsettled economic and political environment there, as well as recent actions by the government that could lead to termination of our production sharing contract. While will certainly vigorously act to protect our interests, we determined that on a risk-weighted basis, the carrying value of our Ecuador investments exceeded the fair value. And we wrote it down accordingly.Sales volumes for the fourth quarter averaged 206,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, down slightly from our expectations, primarily due to our North Sea and Israel properties. In the North Sea, lower-than-expected oil volumes resulted from the timing of the FPSO repairs and the completion of the field optimization work at Dumbarton. Fortunately, those repairs have now been completed. And also the first well at Lochranza is online as well. Natural gas volumes in the Israel were lower than expected. This was due to a couple of reasons. One was warmer-than-normal weather. Also, we had increased imports of competing Egyptian gas. And also, our customer there, Israel Electric, had some downtime on one of their power plants.Volumes in West Africa remained stable for both liquids and natural gas. And in the U.S., we continue to have strong liquid production from our deepwater properties and from our liquid-focused drilling programs onshore. Overall, our results continue to be supported by good exposure to liquids, which ultimately make up about 40% of our total volumes. Higher natural gas liquids prices continue and enhance our net nat [natural] gas prices in certain U.S. locations, and higher oil prices have helped us in Israel. In fact, our national gas pricing in Israel this past quarter was a record for us.With respect to cost, we wrapped up a good year of performance in the fourth quarter. Our lease operating expense, DD&A, exploration, G&A, all came in generally in line with our expectations. Our effective tax rate for the quarter on an adjusted basis was a little lower than guidance.Capital expenditures for the quarter were $384 million, making the total for 2009 just over $1.3 billion. With discretionary cash flow for the year of nearly $1.7 billion, we generated about $375 million of free cash flow, certainly a very impressive result given the environment and challenges we faced this past year. Total debt at the end of the year was down to $2 billion, and we ended the year with $2.7 billion in liquidity. That's between our cash and our available credit facility.Before touching on our capital and guidance, let me just mention four key objectives that really frame our 2010 programs. First is that we want to make sure that we progress the development and assessment of our major projects. These are clearly our most leveraging investments. Second on the list is to maintain our strong existing production base, such that when the major projects do come on stream, that they deliver true incremental growth. Third is to continue the momentum from exploration. And in that regard, we'll be testing high-impact opportunities in all three of our main exploration basins this year. And finally, we want to make sure we retain our strong financial capacity. These objectives are what we are focused on as we move our company forward this year and I think we are in excellent position to deliver on all of those. In 2010, our capital program is planned to be $2.5 billion and of course, excludes the purchase price for the DJ Basin assets. And it also excludes the non-cash capital that's being accrued for the Aseng FPSO's capitalized lease. We continue to increase the allocation of our capital to long-term investments. Our major projects' development and exploration capital will make up some 60% of our program in 2010, up from just over 40% last year. The execution of our major projects come with significant capital outlays of about $1 billion in 2010 but of course, the majority being allocated to Galapagos, Aseng and Tamara. Galapagos is expected to come on production next year and both Aseng and Tamara in the following year in 2012.20% of our capital program in 2010 or about $500 million, is focused on exploration and appraisal activities, targeting an estimated 700 million barrels of net unrisked new resources that we could potentially add to the portfolio. This represents a continued commitment to a significant exploration program for Noble Energy.In addition to the large investments in new acreage and seismic data, we'll be participating in seven high-impact wells, with five of them being in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, one in Equatorial Guinea and one in Eastern Mediterranean. As I mentioned before, we have two tests under way at Deep Blue and Double Mountain in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. We'll also be appraising a large Gunflint discovery with one or two wells this year, and participating in at least one other test in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. In Equatorial Guinea, we'll be drilling an additional oil prospects. And late in the year, we anticipate resuming exploration in the Eastern Med [Mediterranean] looking to build on our tremendous success that we've had already there in Israel.So we have a lot of important and impactful things on the exploration and appraisal front and we certainly expect continuous activity throughout the year. We anticipate 2010 daily production to average between 211,000 and 224,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with the mid-point of the range being up about 3.5% from our 2009 level. In the U.S., we expect slight overall growth led by our onshore development programs, which again are focused on liquid-rich development as well as emerging plays, as well, of course, as folding in a partial year's production from the DJ asset acquisition. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we expect natural declines in our existing properties in 2010 but of course, are looking forward to deepwater production additions in 2011 with the Galapagos startup.Internationally, we expect slight growth overall led by increased natural gas demand in Israel and from our developments on the North Sea in China, offset by some decreases at Alba in Equatorial Guinea, resulting from scheduled facility maintenance there. So there's a lot on our plate for 2010 as we move forward in developing these world-class major projects, as we build on our exploration success with new discoveries and certainly, keeping ourselves well-positioned as we enter this new decade. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave."

I first want to briefly highlight our recent acquisition that it's still expected to close toward the end of the first quarter. These assets are a great fit with our Wattenberg position and also continue to expand our position outside of this field in the DJ Basin. This opportunity was made possible by a tremendous effort on both sides to quickly evaluate, negotiate and reach a definitive agreement over the holidays.Looking at what this acquisition contributes, we're excited about adding over 50 million barrels of oil equivalent of proved reserves in this area by the end of the first quarter, with potential to at least double that number through development of the large inventory of probable and possible opportunities. With a couple of thousand projects and a high liquid yield, we expect to ramp up the rig activity on these properties from currently one operated rig to three by mid-year, with additional increases next year. This will drive a production growth profile from around 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day currently to an average of 20,000 in 2012.We already own some interest in a number of these properties in Wattenberg. And this bolt-on [ph] allows us to implement a growth program for this asset, similar to what we accomplished with the 2006 U.S. exploration assets. In addition, the acreage outside the Wattenberg field comes with some existing seismic that is currently being processed, and will help us evaluate additional running room in the DJ Basin.Turning to our current operations at Wattenberg, our drilling activity was increased in the fourth quarter to five rigs. And we have since added a sixth rig early in 2010. Record drill times in Wattenberg continue to be achieved on the order of three days, spud to spud. After the acquisition closes, we expect to add two additional rigs to the field mid-year, and plan on operating at least eight and up to nine rigs in the field for the remainder of 2010. As we continue to focus on the liquid potential of this field, we conducted a three-well horizontal Niobrara program late in 2009 after extensive study of this opportunity and looking at the results from an early 2009 test. Two of the recent wells have been completed with the third completion scheduled to commence in the next couple of weeks. The initial well results have been encouraging, and we plan to have one rig in Wattenberg focused on horizontal Niobrara drilling throughout the year. As most are aware, there's been a lot of interest in horizontal Niobrara running room in the DJ Basin. Applying the same geoscience processes and technical discipline that has proven successful in our other exploration plays, we will drill some horizontal Niobrara oil test outside of the Wattenberg field during the second half of the year.Our future drilling efforts in the basin will be assisted by having over 300 square miles of 3D seismic by the end of the year. Including our holdings in the Wattenberg field, we've built a substantial acreage position of over 700,000 net acres in the central DJ Basin. Overall, we will allocate $480 million for continued development of Wattenberg in 2010, targeting over a thousand total projects including new drills, refracs and trifracs. Approximately 20 of the new drills will be horizontal Niobrara test, and we will continue to look for additional potential in other zones of this prolific field as well.At our Iron Horse field in Wyoming, we finished the two-pad, 16-well program late last year. The first pad of wells has been completed with the second pad scheduled to come online in early March. Based on the results we have seen so far, we will return to drilling in the second half of 2010, with plans for about 15 new drills targeting this liquid-rich play. In East Texas, our first Haynesville completion continues to perform well and we drilled our second and third wells in the Shelby County during the fourth quarter. The second well, the Peace No. 1 was completed at the end of January. In the first two weeks of sales, the well averaged 7 million cubic feet per day, but exhibited drawdown behaviors every bit as strong as the first well. We are purposely constraining the flow-back rate to test ways to maximize recoveries from this area. Completion operations are underway at the third well, and we're currently drilling the fourth.  Noble Energy has now taken over operatorship on the joint venture acreage. And we just recently brought in a second rig, as we target 11 Haynesville new drills in 2010. Overall, we will be operating an average of 12 to 13 rigs onshore during 2010. As mentioned, we will run about eight on average in the Wattenberg area, two on East Texas, two for Western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. And then our final rig which is currently operating in Piceance and moved to Iron Horse in the second half of the year. Total U.S. onshore capital, excluding the acquisition cost, will be approximately $860 million, around the third of our company capital.Moving to deepwater, fourth quarter operations included a successful sidetrack at our Swordfish property. You will remember we had a gas well that watered out during the third quarter last year, and we brought a rig in to sidetrack into an oil zone. Results were very positive and the full impact of the well, up to 2,500 barrels of oil per day net, is expected at the end of the first quarter. The well just started flowing at a curtailed rate of about 1,500 barrels of oil per day net, as full production has been delayed due to a third-party export pipeline repair. We anticipate spending about 22% of our 2010 capital in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico with a focus on three key areas. One will be moving forward our sanctioned Galapagos project with a target of about 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net in mid- 2011. Our shared rig ENSCO 8501 is expected to arrive later this quarter and initiate drilling on the Santiago exploration test, a lower risk prospect in the Galapagos complex. The rig will then move to the completion of the two to three producers. As a reminder, development plans include subsea tieback to BP's Na Kika facility.Second, as Chuck mentioned, we will have a very active exploration year in 2010 with at least three significant new exploration test, two of which are currently underway at Deep Blue and Double Mountain. We also anticipate participating in another large third-party prospect in the second half of the year. Noble operates Deep Blue and BHP operates Double Mountain. At Deep Blue, another block that contained a portion of the prospect was brought into the unit during the fourth quarter. We now hold a 33.75% interest in this prospect, which we have characterized as greater than 200 million barrels and our largest deepwater Gulf of Mexico predrilled prospect to date. Both wells are drilling ahead, and we should have results by the next earnings call.The third area of deepwater focus in 2010 is the appraisal of our large Gunflint discovery. After Deep Blue, our rig will proceed to drill one and possibly two appraisal wells at Gunflint. Designed to really help us understand the extent and size of the structure, wells with this in [ph] the ultimate planning for development. Adding in the three significant exploration test, we will have five impactful exploration and appraisal wells in the Gulf of Mexico this year. With one operated full-time rig and a second operated rig on a sharing arrangement, we'll be very active in the deepwater in 2010.Now let's move to international, which comprises about 45% of our 2010 planned capital program. Fourth quarter sales volumes were lower than expected in Israel as we were impacted by warmer-than-normal weather, larger allocations of current demand being met by gas imports and downtime at the Hagit power plant. A Hagit combined cycle unit went down in the middle of the fourth quarter and it's expected back online later this quarter.  Net impact during this outage is 10 million to 20 million cubic feet per day. The weather trend has continued through January as temperatures have been about five degrees warmer than normal, much different than what we've experienced here in the States. Although Israel saw some brief periods of more normal winter weather earlier this month, it has returned to milder temperatures recently.New natural gas deliveries from Mary-B to Israel Chemicals Ltd. commenced late in the fourth quarter, and volumes are still in the commissioning phase. We expect these volumes to ramp up over the year, ultimately accounting for 15 million cubic feet per day net. Late this quarter, we will begin drilling two additional development wells at Mary-B. These two wells will be completed by mid-year and designed to be able to produce 150 million to 200 million cubic feet per day each. This will help ensure that the Mary-B field can maintain full platform deliverability around 600 million cubic feet per day until Tamar comes online. This wells will also have the added benefit of providing for future storage injection capability.We're continuing to move Tamar forward on schedule, targeting first deliveries in 2012. Some very positive progress on the marketing side has been made, now having secured two LOIs for the sale of natural gas. We have ongoing discussions with a number of potential customers. And I would expect we will continue to sign additional agreements over the next year. Our plans are still to sanction Tamar this year, based on continued progress and securing better cost estimates for our development plan and further progress in defining an onshore receiving terminal.We recently completed our 3D seismic acquisition in the region, our focus now on processing the data over the next few months. Based on the final processing, our current plan is to drill a significant exploration prospect late this year before moving the rig to complete our development drilling at Tamar. Prospect to be tested depends on the 3D interpretation and the discussions we'll be having with our partners. In total, we were expanding approximately $530 million, just over 20% of our capital in the Eastern Med in 2010. In the North Sea, repairs at the FPSO were completed, which resulted in downtime at Dumbarton for most of the fourth quarter. In addition, the facility modifications designed to debottleneck the Dumbarton field and tie in Lochranza were finished. The first well at Lochranza is online, bringing current total net production from the complex to 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The second well at Lochranza is currently drilling with additional production estimate that come on at the end of this quarter. Further development work at Dumbarton is planned for 2010, with additional production impact in the second half of the year. As we have mentioned before, we're conducting a market test for our North Sea asset. As of yet, we haven't seen an offer that is compelling enough to move forward with the vesting. So although open to the possibility of a sale, we will continue optimizing the production from these oil assets which generate significant cash flow. In China, we're completing the second of two additional horizontal wells from our existing platform at the CDX field. The rig will then move to a program of production and injection wells designed to be hooked up to a second platform, which will be installed late in 2010, with expected production impact mainly in 2011.Turning to West Africa, the capital budget for 2010 is approximately $440 million, excluding the non-cash capital associated with the FPSO conversion for our liquid discoveries. We have a rig at Aseng beginning our 10-well development program, which includes the mix of gas injectors, water injectors and horizontal production wells. Second rig is scheduled to be in the field to assist with development by midyear. The FPSO conversion is proceeding along as planned and we're still expecting a 2012 production startup. We're targeting initial net oil production of 16,500 barrels of oil per day, with design capacity for about 26,000 barrels of oil per day net. At the same time, we have a second West Africa project team working Belinda, moving towards the sanction in 2010, while another group is working separately with the Equatorial Guinea and Cameroon governments to evaluate gas monetization options for the large resource base we have discovered in this region.Our 2010 exploration plans for West Africa include a couple of potential oil tests and some additional 3D seismic. We're currently adding an exploration tail to one of our development oils at Aseng, targeting a separate Miocene oil prospect named Sophia [ph], a nice tie-in candidate to the Aseng development if successful. At the same time, we're continuing to look at a significant oil exploration test later in the year. Depending on our rig schedules and final approvals, we are targeting a fourth quarter test for this Miocene prospect. We'll also be shooting some 3D seismic in the first half of the year in our Cameroon acreage. So West Africa will continue to be an active exciting area for us in 2010.Just a quick mention on the shape of our 2010 volumes. Of note, the first quarter will be lowest quarter of the year, as there are significant scheduled downtime planned for equipment maintenance, upgrades and replacements at the Alba field and downstream plants in Equatorial Guinea. This activity was budgeted with the first quarter net effect estimated to be about 11,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, lower than typical run rate, impacting both our liquid and natural gas production proportionally. We expect total company production in the first quarter to range from 195,000 to 201,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as a result. As the plants come back online, Israel demand increases, continued Rockies growth, including the impact from the asset acquisition, and enhancements at Dumbarton-Lochranza, the second half of the year should average 220,000 to 230,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Finishing up with our reserves picture, we reported year-end proved reserves under the new SEC rules were $820 million barrels oil equivalent. Despite constraining our capital spending and emphasizing capital discipline, we replaced over 100% of both our U.S. and international production through drilling and project development. This includes removing $5 million barrels oil equivalent as a result of our decision to plug and abandon our Main Pass field. However, proved reserves were significantly impacted by the new SEC price rules and our conservative application of the new five-year requirement for PUD development. We did not assume significant increases in onshore U.S. capital spending over the next five years. As a result, for our onshore U.S. reserves, our proved undeveloped percentage actually decreased from 35% to 32% this year.Our overall reserves remain well balanced between liquids and gas, as well as between the U.S. and international. In the U.S., additions were driven largely by development programs in the Rockies, as well as from the Galapagos project and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Internationally, additions benefited by partial bookings at Aseng.Looking to 2010, we expect significant reserve additions from Tamar and Belinda, positive gas price improvements and closing the recent acquisition. This year is positioned to be one of the most exciting and noteworthy years for Noble Energy. The combination of sanctioning Tamar and Belinda, drilling at least seven impact deepwater wells around the globe and expanding our DJ Basin activity will provide a high level of interest each quarter. In each of our four focus areas, onshore U.S., deepwater Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Eastern Med [Eastern Mediterranean], we're applying our successful geoscience processes to further explore our large adjacent acreage positions. We've also developed strong project teams and processes to execute our portfolio of major projects on time and on schedule.At this time, James, we'd like to go ahead and open the call to questions."

But I think from what we've seen, it's been in that kind of $150 million to $200 million a day range on the imports. And that's obviously has an impact when you compare it versus a year ago, where there was essentially none. I mean, that's kind of where that comment comes from, Brian."

Looking back versus the same time last year, the overall economic outlook has clearly improved and we've seen dramatic moves in the energy markets. While we'll be providing an update of our operations in today's call, we plan to go into much greater depth at our Analyst Meeting coming up on June 3rd, and I hope that you will be able to join us either in person or on the webcast at that time. I think we'll have many exciting things to share with you at that point.
Starting out on the pricing side, there continues to be a wide disparity between the market value of crude and natural gas, which on the natural gas side continues to be challenged from the vast supply that the industry has uncovered and also the forecast for production growth in 2010. Perhaps last week's break in the gas rig count is an early indicator of producer discipline setting in, but I still have a lot of concerns about North America natural gas. That's exactly why we like our diversified portfolio, which includes many oil-based projects that we can and have been redeploying capital to.
Let me reiterate our overall objectives for the year, which I plan to touch on as we go through the results for the first quarter. Number one, of course, is to maintain our strong base of production such that when our major projects come on stream, they provide incremental growth.
Second is to continue with significant investments in exploration. Continued exploration will assure the growth momentum beyond the current inventory of major projects that we're developing. Next, we want to maintain our strong financial capacity throughout the year. And finally, we're focused on progressing this lineup of major projects that will clearly deliver transformational impacts on reserves and production over the next several years. I think we made solid progress during the first quarter on these goals.
Looking at our first quarter 2010 results, GAAP net income was $237 million. That was $1.34 per share diluted on revenues of $733 million. Adjusted net income was $138 million or $0.78 per share, with the only judgment item being this quarter being the unrealized commodity derivative gain.
Sales volumes for the first quarter averaged 197,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is consistent with the quarterly range we provided you during last quarter's call. Production volumes averaged 201,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which exceeded our sales volumes with the difference due to some specific, the timing on crude oil liftings in North Sea, as well as in Equatorial Guinea.
Our U.S. operations had a very strong quarter led by our onshore programs, which had record production for the quarter and accounted for approximately 83% of our total U.S. volumes. On shore, we remain focused on liquids opportunities, led by the Wattenberg field, which continues to deliver with record organic quarterly volumes and total volumes at about 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Another record for Wattenberg was that 50% of our volumes were liquids, either crude or natural gas liquids. Total onshore production was up nearly 6,000 barrels per day equivalent from the fourth quarter with the majority of the increase coming in crude and natural gas liquids.
Included in our first quarter's volumes is one month impact of the DJ Basin asset acquisition, which added a thousand barrels a day of liquids and 12 million cubic feet of gas per day on average for the quarter. Internationally, our first quarter volumes in Equatorial Guinea were impacted by the scheduled maintenance downtime at the Alba field and the LPG plant there. That maintenance reduced our sales volumes by 4,000 barrels a day of liquids and 49 million cubic feet of natural gas per day for the quarter. Maintenance work in Equatorial Guinea has now been completed, was carried out on schedule and on budget.
Natural gas sales in Israel were impacted during the quarter by some power plant downtime, also increased levels of competing imports, as well as warmer than usual winter weather. However, the continued strength in oil led to another pricing record for us in Israel. In the North Sea, volumes were up from Dumbarton and Lochranza; however, we were impacted by a couple of operational issues that Dave will talk about in just a few minutes.
Strong NGL pricing continues to enhance our net backed gas prices in certain U.S. locations, which overall led to U.S. gas realizations to be slightly above Henry Hub for the quarter. The increases in crude oil and natural gas liquid realizations have resulted in improved cash margins for us on a unit basis.
At this point, I want to just add a few comments on our hedging activities, as this is an important component supporting our capital programs. Recently, we've taken advantage of the oil markets to add to our hedge positions for 2011 and also began layering in oil contracts for 2012 at some very attractive price levels.
For U.S. natural gas, which only makes up about a third of our global production, we already had approximately two-thirds of our volumes hedged for 2010 and we have been increasing our hedge positions in 2011 as well, thus reducing our exposure to gas price volatility during this critical period, where we have significant capital expenditures for our major projects. Just add that all the details on our hedge positions will be found in our first quarter 10-Q, which, as David mentioned, will be filed later today.
Looking at our cost performance for the quarter, leased operating expense came in at just under $5 per barrel equivalent. That reflected lower than expected onshore U.S. repairs and workovers. DD&A was pretty consistent with our internal expectations, might have been a little bit higher than what the Street had had, with the difference being the impact of removing some of those low cost barrels in Equatorial Guinea due to the maintenance projects there, which of course then resulted in an overall higher average unit rate for the company for the quarter.
Production taxes, transportation and G&A came in on expectations and our effective tax rate and deferred portion on adjusted basis were both near the low end of our guidance ranges. On the exploration front, we participated in two of our seven significant wells for the year during the first quarter. Unfortunately, Double Mountain drilled at Green Canyon 555 in the deep water Gulf of Mexico was noncommercial, so we included $38 million of related costs before tax in the first quarter exploration expense. Our total net cost for the well was approximately $45 million. You will see the difference, which represents costs incurred in the second quarter. That will, of course, show up in the second quarter earnings.
And our other ongoing deep water Gulf of Mexico test Deep Blue, we and our partners decided to extend our planned drilling depth, which has delayed the result there a bit. We expect to have the results in the next month. Looking forward, we plan to appraise our large Gunflint discovery with one or perhaps two wells and we're preparing for additional exploration tests in both Equatorial Guinea and Israel later in the year.
Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $958 million. That was made up of $408 million for organic CapEx and then of course approximately $500 million for the DJ Basin asset acquisition.
And then in addition, there was another 40 million of non-cash accrual for the construction progress on our FPSO that's going in at Aseng. Our $2.5 billion capital budget remains unchanged for the year. And of course, this is a reminder that only represents the cash portion of our program. We should see those expenditures build throughout the year, as we develop our major projects for the deep water Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Israel.
Discretionary cash flow for the quarter was $432 million, which exceeded our organic spending. Total debt at the end of the quarter was slightly under $2.4 billion. We maintained very strong liquidity throughout the period, ending up with $2.5 billion of liquidity between our cash and available credit facility and that's after funding the first quarter acquisition. Our debt-to-cap net of cash was 17% at the end of the period.
I'll touch briefly on the progress on our major projects before handing it over to Dave. Last year, we sanctioned both Galapagos in the deep water gulf and Aseng in Equatorial Guinea and both of these oil projects continue to move forward.
First production from Galapagos is expected next year and everything's on schedule to bring Aseng's first production in 2012. We're busy finalizing the development plans of Tamar offshore Israel and the front end engineering work at Belinda offshore Equatorial Guinea is underway, which lead to sanctions on both this year. While we have not let taken Tamar for sanction, our Board has authorized substantial pre-sanction investments. As a result, our procurement teams have been busy letting contracts for supplies and services and the project execution folks are working to assure we stay on schedule and on budget.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.

I plan to focus most of my comments this morning on an update of our main programs around the globe. But before we jump to the activity, I want to start with our expectations for the second quarter and the rest of the year.
Our second quarter volumes should be up significantly from the first quarter, led by our operations in Equatorial Guinea coming back online, as well as the full quarter's impact of the onshore U.S. acquisition. Current production is actually running about 212,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, despite approximately 10,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the North Sea, which is shut in, waiting for facility changes at Dumbarton and Lochranza.
Total company sales for the second quarter are expected to range from 208,000 to 214,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This includes the impact of the Equatorial Guinea facility modifications for part of April and the assumption of two months downtime for the Dumbarton and Lochranza production. The second half of the year should be significantly higher than the first half, with full production from the North Sea, seasonal and demand increases in Israel, the full impact of the Alba production and our continued onshore U.S. growth.
Moving to our activity, let's start onshore in the United States. As Chuck mentioned, we had a stellar first quarter with record production. Currently, our onshore volumes are running a little over 100,000 barrels equivalent per day after the recent acquisition. We expect to be up another 6% to 8% by the end of the year. Activity remains focused on the liquid-rich opportunity set, which has resulted in liquids comprising 40% of our onshore volumes.
Certainly a key to this program is the core Wattenberg field. Now that the asset acquisition is closed, our total Wattenberg position is approximately 390,000 net acres, which provides us over a 10-year inventory of development projects. As we integrate the acquisition assets, we'll ramp our activity level to 8 or 9 rigs during the year. Of our six current drilling rigs in the field, with one focused on our 2010 horizontal Niobrara program, which is testing the potential for recovery in different areas of Wattenberg. This program will provide us production information and data comparisons across a large portion of the field.
Outside of Wattenberg, we'll be drilling a handful of horizontal Niobrara tests in Northern Colorado and Southern Wyoming during the year. Our overall program in the central DJ Basin area of focus now exceeds 730,000 net acres. As we look at our worldwide capital program, dry gas drilling in the U.S. represents only about 5% of our total 2010 expenditures.
In our two active onshore gas programs, the Haynesville and the Piceance, we'll reduce operated activity during the second half of the year. We plan to drop one of our two rigs in the East Texas Haynesville program by June and move our only Piceance rig to Iron Horse around August. These moves reflect our position to continue focusing on liquid-rich activities and essentially shift some gas drilling dollars into our Niobrara program evaluation.
Moving to the deep water Gulf of Mexico, we mentioned that last quarter's call that we recompleted a swordfish well into an oil zone earlier this year. As the well ramped up during the first quarter to its full rate of about 2,500 barrels of oil per day net, we encouraged facility handling problems at the third party downstream processing facility. This caused us to restrict the field from mid-March through most of April. While the repairs are being performed, we'll restrict swordfish to about 6,000 barrels of oil per day net, however, the repairs have been recently completed and swordfish is now ramping back to full rate.
At Galapagos, the INSCO 8501 rigs spud the Santiago exploration test and we expect to reach total depth by July. However, based on the proximity to the horizon rig incident, we'll continue to monitor developments that could affect our operations. Once drilling at Santiago is finished, the rig is expected to handle the completion work at Isabella, Santa Cruz, and hopefully, Santiago. This oil development represents the first of a number of major projects that will deliver substantial growth to our company over the next decade.
Our other deep water Gulf of Mexico rigs should move from Deep Blue in the next month or so to Gunflint to initiate appraisal drilling. We're certainly aware of the interest in Deep Blue, but adhering to our policy of not commenting on ongoing exploration wells do not expect any news on this well until sometime in May.
The first Gunflint appraisal location is a little over a mile north - northeast of the original discovery in block 948, where we will be testing the structure, thickness and contacts of the field. Also in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we were certainly thrilled to have great success at the March lease sale, where we added 16 additional blocks and a number of attractive prospects to our deep exploration inventory.
So now let's move to international. Starting with Israel, as Chuck mentioned, we achieved a record gas price for the quarter, highlighting the impact of our liquid fuel based sales agreement with the IEC and increasing sales to the Dead Sea works. As we mentioned in our last quarterly call, the Hagit power plant had down time during January and part of February. However, it is now fully operational.
Current overall Israel volume is back to our expected level. At Mari-B, we initiated the drilling of two additional development wells, which along with an offshore compression installation planned for later this year; we hope to maintain our peak field deliverability at around 600 million cubic feet per day, gross. We expect the first well to be completed in the second quarter and the second well in the third quarter. Ultimately, the new wells will also assist the field's long-term use of the storage reserve. The works that bring tomorrow is the first production in 2012 is continuing. We are reporting in place a number of long lead major service and equipment contracts consistent with our time line.
Marketing efforts continue both in securing additional supply agreements and finalizing gas sales and purchase agreements currently underpinned by the LLIs. We're continuing to work with both local and federal authorities to finalize and approve the onshore receiving terminal location, which will be an important step as we move to project sanctions.
Our processing and interpretation of the 3D seismic acquisition in the region is under way and we expect final results over the next few months. This will put us in a position to drill an exploration well when our rig arrives early in the fourth quarter.
In the North Sea, volumes in the first quarter were up from the fourth quarter 2009 and also up versus the first quarter last year, as a result of facility modifications at Dumbarton and the first Lochranza well, which came online during the first quarter 2010. We have been impacted by total field shutdowns at the third party operated Dumbarton Lochranza project since March. The field is currently shut in and is expected to be back online by the end of May. Upon restart of the field, production will ramp back up and include the impact from the second Lochranza well.
In West Africa, the scheduled downtime for equipment maintenance, upgrades and replacements at the Alba field, as well as the methanol and LPG facilities resulted in the lower first quarter volumes. In addition, the third party LNG facility had some maintenance performed at the same time. Facilities ramped back up in early April and are now back to full production. Second quarter volumes should be up significantly from the first quarter.
Our field development work at Aseng is progressing nicely. In fact, we now have all the major contracts to be awarded for the project finalized. The Pride South Pacific rig began in January and is now drilling its second development well. By early June, we expect to have a second rig on location to further assist field development. The hull being converted into the FPSO arrived in the shipyard in March. Everything looks to be progressing as expected. First production in mid 2012 isn't that far off and the anticipated oil contribution from Aseng will have a meaningful production and cash flow impact on our company.
At Belinda, our next major West Africa project, we're working with our partners to finalize the feed development work and anticipating submitting the plan of development to the government this quarter. We still expect to mix in an exploration well among our Equatorial New Guinea program later this year. In Cameroon, we recently began our 3D seismic shoot of approximately 600 square miles and we plan to process the data the second half of the year.
Before opening the call for questions, I do want to say that we are looking forward to providing further detail on our development operations, the progress of our major projects and our deep exploration portfolio at our upcoming analyst meeting June 3rd. We hope you're planning to attend.
With that, Lisa, I think we're ready for questions.

I think Dave can provide maybe a little bit more color, but what we talked about for instance at Aseng is because it's in a relatively new area, we have to be careful about recovery factors and until you see field performance, you would be limited to what you could say is good solid recovery factors for a field with the amount of data you got.
Tamar is a totally different picture because it's a gas reservoir and you've got a lot more things that you can look at to determine recovery. But again, it depends on at sanction, the data you have. You can't look ahead. So in the case of Aseng, that sanction is based on the wells we have in place and as we do the development program, we'll gather more data and that will likely help. And certainly at Tamar, where we have two wells, at sanction, that's the only data we'll have and we'll base our reserves on that.

Of course, one is the crude markets, which is there, you go into a global market and you really have to look at your global assessment of the oil markets. I think our view is that still a very strong market. Now, we do have some, as we've seen in the past where Cushing gets filled up and you see some changes of WTI pricing versus as an example, Brandt. But in the overall scheme of things, I think that's relatively minor.
And the other thing which you have to be careful on, remote areas in the past we've seen challenges in moving oil out of areas where the industry has had a surge of activity. That was one of the reasons that we participated in the White Cliffs pipeline that was built out of Wattenberg. So to give us another outlet for oil there and that is certainly helpful.
On a natural gas liquids side, I mean the margins for processing have been very strong and again, that's a market that tended to be a bit of a cyclical market, but it's also being influenced by the oil markets as well.
So I think itâ€™s - we still see that as a robust market. I think while many others are directionally moving their programs, the advantage that Noble has had all along as we've had the portfolio to be able to move capital. And as you know, we moved capital a long time ago into liquids-rich projects. So it's a matter of just continuing that emphasis.

We're fortunate in that even some of the vertical rigs, the rigs we would have to be drilling vertical wells, we've got two or three of those that we actually can use for horizontal drilling, at least initially, in the program if we decide to. I think the thing that still has the most pressure probably is the equipment, especially high pressure pumping equipment and then some of the frac sands and so forth.

It would run counter for us to jump into an opportunity that has a huge drilling obligation that requires you to ramp up activity over the course of the next 12 to 18 months.

We've probably - we've got thousands of wells, vertical wells in Wattenberg, penetrated in Niobrara. We have a lot of base information that we started looking at probably two to three years ago, got some additional core data, did some PBT work and so forth. This is something we've been looking at fairly hard for a couple of years now, at least a couple of years now. We actually drilled our first horizontal well last year, but we had a chance to start to see some production from that and then compare that to three other wells now over the last year, mainly last six months or so that we've brought online over some wide areas of the field. So we're starting to get a chance to see some things over a little larger area. I think we're just bringing our fifth well on now.
So by the end of this year, we should have probably 20 to 25 wells between Wattenberg and outside of Wattenberg and the horizontal play that will give us a pretty wide spectrum of information while we continue to look at core data, understand how these things compare from the vertical well and log information and then incorporate some of the seismic that we're shooting out there. As I've mentioned before, we should have over a couple hundred square miles of 3D seismic to also tie into this information. It's not something that's going to crop up overnight. It's something we've been looking at over a few years now.

Irene, I would say that that's another program that we'll want to talk about quite a bit with you at our June Analyst Meeting and hopefully give a good picture of what we see for a program going forward.

We've made quite a bit so far, but they were in areas that were flexible enough such that if something changed on particular aspects that we could still maintain schedule.
The key item which you mentioned is the onshore site location. It's kind of hard to build a bridge until you know where it's going to land on the other side of the water. And where we're making great progress on narrowing that down, but until we get at least the clearance and it's narrowed down to a single site, there will still always be lots of work to be done on that site. But as it gets narrowed down, that will be the, I think in my view, one of the key factors that it will allow us to say we've got the design locked down. We're comfortable that we can bring this to our Board and say this is the project that we're going to build.
So out of everything, I think that's the most important thing that we're doing now. And again, that process is moving forward in Israel. We've seen some great progress over the last couple of months on that. Weâ€™ve got some - right now, we have some commitments from the officials that are involved in those decisions to get us an answer on a single site here very shortly. But until we get that, I think we'll be careful about making the full project commitment that comes with sanctions.

I think we're in a great position for supplying natural gas to customers for decades and it's going to be a good business. But I think you have to be careful about when you spend money on it. It looks like it's fully supplied right now.
Yes, there are gas opportunities out there. This industry seems to change very quickly and all you have to do is look at the margins associated with oil projects versus gas projects right now and it has caused many producers to try to think of ways to become more orderly. I think we already had our portfolio well diversified, so we were in a very good position to allocate capital. But there's nothing wrong with being counter cyclical.
If you would have asked me a year and a half ago about making another acquisition in the Rockies, we probably would have said, no, we got too much of that. The Rockies differentials were expanding, but when that market changed and when the differential shrank and we saw the opportunity at the end of last year, we grabbed it very quickly. So it's all about value. And it's all about making sure that it's value that you can recognize based on your long-term view of the markets. So we're open to opportunities, whether gas and oil, I think that right now, as far as our internal programs, we like to invest into oil projects because of the margins, but that would not prevent us from picking up a gas opportunity. But as I noted earlier in the call, you have to be careful because many of them being presented now have huge drilling obligations that would force you to put capital into maybe a market that's a bit challenged right now.

Why do we like the Niobrara, why it's in Wattenberg, outside Wattenberg, within Wattenberg, because generally it's had very, very low recoveries in the field.

And as we go forward and we're growing these projects, yes, Galapagos or an Isabella, Santa Cruz coming on next year, that will be oil and that will move the oil mix. I would say from a U.S. side of things, I will expect that oil will continue to come up. And that's probably the trend that you would expect to see, especially with the way we've allocated capital.
When you look at the global portfolio and you go out to say 2012, you see perhaps a bit more of a balance because you see in Aseng, which is a rich oil coming on, but it's going to be coupled with Tamar, which is of course a gas project. But outside the U.S. and with pricing that's more tied to global liquids pricing, then certainly it's not tied to U.S. gas markets. So I think the key answer to your question is the U.S. business and clearly we see the U.S. business going more oily over the next year or two.

Looking back versus the same time last year, the overall economic outlook has clearly improved and we've seen some dramatic moves in the energy markets. While will be providing an update of our operations in today's call, we plan to go into much greater depth at our Analyst Meeting coming up on June 3, and I hope that you will be able to join us either in person or on the webcast at that time. I think, we'll have many exciting things to share with you at that point.
Now starting out on the pricing side, there continues to be a wide disparity between the market value of crude and natural gas, which on the natural gas side, continues to be challenged from the vast supply that the industry has uncovered, and also the forecast for production growth in 2010. Perhaps last week's break in the gas rig count is an early indicator of producer discipline setting in, but I still have a lot of concerns about North American natural gas. That's exactly why we like our diversified portfolio, which includes many oil-based projects that we can and have been redeploying capital to.
Let me reiterate our overall objectives for the year, which I plan to touch on as we go through the results for the first quarter. Number one, of course, is to maintain our strong base of production, such that when our major projects come on stream, they provide incremental growth. Second, is to continue with significant investments in exploration. Continued exploration will assure the growth momentum beyond the current inventory of major projects that we're developing. Next, we want to maintain our strong financial capacity throughout the year. And finally, we're focused on progressing this lineup of major projects that will clearly deliver transformational impact on reserves and production over the next several years. I think, we made solid progress during the first quarter on these goals.
Looking at our first quarter 2010 results, GAAP net income was $237 million. That was a $1.34 per share diluted on revenues of $733 million. Adjusted net income was $138 million or $0.78 per share with the only adjustment item this quarter, being the unrealized commodity derivative gain.
Sales volumes for the first quarter averaged 197,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which is consistent with the quarterly range we provided you during last quarter's call. Production volumes averaged 201,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which exceeded our sales volumes with the difference due to some specific, the timing on crude oil listings in the North Sea, as well as in Equatorial Guinea.
Our U.S. operations had a very strong quarter, led by our onshore programs, which had record production for the quarter and accounted for approximately 83% of our total U.S. volumes. Onshore, we remain focused on liquid opportunities, led by the Wattenberg field, which continues to deliver, with record organic quarterly volumes and total volumes at about 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Another record for Wattenberg was that 50% of our volumes were liquids, either crude or Natural Gas Liquids. Total onshore production was up nearly 6,000 barrels per day equivalent from the fourth quarter, with the majority of the increase coming in crude and Natural Gas Liquids.
Included in our first quarter's volumes is one month impact of the DJ Basin asset acquisition, which added a 1,000 barrels a day of liquids and 12 million cubic feet of gas per day on average for the quarter.
Internationally, our first quarter volumes in Equatorial Guinea were impacted by the scheduled maintenance downtime at the Alba field and the LPG plant there. That maintenance reduced our sales volumes by 4,000 barrels a day of liquids and 49 million cubic feet of natural gas per day on average for the quarter. The maintenance work in Equatorial Guinea is now being completed and was carried out on schedule and on budget.
Natural gas sales in Israel were impacted during the quarter by some power plant downtime, also increased levels of competing imports, as well as warmer-than-usual winter weather. However, the continued strength in oil led to another pricing record for us in Israel. In the North Sea, volumes were up from Dumbarton and Lochranza. However, we were impacted by a couple of operational issues that Dave will talk about in just a few minutes.
Strong NGL pricing continues to enhance our net nat gas prices in certain U.S. locations, which overall, lead to U.S. gas realizations to be slightly above our Henry Hub for the quarter. The increases in crude oil and natural gas liquid realizations have resulted in improved cash margins for us on a unit basis.
At this point, I want to just add a few comments on our hedging activities. This is an important component, supporting our capital programs. Recently, we've taken advantage of the oil markets to add to our hedged positions for 2011, and also began layering in oil contracts for 2012 at some very attractive price levels.
For U.S. natural gas, which only makes up about a third of our global production, we already had approximately two thirds of our volumes hedged for 2010 and we have been increasing our hedge positions in 2011 as well, thus reducing our exposure to gas price volatility during this critical period, where we have significant capital expenditures for our major projects. Just add that all the details on our hedge positions will be found in our first quarter 10-Q, which as David mentioned, will be filed later today.
Looking at our cost performance for the quarter, lease operating expenses came in at just under $5 per barrel equivalent. That reflected lower-than-expected onshore U.S. repairs and workovers. DD&A was pretty consistent with our internal expectations, might have been a little bit higher than what The Street had, had, with the difference being the impact of removing some of those low-cost barrels in Equatorial Guinea due to the maintenance projects there, which of course, then resulted in an overall higher average unit rate for the company for the quarter.
Production taxes, transportation and G&A came in on our expectations on our effective tax rate in deferred portion on adjusted basis were both near the low end of our guidance ranges. On the exploration front, we participated in two of our seven significant wells for the year during the first quarter. Unfortunately, Double Mountain drilled at Green Canyon 555 in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico was non-commercial, so we included $38 million of related cost before tax in the first quarter exploration expense. Our total net cost for the well was approximately $45 million. And you will see the difference, which represents costs incurred in the second quarter. That will, of course, show up in the second quarter earnings. 
At our other ongoing deepwater Gulf of Mexico test Deep Blue, we and our partners decided to extend our planned drilling depth, which has delayed the results there a bit. We expect to have the results in the next month. Looking forward, we plan to appraise our large Gunflint discovery, with one or perhaps two wells and we're preparing for additional exploration tests in both Equatorial Guinea and Israel later in the year.
Total capital expenditures for the quarter were $958 million. That was made up of $408 million for organic CapEx, and then of course approximately $500 million for the DJ Basin asset acquisition. And then in addition, there was another $40 million of non-cash accrual for the construction progress on our FPSO that's going in at Aseng. Our $2.5 billion capital budget remains unchanged for the year. And of course, this is a reminder, that only represents the cash portion of our program. We should see those expenditures build throughout the year, as we develop our major projects in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Israel.
Discretionary cash flow for the quarter was $432 million, which exceeded our organic spending. Total debt at the end the quarter was slightly under $2.4 billion, and we maintained very strong liquidity throughout the period, ending up with $2.5 billion of liquidity between our cash and available credit facility and that's after funding the first quarter acquisition. Our debt to cap net of cash was 17% at the end of the period.
I'll touch briefly on the progress on our major projects before handing it over to Dave. Last year, we sanctioned both Galapagos in the deepwater Gulf and Aseng in Equatorial Guinea, and both of these oil projects continue to move forward. First production from the Galapagos is expected next year and everything's on-schedule to bring Aseng to first production in 2012. We're busy finalizing the development plans at Tamar, offshore Israel and the front-end engineering work at Belinda, offshore Equatorial Guinea is underway, which led to sanctions on both this year. While we have not yet taken Tamar for sanction, our Board has authorized substantial pre-sanction investments. As a result, our procurement teams have been busy letting contracts for supplies and services and the project execution folks are working to ensure we stay on schedule and on budget. So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave."

I plan to focus most of my comments this morning on an update of our main programs around the globe. But before we jump to the activity, I want to start with our expectations for the second quarter and the rest of the year. Our second quarter volume should be up significantly from the first quarter, led by our operations in Equatorial Guinea coming back online, as well as the full quarter's impact of the onshore U.S. acquisition. Current production is actually running about 212,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, despite approximately 10,000 barrels equivalent per day in the North Sea, which is shut-in, waiting for some facility changes at Dumbarton and Lochranza.
Total company sales for the second quarter are expected to range from 208,000 to 214,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This includes the impact of the Equatorial Guinea facility modifications for part of April and the assumption of two months downtime for the Dumbarton and Lochranza production. The second half of the year should be significantly higher than the first half, with full production from the North sea, seasonal and demand increases in Israel, the full impact of the Alba production and our continued onshore U.S. growth.
Moving to our activity, let's start onshore in the United States. As Chuck mentioned, we had a stellar first quarter with record production. Currently, our onshore volumes are running a little over 100,000 barrels equivalent per day after the recent acquisition. We expect to be up another 6% to 8% by the end of the year. Activity remains focused on the liquid-rich opportunity set, which has resulted in liquids comprising 40% of our onshore volumes.
Certainly, a key to this program is the core Wattenberg field. Now that, that asset acquisition is closed, our total Wattenberg position is approximately 390,000 net acres, which provides us over a ten-year inventory of development projects. As we integrate the acquisition assets, we'll ramp our activity level to eight or nine rigs during the year. Of our six current drilling rigs in the field, with one focused on our 2010 horizontal Niobrara program, which is testing the potential for increased recoveries in different areas of Wattenberg. This program will provide us production information and data comparisons across a large portion of the field. Outside of Wattenberg, we'll be drilling a handful of horizontal Niobrara test in northern Colorado and Southern Wyoming during second half of the year. Our overall position on the central DJ Basin area of focus now exceeds 730,000 net acres.
As we look at our worldwide capital program, dry gas drilling in the U.S. represents only about 5% of our total 2010 expenditures. In our two active onshore gas programs, the Haynesville and the Piceance, we'll reduce operated activity during the second half of the year. We plan to drop one of our two rigs in the East Texas Haynesville program by June and move our only Piceance rig to Iron Horse around August. These moves reflect our position to continue focusing on liquid-rich activities and essentially shift some gas drilling dollars into our Niobrara program evaluation.
Moving to the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we mentioned at last quarter's call that we have re-completed the Swordfish well into an oil zone earlier this year. As the well ramped up during the first quarter to its full rate of about 2,500 barrels of oil per day net, we incurred some facility handling problems at the third-party downstream processing facility. This caused us to restrict the field from mid-March through most of April. While the repairs are being performed, we'll restrict the Swordfish by about 6,000 barrels of oil per day net. However, the repairs have been recently completed and Swordfish is now ramping back to full rate.
At Galapagos, the ENSCO 8501 rig spud the Santiago exploration test, and we expect to reach total depth by July. However, based on the proximity to the Horizon rig incident, we'll continue to monitor developments that could affect our operations. Once drilling at Santiago is finished, the rig is expected to handle the completion work at Isabela, Santa Cruz and hopefully, Santiago. This oil development represents the first of a number of major projects that will deliver substantial growth to our company over the next decade.
Our other deepwater Gulf of Mexico rigs should move from Deep Blue in the next month or so to Gunflint to initiate appraisal drilling. We're certainly aware of the interest in Deep Blue, but adhering to our policy of not commenting on ongoing exploration wells, do not expect any news on this well until sometime in May.
The first Gunflint appraisal location is a little over a mile North-Northeast of the original discovery on Block 948, where we will be testing the structure, thickness and contact of the field. Also in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, we were certainly thrilled to have had great success at the March lead sale, where we added 16 additional blocks and a number of attractive prospects to our deep exploration inventory.
Now let's move to International. Starting with Israel, as Chuck mentioned, we achieved a record gas price for the quarter, highlighting the impact of our liquid fuel based sales agreement with the IEC and increasing sales to the Dead Sea Works. As we mentioned in our last quarterly call, the Hagit power plant had downtime during January and part of February. However, it is now fully operational.
Current overall Israel volume is back to our expected level. At Mary-B, we initiated the drilling of two additional development wells, which along with an offshore compression installation planned for later this year, will help to maintain our peak field deliverability at around 600 million cubic feet per day gross. We expect the first well to be completed in the second quarter and the second well in the third quarter. Ultimately, the new wells will also assist the field's long-term use of the storage reserve.
The work to bring Tamar to first production in 2012 is continuing. We're putting in place a number of the long lead major service and equipment contracts consistent with our timeline. Marketing efforts continue, both in securing additional supply agreements and finalizing gas sales and purchase agreements, currently underpinned by the LOIs. We're continuing to work with both local and federal authorities to finalize and approve the onshore receiving terminal location, which will be an important step, as we move to project sanction.
Our processing and interpretation of the 3D seismic acquisition in the region is underway and we expect the final results over the next few months. This will put us in a position to drill an exploration well when our rig arrives early in the fourth quarter.
In the North sea, volumes in the first quarter were up from the fourth quarter 2009 and also up versus the first quarter last year, as a result of facility modifications at Dumbarton and the first Lochranza well, which came online during the first quarter of 2010. We have been impacted by total field shutdowns at the third-party operated Dumbarton/Lochranza project since March. The field is currently shut in and is expected to be back online by the end of May. Upon restart of the field, production will ramp back up and include the impact from the second Lochranza well.
In West Africa, the scheduled downtime for equipment maintenance, upgrades and replacement at the Alba field, as well as the methanol and LPG facilities resulted in the lower first quarter volumes. In addition, the third-party LNG facility had some maintenance performed at the same time. The facilities ramped back up in your April and are now back to full production. Second quarter volumes should be up significantly from the first quarter.
Our field development work at Aseng is progressing nicely. In fact, we now have all the major contracts to be awarded for the project finalized. The prized South Pacific rig began operations in January and is now drilling its second development well. By early June, we expect to have a second rig on location to further assist field development. The hull being converted in to the FPSO arrived in a shipyard at the end of March, and everything looks to be progressing as expected. First production in mid-2012 isn't that far off and the anticipated oil contribution from Aseng will have a meaningful production and cash flow impact on our company.
At Belinda, our next major West Africa project, we're working with our partners to finalize the FEED development work and anticipating submitting the plan of development to the government this quarter. We still expect to mix in an exploration well among our Equatorial Guinea drilling program later this year. In Cameroon, we recently began our 3D seismic shoot of approximately 600 square miles and we plan to process the data the second half of the year.
Before opening the call for questions, I do want to say that we are looking forward to providing further detail on our development operations, the progress of our major projects and our Deep exploration portfolio at our upcoming Analyst Meeting, June 3. We hope you're planning to attend.
With that, Liza, I think we're ready for questions."

I think, what you have to do is look at the data you have at the time of sanction, in terms of the wells that have been drilled, and use appropriate guidelines on what to do as proven. I think, Dave, can provide maybe a little bit more color. But what we've talked about, for instance, at Aseng is because it's in a relatively new area, we have to be careful about recovery factors. And until you see field performance, you would be limited to what you could say is good solid recovery factors for a field with the amount of data you've got. Tamar is a totally different picture, because it's a gas reservoir and you've got a lot more things you can look at to determine recovery. But again, it depends on at sanction, the data you have. You can't look ahead. So in the case of Aseng, that sanction is based on the wells we have in place, since we do the development program. We'll gather more data and that will likely help and certainly at Tamar, where we have two wells at sanction, that's the only data we'll have and we'll base our reserves on that."

You really have to look at your global assessment of the oil markets. I think, our view is that it's still a very strong market. Now we do have some, as we've seen in the past, where pushing gets filled up and you see some changes of WTI pricing versus say, as an example, brand. But in the overall scheme of things, I think, that's relatively minor. And the other thing, which you have to be careful on is in remote areas, in the past, we've seen challenges in moving oil out of areas, where the industry has had a surge of activity. That was one of the reasons that we participated in the White Cliffs pipeline that was built out of Wattenberg, so it would give us another outlet for oil there and that is certainly helpful. On the natural gas liquids side, I mean, the margins for processing have been very strong. And again, that's a market that's tended to be a bit of a cyclical market, but it's also being influenced by the oil markets as well. So I think, we still see that as a robust market. I think, while many others are directionally moving their programs, the advantage that Noble has had all along, is we've had the portfolio to be able to move capital. And as you know, we move capital a long time ago into liquids-rich projects. So it's a matter of just continuing that emphasis."

And so, we might be at a maybe a slight price disadvantage on some of our volume. But I think right now, our primary customer is maintaining a diversity of supply. They've got agreements with two suppliers and you couple that with the fact that the weather has been warm and demand has been down and it's allowed them to sort of split their supply between the two of us.

We've made quite a bit so far, but they were in areas that were flexible enough such that if something changed on particular aspects that we could still maintain schedule. The key item which you mentioned is the onshore site location. It's kind of hard to build a bridge until you know where it's going to land on the other side of the water. And we're making great progress on narrowing that down, but until we get at least the clearance and it's narrowed down to a single site, there will still always be lots of work to be done on that site. But as it gets narrowed down, that will be the -- I think, in my view, one of the key factors that will allow us to say we've got the design locked down. We're comfortable that we can bring this to our board and say, ""This is the projects that we're going to build."" So out of everything, I think that's the more most important thing that we're doing now. And again, that process is moving forward in Israel. We've seen some great progress over the last couple of months on that. We've got some -- right now, we have some commitments from the officials that are involved in those decisions to get us an answer on a single site here very shortly. But until we get that, I think we'll be careful about making the full project commitment that comes with sanction."

I think we're in a great position for supplying natural gas to customers for decades and it's going to be a good business. But I think you have to be careful about when you spend money on it. It looks like it's fully supplied right now. Yes, there are gas opportunities out there. This industry seems to change very quickly and all you have to do is look at the margins associated with oil projects versus gas projects right now. And it's caused many producers to try to think of ways to become more oily. I think we already had our portfolio well diversified, so we are in a very good position to allocate capital. But there's nothing wrong with being countercyclical. If you would have asked me a year and a half ago about making another acquisition in the Rockies, we probably would have said ""No, we got too much of that and the Rockies differentials were expanding."" But when that market changed and when the differentials shrank and we saw the opportunity at the end of last year, we grabbed it very quickly. So it's all about value. And it's all about making sure that it's value that you can recognize based on your long-term view of the markets. So we're open to opportunities, whether gas and oil, I think that right now, as far as our internal programs, we'd like to invest a project into oil projects because of the margins. But that would not prevent us from picking up a gas opportunity. But as I noted earlier on the call, you have to be careful because many of them being presented now have huge drilling obligations that would force you to put capital into a market that's maybe a bit challenged right now."

We clearly see the potential to enhance recoveries, not only on a per well basis, but in terms of on a per unit of capital that's employed. And you're looking at significantly enhanced returns as a result. Why we like the Niobrara, why it's in Wattenberg or outside Wattenberg, within Wattenberg? It's because generally it's had very, very low recoveries in the field. It's been commercially developed using vertical Wells, but it's had very, very low recoveries. And so, applying technology, we certainly believe there is a potential to enhance that recovery and there's a lot in place, a huge amount in place. So there's a great prize. That's why we like it."

Today I plan to go through our quarterly results and also our updated guidance items. I'll also be discussing the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and also touch on a few of our major projects, which Dave Stover will go",1479,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Today I plan to go through our quarterly results and also our updated guidance items. I'll also be discussing the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and also touch on a few of our major projects, which Dave Stover will go in to greater detail on.
Our results for the second quarter were outstanding, with GAAP net income at $204 million or $1.10 per share diluted. Adjusted net income was $198 million or $1.07 per diluted share, and that's after removing the impact of the unrealized commodity derivative gain, as well as a rig termination charge that I'll touch on in a few minutes. 
Sales volumes for the second quarter were a very robust 219,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, outpacing production due to additional oil liftings in both Equatorial Guinea and the North Sea. But even without the extra liftings, our production volume was at 214,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was on the high end of the quarterly guidance that we previously provided to you.
Volumes in the U.S. were up a strong 3.5% from the first quarter. That was driven largely by our Wattenberg development program and the impact of the DJ Basin asset acquisition that closed the 1st of March this year. This was offset by some third-party downtime we experienced at the Swordfish and Ticonderoga assets in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
Internationally, our volumes were up a very substantial 22% over the first quarter, led by our operations in Equatorial Guinea as well as Israel. In Equatorial Guinea, the Alba field maintenance was completed early in the second quarter, and we again saw additional liftings of crude there. And in Israel, demand for our natural gas was very strong, with sales up nearly 40% from the first quarter. 
On the pricing side of things, we continue to benefit from the strength in liquid markets, which combined with higher oil volumes, contributed to a 13% increase in oil revenues over the first quarter. Going the other direction, our natural gas revenues declined slightly, primarily a result of the softer U.S. gas markets in the second quarter. I know I'm sounding like a broken record on this, but the U.S. gas market is not where one should be trying to accelerate dry gas production. However, on the flip side, our natural gas realizations in Israel this quarter were actually 11% above our U.S. gas realizations.
I'm very pleased with our cost performance for the quarter, lease operating expense stayed relatively flat from the first quarter, right at $5 dollars per barrel oil equivalent. Production taxes and transportation were as expected while DD&A per unit came down significantly driven by higher low-cost volumes coming from Equatorial Guinea and Israel.
G&A and taxes were in line as well. Expiration expense was lower than our original expectations, which had contemplated having results by now from our deepwater drilling at the Santiago and Deep Blue wells. Drilling operations at both these wells were suspended with the announcement of the deepwater moratorium. 
After evaluating the Gulf of Mexico situation, we proceeded ahead and negotiated an agreement with Noble Corp. On the Clyde Boudreaux rig, which canceled the terms of the original contract. We agreed to pay a $26 million fee, which we have recognized in the second quarter as a termination liability. In addition, we have established the framework for a new contract post-moratorium that will have a day rate over $200,000 per day lower than the original contract.
In this morning's release, we updated a few of our guidance items taking into account a number of factors impacting the outlook for the year, including our performance to date, the sale of certain non-core onshore U.S. assets as well as the suspension of drilling in the deepwater Gulf. Our cash organic capital budget is now estimated at $2.2 billion for the year. That's down from the original budget of $2.5 billion. We spent a little less than $1 billion of that to date. And just once again to clarify, organic CapEx includes -- Let me back up. To clarify the organic CapEx excludes our acquisition capital, which that would be the Petro Canada acquisition, as well as a non-cash capital we accrue for the Aseng FPSO lease. 2/3 of the $300 million reduction on spending is related to the deepwater Gulf of Mexico drilling suspension, which of course is impacting both development and exploration operations. The remaining $100 million is related to other major projects, including a combination of project cost reductions as well as some timing changes.
We've adjusted our total volumes for the year to now range from 211,000 to 217,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We brought down the high end of our range but left the bottom end intact. Overall, the midpoint of the range is down 3,000 barrels equivalent per day, with of course the primary reason being the sale of approximately 5,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day from our onshore U.S. assets.  And that sale is expected to close mid-August. 
In addition, FPSO equipment issues that we encountered in the North Sea and a weak first quarter in Israel tightened the range some. However offsetting these variations, we've seen continued strong volumes at Wattenberg, which is providing us out performance on the onshore U.S. assets.
On the cost side, we've trimmed our estimate for lease operating expense, primarily a result of the sale of the higher-cost onshore volumes and some good performance to date. I already mentioned that the exploration expense is coming down. And everything else has stayed relatively in line with our prior ranges. As a reminder, net proceeds from our onshore U.S. asset sale should be over $500 million after tax. Combined with our lower 2010 capital spending, we'll be seeing a benefit of about $800 million of additional liquidity at the end of the year versus earlier expectations further strengthening our financial position.
Switching gears here a little bit. I thought I'd spend a couple of minutes on the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Without going into a lot of detail, let me just say we've spent a vast amount of time revisiting our offshore spill plans, drilling designs, preventive measures, and not just in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico but across all of our global offshore operations. And we've also engaged our partners, rig and service providers and others in those discussions as well. I would say that based on these reviews, we continue to be confident that deepwater energy resources can be safely developed. However, we and the broader industry are moving forward quickly with enhanced plans, enhanced procedures and equipment to better assure safe operations and incident response capabilities. 
The offshore environment is certainly going to be different than before the Macondo incident. And there are a number of new legislative proposals out there dealing with liability, financial responsibility and new potential operating requirements. Noble Energy has been playing a very active role in providing input to these new proposals. We've also been very involved in trade association efforts and have spent a good bit of time visiting with a variety of policymakers. Our intent is to continue to be involved and make sure that Washington understands the importance of oil and gas development in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as the benefits that independence can bring to that area.
I mentioned earlier that we had terminated one of our two rig contracts in the deepwater Gulf. For our other rig, we actually received the industry's first deepwater completion permit post-moratorium. And that was for the Santa Cruz completion, which is allowing our Galapagos project to move forward. So I just say hats off to our team and also the team over at ENSCO for working together on a number of efforts that included verification of service provider training and capability to operational compliance against federal regulations and the third-party certification of maintenance records and BOP systems. It was a substantial effort and I think all of our service providers and internal staff did a great job of providing the assurances that we needed, so that we could carry on with that operation. 
At Tamar in offshore Israel, we're progressing a simplified development option with our partners and the appropriate agencies that will provide us with greater flexibility on that development, actually reduce the onshore impacts while maintaining our production timeline. We're finishing up the final design, which will take advantage of our existing infrastructure and we expect to sanction this project shortly. Continued efforts are being made to invest in long lead materials and a lock in installation contracts, with a focus continuing to be on delivering these important energy sources to the growing Israel market. Our goal for first production at Tamar in 2012 remains intact. So with that, Dave, I'll turn it over to you."

And I will finish with our expectations for the third quarter. Beginning in the U.S. was another very strong quarter for our onshore operation, averaging over 102,000 barrels equivalent per day, a high point for Noble Energy. Our volumes for the quarter included a full contribution from the DJ Basin acquisition, as well as continued growth in our Wattenberg asset, which produced nearly 53,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 50% of the volume being liquids. In our horizontal Niobrara program, we now have two rigs drilling in the central DJ Basin, both currently in the Wattenberg field. So far, we have drilled 10 horizontal Niobrara wells in Wattenberg and two in the Grover area about 20 miles northeast of Wattenberg. Eight of the Wattenberg wells are now on production, with two awaiting completion operations.  
As we continue to step out to the north and the eastern portions of the Wattenberg field, we're encouraged by the early flow back in liquid content of our new wells. Recent initial 24-hour rates have ranged from 580 to 845 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with a 70% to 90% liquid content. Starting in September, we expect to drill a few more wells closer to the Gemini area around the core of the field and near existing vertical producers. The Gemini well has now produced over 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent in just four months and is currently producing about 600 barrels oil equivalent per day.
In the Grover area, the first two horizontal wells were recently drilled and are undergoing completion operations. We will keep one of the two current horizontal rigs in Wattenberg the rest of the year. And the other rig will move between Wattenberg and the Grover area. In southern Wyoming, we're also bringing in an additional rig to drill three horizontal Niobrara wells starting in the third quarter. Overall, our horizontal Niobrara program is on target, with about 30 total wells drilled into play by year end. Along with our ongoing 3D seismic activity, production monitoring and additional reservoir evaluation work, we should be in a good position by the end of the year to assess our expansion plans for this area.
Overall, we're currently operating 13 rigs on our onshore U.S. program. Five of those rigs are conducting horizontal operations, and eight are drilling vertical wells. Offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, we produced about 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. On our last call, we mentioned that Swordfish was curtailed about 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for most of April, as some maintenance was performed at the downstream processing facilities. We're still experiencing some slight curtailment there, about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day waiting on final repairs in the next month or so.
After the Santa Cruz completion, we plan to move the ENSCO 8501 rig to the Isabella completion, using up our allocated time slot on the ENSCO rig this year. This will finish the completion work for the initial two Galapagos project wells.
Moving to international, it was a very strong second quarter for our operations in Israel, where we saw continued strength in the quarterly gas price. Keeping in mind that we have seasonal demand in Israel, we had the highest second quarter gas sales volume in our history. Growth in Israel's overall electricity demand continued shifting to natural gas and increased industrial consumption have led to higher sales. 
The growing demand for natural gas in Israel has strong positive implications for our Tamar development. As we have previously noted, we believe that gas demand in Israel will grow with supply availability. And that appears to be happening rapidly. Just recently, our primary gas customer, Israel Electric, announced plans  it would consider converting existing coal-fired power plants to natural gas. In addition, a new power plant has been planned for sometime now that originally was designed to be coal-fired, is now also being considered to be primarily gas-fired with coal as a backup. 
These market changes would provide strong upside demand for our Tamar gas. Through a combination of near-term demand, during the second quarter we completed the first of two additional development wells at Mary-B aimed at helping to maintain peak field deliverability. With a new well online, we were able to hit a record intraday deliverability rate of over 550 million cubic feet per day growth in early July.  The second well is drilling and remains on schedule for completion in September. And we're moving forward on our compression project with installation scheduled to begin later this year. 
On the exploration front, the Sedco Express rigs should spud our Leviathan prospect to offshore Israel in early October. Here the primary target is the 16 Tcf gross prospect with a 50% chance of success in the same interval that we discovered at Tamar and Dalit. We operate Leviathan with a 40% working interest, and expect initial results by early next year. 
As we evaluated our seismic and because of the extent of our development exploration acreage, we recently signed a short-term contract with an extended option period for the Pride North America rig that will start at the beginning of next year. This will give us the ability to expand our program in this area with continued exploration success. 
In addition to our upcoming drilling activity, we've recently awarded an additional 3D seismic study to commence later this year over a significant piece of our remaining acreage.
In the North Sea, we mentioned at the last call that Dumbarton and Lochranza were shut in at the end of March due to some unexpected FPSO equipment issues. Production came back online in mid-May. However, the FPSO restrictions have not allowed the fields to produce at a consistent volume. We're working with the operator to identify solutions that would enable full production of between 10,000 to 15,000 barrels a day net. 
In West Africa, the scheduled downtime for equipment maintenance, upgrades and replacements at the Alba field, as well as the methanol and LPG facilities, was completed in early April and field production returned to full capacity. In the third quarter, there are eight weeks of scheduled wireline work that will impact production by about 1,000 barrels equivalent per day net for that period.
At the Aseng oil development in Equatorial Guinea, our second contracted rig, the Atwood Hunter, arrived in mid-June and is supplementing the ongoing field development work. The results of this drilling program so far continue to give encouragement to additional resource potential for Aseng and between our two rigs, all drilling and completion well work should be finished by the first of next year. That will put us in a great position to have this oil project online by mid-2012. On the FPSO, hull refurbishment and module fabrication work continues on schedule. We're very pleased to the overall progress of the project and the operational readiness of our team.
At Alen, formerly called Belinda, we have now submitted the plan of development to the Ministry and we remain on schedule to sanction this liquid project late  year. Along with our partners, we're bidding out some of the major contracts and have begun the process to commit to certain long lead items. So everything is moving forward as expected here as well.
In Cameroon, we completed our 3D seismic shoot of approximately 600 square miles. We'll be processing the data throughout the second half of the year targeting the potential to drill at least one new oil prospect in 2011. We've also recently awarded a 3D seismic shoot offshore Nicaragua for later this year.
Now taking a quick look at the third quarter. Total company sales are expected to range from 212,000 to 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our sales differ from actual production based on the timing of liftings at the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea and the North Sea. As Chuck mentioned, during the second quarter, sales were greater than production but we expect sales to be less than production during the third quarter based on our current lifting schedules. It is worth mentioning that our second quarter production was 214,000 barrels equivalent per day. And we expect to see continued production growth in the third quarter despite our onshore volumes impacted by the August sale of 5,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The DJ Basin, North Sea, Alba field and Israel will all contribute to increasing actual production in the third quarter. So with that, Nicole, let's go ahead and open it up for questions."

One, of course, are the existing coal plants. And there's actually a process that's already started for tendering of gas that would be involved in supplementally either replacing a coal or supplementary firing those plants. And so I think it still depends on conversion time frame. But that's an incremental demand that we see of somewhere around 200 million a day. And I think that the timing on that is fairly soon after we expect to start up Tamara. So that program is moving forward. And, again, that's being driven by availability of gas plus just the benefits from a environmental standpoint of switching from coal to gas which is certainly being recognized in Israel. The second project is a project that's a little later. I think the time frame they're talking about for the Ashkelon power plant is in the 2014-2015 time frame. And that project, again, is the original plan was for two basically little over 600-megawatt plants, super critical boilers on coal, and now they have done some work and have determined that they can also fire those on natural gas with perhaps coal as backup.  Israel recently announced -- the infrastructure minister announced that they were going to take that to the Knesset but that's still far down the road and that's some long term demand that could be added to. So, again, our view is that dual fuels would be seeing the impact seen maybe 2014 beginning 2015 depends on the conversion timing and it would probably be a couple of years later before you'd see the Ashkelon project.  But that's the forecast we're carrying and we're seeing there's quite a urgency underway right now to build additional power capacity in Israel. They're short so those plans could accelerate. But as I mentioned that's clearly upside to some of the earlier demand forecast that we saw for gas."

So the answer is, no, we don't expect the cost to markedly change as a result of this.  Quite honestly we like the alternatives that we've been pursuing.  We have been looking at these all along because this has been a project where we had to basically keep alive several alternatives as we went forward.  And our view right now is the onshore receiving terminal is problematic.  There is still a real question about its location.  And we have real concerns that by the time that would be approved, it would really have an impact on the project's schedule. So while I personally believe that there will ultimately be an onshore terminal.  Maybe it will be tied to further exploration work that we do and additional resources that we certainly hope will be discovered in the basin.  But near-term we can utilize some of our existing facilities and mitigate those onshore impacts do it in a way that does not really markedly change the project costs."

There's been no cap on spill liability, the primary driver in some of these. And then the other piece of it is what financial responsibility you demonstrate referred to as a Certificate of Financial Responsibility or COFR. I think where it is going today, the third-party liability cap has been moving up. And I think most of us realize that, that always was a fairly tenuous cap. There's a lot of ways that it could be breached. So while we would like to make sure that the industry has access to other sources of funds, for instance, the oil spill liability trust fund or perhaps some other pool arrangement, when you go above whatever cap it is, I think that the area that we've been zeroed in on is the financial responsibility requirement. And I guess I would just say that from the discussions we've had, there's been a growing appreciation of raising that COFR or Certificate of Financial Responsibility to a very high number is more damaging than good. And as a result, I don't know whether we will see anything in this current legislation that will move through. It may be later in the year. But certainly, the trend has been as every week passes, there has been more reasonable discussion by policymakers about what's an appropriate adjustment to make in these, and also more discussion about how the broader industry can have access to a pool of funds or some sort of central fund that would give them, in a way, a type of insurance, not true form of insurance but a way to fund the liability of an incident should it -- hopefully never again occur to this magnitude but should it occur."

I mean we made it clear early on that Tamar was in our view dedicated to the local market. As the Tamar size has grown, they've seen that there is a lot of gas, multi-decades of gas available from Tamar. And so there's actually been a significant openness in Israel to the idea of exports, and that's been talked about a lot. Our challenge is to keep them from counting that as a done deal until we drill the exploration well.  They tend to view prospects as discoveries there. And so more of our effort has been on trying to make sure they understand the exploration work that we have in front of us, before we can count all this as a discovery. But certainly, they've actually started to think about the economic impacts on their country of exports and what that might mean for them and some of the other implications. That will be a significant project, as I know you would appreciate something that's 16 Tcf in size if that where to happen that is a major export project, and there's a lot of work that would have to be done.

I'd probably reference you back to one of the exhibits that Ted Brown showed in the June Analyst Meeting where it kind of showed our plans for drilling out there. And what I mentioned is I think by the end of this year, we'll have 15 to 20 horizontal wells in Wattenberg. We'll have six or seven in this Grover area that's kind of northeast of Wattenberg. And we'll have three in Southern Wyoming. And we've kind of shown some depiction of that in Ted's presentation in June. I think that's really what's going to give us the additional knowledge, when we tie to some of the horizontal -- vertical comparisons. Obviously, we have a number of vertical wells in Wattenberg. And then there's some industry data outside of Wattenberg. But when you take that range and aerial extent of comparison then by the end of year, be able to tie that back to the vertical piece, that's what'll give us a pretty good working knowledge then by the end of the year. With that, we'll be able to then compare some things as to how the Niobrara changes across some of these areas, how the different zones within the Niobrara look. But we really need to get some of that work done, that horizontal work done across that wider area especially outside of Wattenberg. I think when you look at the pipeline piece, for example, White Cliffs, I think it can be expanded probably 20,000 or 30,000 barrels a day fairly easily, with some compression and so forth. And I know there's a number of folks looking at that scenario which you brought up, as to additional expansion out in that area. And in fact, we've got our marketing team doing a lot of work with some folks that are looking at what's going to be required from the whole industry scale out through that area. So I think that's still in its early stages. We hope that is the case where production ramps up, like you're talking about. That'd be an exciting thing to watch. And we're going to be staying up front in that and planning for especially the infrastructure going forward. But end of the day, I think we'll be able to move the volume out of the area."

The reason that we talked about some of these additional things is that the timing of that additional demand seems to be moving up. And of course, we always deal in average demand and there will still be seasonal demand in Israel that you will see periods of probably very high demand, peak demand. And then as you go out, one of the things that is the wildcard in all this is those numbers that I referred to assume that Egyptian supply continues to enter this system and we continue to see that Egyptian supply has its good days and it has its bad days. And it's always subject to the political issues as well. And so that's another 200 million on today's volume that can move around. So our view is, is we want to be prepared to be able to handle whatever Israel needs from day one.  Even if that mean's having -- delivering an additional 200 million to cover the volumes. So it's a wide range. I wouldn't change from what we've provided in the past. I just in my own mind feel that there's upside to that because of the incremental demand needs we're seeing, the discussion of conversion of plants, the fact that electricity demand in Israel continues to grow rapidly, that industrial customers continue to appear almost daily, as they see the benefits of natural gas. And that the imports that they do have from Egypt continue to be volatile and that provides us incremental opportunities to deliver spot sales if those imports should fail."

In Nicaragua, we'll actually start shooting our seismic later this year. And they're at least from the initial look and then, obviously this is very high risk type prospects still at this point until we get some additional seismic shot. So those are very big prospects size.  I mean I think we've talk before in the past about billion barrel size of prospects down there."

But we are going to step back down and drill some Gemini type wells here over the next few months. I think two or three additional wells. And the difference here, the recent wells up to the north these are kind of in new areas also.  If you remember the Gemini type well was down in the developed part of the field.  More towards the core of the field and it had a higher gas content but it was also testing the ability to drain new resources out of areas where it had fairly extensive vertical production history.  And that's what we're also going to test with these other couple wells that we'll call more Gemini like that we're going to drill here in the next few months.

On the call today, we have Chuck Davidson, Chairman and CEO; Dave Stover, President and COO; and Ken Fisher, CFO. 
The plan for the call today is to have Chuck review our results for the quarter as well as discuss some updated guidance. Dave will then review our global operations, focus on second quarter highlights and our ongoing activity levels.  Many of you participated in our Analyst Meeting held June 3 either in person or via webcast. We won't be reviewing much of the detail in the call today, so I encourage those who haven't had a chance to review the replay of that webcast.
Today we'll leave plenty of time for Q&A at the end of our prepared remarks. But we're going to try to wrap up the call in less than an hour. We know that everyone's busy with the earnings schedule. Should you have any questions that we don't get to this morning, please don't hesitate to call, and we'll do the best we can to answer you.
We hope everyone has seen our earnings release that we issued this morning. Later today, we expect to be filing our 10-Q with the SEC, and it will also be available on our website.
I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements based on our current view and most reasonable expectations. We provide no assurances on these statements as a number of factors and uncertainties could cause actual results in the future periods to differ materially from what we discuss. You should read our full disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that influence our business.
We'll reference certain non-GAAP financial measures today, such as adjusted net income, or discretionary cash flow. When we refer to these items, it is because we believe they are good metrics to use in evaluating the company's performance. Be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release tables.  
With that, let me turn the call over to Chuck."
292135,109545092,70825,"Noble Energy, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Noble Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Today I plan to go through our quarterly results and also our updated guidance items. I'll also be discussing the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and also touch on a few of our major projects, which Dave Stover will go",1477,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Today I plan to go through our quarterly results and also our updated guidance items. I'll also be discussing the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and also touch on a few of our major projects, which Dave Stover will go in to greater detail on.
Our results for the second quarter were outstanding, with GAAP net income at $204 million or $1.10 per share diluted. Adjusted net income was $198 million or $1.07 per diluted share, and that's after removing the impact of the unrealized commodity derivative gain, as well as a rig termination charge that I'll touch on in a few minutes. 
Sales volumes for the second quarter were a very robust 219,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, outpacing production due to additional oil liftings in both Equatorial Guinea and the North Sea. But even without the extra liftings, our production volume was at 214,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was on the high end of the quarterly guidance that we previously provided to you.
Volumes in the U.S. were up a strong 3.5% from the first quarter. That was driven largely by our Wattenberg development program and the impact of the DJ Basin asset acquisition that closed the 1st of March this year. This was offset by some third-party downtime we experienced at the Swordfish and Ticonderoga assets in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
Internationally, our volumes were up a very substantial 22% over the first quarter, led by our operations in Equatorial Guinea as well as Israel. In Equatorial Guinea, the Alba field maintenance was completed early in the second quarter, and we again saw additional liftings of crude there. And in Israel, demand for our natural gas was very strong, with sales up nearly 40% from the first quarter. 
On the pricing side of things, we continue to benefit from the strength in liquid markets, which combined with higher oil volumes, contributed to a 13% increase in oil revenues over the first quarter. Going the other direction, our natural gas revenues declined slightly, primarily a result of the softer U.S. gas markets in the second quarter. I know I'm sounding like a broken record on this, but the U.S. gas market is not where one should be trying to accelerate dry gas production. However, on the flip side, our natural gas realizations in Israel this quarter were actually 11% above our U.S. gas realizations.
I'm very pleased with our cost performance for the quarter, lease operating expense stayed relatively flat from the first quarter, right at $5 dollars per barrel oil equivalent. Production taxes and transportation were as expected while DD&A per unit came down significantly driven by higher low-cost volumes coming from Equatorial Guinea and Israel.
G&A and taxes were in line as well. Expiration expense was lower than our original expectations, which had contemplated having results by now from our deepwater drilling at the Santiago and Deep Blue wells. Drilling operations at both these wells were suspended with the announcement of the deepwater moratorium. 
After evaluating the Gulf of Mexico situation, we proceeded ahead and negotiated an agreement with Noble Corp. On the Clyde Boudreaux rig, which canceled the terms of the original contract. We agreed to pay a $26 million fee, which we have recognized in the second quarter as a termination liability. In addition, we have established the framework for a new contract post-moratorium that will have a day rate over $200,000 per day lower than the original contract.
In this morning's release, we updated a few of our guidance items taking into account a number of factors impacting the outlook for the year, including our performance to date, the sale of certain non-core onshore U.S. assets as well as the suspension of drilling in the deepwater Gulf. Our cash organic capital budget is now estimated at $2.2 billion for the year. That's down from the original budget of $2.5 billion. We spent a little less than $1 billion of that to date. And just once again to clarify, organic CapEx includes -- Let me back up. To clarify the organic CapEx excludes our acquisition capital, which that would be the Petro-Canada acquisition, as well as a non-cash capital we accrue for the Aseng FPSO lease. 2/3 of the $300 million reduction on spending is related to the deepwater Gulf of Mexico drilling suspension, which of course is impacting both development and exploration operations. The remaining $100 million is related to other major projects, including a combination of project cost reductions as well as some timing changes.
We've adjusted our total volumes for the year to now range from 211,000 to 217,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We brought down the high end of our range but left the bottom end intact. Overall, the midpoint of the range is down 3,000 barrels equivalent per day, with of course the primary reason being the sale of approximately 5,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day from our onshore U.S. assets.  And that sale is expected to close mid August. 
In addition, FPSO equipment issues that we encountered in the North Sea and a weak first quarter in Israel tightened the range some. However offsetting these variations, we've seen continued strong volumes at Wattenberg, which is providing us outperformance on the onshore U.S. assets.
On the cost side, we've trimmed our estimate for lease operating expense, primarily a result of the sale of the higher-cost onshore volumes and some good performance to date. I already mentioned that the exploration expense is coming down, and everything else has stayed relatively in line with our prior ranges. As a reminder, net proceeds from our onshore U.S. asset sale should be over $500 million after tax. Combined with our lower 2010 capital spending, we'll be seeing a benefit of about $800 million of additional liquidity at the end of the year versus earlier expectations, further strengthening our financial position.
Switching gears here a little bit, I thought I'd spend a couple of minutes on the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Without going into a lot of detail, let me just say we've spent a vast amount of time revisiting our offshore spill plans, drilling designs, preventive measures and not just in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, but across all of our global offshore operations. And we've also engaged our partners, rig and service providers and others in those discussions as well. I would say that based on these reviews, we continue to be confident that deepwater energy resources can be safely developed. However, we and the broader industry are moving forward quickly with enhanced plans, enhanced procedures and equipment to better assure safe operations and incident response capabilities. 
The offshore environment is certainly going to be different than before the Macondo incident. And there are a number of new legislative proposals out there dealing with liability, financial responsibility and new potential operating requirements. Noble Energy has been playing a very active role in providing input to these new proposals. We've also been very involved in trade association efforts and have spent a good bit of time visiting with a variety of policymakers. Our intent is to continue to be involved and make sure that Washington understands the importance of oil and gas development in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as the benefits that independence can bring to that area.
I mentioned earlier that we had terminated one of our two rig contracts in the deepwater Gulf. For our other rig, we actually received the industry's first deepwater completion permit post-moratorium. And that was for the Santa Cruz completion, which is allowing our Galapagos project to move forward. So I just say hats off to our team and also the team over at ENSCO for working together on a number of efforts that included verification of service provider training and capability to operational compliance against federal regulations and the third-party certification of maintenance records and BOP systems. It was a substantial effort and I think all of our service providers and internal staff did a great job of providing the assurances we needed, so that we could carry on with that operation. 
At Tamar in offshore Israel, we're progressing a simplified development option with our partners and the appropriate agencies that will provide us with greater flexibility on that development, actually reduce the onshore impacts while maintaining our production time line. We're finishing up the final design, which will take advantage of our existing infrastructure and we expect to sanction this project shortly. Continued efforts are being made to invest in long lead materials and a lock-in installation contracts, with a focus continuing to be on delivering these important energy sources to the growing Israel market. Our goal for first production at Tamar in 2012 remains intact. 
So with that, Dave, I'll turn it over to you."
292135,109545092,70825,"Noble Energy, Inc., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Noble Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chuck. As I review our global operations, my comments will focus mainly on our four programs, and I will finish with our expectations for the third quarter. Beginning in the U.S. was another very strong quarter for our onshore operation, averagi",1447,"Thanks, Chuck. As I review our global operations, my comments will focus mainly on our four programs, and I will finish with our expectations for the third quarter. 
Beginning in the U.S. was another very strong quarter for our onshore operation, averaging over 102,000 barrels equivalent per day, a high point for Noble Energy. Our volumes for the quarter included a full contribution from the DJ Basin acquisition, as well as continued growth in our Wattenberg asset, which produced nearly 53,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 50% of the volume being liquids. In our horizontal Niobrara program, we now have two rigs drilling in the Central DJ Basin, both currently in the Wattenberg field. So far, we have drilled 10 horizontal Niobrara wells in Wattenberg and two in the Grover area about 20 miles northeast of Wattenberg. Eight of the Wattenberg wells are now on production, with two awaiting completion operations.  
As we continue to step out to the north and the eastern portions of the Wattenberg field, we're encouraged by the early flow back in liquid content of our new wells. Recent initial 24-hour rates have ranged from 580 to 845 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with a 70% to 90% liquid content. Starting in September, we expect to drill a few more wells closer to the Gemini area around the core of the field and near existing vertical producers. The Gemini well has now produced over 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent in just four months and is currently producing about 600 barrels oil equivalent per day.
In the Grover area, the first two horizontal wells were recently drilled and are undergoing completion operations. We will keep one of the two current horizontal rigs in Wattenberg the rest of the year. And the other rig will move between Wattenberg and the Grover area. In southern Wyoming, we're also bringing in an additional rig to drill three horizontal Niobrara wells starting in the third quarter. Overall, our horizontal Niobrara program is on target, with about 30 total wells drilled into play by year end. Along with our ongoing 3D seismic activity, production monitoring and additional reservoir evaluation work, we should be in a good position by the end of the year to assess our expansion plans for this area.
Overall, we're currently operating 13 rigs on our onshore U.S. program. Five of those rigs are conducting horizontal operations, and eight are drilling vertical wells. Offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, we produced about 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. On our last call, we mentioned that Swordfish was curtailed about 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for most of April, as some maintenance was performed at the downstream processing facilities. We're still experiencing some slight curtailment there, about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day waiting on final repairs in the next month or so.
After the Santa Cruz completion, we plan to move the ENSCO 8501 rig to the Isabella completion, using up our allocated time slot on the ENSCO rig this year. This will finish the completion work for the initial two Galapagos project wells.
Moving to international, it was a very strong second quarter for our operations in Israel, where we saw continued strength in the quarterly gas price. Keeping in mind that we have seasonal demand in Israel, we had the highest second quarter gas sales volume in our history. Growth in Israel's overall electricity demand continued shifting to natural gas and increased industrial consumption have led to higher sales. 
The growing demand for natural gas in Israel has strong positive implications for our Tamar development. As we have previously noted, we believe that gas demand in Israel will grow with supply availability. And that appears to be happening rapidly. Just recently, our primary gas customer, Israel Electric, announced plans  it would consider converting existing coal-fired power plants to natural gas. In addition, a new power plant has been planned for sometime now that originally was designed to be coal-fired, is now also being considered to be primarily gas-fired with coal as a backup. 
These market changes would provide strong upside demand for our Tamar gas. Through a combination of near-term demand, during the second quarter we completed the first of two additional development wells at Mary-B aimed at helping to maintain peak field deliverability. With a new well online, we were able to hit a record intraday deliverability rate of over 550 million cubic feet per day growth in early July.  The second well is drilling and remains on schedule for completion in September. And we're moving forward on our compression project with installation scheduled to begin later this year. 
On the exploration front, the Sedco Express rigs should spud our Leviathan prospect to offshore Israel in early October. Here the primary target is the 16 Tcf gross prospect with a 50% chance of success in the same interval that we discovered at Tamar and Dalit. We operate Leviathan with a 40% working interest, and expect initial results by early next year. 
As we evaluated our seismic and because of the extent of our development exploration acreage, we recently signed a short-term contract with an extended option period for the Pride North America rig that will start at the beginning of next year. This will give us the ability to expand our program in this area with continued exploration success. 
In addition to our upcoming drilling activity, we've recently awarded an additional 3D seismic study to commence later this year over a significant piece of our remaining acreage.
In the North Sea, we mentioned at the last call that Dumbarton and Lochranza were shut in at the end of March due to some unexpected FPSO equipment issues. Production came back online in mid-May. However, the FPSO restrictions have not allowed the fields to produce at a consistent volume. We're working with the operator to identify solutions that would enable full production of between 10,000 to 15,000 barrels a day net. 
In West Africa, the scheduled downtime for equipment maintenance, upgrades and replacements at the Alba field, as well as the methanol and LPG facilities, was completed in early April and field production returned to full capacity. In the third quarter, there are eight weeks of scheduled wireline work that will impact production by about 1,000 barrels equivalent per day net for that period.
At the Aseng oil development in Equatorial Guinea, our second contracted rig, the Atwood Hunter, arrived in mid-June and is supplementing the ongoing field development work. The results of this drilling program so far continue to give encouragement to additional resource potential for Aseng and between our two rigs, all drilling and completion well work should be finished by the first of next year. That will put us in a great position to have this oil project online by mid-2012. On the FPSO, hull refurbishment and module fabrication work continues on schedule. We're very pleased to the overall progress of the project and the operational readiness of our team.
At Alen, formerly called Belinda, we have now submitted the plan of development to the Ministry and we remain on schedule to sanction this liquid project late  year. Along with our partners, we're bidding out some of the major contracts and have begun the process to commit to certain long lead items. So everything is moving forward as expected here as well.
In Cameroon, we completed our 3D seismic shoot of approximately 600 square miles. We'll be processing the data throughout the second half of the year targeting the potential to drill at least one new oil prospect in 2011. We've also recently awarded a 3D seismic shoot offshore Nicaragua for later this year.
Now taking a quick look at the third quarter. Total company sales are expected to range from 212,000 to 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our sales differ from actual production based on the timing of liftings at the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea and the North Sea. As Chuck mentioned, during the second quarter, sales were greater than production but we expect sales to be less than production during the third quarter based on our current lifting schedules. It is worth mentioning that our second quarter production was 214,000 barrels equivalent per day. And we expect to see continued production growth in the third quarter despite our onshore volumes impacted by the August sale of 5,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The DJ Basin, North Sea, Alba field and Israel will all contribute to increasing actual production in the third quarter. 
So with that, Nicole, let's go ahead and open it up for questions."

One, of course, are the existing coal plants. And there's actually a process that's already started for tendering of gas that would be involved in supplementally either replacing a coal or supplementary firing those plants. And so I think it still depends on conversion time frame. But that's an incremental demand that we see of somewhere around 200 million a day. And I think that the timing on that is fairly soon after we expect to start up Tamara. So that program is moving forward. And, again, that's being driven by availability of gas plus just the benefits from a environmental standpoint of switching from coal to gas which is certainly being recognized in Israel. The second project is a project that's a little later. I think the time frame they're talking about for the Ashkelon power plant is in the 2014-2015 time frame. And that project, again, is the original plan was for two basically little over 600-megawatt plants, super critical boilers on coal, and now they have done some work and have determined that they can also fire those on natural gas with perhaps coal as backup.  Israel recently announced -- the infrastructure minister announced that they were going to take that to the Knesset but that's still far down the road and that's some long term demand that could be added to. So, again, our view is that dual fuels would be seeing the impact seen maybe 2014 beginning 2015 depends on the conversion timing and it would probably be a couple of years later before you'd see the Ashkelon project.  But that's the forecast we're carrying and we're seeing there's quite a urgency underway right now to build additional power capacity in Israel. They're short so those plans could accelerate. But as I mentioned that's clearly upside to some of the earlier demand forecast that we saw for gas."

We have, as I mentioned, we've actually looked at some additional options that would utilize our existing infrastructure and so while there may have been some earlier options that would have been a total offshore solution that might have had increased costs, by utilizing some of our existing infrastructure we can actually mitigate that. So the answer is, no, we don't expect the cost to markedly change as a result of this.  Quite honestly we like the alternatives that we've been pursuing.  We have been looking at these all along because this has been a project where we had to basically keep alive several alternatives as we went forward.  And our view right now is the onshore receiving terminal is problematic.  There is still a real question about its location.  And we have real concerns that by the time that would be approved, it would really have an impact on the project's schedule. So while I personally believe that there will ultimately be an onshore terminal.  Maybe it will be tied to further exploration work that we do and additional resources that we certainly hope will be discovered in the basin.  But near-term we can utilize some of our existing facilities and mitigate those onshore impacts and do it in a way that does not really markedly change the project cost."

There's been no cap on spill liability, the primary driver in some of these. And then the other piece of it is what financial responsibility you demonstrate referred to as a Certificate of Financial Responsibility or COFR. I think where it is going today, the third-party liability cap has been moving up. And I think most of us realize that, that always was a fairly tenuous cap. There's a lot of ways that it could be breached. So while we would like to make sure that the industry has access to other sources of funds, for instance, the oil spill liability trust fund or perhaps some other pool arrangement, when you go above whatever cap it is, I think that the area that we've been zeroed in on is the financial responsibility requirement. And I guess I would just say that from the discussions we've had, there's been a growing appreciation of raising that COFR or Certificate of Financial Responsibility to a very high number is more damaging than good. And as a result, I don't know whether we will see anything in this current legislation that will move through. It may be later in the year. But certainly, the trend has been as every week passes, there has been more reasonable discussion by policymakers about what's an appropriate adjustment to make in these, and also more discussion about how the broader industry can have access to a pool of funds or some sort of central fund that would give them, in a way, a type of insurance, not true form of insurance but a way to fund the liability of an incident should it, hopefully never again occur to this magnitude, but should it occur."

There's obviously strong concern in Washington about accessing taxpayer money, so that, that becomes a major concern. And so some sort of industry mutual, similar to what's been applied in the nuclear industry, probably makes a lot of sense. There's a thing called Price-Anderson that's applied in the nuclear industry. And that's worked well since 1957.

I mean we made it clear early on that Tamar was in our view dedicated to the local market. As the Tamar size has grown, they've seen that there is a lot of gas, multi-decades of gas available from Tamar. And so there's actually been a significant openness in Israel to the idea of exports, and that's been talked about a lot. Our challenge is to keep them from counting that as a done deal until we drill the exploration well.  They tend to view prospects as discoveries there. And so more of our effort has been on trying to make sure they understand the exploration work that we have in front of us, before we can count all this as a discovery. But certainly, they've actually started to think about the economic impacts on their country of exports and what that might mean for them and some of the other implications. That will be a significant project, as I know you would appreciate something that's 16 Tcf in size if that where to happen that is a major export project, and there's a lot of work that would have to be done. But as far as the country allowing exports, the assurance that we have gotten is as long as we can demonstrate that we can adequately supply their market, that they will certainly not stand in the way of a company developing the assets and recognizing there'll be economic benefits to the state of Israel as a result."

I'd probably reference you back to one of the exhibits that Ted Brown showed in the June Analyst Meeting where it kind of showed our plans for drilling out there. And what I mentioned is I think by the end of this year, we'll have 15 to 20 horizontal wells in Wattenberg. We'll have six or seven in this Grover area that's kind of northeast of Wattenberg. And we'll have three in Southern Wyoming. And we've kind of shown some depiction of that in Ted's presentation in June. I think that's really what's going to give us the additional knowledge, when we tie to some of the horizontal -- vertical comparisons. Obviously, we have a number of vertical wells in Wattenberg. And then there's some industry data outside of Wattenberg. But when you take that range and aerial extent of comparison then by the end of year, be able to tie that back to the vertical piece, that's what'll give us a pretty good working knowledge then by the end of the year. With that, we'll be able to then compare some things as to how the Niobrara changes across some of these areas, how the different zones within the Niobrara look. But we really need to get some of that work done, that horizontal work done across that wider area especially outside of Wattenberg. I think when you look at the pipeline piece, for example, White Cliffs, I think it can be expanded probably 20,000 or 30,000 barrels a day fairly easily, with some compression and so forth. And I know there's a number of folks looking at that scenario which you brought up, as to additional expansion out in that area. And in fact, we've got our marketing team doing a lot of work with some folks that are looking at what's going to be required from the whole industry scale out through that area. So I think that's still in its early stages. We hope that is the case where production ramps up, like you're talking about. That'd be an exciting thing to watch. And we're going to be staying up front in that and planning for especially the infrastructure going forward. But end of the day, I think we'll be able to move the volume out of the area."

The reason that we talked about some of these additional things is that the timing of that additional demand seems to be moving up. And of course, we always deal in average demand and there will still be seasonal demand in Israel that you will see periods of probably very high demand, peak demand. And then as you go out, one of the things that is the wildcard in all this is those numbers that I referred to assume that Egyptian supply continues to enter this system and we continue to see that Egyptian supply has its good days and it has its bad days. And it's always subject to the political issues as well. And so that's another 200 million on today's volume that can move around. So our view is, is we want to be prepared to be able to handle whatever Israel needs from day one.  Even if that mean's having -- delivering an additional 200 million to cover the volumes. So it's a wide range. I wouldn't change from what we've provided in the past. I just in my own mind feel that there's upside to that because of the incremental demand needs we're seeing, the discussion of conversion of plants, the fact that electricity demand in Israel continues to grow rapidly, that industrial customers continue to appear almost daily, as they see the benefits of natural gas. And that the imports that they do have from Egypt continue to be volatile and that provides us incremental opportunities to deliver spot sales if those imports should fail."

Good morning, everyone, welcome to Noble Energy's second quarter 2010 earnings call and webcast. On the call today, we have Chuck Davidson, Chairman and CEO; Dave Stover, President and COO; and Ken Fisher, CFO.
The plan for the call today is to have Chuck review our results for the quarter as well as discuss some updated guidance. Dave will then review our global operations focused on second quarter highlights and our ongoing activity levels. Many of you participated in our Analyst Meeting held June 3, either in person or via webcast. We won't be reviewing much of the detail in the call today so I encourage those who haven't had a chance to, to review the replay of that webcast.
Today we will leave plenty of time for Q&A at the end of our prepared remarks but we are going to try to wrap up the call in less than an hour. We know that everyone is busy with the earnings schedule. Should you have any questions that we don't get to this morning, please don't hesitate to call and we will do the best we can to answer you. We hope everyone has seen our earnings release that we issued this morning.
Later today, we expect to be filing our 10-Q with the SEC and it will also be available on our website. I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements based on our current view and most reasonable expectations.
We provide no assurances on these statements as a number of factors and uncertainties could cause actual results in the future periods to differ materially from what we've discussed. You should read our full disclosures on the forward-looking statements in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of the risk factors that influence our business.
We will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures today, such as adjusted net income or discretionary cash flow. When we refer to these items, it is because we believe they are good metrics to use in evaluating the company's performance. Be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release tables.
With that, let me turn the call over to Chuck.

Today I plan to go through our quarterly results and also our updated guidance items. I'll also be discussing the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and also touch on a few of our major projects, which Dave Stover will go into greater detail on.
Our results for the quarter, for the second quarter were outstanding with GAAP net income at $204 million or $1.10 per share diluted. Adjusted net income was $198 million or $1.07 per diluted share and that's after removing the impact of the unrealized commodity derivative gain as well as a rig termination charge that I will touch on in a few minutes.
Sales volumes for the second quarter were a very robust 219,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, outpacing production due to additional oil listings in both Equatorial Guinea and the North Sea. But even without the extra listings, our production volume was at 214,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was on the high end of the quarterly guidance that we previously provided to you. 
Volumes in the US were up a strong 3.5% from the first quarter. That was driven largely by our Wattenberg development program and the impact of the DJ Basin asset acquisition that closed the first of March this year. This was offset by some third-party downtime we experienced at the Swordfish and Tri-Conderoga assets in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.
Internationally, our volumes were up a very substantial 22% over the first quarter, led by our operations in Equatorial Guinea, as well as Israel. In Equatorial Guinea, the Alba field maintenance was completed early in the second quarter and we again saw additional listings of crude there. 
And in Israel, demand for our natural gas was very strong with sales up nearly 40% from the first quarter. On the pricing side of things, we continue to benefit from the strength in liquid markets, which combined with higher oil volumes contributed to a 13% increase in oil revenues over the first quarter.
Going the other direction, our natural gas revenues declined slightly, primarily a result of the softer US gas markets in the second quarter. I know I'm sounding like a broken record on this, but the US gas market is not where one should be trying to accelerate dry gas production. However, on the flip side, our natural gas realizations in Israel this quarter were actually 11% above our US gas realizations. I'm very pleased with our cost performance for the quarter. Lease operating expense stayed relatively flat from the first quarter, right at $5 per barrel oil equivalent.
Production taxes and transportation were as expected, while DD&A per unit came down significantly driven by higher low-cost volumes coming from Equatorial Guinea and Israel. G&A and taxes were in line as well. Exploration expense was lower than our original expectations which had contemplated having results by now from our deepwater drilling at the Santiago and Deep Blue wells. Drilling operations at both of these wells were suspended with the announcement of the deepwater moratorium.
After evaluating the Gulf of Mexico situation, we proceeded ahead and negotiated an agreement with Noble Corp. on the Clyde Boudreaux rig, which cancelled the terms of the original contract. We agreed to pay a $26 million fee, which we have recognized in the second quarter as a termination liability. In addition, we have established the framework for a new contract post-moratorium that will have a day rate over $200,000 per day lower than the original contract.
In this morning's release, we updated a few of our guidance items, taking into account a number of factors impacting the outlook for the year, including our performance to-date, the sale of certain non-core, onshore US assets, as well as the suspension of drilling in the deepwater Gulf. Our cash, organic capital budget is now estimated at $2.2 billion for the year. That's down from the original budget of $2.5 billion. We spent a little less than $1 billion of that to-date.
And just once again, to clarify organic CapEx excludes our acquisition capital, that would be the Petro-Canada acquisition, as well as the non-cash capital we accrue for the Aseng FPSO lease. Two-thirds of the $300 million reduction on spending is related to the deepwater Gulf of Mexico drilling suspension which of course is impacting both development and exploration operations. The remaining $100 million is related to other major projects including a combination of project cost reductions as well as some timing changes. We have adjusted our total volumes for the year to now range from 211,000 to 217,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. We brought down the high end of our range but left the bottom end intact.
Overall the midpoint of the range is down 3,000 barrels equivalent per day with of course the primary reason being the sale of approximately 5,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day from our onshore US assets and that deal is expected to close mid-August. In addition, FPSO equipment issues that we encountered in the North Sea in a weak first quarter in Israel tightened the range some. However offsetting these variations we have seen continued strong volumes at Wattenberg which is providing us outperformance on the onshore US assets.
On the cost side we trimmed our estimate for lease operating expense primarily a result of the sale of the higher cost onshore volumes and some good performance to date. I already mentioned the expiration expense is coming down and everything else has stayed relatively in line with our prior ranges.
As a reminder, net procedures from our onshore US asset sales should be over $500 million after-tax. Combined with our lower 2010 capital spending, we will be seeing a benefit of about $800 million of additional liquidity at the end of the year versus earlier expectations further strengthening our financial position. 
Switching gears here a little bit, I thought I would spend a couple of minutes on the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Without going into a lot of detail, let me just say we have spent a vast amount of time revisiting our offshore spill plans, drilling designs, preventative measures and not just in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico but across all of our global offshore operations. We have also engaged our partners, rig and service providers and others in those discussions as well.
I would say that based on these reviews we continue to be confident that deepwater energy resources can be safely developed, however we in the broader industry are moving forward quickly with enhanced plans, enhanced procedures and equipment to better assure safe operations and incident response capabilities. The offshore environment is certainly going to be different than before the Macondo incident and there are a number of new legislative proposals out there dealing with liability, financial responsibility and new potential operating requirements.
Noble Energy has been playing a very active role in providing input to these new proposals. We've also been very involved in trade association efforts and have spent a good bit of time visiting with a variety of policy makers. Our intent is to continue to be involved and make sure that Washington understands the importance of oil and gas development in the Gulf of Mexico as well as the benefits that independents can bring to that area.
I mentioned earlier that we had terminated one of our two rig contracts from the deepwater Gulf. For our other rig, we actually received the industry's first deepwater completion permit post moratorium and that was for the Santa Cruz completion which is allowing our Galapagos project to move forward. So I just say hats off to our team and also the team over at ENSCO for working together on a number of efforts that included verification of service provider training and capability to operational compliance against federal regulations and the third-party certification of maintenance records and BOP systems. It was a substantial effort and I think all of our service providers and internal staff did a great job of providing the assurances we needed so that we could carry on with that operation. 
At Tamar in offshore Israel, we're progressing a simplified development option with our partners and the appropriate agencies who will provide us a greater flexibility on that development, actually reduce the onshore impacts while maintaining our production time line. We're finishing up the final design which will take advantage of our existing infrastructure and we expect to sanction this project shortly. 
Continued efforts are being made to invest in long lead materials and the lock-in installation contracts. With our focus continuing to be on delivering these important energy sources to the growing Israel markets, our goal for first production at Tamar in 2012 remains intact. 
So with that, Dave, I'll turn it over to you.

As I review our global operations, my comments will focus mainly on our core programs and I will finish with our expectations for the third quarter. Beginning in the US, it was another very strong quarter for our onshore operations, averaging over 102,000 barrels equivalent per day, a high point for Noble Energy. 
Our volumes for the quarter included a full contribution from the DJ basin acquisition as well as continued growth in our Wattenberg asset, which produced nearly 53,000 barrels oil equivalent per day with 50% of the volume being liquids. In our horizontal Niobrara program, we now have two rigs drilling in the central DJ basin, both currently in the Wattenberg field. 
So far we have drilled 10 horizontal Niobrara wells in Wattenberg and two in the Grover area about 20 miles northeast of Wattenberg. Eight of the Wattenberg wells are now on production with two awaiting completion operations. As we continue to step out to the north and the eastern portions of the Wattenberg field, we're encouraged by the early flow back in liquid content of our new wells. Recent initial 24 hour rates have ranged from 580 to 845 barrels of oil equivalent per day with a 70% to 90% liquid content. 
Starting in September, we expect to drill a few more wells closer to the Gemini area, around the core of the field and near existing vertical producers. The Gemini well has now produced over 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent in just four months, and is currently producing about 600 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In the Grover area, the first two horizontal wells were recently drilled and are undergoing completion operations. We will keep one of the two current horizontal rigs in Wattenberg the rest of the year and the other rig will move between Wattenberg and the Grover area. 
In southern Wyoming, we are also bringing in an additional rig to drill three horizontal Niobrara wells starting in the third quarter. Overall, our horizontal Niobrara program is on target, with about 30 total wells drilled in the play by year end. Along with our ongoing 3D seismic activity, production monitoring and additional reservoir evaluation work, we should be in a good position by the end of the year to assess our expansion plans for this area. Overall, we're currently operating 13 rigs in our onshore US program. Five of those rigs are conducting horizontal operations and eight are drilling vertical wells.
Offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, we produced about 18,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. On our last call, we mentioned that Swordfish was curtailed about 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for most of April as some maintenance was performed at the downstream processing facilities. We are still experiencing some slight curtailment there about 1,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day waiting on final repairs in the next month or so.
After the Santa Cruz completion, we plan to move the Ensco 8501 rig to the Isabella completion using up our allocated time slot on the Ensco rig this year. This will finish the completion work for the initial two Galapagos project wells.
Moving to international, it was a very strong second quarter for our operations in Israel where we saw continued strength in the quarterly gas price. Keeping in mind that we have seasonal demand in Israel, we had the highest second quarter gas sales volume in our history.
Growth in Israel is overall, electricity demand continued shifting to natural gas and increased industrial consumption had led to higher sales. The growing demand for natural gas in Israel has strong positive implications for our Tamar development.
As we have previously noted, we believe that gas demand in Israel will grow with supply availability and that appears to be happening rapidly. Just recently, our primary gas customer, Israel Electric, announced plans that would consider converting existing coal fired power plants to natural gas.
In addition, a new power plant has been planned for some time now that originally was designed to be coal fired is now also being considered to be primarily gas fired with coal as a backup.
These market changes would provide strong upside demand for our Tamar gas. To accommodate strong near-term demand, during the second quarter we completed the first of two additional development wells at Mari-B aimed at helping to maintain peak field deliverability.
With the new well online, we were able to hit a record intra-day deliverability rate of over 550 million cubic feet per day gross in early July. The second well is drilling and remains on schedule for completion in September. And we are moving forward on our compression project with installation scheduled to begin later this year.
On the exploration front, the Sedco Express rig should spot our Leviathan prospect to offshore Israel in early October. Here the primary target is a 16 TCS gross prospect with a 50% chance of success in the same interval that we discovered at Tamar and Dalit. We operate Leviathan with 40% working interest and expect initial results by early next year.
As we evaluated our seismic and because of the extent of our development in exploration acreage, we recently signed a short-term contract with an extended option period for the Pride North America rig that will start at the beginning of next year. This will give us the ability to expand our program in this area with continued exploration success.
In addition to our upcoming drilling activity, we have recently awarded an additional 3D seismic study to commence later this year over a significant piece of our remaining acreage.
In the North Sea, we mentioned at the last call that Dumbarton and Lochranza were shut in at the end of March, due to some unexpected FPSO equipment issues. Production came back online in mid-May; however FPSO restrictions did not allow the fields to produce at a consistent volume.
We are working with the operator to identify solutions that would enable full production of between 10,000 to 15,000 barrels a day net. In West Africa, the scheduled downtime for equipment maintenance, upgrades and replacements at the Alba field as well as the methanol and LPG facilities was completed in early April and field production returned to full capacity.
In the third quarter, there are eight weeks of scheduled wireline work that will impact production by about 1,000 barrels equivalent per day net for that period. At the Aseng oil development in Equatorial Guinea, our second contracted rig the Atwood Hunter arrived in mid-June and is supplementing the ongoing field development work.
The results of this drilling program so far continue to give encouragement to additional resource potential for Aseng and between our two rigs all drilling and completion well work should be finished by the first of next year. That will put us in a great position to have this oil project online by mid 2012.
On the FPSO, hall refurbishment and module fabrication work continues on schedule and we are very pleased with the overall progress of the project and the operational readiness of our team. At Alen formerly called Belinda, we have now submitted the plan of development to the ministry and we remain on schedule to sanction this liquid project late this year.
Along with our partners we are bidding out some of the major contracts and have begun the process to commit to certain long lead items. So everything is moving forward as expected here as well. In Cameroon, we completed our 3D seismic shoot of approximately 600 square miles and we will be processing the data throughout the second half of the year, targeting the potential to drill at least one new oil prospect in 2011. We've also recently awarded a 3D seismic shoot offshore Nicaragua for later this year.
Now taking a quick look at the third quarter. Total company sales are expected to range from 212,000 to 220,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our sales differ from actual production based on the timing of listings at the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea and the North Sea.
As Chuck mentioned, during the second quarter sales were greater than production but we expect sales to be less than production during the third quarter based on our current lifting schedules. It is worth mentioning that our second quarter production was 214,000 barrels equivalent per day and we expect to see continued production growth in the third quarter despite our onshore volumes impacted by the August sale of 5,700 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
The DJ basin, North Sea, Alba field and Israel will all contribute to increasing actual production in the third quarter.
So with that, Nicole, let's go ahead and open it up for questions.

One, of course, are the existing coal plants and there is actually a process that's already started for tendering gas that would be involved in supplementally either replacing the coal or supplementary firing those plants. And so, you know, I think it still depends on conversion timeframe, but that's an incremental demand that we see of somewhere around 200 million a day, and I think that the timing on that is fairly soon after we expect to start up Tamar.
That program is moving forward, and again that's being driven by availability of gas plus just the benefits from an environmental standpoint of switching from coal to gas, which is certainly being recognized in Israel. The second project is a project that's a little later, I think the timeframe they are talking about for the Ashkelon power plant is in the 2014, 2015 timeframe.
And that project again, the original plan was for two basically little over 600-megawatt plants, supercritical boilers on coal and now they have done some work and have determined that they can also fire those on natural gas with perhaps coal as backup. Israel recently announced the Infrastructure Minister announced that they were going to take that to the (inaudible), but that's still far down the road and that's some long-term demand that could be additive.
Again, our view is that the dual fueled would be seeing the impact, seeing maybe 2014, beginning 2015, depends on the conversion timing and it would probably be a couple of years later before you see the Ashkelon project. But, that's the forecast we are carrying and we are seeing there is quite an urgency underway right now to build additional power capacity in Israel. They are short so those plans could accelerate. As I mentioned, that's clearly upside to some of the earlier demand forecasts that we saw for gas.

So, if Leviathan was successful and again we haven't drilled it, it's a 50% chance of success, but if it was successful and with the size that we've put it at, we certainly believe that we'd be looking at export markets for that. And so depending on what the ultimate customers would be there, would likely determine how that gas would be priced and I guess right now it would be too early to say. Some markets are tied to oil, others have some other factors that go into it, but until we are dealing with a real project there, it's a little bit too early to speculate.

One last question, deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Congratulations on the permit in Santa Cruz. As you think about the environment out there, were they delineating between Santa Cruz already a discovery and effectively giving you the completion permit versus the challenges you might have faced if you were looking at a straight exploration well? Any kind of color you can give us on how people are thinking about risk levels on a discovery versus exploration going forward, and obviously how that ties to the legislation coming out with liability caps on the oil spill side of things?

Now, they were subject to significant additional stringent requirements, certifications of the rig, of compliance with rules, regulations, third-party reviews of the blowout system, so there was a lot of work. But the main driver was that they had already recognized that completions were not part of the moratorium. We just had to go through the process because we basically had to resubmit the permit application for the completion. 
To date, there is no drilling being allowed for in the deepwater Gulf because of the suspension of operations. I do think that there is some appreciation that there maybe some different well categories, but right now that's not being considered. It's basically completion work. If you can qualify your operations and rigs, you can submit those permits for operations, but drilling is still suspended.

As I mentioned, we've actually looked at some additional options that would utilize our existing infrastructure and so while there may have been some earlier options that would have been a total offshore solution that might have had increased costs by utilizing some of our existing infrastructure, we can actually mitigate that. So the answer is, no. We don't expect the cost to markedly change as a result of this.
Quite honestly, we like the alternatives that we've been pursuing. We have been looking at these all along because this has been a project where we had to basically keep alive several alternatives as we went forward. And our view right now is the onshore receiving terminal is problematic, there is still a real question about its location and we have real concerns that by the time that would be approved, it would really have an impact on the project schedule.
So, while I personally believe that there will ultimately be an onshore terminal, maybe it will be tied to further exploration work that we do and additional resources that we certainly hope will be discovered in the basin. But near term, we can utilize some of our existing facilities and mitigate those onshore impacts and do it in a way that does not really markedly change the project cost.

There's been no cap on spill liability, the primary driver in some of these. And then the other piece of it is what financial responsibility you demonstrate referred to as a Certificate of Financial Responsibility or COFR. I think where it is going today, the third-party liability cap has been moving up and I think most of us realize that that always was a fairly tenuous cap. 
There's a lot of ways that it can be reached. So while we would like to make sure that the industry has access to other sources of funds, for instance, the oil spill liability trust fund or perhaps some other pool arrangement, when you go above whatever cap it is, I think that the area that we have been zeroed in on is the financial responsibility requirement.
And I guess I would just say that from the discussions we have had, there's a growing appreciation of raising that COFR or Certificate of Financial Responsibility to a very high number is more damaging than good. And as a result, you know, I don't know whether we will see anything in this current legislation that will move through. It may be later in the year, but certainly the trend has been as every week passes, there has been more reasonable discussion by policy makers about what's an appropriate adjustments to make in these and also more discussion about how the broader industry can have access to a pool of funds or some sort of central fund that would give them in a way a type of insurance, not true form of insurance, but a way to fund the liability of an incident should it hopefully never again occur to this magnitude, but should it occur.

We have been working with a number of people in Washington as Chuck mentioned and trying to ensure that A, that the COFR is set at a reasonable limit that allows competitive access to the Gulf of Mexico for a range of companies including independents. And then on the liability caps, our view is that a pool or mutualization mechanism funded by the industry is probably the most practical solution to this. There's obviously strong concern in Washington about accessing taxpayer money, so that that becomes a major concern. And so some sort of industry mutual similar to what's been applied in the nuclear industry probably makes a lot of sense. There's a thing called Price Anderson that's applied in the nuclear industry and that's worked well since 1957. And so that in a sense as Chuck mentioned is a form of industry insurance that I think could be applicable here and from our discussions it's starting to gain some traction and understanding with the policy makers.

Our challenge is to keep them from counting that as a done deal until we drill the exploration well. They tend to view prospects as discoveries there and so more of our effort has been on trying to make sure they understand the exploration work that we have in front of us before we can count all this as a discovery.
But certainly they have actually started to think about the economic impacts on their country of exports and what that might mean for them and some of the other implications. That will be a significant project, as I know you would appreciate of something that's 16 TCF in size if that were to happen, that is a major export project and there's a lot of work that would have to be done.

Irene, let me start with the first one as far as what we are learning as we go across this trend. I would probably reference you back to one of the exhibits that Ted Brown showed in the June Analyst Meeting where it showed our plans for drilling out there and what I mentioned is I think by the end of this year we will have 15 to 20 horizontal wells in Wattenberg, we will have six or seven in this Grover area that's kind of northeast of Wattenberg and we will have three in southern Wyoming and we kind of have shown some depiction of that in Ted's presentation in June. So I think that's really what's going to give us the additional knowledge when we tie to some of the vertical comparisons. Obviously, we have a number of vertical wells in Wattenberg, and then there are some industry data outside of Wattenberg.
But when you take that range and area of extent of comparison, then by the end of year be able to tie that back to the vertical piece, that's what will give us a pretty good working knowledge then by the end of the year. And with that, we'll be able to then compare some things as to how the Niobrara changes across some of these areas, how the different zones within the Niobrara look. But we really need to get some of that work done, that horizontal work done across that wider area, especially outside of Wattenberg.
I think when you look at the pipeline piece, for example, White Cliffs, I think it can be expanded probably 20 or 30,000 barrels a day fairly easily with some compression and so forth. And I know there's a number of folks looking at that scenario what you brought up as to additional expansion out in that area and, in fact, we've got our marketing team doing a lot of work with some folks looking at what's going to be required from the whole industry scale out through that area.
So I think that's still in its early changes. We hope that is the case where production ramps up like you're talking about. But that'd be an exciting thing to watch and we're going to be staying up front on that and planning for especially the infrastructure going forward. But end of the day, I think we'll be able to move the volume out of the area.

The reason that we talked about some of these additional things is that the timing of that additional demand seems to be moving up. And, of course, we always deal in average demand and there will still be seasonal demand in Israel that you will see periods of probably very high demand, peak demand. And then as you go out, one of the things that is the wildcard in all this is those numbers that I refer to assume that Egyptian supply continues to enter the system and we continue to see that Egyptian supply has its good days and it has its bad days, and it's always subject to the political issues as well. And so that's another 200 million on today's volumes that can move around. So our view is we want to be prepared to be able to handle whatever Israel needs from day one, even if that means having to deliver an additional 200 million to cover the Egypt volumes. So it's a wide range.
I wouldn't change from what we've provided in the past. I just in my own mind feel that there is upside to that because of the incremental demand needs we're seeing, this discussion of conversion of plants, the fact that electricity demand in Israel continues to grow rapidly, that industrial customers continue to appear almost daily as they see the benefits of natural gas and that the imports that they do have from Egypt continue to be volatile and that provides us incremental opportunities to deliver spot sales if those imports should fail.

More towards the core of the field, had a higher gas content, there was also testing the ability to drain new resources out of areas where it had fairly extensive vertical production history and that's what we are going to also test with these other couple wells that we will call more Gemini like that we are going to drill here in the next few months, so we will have both type comparisons then.

Welcome to Noble Energy's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Call and Webcast. On the call today, we have Chuck Davidson, Chairman and CEO; Dave Stover, President and COO; and Ken Fisher, CFO.
In a minute, Chuck will review our results for the quarter as well as talk about some of our plans for 2011. Dave will then review our global operations, focused on third quarter highlights and our ongoing activity levels. 
Today, we plan on leaving plenty of time for Q&A at the end of our prepared remarks and wrap up the call in less than an hour. In an effort to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to ask their questions on the call, we would ask that all the participants limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up.
And should you have any questions that we don't get to, we'll be more than happy to respond to those after the call. We hope everyone has found the earnings release that we issued this morning. Later today, we do expect to be filing our 10-Q with the SEC and we will also have that available on our website.
I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements based on our current view and most reasonable expectations. We provide no assurances on these statements as a number of factors and uncertainties could cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from what we discuss here today. You should read our full disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of risk factors that influence our business.
We'll reference today certain non-GAAP financial measures here today, such as adjusted net income or discretionary cash flow on the call. When we refer to these items, it's because we believe they are good metrics to use in evaluating the company's performance. Be sure to see the reconciliation in our earnings release tables.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Chuck now."

In my opening comments, I plan to review our quarterly results and then also walk through some early thoughts for 2011. No question, we had a great third quarter. Record volumes combined with good cost manageme",1519,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. In my opening comments, I plan to review our quarterly results and then also walk through some early thoughts for 2011. No question, we had a great third quarter. 
Record volumes combined with good cost management delivered GAAP net income of $232 million or $1.31 per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $225 million or $1.27 per diluted share after removing the impact of unrealized commodity derivative gain, also removing the gain on the sale of assets as well as an asset impairment charge.
While the sales numbers are certainly well above expectation, from my perspective, it was really the list of key accomplishments regarding our long-term growth agenda that really made the quarter standout. And these included the sanction of the Tamar project in Israel, significant progress with the horizontal Niobrara play in the DJ Basin and continuing Galapagos in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico despite the moratorium that we have there. These accomplishments are what will really bring great results to our company in the future.
Sales volumes for the third quarter were 230,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Actual production was 2,000 barrels per day above sales due to timing of some international oil listings. Good product diversification continues to be beneficial for us as we have 38% of our sales being global liquids, 33% international gas and the remaining 29% was U.S. gas. Versus the second quarter this year, our international gas percentage was up four points, primarily driven by continued market growth and strong seasonal demand we experienced in Israel, which led to record sales volumes there.
Liquid volumes in the U.S. averaged 54,000 barrels per day in the third quarter, up over 2,000 barrels per day from the second quarter. All volumes in the Central DJ Basin and deepwater Gulf of Mexico were up a combined 5,000 barrels per day, partially offset by nearly a 3,000 barrel a day reduction, which was due to our onshore asset sale that closed during the quarter. 
Our DJ Basin volumes continue to reflect growth from both the vertical and the horizontal development programs. Deepwater was higher as some of our volumes were restricted in the second quarter. We also had increased North Sea volumes primarily from Dumbarton and Lochranza. In Equatorial Guinea, our liquid volumes were down sequentially, due to the timing of liftings during the quarter.
On U.S. natural gas, our volumes declined from the second quarter, primarily resulting from reallocating capital away from dry gas drilling, which of course we began some time ago. Even in Wattenberg, our gas production has declined as we focused on growing liquids in the field. And we'll continue with the same domestic natural gas strategy until the U.S. market is ready for more supply. 
Overall, our U.S. volumes were flat with the second quarter, again keeping in mind that we lost 3,000 barrels a day due to the divestiture. International is up 11,000 barrels a day equivalent for the quarter, that's an 11% increase over the second quarter.
Commodity price realizations were relatively consistent from second quarter to third quarter. Our crude oil average for the quarter was strong at over $73 per barrel and U.S. gas prices were basically flat at $3.87 per Mcf. In Israel, prices were down a little bit due to the changing blend between the old and new gas price advantages at Mari-B. 
Looking at cost that trends from the second to the third quarter was very good, with lease operating expense down 10% on a per barrel basis and transportation and DD&A generally flat. Our exploration activity for the third quarter was relatively quiet and G&A was as expected. The effective tax rate in the third portion on a adjusted basis was lower than we originally anticipated. This resulted from the application of some excess foreign tax credits that we're able to apply to our foreign U.S. branch assets.
The adjustment items to net income for the third quarter include a small gain on the commodity mark-to-market, as well as $114 million pretax gain from the sale of the assets in the Mid-Continent, and the Illinois Basin, again, which closed during the third quarter. We also removed the impact of asset impairments primarily the result of further decline to the natural gas price curve. Finally, we wrote down the value of our New Albany shale assets which we discontinued development activity quite some time ago.
Our balance sheet continues to be very strong. At the end of the quarter, we had over $1.1 billion in cash with the $1.75 billion undrawn on our credit facility, providing us ample flexibilities we invest in our major projects in the coming months. Our total liquidity is right at $2.9 billion. Our debt-to-book capitalization dropped to 25%. And when you net it of cash, it's just 13%, which is six points below where it was just a quarter ago. Our capital spending for the year still looks to be around $2.2 billion.
Switching gears, I thought I'll spend a few minutes on how we're thinking on things as we approached 2011. First for our onshore U.S. program, we've recently added the Central DJ Basin program to a growing list of major projects, and Dave will be discussing the program in greater detail later on the call. 
We view the horizontal Niobrara program in four distinct parts. First off is the core Wattenberg were a substantial amount of vertical development had taken place over the years. And we're now identifying locations for additional horizontal wells. The horizontal potential in the Wattenberg core was highlighted earlier this year by our Gemini well success, and we expect to drill more Gemini-type wells by the end of the year. 
The second area is on the northern and eastern edges of Wattenberg where we're refocusing on expanding the economic limits of the field. A large portion of our horizontal drilling to date has been in this area, and we've been encouraged by flow rates with liquid contributions north of 70%.
Third is our position in northern Colorado from the edges of Wattenberg, basically up to the Wyoming border and the fourth area is our acreage in Southeastern Wyoming and Northwest Weld County, Colorado. Overall, we should be adding two horizontal rigs to the DJ Basin next year. And we expect to drill more than double the number of horizontal wells in 2011 than we will drill this year.
Moving offshore. Despite the Gulf moratorium being formally lifted, we still face a considerable uncertainty there. However, I'm becoming more confident that drilling will resume reasonably soon, perhaps by year end. But almost certainly at a slower pace than pre-moratorium. We're certainly pleased that the completion work at Galapagos has moved forward, and it will truly be an advantage to us that we already have a working certified rig as we prepare to resume drilling. It's our hope that drilling prospects such as Santiago, which is part of Galapagos, the Deep Blue sidetrack and appraisal of our large Gunflint discovery, all of which are targeting known reservoirs will be early candidates for approval.
In the Eastern Med [Mediterranean], we sanctioned Tamar in the third quarter and it's full speed ahead there. We've now awarded the platform fabrication installation contracts as well as the umbilican subsea installation in all major subsea equipment as ordered. The rig will commence field developments in the first quarter of next year following exploration results of Leviathan which initiated drilling about a week and a half ago. 
Our second rig will come into the area early next year to provide further support to our exploration and appraisal plan. So we'll have two rigs working in the Eastern Mediterranean for at least a good portion of 2011.
Our next will certainly be very active for us. Overall, our goals are to keep our major project developments on schedule, expand the horizontal Niobrara program and resume deepwater Gulf of Mexico drilling activity. On top of that, we're focused on leveraging our prior success in exploring offshore West Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean. And of course, supporting these objectives is maintaining a strong balance sheet, which we have. 
We'll be finalizing our capital budget over the next few months, but I would expect that it will be consistent with what we laid out in our June Analyst Meeting. The Mid-Continent and Illinois Basin production that we sold partway to this year which totals approximately 6,000 barrels a day equivalent will obviously impact 2011 volumes. But even so, we expect volume growth next year, which will likely be in the low-single digits on a percentage basis. Of course our growth will rapidly accelerate as the major projects start up, so as we move closer to 2012, we should see the beginning of a significant step up in both production and cash flow, as well as an accelerating growth rate, led by our strong-based programs and the impact of our major project developments.
So that's just a quick glimpse of what we see for 2011. And so with that, I'll turn the call over to you, Dave."

Starting in the U.S., our plan to focus on our activity levels, recent results and where our programs are headed the remainder of this year and into next year. It was another great quarter for our onshore business led by the Central DJ Ba",1704,"Thanks, Chuck. Starting in the U.S., our plan to focus on our activity levels, recent results and where our programs are headed the remainder of this year and into next year. 
It was another great quarter for our onshore business led by the Central DJ Basin. With a strong liquid focus, we've been able to grow our net crude oil production at the basin by over 2,500 barrels per day compared to the second quarter average of this year. Total liquid production in this area averaged over 30,000 barrels a day in the third quarter and our liquid percent has grown to 54% of total basin production. Actual crude oil and condensate made up 21,000 barrels per day in the third quarter.
We're operating six vertical rigs in Wattenberg and our Niobrara horizontal rig count has grown to three, with two rigs currently in Wattenberg and one on our Southeastern Wyoming acreage. Our net acreage in the basin is now over 830,000, an increase of 80,000 acres since June with the majority of the additions coming from areas outside of Wattenberg. 
So far this year, we've drilled 15 wells in Wattenberg, two in the core and 13 tests in the northern and eastern edges of the field. Recent horizontal well results in Wattenberg continued to be encouraging with the last 11 wells having initial 24 hour rates between 550 and 850 barrels of oil equivalent per day with high oil content. Some of the wells drilled on the edges of the field have been in areas we would consider marginally economic for vertical well development, making areas that previously didn't work now viable with current technology. 
As we continue to obtain more production history, estimated ultimate recoveries are tracking on average with our 290,000 barrel of oil equivalent scenario. In total, we have 15 horizontal wells on production in Wattenberg, including the three wells that were drilled in 2009. Our teams continued to improve drill times, highlighted by recent wells with a spud to TD in less than 15 days. On the completion side, bilateral lengths range from 3,300 to 5,100 feet. The number of fracs stages per well has increased to 18 to 20 stages.
We recently moved one of the horizontal rig back to the core area of Wattenberg few miles from our Gemini well, where we will be further testing recovery in a more vertically developed portion of the field. Gemini has now produced over 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent in just seven months, and is still producing over 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day with liquid representing 30% to 40% of the volume. We also recently finished the horizontal Codell well and are drilling a second, targeting both the Codell and the Niobrara zones, but we're still testing and evaluating different completion scenarios in these early stage of the play.
In our third focus area, Northern Colorado, we have drilled and completed four wells around the Grover area. The first two wells, we're targeting quite areas identified on the 3D where we're testing the matrix contribution. Despite the lack of natural fractures, initial 24 hour rates were 500 to 600 barrels of oil equivalent per day with around 85% oil contribution. These wells have been on production in less than 60 days, and we're working to determine the optimum production lift system as there is less reservoir energy in this area north of Wattenberg. 
Our third and fourth wells were a few miles to the east in an area with more natural fractures. They were recently completed in our cleaning up after stimulation.
And the fourth area of focus in Southeast Wyoming, we're now drilling our second of three wells combining 3D seismic data with core and well information gained from vertical monitoring wells, all of which will help in evaluating this portion of the play. The first horizontal well was fracture stimulated this week.
In total, we're still planning to have about 30 horizontal Niobrara wells drilled in the basin this year. Around 21 in Wattenberg, about six in Northern Colorado and three in Southeast Wyoming.
Based on our results today and encouragement about the play, we currently plan to add a fourth horizontal rig in the second quarter next year and a fifth in the third quarter. As Chuck mentioned, our plan's to have us doubling our horizontal Niobrara drilling activity next year. We will also continue acquiring 3D seismic, adding another thousand square miles to the 300 we expect to have by the end of this year.
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the ENSCO 8501 rig has completed Santa Cruz and will complete work in Isabela in the next few days finishing almost all the Galapagos project that we operate. BP is working on a subsea gathering system and tie in, as well as the top sites at Na Kika. The latest schedule has the late barge coming in around the first of April next year with initial production in the second half of the year. We're still expecting in the range of 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net when it comes online.
At our Retarm [ph] South oil project, we have recently approved the plan of development which is targeting the addition of 3,000 to 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net by the end of 2011. The well was drilled and completed in 2008, and we're finalizing the production handling agreement.
Following the lifting of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico moratorium, we have submitted permit applications to resume drilling operations at Santiago and the Deep Blue sidetrack. We plan to submit a permit for the Gunflint appraisal well shortly.
Turning to our international program. At the Aseng oil project in Equatorial Guinea, our two rigs have finished drilling operations and are now performing well completions. As a reminder, Aseng is being developed with five horizontal producers, three water injectors and two gas injectors. We're pleased with the results from the drilling program coming in under budget and with oil and plays numbers increasing slightly. We've landed all 10 of the subsea trees and everything is moving forward as expected including the FPSO conversion, start up the still plan for mid-2012 with 17,000 barrels of oil per day net.
At Alen, all FEED and early design work has been completed. We expect to have project sanctioned in the next couple of months. We have awarded contracts for the platform, subsea trees and installation of pipeline. And field start up is expected by the end of 2013. Between Aseng and Alen, we should see an increase of more than 30,000 barrels of liquids per day net by the end of 2013.
As we process new 3D data from Cameroon, and reprocess our Equatorial Guinea 3D, we're prioritizing our exploration plans for next year in the Douala Basin. The 2011 targets will be additional oil opportunities in the range of 100 million barrels gross or greater, mostly in the Miocene or perhaps seems slightly deeper. Overall, we believe we will have between two and four exploration wells in this basin next year.
In the North Sea, we received temporary relief related to the meant [ph] stock issue on the Dumbarton FPSO. As a result, total North Sea volumes were up 45% from the second quarter, reflecting improved sales since from Dumbarton and Lochranza. There is some compression system maintenance on going at Dumbarton and that will restrict our rates just a bit in the fourth quarter. 
In Israel, we completed the second of two new development wells at Mari-B in mid-September. Strong natural gas demand has allowed us to test the productivity of our new wells, one of which flowed as much as 225 million cubic feet a day, with the completion similar to what we're finding at Tamar. The addition of these two wells, along with compression in the first half of 2011, allows us to maintain full field deliverability, 600 million cubic feet a day gross until Tamar comes online. Overall, it was a quarter of exceptional operational performance in Israel, meeting record gas demand reliably, bringing two new wells online and continuing our outstanding safety performance.
Once the said coach press rig completes our exploration test at Leviathan, we will begin development drilling at Tamar. Leviathan is now drilling, and we anticipate seeing results by the end of the year. Again, this is a 16 trillion cubic foot gross prospect with a 50% chance of success. Chuck mentioned that we will bring a second rig to the region early next year. Depending on results from the Leviathan well, I would expect that we will drill between two and four exploration or appraisal wells in the area in 2011 as we continue to test the potential of this under-explored basin. We have recently completed additional 3D seismic acquisition offshore Israel adding another 925 square miles of coverage.
Turning to our total company sales outlook for the fourth quarter, volumes should range between 212 to 222,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Combined with strong sales year-to-date, our full year average outlook has increased into the upper half of our previous guidance or 214,000 to 217,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
In the U.S., the fourth quarter will not include any volumes from the 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day divestiture that closed in August. Compared to the third quarter, natural gas sales volumes in Israel will be down due to the seasonality and the North Sea and deepwater Gulf of Mexico volumes will see some decline. We expect our Central DJ Basin volumes will continue to show growth and oil volumes in Equatorial Guinea should be higher as the third quarter was an underlifted period.
Our activity level remains high as we rapidly approach 2011. We will continue to gather more information on the horizontal Niobrara program while prepare for our return to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Internationally, we're focused on keeping both Aseng and Alen moving in West Africa and Tamar in Israel. We should have results from Leviathan by the end of the year. That's a quick look at our key activities. So Holly, I think now we're ready to open it up for questions."

Well, the operative word is hope. I hope that we'll see something by the end of the year. And the only reason I say that is as Dave pointed out, we have submitted the applications to resume work on two wells we're drilling at the time of the moratorium, that was Santiago and Deep Blue. So certainly, we would expect that those -- whenever we receive approval, it will be one of those that will likely get early approval. And as I noted, I was hopeful that those and perhaps Gunflint might be early on the queue because we were drilling into known reservoirs. One has been penetrated before and so in our view, it's more likely that those types of operations might get earlier approval than sheer rank exploration. I only say that because some of the experience that other companies had when they were resuming operations in the shallow water that those that were more known and viewed to be, they could be easily looked through when you had known pore pressures and regimes and drilling programs that they be might level up as early approval. When that will happen -- I'm only speculating because that review process started. Again I noted, we do have a positive, these are being permitted on the ENSCO rig that is actually been working during the moratorium. It was very early certified. And so we've got what we believe is a working certified rig, so that part of it we can work through. There's still more things that have to be done. And clearly, our experience to get the Galapagos completion permit was that they had a lot of work and a lot of iterations to go through. So I would not expect anything to be just as sended in and then comes back approved. I would think that there will be some iterations in these drilling permits. So if anything happens, I would say it's going to have very little cost impact on this year. Our view is that all of this will be part of our 2011 plans and we certainly got flexibility to accommodate the schedule, whatever turns out."

Welcome to Noble Energy's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Call and Webcast. On the call today, we have Chuck Davidson, Chairman and CEO; Dave Stover, President and COO; and Ken Fisher, CFO.
In a minute, Chuck will review our results for the quarter as well as talk about some of our plans for 2011. Dave will then review our global operations, focused on third quarter highlights and our ongoing activity levels. 
Today, we plan on leaving plenty of time for Q&A at the end of our prepared remarks and wrap up the call in less than an hour. In an effort to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to ask their questions on the call, we would ask that all the participants limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up.
And should you have any questions that we don't get to, we'll be more than happy to respond to those after the call. We hope everyone has found the earnings release that we issued this morning. Later today, we do expect to be filing our 10-Q with the SEC and we will also have that available on our website.
I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements based on our current view and most reasonable expectations. We provide no assurances on these statements as a number of factors and uncertainties could cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from what we discuss here today. You should read our full disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of risk factors that influence our business.
We'll reference today certain non-GAAP financial measures here today, such as adjusted net income or discretionary cash flow on the call. When we refer to these items, it's because we believe they are good metrics to use in evaluating the company's performance. Be sure to see the reconciliation in our earnings release tables.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Chuck now."

In my opening comments, I plan to review our quarterly results and then also walk through some early thoughts for 2011. No question, we had a great third quarter. Record volumes combined with good cost manageme",1520,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. In my opening comments, I plan to review our quarterly results and then also walk through some early thoughts for 2011. No question, we had a great third quarter. 
Record volumes combined with good cost management delivered GAAP net income of $232 million or $1.31 per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $225 million or $1.27 per diluted share after removing the impact of unrealized commodity derivative gain, also removing the gain on the sale of assets as well as an asset impairment charge.
While the sales numbers are certainly well above expectation, from my perspective, it was really the list of key accomplishments regarding our long-term growth agenda that really made the quarter standout. And these included the sanction of the Tamar project in Israel, significant progress with the horizontal Niobrara play in the DJ Basin and continuing Galapagos in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico despite the moratorium that we had there. These accomplishments are what will really bring great results to our company in the future.
Sales volumes for the third quarter were 230,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Actual production was 2,000 barrels per day above sales due to timing of some international oil liftings. Good product diversification continues to be beneficial for us as we have 38% of our sales being global liquids, 33% international gas and the remaining 29% was U.S. gas. Versus the second quarter this year, our international gas percentage was up four points, primarily driven by continued market growth and strong seasonal demand we experienced in Israel, which led to record sales volumes there.
Liquid volumes in the U.S. averaged 54,000 barrels per day in the third quarter, up over 2,000 barrels per day from the second quarter. All volumes in the Central DJ Basin and deepwater Gulf of Mexico were up a combined 5,000 barrels per day, partially offset by nearly a 3,000 barrel a day reduction, which was due to our onshore asset sale that closed during the quarter. 
Our DJ Basin volumes continue to reflect growth from both the vertical and the horizontal development programs. Deepwater was higher as some of our volumes were restricted in the second quarter. We also had increased North Sea volumes primarily from Dumbarton and Lochranza. In Equatorial Guinea, our liquid volumes were down sequentially, due to the timing of liftings during the quarter.
On U.S. natural gas, our volumes declined from the second quarter, primarily resulting from reallocating capital away from dry gas drilling, which of course we began some time ago. Even in Wattenberg, our gas production has declined as we focused on growing liquids in the field. And we'll continue with the same domestic natural gas strategy until the U.S. market is ready for more supply. 
Overall, our U.S. volumes were flat with the second quarter, again keeping in mind that we lost 3,000 barrels a day due to the divestiture. International is up 11,000 barrels a day equivalent for the quarter, that's an 11% increase over the second quarter.
Commodity price realizations were relatively consistent from second quarter to third quarter. Our crude oil average for the quarter was strong at over $73 per barrel and U.S. gas prices were basically flat at $3.87 per Mcf. In Israel, prices were down a little bit due to the changing blend between the old and new gas price advantages at Mari-B. 
Looking at cost the trend from the second to the third quarter was very good, with lease operating expense down 10% on a per barrel basis and transportation and DD&A generally flat. Our exploration activity for the third quarter was relatively quiet and G&A was as expected. The effective tax rate and deferred portion on an adjusted basis was lower than we originally anticipated. This resulted from the application of some excess foreign tax credits that we're able to apply to our foreign U.S. branch assets.
The adjustment items to net income for the third quarter include a small gain on the commodity mark-to-market, as well as $114 million pretax gain from the sale of the assets in the Mid-Continent, and the Illinois Basin, again, which closed during the third quarter. We also removed the impact of asset impairments primarily the result of further decline to the natural gas price curve. Finally, we wrote down the value of our New Albany shale assets which we discontinued development activity quite some time ago.
Our balance sheet continues to be very strong. At the end of the quarter, we had over $1.1 billion in cash with the $1.75 billion undrawn on our credit facility, providing us ample flexibility as we invest in our major projects in the coming months. Our total liquidity is right at $2.9 billion. Our debt-to-book capitalization dropped to 25%. And when you net it of cash, it's just 13%, which is six points below what it was just a quarter ago. Our capital spending for the year still looks to be around $2.2 billion.
Switching gears, I thought Iâ€™d spend a few minutes on how we're thinking on things as we approach 2011. First for our onshore U.S. program, we've recently added the Central DJ Basin program to a growing list of major projects, and Dave will be discussing the program in greater detail later on the call. 
We view the horizontal Niobrara program in four distinct parts. First off is the core Wattenberg where a substantial amount of vertical development had taken place over the years. And we're now identifying locations for additional horizontal wells. The horizontal potential in the Wattenberg core was highlighted earlier this year by our Gemini well success, and we expect to drill more Gemini-type wells by the end of the year. 
The second area is on the northern and eastern edges of Wattenberg where we're focusing on expanding the economic limits of the field. A large portion of our horizontal drilling to date has been in this area, and we've been encouraged by flow rates with liquid contributions north of 70%.
Third is our position in northern Colorado from the edges of Wattenberg, basically up to the Wyoming border and the fourth area is our acreage in Southeastern Wyoming and Northwest Weld County, Colorado. Overall, we should be adding two horizontal rigs to the DJ Basin next year. And we expect to drill more than double the number of horizontal wells in 2011 than we will drill this year.
Moving offshore. Despite the Gulf moratorium being formally lifted, we still face a considerable uncertainty there. However, I'm becoming more confident that drilling will resume reasonably soon, perhaps by year end. But almost certainly at a slower pace than pre-moratorium. We're certainly pleased that the completion work at Galapagos has moved forward, and it will truly be an advantage to us that we already have a working certified rig as we prepare to resume drilling. It's our hope that drilling prospects such as Santiago, which is part of Galapagos, the Deep Blue sidetrack and appraisal of our large Gunflint discovery, all of which are targeting known reservoirs will be early candidates for approval.
In the Eastern Med [Mediterranean], we sanctioned Tamar in the third quarter and it's full speed ahead there. We've now awarded the platform fabrication installation contracts as well as the umbilican subsea installation in all major subsea equipment as ordered. The rig will commence field developments in the first quarter of next year following exploration results of Leviathan which initiated drilling about a week and a half ago. 
Our second rig will come into the area early next year to provide further support to our exploration and appraisal plan. So we'll have two rigs working in the Eastern Mediterranean for at least a good portion of 2011.
Our next year will certainly be very active for us. Overall, our goals are to keep our major project developments on schedule, expand the horizontal Niobrara program and resume deepwater Gulf of Mexico drilling activity. On top of that, we're focused on leveraging our prior success in exploring offshore West Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean. And of course, supporting these objectives is maintaining a strong balance sheet, which we have. 
We'll be finalizing our capital budget over the next few months, but I would expect that it will be consistent with what we laid out in our June Analyst Meeting. The Mid-Continent and Illinois Basin production that we sold partway to this year which totals approximately 6,000 barrels a day equivalent will obviously impact 2011 volumes. But even so, we expect volume growth next year, which will likely be in the low-single digits on a percentage basis. Of course our growth will rapidly accelerate as the major projects start up, so as we move closer to 2012, we should see the beginning of a significant step up in both production and cash flow, as well as an accelerating growth rate, led by our strong-based programs and the impact of our major project developments.
So that's just a quick glimpse of what we see for 2011. And so with that, I'll turn the call over to you, Dave."

Starting in the U.S., I plan to focus on our activity levels, recent results and where our programs are headed the remainder of this year and into next year. It was another great quarter for our onshore business led by the Central DJ Basi",1704,"Thanks, Chuck. Starting in the U.S., I plan to focus on our activity levels, recent results and where our programs are headed the remainder of this year and into next year. 
It was another great quarter for our onshore business led by the Central DJ Basin. With a strong liquid focus, we've been able to grow our net crude oil production at the basin by over 2,500 barrels per day compared to the second quarter average of this year. Total liquid production in this area averaged over 30,000 barrels a day in the third quarter and our liquid percent has grown to 54% of total basin production. Actual crude oil and condensate made up 21,000 barrels per day in the third quarter.
We're operating six vertical rigs in Wattenberg and our Niobrara horizontal rig count has grown to three, with two rigs currently in Wattenberg and one on our Southeastern Wyoming acreage. Our net acreage in the basin is now over 830,000, an increase of 80,000 acres since June with the majority of the additions coming from areas outside of Wattenberg. 
So far this year, we've drilled 15 wells in Wattenberg, two in the core and 13 tests in the northern and eastern edges of the field. Recent horizontal well results in Wattenberg continued to be encouraging with the last 11 wells having initial 24 hour rates between 550 and 850 barrels of oil equivalent per day with high oil content. Some of the wells drilled on the edges of the field have been in areas we would consider marginally economic for vertical well development, making areas that previously didn't work now viable with current technology. 
As we continue to obtain more production history, estimated ultimate recoveries are tracking on average with our 290,000 barrel of oil equivalent scenario. In total, we have 15 horizontal wells on production in Wattenberg, including the three wells that were drilled in 2009. Our teams continued to improve drill times, highlighted by recent wells with a spud to TD in less than 15 days. On the completion side, the lateral lengths range from 3,300 to 5,100 feet. The number of fracs stages per well has increased to 18 to 20 stages.
We recently moved one of the horizontal rig back to the core area of Wattenberg few miles from our Gemini well, where we will be further testing recovery in a more vertically developed portion of the field. Gemini has now produced over 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent in just seven months, and is still producing over 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day with liquid representing 30% to 40% of the volume. We also recently finished the horizontal Codell well and are drilling a second, targeting both the Codell and the Niobrara zones, but we're still testing and evaluating different completion scenarios in these early stage of the play.
In our third focus area, Northern Colorado, we have drilled and completed four wells around the Grover area. The first two wells, we're targeting quiet areas identified on the 3D where we're testing the matrix contribution. Despite the lack of natural fractures, initial 24 hour rates were 500 to 600 barrels of oil equivalent per day with around 85% oil contribution. These wells have been on production in less than 60 days, and we're working to determine the optimum production lift system as there is less reservoir energy in this area north of Wattenberg. 
Our third and fourth wells were a few miles to the east in an area with more natural fractures. They were recently completed and are cleaning up after stimulation.
And the fourth area of focus in Southeast Wyoming, we're now drilling our second of three wells combining 3D seismic data with core and log information gained from vertical monitoring wells, all of which will help in evaluating this portion of the play. The first horizontal well was fracture stimulated this week.
In total, we're still planning to have about 30 horizontal Niobrara wells drilled in the basin this year. Around 21 in Wattenberg, about six in Northern Colorado and three in Southeast Wyoming.
Based on our results today and encouragement about the play, we currently plan to add a fourth horizontal rig in the second quarter next year and a fifth in the third quarter. As Chuck mentioned, our plans have us doubling our horizontal Niobrara drilling activity next year. We will also continue acquiring 3D seismic, adding another thousand square miles to the 300 we expect to have by the end of this year.
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the ENSCO 8501 rig has completed Santa Cruz and will complete work in Isabela in the next few days finishing almost all the Galapagos project that we operate. BP is working on a subsea gathering system and tie in, as well as the top sites [ph] at Na Kika. The latest schedule has the lay barge coming in around the first of April next year with initial production in the second half of the year. We're still expecting in the range of 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net when it comes online.
At our Retarm [ph] South oil project, we have recently approved the plan of development which is targeting the addition of 3,000 to 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net by the end of 2011. The well was drilled and completed in 2008, and we're finalizing the production handling agreement.
Following the lifting of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico moratorium, we have submitted permit applications to resume drilling operations at Santiago and the Deep Blue sidetrack. We plan to submit a permit for the Gunflint appraisal well shortly.
Turning to our international program. At the Aseng oil project in Equatorial Guinea, our two rigs have finished drilling operations and are now performing well completions. As a reminder, Aseng is being developed with five horizontal producers, three water injectors and two gas injectors. We're pleased with the results from the drilling program coming in under budget and with oil and plays numbers increasing slightly. We've landed all 10 of the subsea trees and everything is moving forward as expected including the FPSO conversion.  Start up is still planned for mid-2012 with 17,000 barrels of oil per day net.
At Alen, all FEED and early design work has been completed. We expect to have project sanctioned in the next couple of months. We have awarded contracts for the platform, subsea trees and installation of pipeline. And field start up is expected by the end of 2013. Between Aseng and Alen, we should see an increase of more than 30,000 barrels of liquids per day net by the end of 2013.
As we process new 3D data from Cameroon, and reprocess our Equatorial Guinea 3D, we're prioritizing our exploration plans for next year in the Douala Basin. The 2011 targets will be additional oil opportunities in the range of 100 million barrels gross or greater, mostly in the Miocene or perhaps seems slightly deeper. Overall, we believe we will have between two and four exploration wells in this basin next year.
In the North Sea, we received temporary relief related to the vent stack issue on the Dumbarton FPSO. As a result, total North Sea volumes were up 45% from the second quarter, reflecting improved sales since from Dumbarton / Lochranza. There is some compression system maintenance on going at Dumbarton and that will restrict our rates just a bit in the fourth quarter. 
In Israel, we completed the second of two new development wells at Mari-B in mid-September. Strong natural gas demand has allowed us to test the productivity of our new wells, one of which flowed as much as 225 million cubic feet a day, with the completion similar to what we're finding at Tamar. The addition of these two wells, along with compression in the first half of 2011, allows us to maintain full field deliverability, 600 million cubic feet a day gross until Tamar comes online. Overall, it was a quarter of exceptional operational performance in Israel, meeting record gas demand reliably, bringing two new wells online and continuing our outstanding safety performance.
Once the said coach press rig completes our exploration test at Leviathan, we will begin development drilling at Tamar. Leviathan is now drilling, and we anticipate seeing results by the end of the year. Again, this is a 16 trillion cubic foot gross prospect with a 50% chance of success. Chuck mentioned that we will bring a second rig to the region early next year. Depending on results from the Leviathan well, I would expect that we will drill between two and four exploration or appraisal wells in the area in 2011 as we continue to test the potential of this under-explored basin. We have recently completed additional 3D seismic acquisition offshore Israel adding another 925 square miles of coverage.
Turning to our total company sales outlook for the fourth quarter, volumes should range between 212,000 to 222,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Combined with strong sales year-to-date, our full year average outlook has increased into the upper half of our previous guidance or 214,000 to 217,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
In the U.S., the fourth quarter will not include any volumes from the 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day divestiture that closed in August. Compared to the third quarter, natural gas sales volumes in Israel will be down due to the seasonality and the North Sea and deepwater Gulf of Mexico volumes will see some decline. We expect our Central DJ Basin volumes will continue to show growth and oil volumes in Equatorial Guinea should be higher as the third quarter was an underlifted period.
Our activity level remains high as we rapidly approach 2011. We will continue to gather more information on the horizontal Niobrara program.  Weâ€™ll prepare for our return to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Internationally, we're focused on keeping both Aseng and Alen moving in West Africa and Tamar in Israel. We should have results from Leviathan by the end of the year. That's a quick look at our key activities. So Holly, I think now we're ready to open it up for questions."

This is -- I think it's safe to say, it's very much an incremental program. But we're still working on the parts of the basin that we'll go into. We're obviously going to be working in all the areas that we outlined and we'll get that finalized. But it will be a substantial program."

Well, the operative word is hope. I hope that we'll see something by the end of the year. And the only reason I say that is as Dave pointed out, we have submitted the applications to resume work on two wells we were drilling at the time of the moratorium, that was Santiago and Deep Blue. So certainly, we would expect that those -- whenever we receive approval, it will be one of those that will likely get early approval. And as I noted, I was hopeful that those and perhaps Gunflint might be early in the queue because we were drilling into known reservoirs, ones that had been penetrated before.  And so in our view, it's more likely that those types of operations might get earlier approval than pure rank exploration. I only say that because some of the experience that other companies had when they were resuming operations in the shallow water that those that were more known and viewed to be, they could be easily looked through when you had known pore pressures and regimes and drilling programs that they be might bubble up as early approvals. When that will happen -- I'm only speculating because that review process started. Again I noted, we do have a positive, these are being permitted on the ENSCO rig that is actually been working during the moratorium. It was very early certified. And so we've got what we believe is a working certified rig, so that part of it we can work through. There's still more things that have to be done. And clearly, our experience in getting the Galapagos completion permits was that they had a lot of work and a lot of iterations to go through. So I would not expect anything to be just a send in and it comes back approved. I would think that there will be some iterations in these drilling permits. So if anything happens, I would say it's going to have very little cost impact on this year. Our view is that all of this will be part of our 2011 plans and weâ€™ve certainly got flexibility to accommodate the schedule, whatever turns out."

Welcome to Noble Energy's Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Call and Webcast. On the call today, we have Chuck Davidson, Chairman and CEO; Dave Stover, President and COO; and Ken Fisher, CFO.
In a minute, Chuck will review our results for the quarter as well as talk about some of our plans for 2011. Dave will then review our global operations, focused on third quarter highlights and our ongoing activity levels. 
Today, we plan on leaving plenty of time for Q&A at the end of our prepared remarks and wrap up the call in less than an hour. In an effort to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to ask their questions on the call, we would ask that all the participants limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up.
And should you have any questions that we don't get to, we'll be more than happy to respond to those after the call. We hope everyone has found the earnings release that we issued this morning. Later today, we do expect to be filing our 10-Q with the SEC and we will also have that available on our website.
I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements based on our current view and most reasonable expectations. We provide no assurances on these statements as a number of factors and uncertainties could cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from what we discuss here today. You should read our full disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of risk factors that influence our business.
We'll reference today certain non-GAAP financial measures here today, such as adjusted net income or discretionary cash flow on the call. When we refer to these items, it's because we believe they are good metrics to use in evaluating the company's performance. Be sure to see the reconciliation in our earnings release tables.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Chuck now."

In my opening comments, I plan to review our quarterly results and then also walk through some early thoughts for 2011. No question, we had a great third quarter. Record volumes combined with good cost manageme",1520,"Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. In my opening comments, I plan to review our quarterly results and then also walk through some early thoughts for 2011. No question, we had a great third quarter. 
Record volumes combined with good cost management delivered GAAP net income of $232 million or $1.31 per diluted share. Adjusted net income was $225 million or $1.27 per diluted share after removing the impact of unrealized commodity derivative gain, also removing the gain on the sale of assets as well as an asset impairment charge.
While the sales numbers are certainly well above expectation, from my perspective, it was really the list of key accomplishments regarding our long-term growth agenda that really made the quarter standout. And these included the sanction of the Tamar project in Israel, significant progress with the horizontal Niobrara play in the DJ Basin and continuing Galapagos in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico despite the moratorium that we had there. These accomplishments are what will really bring great results to our company in the future.
Sales volumes for the third quarter were 230,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Actual production was 2,000 barrels per day above sales due to timing of some international oil liftings. Good product diversification continues to be beneficial for us as we have 38% of our sales being global liquids, 33% international gas and the remaining 29% was U.S. gas. Versus the second quarter this year, our international gas percentage was up four points, primarily driven by continued market growth and strong seasonal demand we experienced in Israel, which led to record sales volumes there.
Liquid volumes in the U.S. averaged 54,000 barrels per day in the third quarter, up over 2,000 barrels per day from the second quarter. All volumes in the Central DJ Basin and deepwater Gulf of Mexico were up a combined 5,000 barrels per day, partially offset by nearly a 3,000 barrel a day reduction, which was due to our onshore asset sale that closed during the quarter. 
Our DJ Basin volumes continue to reflect growth from both the vertical and the horizontal development programs. Deepwater was higher as some of our volumes were restricted in the second quarter. We also had increased North Sea volumes primarily from Dumbarton and Lochranza. In Equatorial Guinea, our liquid volumes were down sequentially, due to the timing of liftings during the quarter.
On U.S. natural gas, our volumes declined from the second quarter, primarily resulting from reallocating capital away from dry gas drilling, which of course we began some time ago. Even in Wattenberg, our gas production has declined as we focused on growing liquids in the field. And we'll continue with the same domestic natural gas strategy until the U.S. market is ready for more supply. 
Overall, our U.S. volumes were flat with the second quarter, again keeping in mind that we lost 3,000 barrels a day due to the divestiture. International is up 11,000 barrels a day equivalent for the quarter, that's an 11% increase over the second quarter.
Commodity price realizations were relatively consistent from second quarter to third quarter. Our crude oil average for the quarter was strong at over $73 per barrel and U.S. gas prices were basically flat at $3.87 per Mcf. In Israel, prices were down a little bit due to the changing blend between the old and new gas price advantages at Mari-B. 
Looking at cost the trend from the second to the third quarter was very good, with lease operating expense down 10% on a per barrel basis and transportation and DD&A generally flat. Our exploration activity for the third quarter was relatively quiet and G&A was as expected. The effective tax rate and deferred portion on an adjusted basis was lower than we originally anticipated. This resulted from the application of some excess foreign tax credits that we're able to apply to our foreign U.S. branch assets.
The adjustment items to net income for the third quarter include a small gain on the commodity mark-to-market, as well as $114 million pretax gain from the sale of the assets in the Mid-Continent, and the Illinois Basin, again, which closed during the third quarter. We also removed the impact of asset impairments primarily the result of further decline to the natural gas price curve. Finally, we wrote down the value of our New Albany shale assets which we discontinued development activity quite some time ago.
Our balance sheet continues to be very strong. At the end of the quarter, we had over $1.1 billion in cash with the $1.75 billion undrawn on our credit facility, providing us ample flexibility as we invest in our major projects in the coming months. Our total liquidity is right at $2.9 billion. Our debt-to-book capitalization dropped to 25%. And when you net it of cash, it's just 13%, which is six points below what it was just a quarter ago. Our capital spending for the year still looks to be around $2.2 billion.
Switching gears, I thought Iâ€™d spend a few minutes on how we're thinking on things as we approach 2011. First for our onshore U.S. program, we've recently added the Central DJ Basin program to a growing list of major projects, and Dave will be discussing the program in greater detail later on the call. 
We view the horizontal Niobrara program in four distinct parts. First off is the core Wattenberg where a substantial amount of vertical development had taken place over the years. And we're now identifying locations for additional horizontal wells. The horizontal potential in the Wattenberg core was highlighted earlier this year by our Gemini well success, and we expect to drill more Gemini-type wells by the end of the year. 
The second area is on the northern and eastern edges of Wattenberg where we're focusing on expanding the economic limits of the field. A large portion of our horizontal drilling to date has been in this area, and we've been encouraged by flow rates with liquid contributions north of 70%.
Third is our position in northern Colorado from the edges of Wattenberg, basically up to the Wyoming border and the fourth area is our acreage in Southeastern Wyoming and Northwest Weld County, Colorado. Overall, we should be adding two horizontal rigs to the DJ Basin next year. And we expect to drill more than double the number of horizontal wells in 2011 than we will drill this year.
Moving offshore. Despite the Gulf moratorium being formally lifted, we still face a considerable uncertainty there. However, I'm becoming more confident that drilling will resume reasonably soon, perhaps by year end. But almost certainly at a slower pace than pre-moratorium. We're certainly pleased that the completion work at Galapagos has moved forward, and it will truly be an advantage to us that we already have a working certified rig as we prepare to resume drilling. It's our hope that drilling prospects such as Santiago, which is part of Galapagos, the Deep Blue sidetrack and appraisal of our large Gunflint discovery, all of which are targeting known reservoirs will be early candidates for approval.
In the Eastern Med [Mediterranean], we sanctioned Tamar in the third quarter and it's full speed ahead there. We've now awarded the platform fabrication installation contracts as well as the umbilican subsea installation in all major subsea equipment as ordered. The rig will commence field developments in the first quarter of next year following exploration results of Leviathan which initiated drilling about a week and a half ago. 
Our second rig will come into the area early next year to provide further support to our exploration and appraisal plan. So we'll have two rigs working in the Eastern Mediterranean for at least a good portion of 2011.
Our next year will certainly be very active for us. Overall, our goals are to keep our major project developments on schedule, expand the horizontal Niobrara program and resume deepwater Gulf of Mexico drilling activity. On top of that, we're focused on leveraging our prior success in exploring offshore West Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean. And of course, supporting these objectives is maintaining a strong balance sheet, which we have. 
We'll be finalizing our capital budget over the next few months, but I would expect that it will be consistent with what we laid out in our June Analyst Meeting. The Mid-Continent and Illinois Basin production that we sold partway to this year which totals approximately 6,000 barrels a day equivalent will obviously impact 2011 volumes. But even so, we expect volume growth next year, which will likely be in the low-single digits on a percentage basis. Of course our growth will rapidly accelerate as the major projects start up, so as we move closer to 2012, we should see the beginning of a significant step up in both production and cash flow, as well as an accelerating growth rate, led by our strong-based programs and the impact of our major project developments.
So that's just a quick glimpse of what we see for 2011. And so with that, I'll turn the call over to you, Dave."

Starting in the U.S., I plan to focus on our activity levels, recent results and where our programs are headed the remainder of this year and into next year. It was another great quarter for our onshore business led by the Central DJ Basi",1703,"Thanks, Chuck. Starting in the U.S., I plan to focus on our activity levels, recent results and where our programs are headed the remainder of this year and into next year. 
It was another great quarter for our onshore business led by the Central DJ Basin. With a strong liquid focus, we've been able to grow our net crude oil production at the basin by over 2,500 barrels per day compared to the second quarter average of this year. Total liquid production in this area averaged over 30,000 barrels a day in the third quarter and our liquid percent has grown to 54% of total basin production. Actual crude oil and condensate made up 21,000 barrels per day in the third quarter.
We're operating six vertical rigs in Wattenberg and our Niobrara horizontal rig count has grown to three, with two rigs currently in Wattenberg and one on our Southeastern Wyoming acreage. Our net acreage in the basin is now over 830,000, an increase of 80,000 acres since June with the majority of the additions coming from areas outside of Wattenberg. 
So far this year, we've drilled 15 wells in Wattenberg, two in the core and 13 tests in the northern and eastern edges of the field. Recent horizontal well results in Wattenberg continued to be encouraging with the last 11 wells having initial 24 hour rates between 550 and 850 barrels of oil equivalent per day with high oil content. Some of the wells drilled on the edges of the field have been in areas we would consider marginally economic for vertical well development, making areas that previously didn't work now viable with current technology. 
As we continue to obtain more production history, estimated ultimate recoveries are tracking on average with our 290,000 barrel of oil equivalent scenario. In total, we have 15 horizontal wells on production in Wattenberg, including the three wells that were drilled in 2009. Our teams continued to improve drill times, highlighted by recent wells with a spud to TD in less than 15 days. On the completion side, the lateral lengths range from 3,300 to 5,100 feet. The number of fracs stages per well has increased to 18 to 20 stages.
We recently moved one of the horizontal rig back to the core area of Wattenberg few miles from our Gemini well, where we will be further testing recovery in a more vertically developed portion of the field. Gemini has now produced over 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent in just seven months, and is still producing over 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day with liquid representing 30% to 40% of the volume. We also recently finished the horizontal Codell well and are drilling a second, targeting both the Codell and the Niobrara zones, but we're still testing and evaluating different completion scenarios in these early stage of the play.
In our third focus area, Northern Colorado, we have drilled and completed four wells around the Grover area. The first two wells, we're targeting quiet areas identified on the 3D where we're testing the matrix contribution. Despite the lack of natural fractures, initial 24 hour rates were 500 to 600 barrels of oil equivalent per day with around 85% oil contribution. These wells have been on production in less than 60 days, and we're working to determine the optimum production lift system as there is less reservoir energy in this area north of Wattenberg. 
Our third and fourth wells were a few miles to the east in an area with more natural fractures. They were recently completed and are cleaning up after stimulation.
And the fourth area of focus in Southeast Wyoming, we're now drilling our second of three wells combining 3D seismic data with core and log information gained from vertical monitoring wells, all of which will help in evaluating this portion of the play. The first horizontal well was fracture stimulated this week.
In total, we're still planning to have about 30 horizontal Niobrara wells drilled in the basin this year. Around 21 in Wattenberg, about six in Northern Colorado and three in Southeast Wyoming.
Based on our results today and encouragement about the play, we currently plan to add a fourth horizontal rig in the second quarter next year and a fifth in the third quarter. As Chuck mentioned, our plans have us doubling our horizontal Niobrara drilling activity next year. We will also continue acquiring 3D seismic, adding another thousand square miles to the 300 we expect to have by the end of this year.
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the ENSCO 8501 rig has completed Santa Cruz and will complete work in Isabela in the next few days finishing almost all the Galapagos project that we operate. BP is working on a subsea gathering system and tie in, as well as the top sites [ph] at Na Kika. The latest schedule has the lay barge coming in around the first of April next year with initial production in the second half of the year. We're still expecting in the range of 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net when it comes online.
At our Raton South oil project, we have recently approved the plan of development which is targeting the addition of 3,000 to 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net by the end of 2011. The well was drilled and completed in 2008, and we're finalizing the production handling agreement.
Following the lifting of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico moratorium, we have submitted permit applications to resume drilling operations at Santiago and the Deep Blue sidetrack. We plan to submit a permit for the Gunflint appraisal well shortly.
Turning to our international program. At the Aseng oil project in Equatorial Guinea, our two rigs have finished drilling operations and are now performing well completions. As a reminder, Aseng is being developed with five horizontal producers, three water injectors and two gas injectors. We're pleased with the results from the drilling program coming in under budget and with oil and plays numbers increasing slightly. We've landed all 10 of the subsea trees and everything is moving forward as expected including the FPSO conversion.  Start up is still planned for mid-2012 with 17,000 barrels of oil per day net.
At Alen, all FEED and early design work has been completed. We expect to have project sanctioned in the next couple of months. We have awarded contracts for the platform, subsea trees and installation of pipeline. And field start up is expected by the end of 2013. Between Aseng and Alen, we should see an increase of more than 30,000 barrels of liquids per day net by the end of 2013.
As we process new 3D data from Cameroon, and reprocess our Equatorial Guinea 3D, we're prioritizing our exploration plans for next year in the Douala Basin. The 2011 targets will be additional oil opportunities in the range of 100 million barrels gross or greater, mostly in the Miocene or perhaps seems slightly deeper. Overall, we believe we will have between two and four exploration wells in this basin next year.
In the North Sea, we received temporary relief related to the vent stack issue on the Dumbarton FPSO. As a result, total North Sea volumes were up 45% from the second quarter, reflecting improved sales since from Dumbarton / Lochranza. There is some compression system maintenance on going at Dumbarton and that will restrict our rates just a bit in the fourth quarter. 
In Israel, we completed the second of two new development wells at Mari-B in mid-September. Strong natural gas demand has allowed us to test the productivity of our new wells, one of which flowed as much as 225 million cubic feet a day, with the completion similar to what we're finding at Tamar. The addition of these two wells, along with compression in the first half of 2011, allows us to maintain full field deliverability, 600 million cubic feet a day gross until Tamar comes online. Overall, it was a quarter of exceptional operational performance in Israel, meeting record gas demand reliably, bringing two new wells online and continuing our outstanding safety performance.
Once the said coach press rig completes our exploration test at Leviathan, we will begin development drilling at Tamar. Leviathan is now drilling, and we anticipate seeing results by the end of the year. Again, this is a 16 trillion cubic foot gross prospect with a 50% chance of success. Chuck mentioned that we will bring a second rig to the region early next year. Depending on results from the Leviathan well, I would expect that we will drill between two and four exploration or appraisal wells in the area in 2011 as we continue to test the potential of this under-explored basin. We have recently completed additional 3D seismic acquisition offshore Israel adding another 925 square miles of coverage.
Turning to our total company sales outlook for the fourth quarter, volumes should range between 212,000 to 222,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Combined with strong sales year-to-date, our full year average outlook has increased into the upper half of our previous guidance or 214,000 to 217,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
In the U.S., the fourth quarter will not include any volumes from the 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day divestiture that closed in August. Compared to the third quarter, natural gas sales volumes in Israel will be down due to the seasonality and the North Sea and deepwater Gulf of Mexico volumes will see some decline. We expect our Central DJ Basin volumes will continue to show growth and oil volumes in Equatorial Guinea should be higher as the third quarter was an underlifted period.
Our activity level remains high as we rapidly approach 2011. We will continue to gather more information on the horizontal Niobrara program.  Weâ€™ll prepare for our return to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Internationally, we're focused on keeping both Aseng and Alen moving in West Africa and Tamar in Israel. We should have results from Leviathan by the end of the year. That's a quick look at our key activities. So Holly, I think now we're ready to open it up for questions."

This is -- I think it's safe to say, it's very much an incremental program. But we're still working on the parts of the basin that we'll go into. We're obviously going to be working in all the areas that we outlined and we'll get that finalized. But it will be a substantial program."

Well, the operative word is hope. I hope that we'll see something by the end of the year. And the only reason I say that is as Dave pointed out, we have submitted the applications to resume work on two wells we were drilling at the time of the moratorium, that was Santiago and Deep Blue. So certainly, we would expect that those -- whenever we receive approval, it will be one of those that will likely get early approval. And as I noted, I was hopeful that those and perhaps Gunflint might be early in the queue because we were drilling into known reservoirs, ones that had been penetrated before.  And so in our view, it's more likely that those types of operations might get earlier approval than pure rank exploration. I only say that because some of the experience that other companies had when they were resuming operations in the shallow water that those that were more known and viewed to be, they could be easily looked through when you had known pore pressures and regimes and drilling programs that they be might bubble up as early approvals. When that will happen -- I'm only speculating because that review process started. Again I noted, we do have a positive, these are being permitted on the ENSCO rig that is actually been working during the moratorium. It was very early certified. And so we've got what we believe is a working certified rig, so that part of it we can work through. There's still more things that have to be done. And clearly, our experience in getting the Galapagos completion permits was that they had a lot of work and a lot of iterations to go through. So I would not expect anything to be just a send in and it comes back approved. I would think that there will be some iterations in these drilling permits. So if anything happens, I would say it's going to have very little cost impact on this year. Our view is that all of this will be part of our 2011 plans and weâ€™ve certainly got flexibility to accommodate the schedule, whatever turns out."

Welcome to Noble Energyâ€™s third quarter 2010 earnings call and webcast. On the call today we have Chuck Davidson, Chairman and CEO; Dave Stover, President and COO; and Ken Fisher, CFO.
In a minute, Chuck will review our results for the quarter as well as talk about some of our plans for 2011. Dave will then review our global operations focused on third quarter highlights and our ongoing activity levels.
Today, we plan on leaving plenty of time for Q&A at the end of our prepared remarks and wrap up the call in less than an hour. In an effort to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to ask their questions on the call, we would ask that all the participants limit themselves to one primary question and one follow-up. And should you have any questions that we donâ€™t get to, weâ€™ll be more than happy to respond to those after the call.
We hope everyone has found the earnings release that we issued this morning. Later today, we do expect to be filing our 10-Q with the SEC and we will also have that available on our Web site.
I want to remind everyone that this webcast and conference call contains projections and forward-looking statements based on our current view and most reasonable expectations. We provide no assurances on these statements as a number of factors and uncertainties could cause actual results in future periods to differ materially from what we discuss here today. You should read our full disclosures on forward-looking statements in our latest news release and SEC filings for a discussion of risk factors that influence our business.
Weâ€™ll reference today certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted net income or discretionary cash flow on the call. When we refer to these items, itâ€™s because we believe they are good metrics to use in evaluating the companyâ€™s performance. Be sure to see the reconciliations in our earnings release tables.
With that, Iâ€™m going to turn the call over to Chuck now.

In my opening comments I plan to review our quarterly results and then also walk through some early thoughts for 2011. No question, we had a great third quarter. Record volumes combined with good cost management delivered GAAP net income of $232 million or $1.31 per diluted share.
Adjusted net income was $225 million or $1.27 per diluted share after removing the impact of unrealized commodity derivative gain, also removing the gain on the sale of assets as well as an asset impairment charge.
While the sales numbers are certainly well above expectations, from my perspective it was really the list of key accomplishments regarding our long-term growth agenda that really made the quarter stand out.
Now, these included the sanction of the Tamar project in Israel, significant progress with the horizontal Niobrara play in the DJ Basin and continuing Galapagos in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico despite the moratorium that we had there. These accomplishments are what will really bring great results to our company in the future.
Sales volumes for the third quarter were 230,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Actual production was 2,000 barrels per day above sales to the timing of some international oil liftings. Good product diversification continues to be beneficial for us as we had 38% of our sales being global liquids, 33% international gas and remaining 29% was U.S. gas.
Versus the second quarter this year, our international gas percentage was up 4 points, primarily driven by continued market growth and strong seasonal demand we experienced in Israel, which led to record sales volumes there.
Liquid volumes in the U.S. averaged 54,000 barrels per day in the third quarter, up over 2,000 per day from the second quarter. Oil volumes in the Central DJ Basin and deepwater Gulf of Mexico were up a combined 5,000 barrels per day, partially offset by nearly a 3,000 barrel a day reduction which was due to our onshore asset sale that closed during the quarter.
Our DJ Basin volumes continued to reflect growth from both the vertical and the horizontal development programs. Deepwater was higher as some of our volumes were restricted in the second quarter.
We also had increased North Sea volumes, primarily from Dumbarton and Lochranza. In Equatorial Guinea, our liquid volumes were down sequentially due to the timing of liftings during the quarter.
On U.S. natural gas, our volumes declined from the second quarter, primarily resulting from reallocating capital away from dry gas drilling which of course we began some time ago. Even in Wattenberg our gas production has declined as we focused on growing liquids in the field, and weâ€™ll continue with the same domestic natural gas strategy until the U.S. market is ready for more supply.
Overall, our U.S. volumes were flat with the second quarter and again, keeping in mind that we lost 3,000 barrels a day due to the divestiture. International was up 11,000 barrels a day equivalent for the quarter, thatâ€™s an 11% increase over the second quarter.
Commodity price realizations were relatively consistent from second quarter to third quarter. Our crude oil average for the quarter was strong at over $73 per barrel and U.S. gas prices were basically flat at 387 per Mcf. In Israel, prices were down a little bit due to the changing blend between the old and new gas price vintages at Mary B.
Looking at costs, the trend from the third quarter was very good with lease operating expense down 10% on a per barrel basis and transportation and DD&A generally flat.
Our exploration activity for the third quarter was relatively quiet and G&A was as expected. The effective tax rate and deferred portion on an adjusted basis were lower than we originally anticipated. This resulted from the application of some excess foreign tax credits that weâ€™re able to apply to our foreign U.S. branch assets.
The adjustment items to net income for the third quarter include a small gain on the commodity mark-to-market as well as a $114 million pre-tax gain from the sale of the assets in the Mid-Continent and Illinois basin, again which closed during third quarter. We also removed the impact of asset impairments, primarily the result of further declines from the natural gas price curve.
Finally, we wrote down the value of our New Albany shale assets which we discounted development activity quite some time ago.
Our balance sheet continues to be very strong. At the end of the quarter, we had over $1.1 billion in cash with $1.75 billion undrawn on our credit facility providing us ample flexibility to reinvest in our major projects in the coming months.
Our total liquidity is right at $2.9 billion. Debt-to-book capitalization dropped to 25% and when you net it of cash, itâ€™s just 13% which is six points below what it was just a quarter ago. Our capital spending for the year still looks to be around $2 billion.
Switching gears, I thought Iâ€™d spend a few minutes on how we are thinking on things as we approach 2011. First, for our onshore U.S. program, weâ€™ve recently added the Central DJ Basin program to a growing list of major projects and Dave will be discussing the program in greater detail later on the call.
We view the horizontal Niobrara program in four distinct parts. First off is the core Wattenberg where a substantial amount of vertical development have taken place over the years and weâ€™re now identifying locations for additional horizontal wells. The horizontal potential in the Wattenberg core was highlighted earlier this year by our Gemini well success and we expect to drill more Gemini type wells by the end of the year.
The second area is on the Northern and Eastern edges of Wattenberg where weâ€™re focusing on expanding the economic limits of the field. A large portion of our horizontal drilling to-date has been in this area and weâ€™ve been encouraged by flow rates with liquid contributions north of 70%.
Third is our position in Northern Colorado from the edges of Wattenberg basically up to the Wyoming border and the fourth area is our acreage in Southeaster Wyoming and Northwest, Weld County, Colorado. Overall, we should be adding two horizontal rigs to the DJ Basin next year and we expect to drill more than double the number of horizontal wells in 2011 than we will drill this year.
Moving offshore, despite the Gulf moratorium being formally lifted, we still face considerable uncertainty there. However, Iâ€™m becoming more confident that drilling will resume reasonably soon perhaps by year, but almost certainly at a slower pace than pre-moratorium.
Weâ€™re certainly pleased that the completion work at Galapagos has moved forward and it will truly be an advantage to us that we already have a working certified rig as we prepare to resume drilling.
Itâ€™s our hope that drilling prospects such as Santiago, which is part of Galapagos, the Deep Blue sidetrack and appraisal of our large Gunflint discovery, all of which are targeting known reservoirs will be early candidates for approval.
In the Eastern Med, we sanctioned Tamar in the third quarter and its full speed ahead there. Weâ€™ve now ordered the platform fabrication and installation contracts, as well as the umbilical and subsea installation in all major subsea equipment is ordered. The rig will commence field developments in the first quarter of next year, following exploration results of Leviathan which initiated drilling about a week and a half ago.
Our second rig will come into the area early next year to provide further the support to our exploration and appraisal but weâ€™ll have two rigs working in the eastern Mediterranean for at least a good portion of 2011. Next year will certainly be very active for us.
Overall, our goals are to keep our major project developments on schedule, expand the horizontal Niobrara program and resume deepwater Gulf of Mexico drilling activity.
On top of that, weâ€™re focused on leveraging our prior success in exploring offshore West Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, and of course supporting these objectives is maintaining a strong balance sheet, which we have.
Weâ€™ll be finalizing our capital budget over the next few months, but I would expect that it will be consistent with what we laid out in our June Analyst Meeting.
The Mid-continent and Illinois basin production that we saw partway through this year which totals approximately 6,000 barrels a day equivalent will obviously impact 2011 volumes. But even so, we expect volume growth next year which will likely be in the low single-digits on a percentage basis.
Of course, our growth will rapidly accelerate as the major projects start up. So, as we move closer to 2012, we should see the beginning of a significant step-up in both production and cash flow as well as an accelerating growth rate led by our strong base programs and the impact of our major project developments.
So thatâ€™s just a quick glimpse of what we see for 2011. So, with that, Iâ€™ll turn the call over to you Dave.

Starting in the U.S., I plan to focus on our activity levels, recent results and where our programs are headed the remainder of this year and into next year. It was another great quarter for our onshore business led by the Central DJ basin.
With a strong liquids focus, weâ€™ve been able to grow our net crude oil production in the basin by over 2,500 barrels per day compared to the second quarter average of this year. Total liquid production in this area averaged over 30,000 barrels a day in the third quarter and our liquid percent has grown to 54% of total basin production. Actual crude oil and condensate made up 21,000 barrels per day in the third quarter.
We are operating six vertical rigs at Wattenberg and our Niobrara horizontal rig count has grow to three, with two rigs currently in Wattenberg and one on our Southeastern Wyoming acreage. Our net acreage in the basin is now over 830,000, an increase of 80,000 acres since June with the majority of the additions coming from areas outside of Wattenberg.
So far this year, we have drilled 15 wells in Wattenberg, two in core and 13 tests in the northern and eastern edges of the field. Recent horizontal well results in Wattenberg continue to be encouraging with the last 11wells having initial 24 hour rates between 550 and 850 barrels of oil equivalent per day with high oil content.
Some of the wells drilled on the edges of the field have been in areas we would consider marginally economic for vertical well development making areas that previously didnâ€™t work now by viable with current technology.
As we continue to obtain more production history, estimated ultimate recoveries are tracking on average with our 290,000 barrel of oil equivalents scenario. In total, we have 15 horizontal wells on production in Wattenberg including the three wells that were drilled in 2009.
Our teams continue to improve drill times highlighted by recent wells with a spud to TD in less than 15 days. On the completion side, while lateral lengths range from 3,300 to 5,100 feet, the number of frac stages per well has increased to 18 to 20 stages.
We recently moved one of the horizontal rigs back into the core area of Wattenberg, a few miles from our Gemini well where we will be further testing recovery in the more vertically developed portion of the field.
Gemini has now produced over 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent in just seven months and is still producing over 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day with liquids representing 30% to 40% of the volume.
We also recently finished the horizontal Codell well and are drilling a second, targeting both the Codell and the Niobrara zones. But we are still testing and evaluating different completion scenarios in this early stages of the play.
In our third focus are, Northern Colorado, we have drilled and completed four wells around the Grover area. The first two wells weâ€™re targeting quiet areas identified on the 3D where we are testing metrics contribution. Despite the lack of natural fractures, initial 24-hour rates were 500 to 600 barrels of oil equivalent per day with around 85% oil contribution.
These wells have been on production less than 60 days and we are working to determine the optimum production lift system as there is less reservoir energy in this area north of Wattenberg.
Our third and fourth wells were a few miles to the east in an area with more natural fractures. They were recently completed and are cleaning up after stimulation.
In the fourth area of focus in Southeast Wyoming, we are now drilling our second of three wells, combining 3D seismic data with core and log information gained from vertical monitoring wells, all of which will help in evaluating this portion of the play. The first horizontal well was fracture-stimulated this week.
In total, weâ€™re still planning to have about 30 horizontal Niobrara wells drilled in the Basin this year; around 21 in Wattenberg, about six in Northern Colorado and three in Southeast Wyoming.
Based on our results today and encouragement about the play, we currently plan to add a fourth horizontal rig in the second quarter next year and a fifth in the third quarter. As Chuck mentioned, our plan is to have us doubling our horizontal Niobrara drilling activity next year. We will also continue acquiring 3D seismic adding another 1,000 square miles to the 300 we expect to have by the end of this year.
In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Ensco 8501 rig has completed Santa Cruz and will complete work at Isabela in the next few days, finishing almost all of the Galapagos project that we operate. BP is working on the subsea gathering system and tie-in as well as the topsides at Na Kika.
The latest schedule as the lay barge coming in around the 1st of April next year with initial production in the second half of the year. We are still expecting in the range of 8,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net when it comes online.
At our Raton South Oil project, we have recently approved the plan of development which is targeting the addition of 3,000 to 4,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day net by the end of 2011. The well was drilled and completed in 2008 and weâ€™re finalizing the production handling agreement.
Following the lifting of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico moratorium, we have submitted permit applications to resume drilling operations at Santiago and the Deep Blue sidetrack. We plan to submit a permit for the Gunflint appraisal well shortly.
Turning to our international program, at the Aseng Oil Project in Equatorial Guinea, our two rigs have finished drilling operations and are now performing oil completions.
As a reminder, Aseng is being developed with five horizontal producers, three water injectors and two gas injectors. We are pleased with the results from the drilling program coming in under budget and with oil and plays numbers increasing slightly. We have landed all 10 of the subsea trees and everything is moving forward as expected including the FPSO conversion.
Start-up is still planned for mid 2012 with 17,000 barrels of oil per day net. At Alen all feed and early design work has been completed and we expect to have project sanctioned in the next couple of months.
Weâ€™ve awarded contracts for the platform, subsea trees and installation of pipelines and the filed startup is expected by the end of 2013. Between Aseng and Alen, we should see an increase of more than 30,000 barrels of liquids per day net by the end of 2013.
As we process new 3D data from Cameroon and reprocess our Equatorial Guinea 3D, we are prioritizing our exploration plans for next year Douala Basin. The 2011 targets will be additional oil opportunities in the range of 100 million barrels gross or greater, mostly in the Miocene or perhaps even slightly deeper. Overall, we believe we will have between two and four exploration wells in this basin next year.
In the North Sea, we received temporary relief related to the vent stack issue on the Dumbarton FPSO. As a result, total North Sea volumes were up 45% from the second quarter, reflecting improved sales from Dumbarton and Lochranza. There is some compression system maintenance ongoing at Dumbarton and that will restrict our rates just a bit in the fourth quarter.
In Israel, we competed the second of the two new development wells at Mary B in mid September. Strong natural gas demand has allowed us to test the productivity of our new wells, one of which flowed as much as 255 million cubic feet a day with the completion similar to what weâ€™re finding at Tamar.
The addition of these two wells, along with compression in the first half of 2011, allows us to maintain full field deliverability of 600 million cubic feet a day growth until Tamar comes online.
Overall, it was a quarter of exceptional operational performance in Israel meeting record gas demand reliably, bringing two new wells online and continuing our outstanding safety performance.
Once the Sedco Express rig completes her exploration test at Leviathan, we will begin development drilling at Tamar. Leviathan is now drilling and we anticipate seeing results by the end of the year. Again, this is a 16 trillion cubic feet growth prospect with a 50% chance of success.
Chuck mentioned that we will bring a second rig to the region early next year. Depending on results from the Leviathan well, I would expect that we will drill between two and four exploration or appraisal wells in the area in 2011, as we continue to test the potential of this underexplored Basin. We have recently completed additional 3D seismic acquisition offshore Israel adding another 925 square miles of coverage.
Turning to our total company sales outlook for the fourth quarter, volumes should range between 212,000 to 222,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Combined with strong sales year-to-date, our full year average outlook has increased under upper half of our previous guidance or 214,000 to 217,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In the U.S., the fourth quarter will not include any volumes from the 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day divestiture that closed in August. Compared to the third quarter, natural gas sales volumes in Israel would be down due to the seasonality and the North Sea and deepwater Gulf of Mexico volumes will see some decline.
We expect our central DJ Basin volumes will continue to show growth and oil volumes in Equatorial Guinea should be higher as the third quarter was an under-lifted period.
Our activity level remains high as we rapidly approach 2011. We will continue to gather more information on the horizontal Niobrara program; weâ€™ll prepare for a return to drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. Internationally, we are focused on keeping both Aseng and Alen moving in West Africa and Tamar in Israel. We should have results from Leviathan by the end of the year. Thatâ€™s a quick look at our key activities.
So, Allie, I think now weâ€™re ready to open it up for questions.

So we just got to give them some time to produce, but weâ€™re encouraged with what weâ€™ve seen so far and as we mentioned weâ€™re stepping out now and going to test some areas that look like it has a little more faulting expectation and one more fracturing and weâ€™re just starting to clean those wells up and weâ€™ll have a chance to compare those over the next couple of months.

We expect to maintain a very strong legacy program in Wattenberg. So, weâ€™re not robbing that. This is I think itâ€™s safe to say is very much an incremental program, but weâ€™re still working on the parts of the basin that we will go into, weâ€™re obviously going to be working in all the areas that we outlined and weâ€™ll get that finalized. But it will be a substantial program.

That was Santiago and Deep Blue. So, certainly we would expect that those whenever we receive approval, it will be one of those that will likely get early approval.
And as I noted, I was hopeful that those and perhaps Gunflint might be earlier in the queue because we were drilling into known reservoirs, ones that had been penetrated before. So, in our view, itâ€™s more likely that those types of operations might get earlier approval than fewer rank exploration. I only say that because some of the experience of other companies had when they were resuming operations in the shallow water that those that were more known and they could be easily looked through and you had known for pressures and regimes and drilling programs that they might bubble up as early approvals. When that will happen, I am only speculating because that review process started.
Again, we noted, we do have a positive. These are being permitted on the ENSCO rig that is actually been working during the moratorium. It was very early certified and so weâ€™ve got it what we believe is a working certified rig. So that part of it we can work through. Thereâ€™s still more things that have to be done and clearly our experience in getting the Galapagos completion permits was that they had a lot of work and a lot of iteration to go through.
So I would not expect anything to be just ascended in and it comes back approved. I would think that there will be some iterations in these drilling permits. So if anything happens, I would say itâ€™s going to have a very little cost impact on this year. Our view is that all of this will be part of our 2011 plans and weâ€™ve certainly got flexibility to accommodate the schedule whatever it turns out.
