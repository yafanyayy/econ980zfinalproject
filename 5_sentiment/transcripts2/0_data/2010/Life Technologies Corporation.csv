I hope you've had a chance to review the press release we put out this morning.
During today's call, I will cover our achievements for the year and our recent product announcements and our outlook for 2010. Mark Stevenson will talk about our integration progress over the past year and also provide some color on divisional performance. Finally, David will then cover more specifics on our financials for the quarter and the year as well as provide additional details on our view for 2010.
We had a terrific fourth quarter with 11% organic growth, which rounded out a strong year for Life Technologies. 2009 was our first full year after the Applied Biosystems and Invitrogen merger, and our teams around the world performed in an exceptional manner.
We ended the year with 7% organic growth, 300 basis points of operating margin expansion and $534 million in free cash flow. This performance was the result of a lot of hard work and executing on our three strategic imperatives; delivering on the integration, realizing the potential of the new company and investing for future growth.
Our first strategic imperative, delivering on the integration, is critical to our success. We methodically executed upon our integration plans, which enabled us to deliver over 100 million in synergies, considerably higher than our original expectations. In addition to the sizable synergies realized, we were able to merge the two companies into truly one company with a solid foundation of processes and systems.
We still have integrations in place to realize more synergies, but in 2009 we were able to complete all the basic actions necessary to operate as one company. In terms of synergy capture in 2010, by the end of this year we'll have taken actions for both revenue acceleration and cost reductions that will generate 175 million in synergies on an annual basis in 2011, one full year ahead of the original three-year integration schedule.
Beyond the accelerated integration efforts, 2009 was a strong year on a number of measures including organic growth, new product launches and productivity gains. As we announced yesterday, our development efforts last year set us up for an impressive line of new sequencing products to be launched in the next several months, which I'll speak about in a moment.
As you know, next-generation sequencing represents less than 5% of our revenues, and as such we also had numerous new products launched in other areas of our business, the most notable of which is our new flow cytometer, Attune. This product launched in December at the American Society of Cell Biology Conference to outstanding reviews from customers and industry experts alike.
Attune will begin shipping at the beginning of the second quarter and we already have customers lined up. The launch of this product represents our entry into the $1.4 billion flow cytometry market. In the next five years, we anticipate sales will exceed $100 million from our flow cytometry products.
In addition to the new instruments introduced this year, 2009 was another year of rapid releases for new reagent products and benchtop devices, and 2010 is shaping up to be even better.
I want to now take a moment to talk about our sequencing business and a number of new and very exciting products we'll be launching this year. You'll hear more about some of these products in February at the annual AGBT meeting, but today let me focus on the press release we issued yesterday.
As we announced, we are launching our new SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencing system this quarter, a system that we believe will deliver the highest quality genome on the market. It's important to understand that as sequencing becomes more of a clinical tool, meaning that as doctors begin to look at a person's genomic data as a basis for diagnosing and treating disease, it's critical that this data be as accurate as possible.
When you're talking about three billion base pairs, an error rate of even 1% will add up to 30 million mistakes. That's just not good enough when it comes to making decisions that affect peoples' health. That's why we're so excited about SOLiD 4. It will generate up to 100 gigabases of mappable sequence data per run, but more importantly it will deliver unparalleled accuracy.
In fact, by the second half of this year when the SOLiD 4hq package, an upgrade to SOLiD 4, will be available, researchers will be able to generate 300 gigabases of mappable data at 99.99% accuracy. Four nines. This is a remarkable achievement, and given that the system will lower the cost of sequencing a genome to about $3,000 later this year, we now have an instrument that delivers such accuracy and cost as to truly replace array-based technology.
We have already gotten tremendously positive feedback from our customers about what SOLiD 4 will help them achieve. Of course, one collaboration involving the SOLiD 4 System that we're particularly excited about is the one we announced this morning with the Ignite Institute for Individualized Health. As we announced in our release this morning, Ignite will acquire 100 SOLiD 4 Systems, creating the largest next-generation genome sequencing facility in North America.
Ignite is a unique organization, one that is focused on integrating R&D, commercialization and clinical care to create medical solutions fit for the 21st century, solutions based on personalized medicine. We're proud that Life Technologies will partner with such an innovative organization that is truly focused on translational research. As I said earlier, we're now at a stage where we need to look beyond the technological innovations to how the application of these technologies can be used to improve human health.
As sequencing becomes more rapid, accurate and cost effective, we also need to devote attention and resources to other factors. That's why we also announced yesterday that we will dedicate approximately $100 million over the next few years to solve the major challenges related to interpreting and understanding the data generated by sequencing. Our foundation will dedicate $5 million over the next two years to educating physicians on how to use this data to truly help their patients. I'm proud that Life Technologies has the drive and the capability to not just create the best sequencing technologies, but help the community use those technologies to make a difference in ways that really affect peoples' lives.
The use of life science tools and technologies in medical applications is already happening today, of course, specifically in molecular diagnostics, which is a $3 billion market growing at 15% annually. In 2009, we had over 300 million of sales related to molecular diagnostics, so we're already having a strong presence in this high growth market.
Our product offerings in this fast growing business range from reagents and OEM components to products that are cleared for diagnostic use in the U.S. and Europe. To further our participation in the molecular diagnostics arena, we will make investments in developing diagnostic content for our 7500 Fast Dx RT PCR instrument and our 3500 Dx capillary electrophoresis systems, as well as create new tools and components for research in this field.
In addition, we recently announced the acquisition of AcroMetrix, a provider of diagnostic quality control products. This acquisition allows us to further expand our diagnostic capabilities and also expand our direct channel to molecular diagnostics clients. The focus and investment we're putting on moving sequencing technologies into the clinic and making ever more molecular diagnostic tools that will fuel our revenue growth in the long term.
Now for our 2010 expectations. We expect that organic revenue growth will grow in the mid to high single digits. Including the impact of the previously announced mass spectrometry divestiture, earnings per share will grow 10 to 15%. I'll let David get more into the specifics about our expectations, but clearly we are anticipating another solid year of financial performance and value creation for our shareholders.
Beyond 2010, our outlook is equally compelling, with even more new products on the horizon and investments in markets such as food testing, molecular diagnostics and biofuels research adding to our growth rates. In the meanwhile, each and every day we remain focused on execution.
Since 2006, after we transformed the operating rhythm of the organization, we set out to be a company that could prioritize better than any and reliably complete those basic but essential tasks that make up great performance. Our results speak for themselves. Since that time, our earnings per share have grown from $1.46 per share to $3.04 per share 2009, in spite of the worst economic downturn in 60 years and a very large transformative acquisition. In 2010, we will continue to deliver this reliable performance.
I'll now hand it over to Mark Stevenson, who will provide some color on the integration and each of the divisions.

As Greg mentioned, one of our strategic imperatives is delivering on the integration. Now that Life Technologies has been operating for one full year as a combined company, I thought it fitting to make a few comments on the integration and the incredible company that is being created in the process.
Over the last year, we have worked diligently to extract the best attributes from both companies and create really a unique business with substantial scale and scope. The integration team made significant progress in 2009. However, there is still a lot of hard work to be done, and we remain focused on executing our integration plans.
With that said, I'll tell you a little bit about the progress we have made so far. Life Technologies has retained an incredibly talented workforce. Our sales teams were recently ranked number one by our customers in both instruments and reagents. Our extensive service and support teams are focused on providing the highest service level to our customers.
Our R&D teams manage the most comprehensive offering of technologies available, and in 2009 Life Technologies launched over 1,000 new product SKUs, and we will accelerate that pace in 2010 and beyond. We are making significant investments in research and development, so that we will remain on the cutting edge of science and technology. By doing this, we can not only meet the evolving needs of our customers, but actually accelerate scientific advancement by bringing relevant and innovative technologies to market.
The scope of Life Technologies is broader than either company could have achieved on a stand-alone basis. As a combined company, we serve over 160 countries around the world, we process 11,000 orders a day and distribute more than 8,000 shipments every single day. Our geographic presence and large volume of orders allows us to drive down the costs and become ever more efficient in our operations. The combination of Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems' strengths is really proving out to be a true competitive advantage that will sustain us into the future.
With that said, I'll move on to provide some specifics on the divisional performance. In the fourth quarter, Molecular Biology Systems grew approximately 15% organically to 422 million in revenue. The majority of H1N1-related products reside within this group and accounted for approximately four points of growth for the division. While we continue to partner with the CDC and other global health organizations to ensure H1N1 public health monitoring, we expect minimal revenue from H1N1-related products in 2010.
Organic growth was also positively impacted by the continued strength in the TaqMan arrays business, in addition to strong demand for qPCR instrumentation and reagents. Additionally, we saw an uptake in the sale of PCR instruments and consumables, a direct result of stimulus funding. For the year, Molecular Biology Systems grew 9% organically to 1.58 billion. Double-digit growth in the genomic assays and high single digit growth in PCR systems was offset by the expected decline in PCR royalties.
Cell Systems had revenues of 211 million in the quarter or 4% organic growth. Strong growth in many of the business areas, such as our magnetic beads and stem cell technologies, was slightly offset by a year-over-year decline in our Bioproduction business. The decline in Bioproduction this year can be mostly attributed to customer-specific issues. We expect that this business will return to a more robust growth in 2010. Total year revenue for Cell Systems was 789 million or 4% organic growth.
Genetic Systems had revenue of 234 million in the quarter, representing 13% organic growth. For the full year, Genetic Systems had revenue of 907 million or 9% organic growth, after accounting for the LIMS divestiture. Revenue for CE systems and consumables sold into the research market was flat in the fourth quarter and for the full year.
This result performance is of particular note since we expected the market would decline in the high single to low double digits as genome centers decommission CE systems in favor of next-generation sequencing systems. We now believe that the decommissioning process is largely complete, and going forward we expect this business to be relatively stable. CE systems and kits sold into applied markets, such as forensics and environmental testing, grew double digits in the quarter, and we expect that this business will continue to grow at a similar rate in the coming year.
Finally, next-generation sequencing continues to gain traction in the market with strong double digit growth in the quarter. We expect that the full suite of next-generation sequencing platforms that Greg spoke about earlier will continue to drive strong growth in the years to come.
Finally, in our Mass Spectrometry division, our joint venture with MDS, revenue growth 7% organically to 130 million. All geographies contributed to growth year-over-year, with Japan growing in the double digits. On a full year basis, this division declined 1%, in line with our expectation of flat to down 10% for the year.
As you are aware, we are in the process of selling our stake in this business to Danaher Corporation. We are in the final stages of this process and now expect the transaction to close shortly.
Now I will turn it over to David Hoffmeister for a full description of the 2009 results and our outlook for 2010.

I'll now take you through the financial details of the fourth quarter and the full year 2009 results.
This quarter, revenue grew 14% to $874 million. Excluding the impact from currency and divestitures, revenue grew 11% organically. This was a strong quarter for organic growth with good performance across all our businesses and geographies.
For the full year, revenue grew 5% to 3.3 billion. Excluding the impact from currency and divestitures, revenue grew 7% organically. We're very pleased with these results, especially in the face of a large integration and a tough economic environment.
Let me briefly highlight a couple of items that we have mentioned in the past that contributed to growth again this quarter. Demand for our H1N1-related products was approximately 15 million for the quarter, resulting in full year revenues of about 45 million. Also, an order in the Japanese police force outfitting them with our 3130xl CE sequencer and sample preparation kits, totaling 20 million for the year, contributed nine million in the quarter. These are two good examples of how the broader capabilities of Life Technologies better position us to capitalize on these types of opportunities as they arise.
In terms of organic growth by region, excluding the mass spec division the Americas grew 9% in the fourth quarter, Europe grew 11%, Asia Pacific 23% and Japan 9%. Currency this quarter contributed approximately 4% to revenue growth, net of our hedging program. The positive impact to EPS was approximately $0.06 of earnings per share, including foreign currency impacts accounted for in revenue, other income and the mass spec joint venture.
On a full year basis, currency decreased revenue growth by approximately 2%, net of our hedging program. This impacted EPS negatively by approximately $0.19. The divestiture of the LIMS business had a negative one point effect on reported revenue growth in the fourth quarter and half a point impact on the full year.
Moving on to other items, fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 65%, an increase of approximately 130 basis points over prior year. Positive price realization across the portfolio, positive currency impact, synergies and lower royalty expense all contributed to the gross margin improvements, offset slightly by the negative impact of lower royalty revenue.
On a sequential basis, gross margins declined as expected by 200 basis points as a result of lower price, a higher mix of instruments and OEM orders and the recognition of higher manufacturing expenses as we drew down inventory at year-end. As a reminder, gross margins in the fourth quarter are typically lower for these reasons.
For the full year, gross margins equaled 66.3%, an improvement of 70 basis points over prior year. Positive price, lower royalty expense and synergies from the merger drove the increase, which was partially offset by the negative impact of lower royalty revenue and currencies.
As expected, fourth quarter operating expenses of 342 million were higher than the previous quarter and the prior year. The increase resulted from investments in the commercial organization, in marketing programs aimed at capturing the stimulus and other opportunities, R&D programs for benchtop instrumentation and sequencing and depreciation as investments ramped up over the year. In addition, we entered into several collaborative R&D partnerships in the quarter.
Total operating expenses for 2009 equaled 1.3 billion, a $7 million decline year-over-year. Fourth quarter operating income was 226 million, an increase of 30% over prior year, including the impact of currency and 19% excluding currency. Our operating margin was 25.8%, representing the 300 basis points of improvement year-over-year including the impact from currency. This operating margin expansion primarily resulted from higher gross margin and decreases in head count-related expenses as a result of the merger. As expected, operating margins declined on a sequential basis due to lower gross margins.
For the full year, operating income equaled 879 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year including the impact of currency and 22% excluding currency. Operating margin expanded 300 basis points for the full year to 26.6% including the impact of currency, and 27% excluding currency. Full year operating margin expansion was a result of improved gross margins and decreased head count expenses due to synergies, partially offset by increases in depreciation and purchased services.
In terms of other income line items in the quarter, we had two million of interest income and approximately 16 million of income from our mass spec joint venture. Other income for the full year consisted of five million of interest income and 46 million of income from mass spec. Interest expense for the quarter was 36 million and 150 million for the full year.
Our non-GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 26.2%, resulting in a full year tax rate of 28.5%. The tax rate in the fourth quarter was lower than in previous quarters due to higher income in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Specifically, we had increased sales of instruments manufactured in Singapore where we have a significantly lower tax rate.
Our diluted share count for the quarter was 187.3 million shares and 181.4 million for the full year. As you'll recall, our share count is impacted by our stock price due to our convertible debt and employee stock options.
GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.26, which includes $0.29 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.04 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB14-1 and $0.19 per share of business integration costs and other items, and $0.02 per share of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs resulting from the early repayment of term loans. On a non-GAAP basis which excludes these items, diluted earnings per were $0.80 for the quarter.
For the full year, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.80, which includes $1.43 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.17 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with APB14-1, $0.59 per share of business integration costs and other items; and $0.05 per share of accelerated amortization of debt issuance cost. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the year were $3.04.
As a reminder, there is a full reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's press release and on our website.
Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, our ending cash and short-term investments were 648 million, including approximately 41 million held as restricted cash. For the quarter, cash from operating activities was 264 million, capital expenditures were 77 million and free cash flow was $187 million, resulting in full year free cash flow of $534 million.
We repaid 150 million of term loan B during the fourth quarter and 425 million of term loans A and B for the full year. We ended the year with approximately 3.1 million of debt. The balance is made up of our convertible debt of 1.1 billion, in addition to term loans of two billion. As a reminder, 350 million of convertible debt is classified as short term with a put call date of August 1 of this year.
I'll now move on to our outlook for 2010. Before I get started, you should note that all guidance I'm providing today assumes we close the mass spec divestiture in the next few days.
As Greg mentioned earlier, we expect to grow revenue organically in the mid to high single digits. Due to the high volatility of currency rates in 2009, we are providing a range for the possible impact on revenue from currency in 2010. The effect on revenue is expected to be in the range of one to two points of additional growth, including the impact of our hedging program. The low end of the range is calculated using the 2009 average rates and the high end is calculated using year-end rates. For modeling purposes, you can choose the rates that you feel are most appropriate.
Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.50. We expect free cash flow to be in the range of 575 to 600 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be 150 to 175 million, including approximately 30 million of integration-related capital.
Our free cash flow forecast also includes approximately 100 million of one-time expenses related to the integration. These costs will be excluded from pro forma earnings, but they're nonetheless cash, so they will lower free cash flow in 2010.
Additional items impacting free cash flow during 2010 include the full-year impact of cash bonuses paid to Applied Biosystems employees versus 2009 when bonuses covered only half the year, and cash impact from the divestiture of the mass spec business. It's important to note that as in the past our free cash flow will be back end loaded in the year due to normal working capital fluctuations throughout the year and the payout of annual bonuses in the first quarter.
A few other items related to our expectations in the coming year include the following. We've included the impact from the stimulus in our forecast. As we've stated in the past, we expect to receive in excess of $100 million in revenue over the life of the program. The exact size and timing of this is difficult to predict since the funds are just beginning to flow.
In the last half of 2009, we had approximately 50 million of revenue as a result of stimulus funding and we expect stimulus-related revenues to slowly ramp up in the first half of the year with the majority of the benefit realized in the latter half of 2010 and into 2011.
As these benefits materialize in 2010, we plan to take the opportunity to reinvest approximately half of the operating profit impact back into the core business to drive future organic growth. We will focus the investment in several areas, including sequencing technologies, which Greg mentioned earlier and accelerating the expansion of our commercial organization in some of our faster growing markets such as China.
Synergy savings for 2009 were 95 million, and we exited the year at a run rate of over 100 million on an annual basis. In 2010, we will put actions in place to achieve additional 70 million in synergy savings on an annual basis. You can expect that the annualized run rate exiting 2010 will be $175 million.
Royalty revenue is no longer expected to decline in 2010. Due to the efforts of our licensing team, the previously announced decline of 10 to 15 million has been offset with revenue from new license agreements. At this point, we still expect royalties to decline by 20 million in 2011.
We expect operating margins to expand between 100 and 125 basis points. This improvement will largely result from capturing additional synergies.
The pro forma tax rate will be approximately 29.0 to 29.5% depending on the geographical mix of income throughout the year. Interest income will fluctuate depending on our cash balance. Our average interest rate on investments is approximately 50 to 60 basis points.
Interest expense is expected to be in the range of 120 to $130 million, depending on the timing of debt repayment and interest rate fluctuations. Inclusive in this number are any changes in capital structure which may come as a result of the waiver we filed yesterday. The waiver seeks agreement from our current lenders to permit the issuance of debt securities, the proceeds of which would be used to repay the term loans. The waiver is effective for up to six months.
Also included in interest expense guidance is the expectation that we would make the following debt repayments during 2010 to reach our target leverage ratio of 2.0 to 2.5 times EBITDA. We anticipate making 140 million of mandatory debt repayments on the term loans and approximately 290 million utilizing the proceeds from the mass spec divestiture.
Our diluted share count is approximately 190 million at today's stock price, but it will increase if our stock price increases due to dilution from our convertible debt, as well as stock options. Assuming an average share price between 52 and $55, the share count would range between 192 and 194 million shares.
Finally, here are a couple of other variables that may further help in modeling the business. First, you can assume that every point of organic growth contributes about $0.07 of earnings per share and every 10 million in operating expenses equals $0.03 per share. Second, in order to help estimate the effect of currency, we've calculated the impact on earnings per share if all currencies moved against the dollar by 5% and our mix of foreign currencies stayed the same. In this scenario, the impact on earnings per share would be $0.10.
With that, I'll hand the call back over to Eileen so we can answer any questions that you may have. Eileen?

In our current discussions, at least we have heard, is that the NIH will probably get another increase in fiscal year 2011. We don't think it will be held flat, but obviously it's subject to a lot of negotiation yet to be had. We're actually encouraged that the NIH in this current environment of potentially flat discretionary spending will actually be one of the budgets that does get an increase.

So we've really been going to them, explaining the roadmap and how we've accelerated that. So they're very excited about that and particularly on the accuracy. They're beginning to see the difference it makes in the results to really ensure that they're not getting any false positives in that. So very positive response as we've gone to those customers and we upgrade and outlaid the path for the year.

You can expect that pace of innovation to continue coming out of the company. As Mark was mentioning, one of the primary motives for bringing these two companies together was to drive the scale around R&D, to really create ever more innovation in life sciences. You're seeing the very early stages of that.
In terms of the overall spend on R&D, we hover around 10, 10.5%. As we accelerate our organic growth, we think the R&D spend will stay in and around that percentage. Now we're dealing with some very large numbers, and numbers that are far larger than our competitors that allow us to have this scale of innovation that we hope will be unmatched.

As far as costs go, we're going to continue to get synergies from purchasing. We identified earlier plant consolidations, other manufacturing opportunities. We expect to get those, as well as some consolidations and efficiencies in distribution.

I mean just the tremendous progress that has been made in the short run technologies as they got longer both in comparative sequencing and de novo sequencing, that switch has already occurred. So the decommissioning that we're seeing and the transfer out of those experiments has actually occurred already.
What we see in the research market is where people want to do a single experiment and perhaps look at a part of a genome and just do one run, instruments like the 3500 that we introduced that run into smaller labs, into smaller clinics is a very cost efficient way to run that out, to validate that sequence and then translate that into a clinical setting. So that's where we're seeing research applications and good pickup continue in that CE market and continuing to run CE instruments in that space. So that's why we feel comfortable about, as we've seen this year, the stabilization of that business. We're aware obviously of the long run technologies. Again, we'll talk about our single molecule technology coming in at the AGBT conference. We see a good place for that in the market, but it's complementary to other next-generation sequencing tools.

I hope you’ve had a chance to review the press release we put out this afternoon. As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth and we are plea",1442,"Thanks, Eileen, and thanks to all of you for joining us. I hope you’ve had a chance to review the press release we put out this afternoon. As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth and we are pleased with how we have started 2010.
Revenue grew 10% organically to $887 million, a result of terrific growth in both instruments and consumables. Operating margins expanded by 330 basis points to hit a record 29.5%. And earnings per share grew 21% to $0.87 for the quarter. This quarter marks the 14th quarter in a row that this Company has met or exceeded its financial targets on both the top and the bottom line. This milestone demonstrates how seriously we take our commitments to our shareholders. Our teams around the world have proven that they know how to put their heads down and get the work done, driving above market revenue growth with a relentless focus on execution.
As I do every quarter, I will take a few moments now to talk about these results in the context of our strategic imperatives delivering on the integration, realizing the potential of this new Company, and investing for the future. First, we made significant progress on our integration goals for the year. The sales force reorganization is complete and our reps are hitting the street with a singular purpose of adding value for our customers. Our ultimate goal is to become their partner of choice by providing unparalled customer service, and offering an expansive portfolio of innovative products that simplify and streamline entire workflows.
In addition, we announced the closure of two manufacturing site in Camarillo, California, and Bromborough, UK. The work to consolidate these operations into our facilities in Frederick, Maryland and Warrington in the UK is well underway and going successfully. These initiatives, as well as many others will generate an additional $20 million in annualized synergies. This brings us one step closer to our goal of putting action plans in place that will generate an additional $70 million in annualized savings by the end of this year.
Our diligence [ph] approach to the integration has not only paid off from a near term synergy perspective, but has set us up for success in other important ways. In particular, we’ve made great strides in realizing the potential of the new Company, which is our second strategic imperative. Let me now share with you some ways in which we optimize the value of our combined Company in the first quarter.
As I mentioned, we grew revenue 10% organically. Regionally, Japan was a standup performer with 23% growth for the quarter. Throughout 2009 our team in Japan executed on a strategy to optimize our commercial structure in the region. Among other actions, we increased the number of sales reps in the field and implemented a new dealer strategy that more closely aligned incentives with performance. These efforts position us well to take advantage of the additional research funding that the Japanese government released in the first quarter of 2010. As a result, we had strong sales across all of our businesses in Japan with a notable increase in sales of the new 3500 Genetic Analyzer and the Neon Transfection system.
Growth in Japan was also positively impacted from a lift in realized price and recognition of the last installment from the landmark police forensics deal. We are very pleased with this performance and recognize the tremendous efforts that our team in Japan is putting forth. However, this remains a very challenging region, and we expect growth to be in the low-single digits for the balance of the year now.
The Americas region grew 8% in the quarter with stimulus-related revenues contributing approximately 3% of this growth. While we did not see a significant ramp up in stimulus revenues for the fourth quarter, we are still confident - from the fourth quarter, we are still confident in our estimate of greater than $100 million over the life of this federal program. However, because of the slow ramp up in stimulus related spending, we believe that more of this revenue might now push into 2011 than we had originally anticipated
I’d like to now talk a bit about our last strategic priority, investing for future growth. As I’ve stated in the past, we expect to grow revenue one to two points faster than the market for the foreseeable future. One of the ways in which we will achieve this goal is the consistent introduction of new and innovative products. It is critical to have an eye on the future and anticipate the areas that will drive growth in the months and the years to come.
To that end, we have spent considerable efforts fine-tuning our innovation techniques over the last 24 months and focus our efforts on several key areas, including genetic sequencing, synthetic biology, flow cytometry, benchtop devices, and PCR. In addition to meeting the needs of our research customers, investments in these areas will increasingly move us into higher growth in commercial and clinical realms.
We will go into more detail about our investment strategies at our upcoming investor day in June, but I will give you a few highlights of some of our recent product introductions now.
Yesterday, we issued a press release about the debut of the industry’s first benchtop proteomic and epigenetic sample preparation system, the MAGic Sample Processor. In line with our strategy of offering innovative products that simplify and streamline workflows, this new device cuts protocol times in half and dramatically reduces experimental errors by automating manual processes. MAGic utilizes microfluidics, thermal controls, and integrated magnetic separation technology, which enables researchers to more easily perform technically challenging experiments in protein purification and epigenetics.
We are particularly excited about this launch as it is another product in a growing line of innovative, productivity-enhancing benchtop devices. And I might add, it combines the very best of Life Technologies’ engineering, Dynal bead technology, and our consumables channel [ph]. It is a product that couldn’t have been created without the creating of Life Technologies.
In addition to the launch of MAGic, last week at the America Association for Cancer Research, we unveiled several new technologies, including research only KRAS and BRAF mutation analysis reagents that can be analyzed using the 3500 Genetic Analyzer.
We also announced our newest innovation in real-time PCR, the ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System. The ViiA 7 System offers maximum productivity, ease of use, and instrument to instrument consistency. While the ViiA 7 System is currently for research use only, it was designed with clinical applications in mind. We expect to get a CE IVD mark later in the year and ultimately plan for 510(k) in the U.S. Gaining these clearances will extend the application of the ViiA 7 System beyond research lab and into clinical and diagnostic markets. The launch of the ViiA 7 System is part of our broader strategy to extend our leadership position in PCR by setting new technology standards. We began executing upon this strategy in 2009 when we acquired Cytonix for intellectual property related to digital PCR technology and then followed that with the acquisition of BioTrove for its OpenArray platform, enabling high throughput traditional genotyping into PCR as well as digital PCR reads.
Today, I am pleased to announce the acquisition of Stokespile [ph] whose ground-breaking technology redefines the current play-safe paradigm for the PCR process, generating orders of magnitude more date in less time. Stokespile has developed the microfluidics based system for high throughput, highly flexible genotyping, gene expression analysis, and digital PCR. This technology is well-suited to meet the ever-growing demand for higher throughput genomic analysis in agriculture, drug discovery, translational research, and other applications being fuelled by the rapid rate of discovery from next generation sequencing systems such as ours. The acquisition of Stokespile is another very exciting step forward as we continue to build out and redefine the PCR industry.
These combined assets will enable our vision of delivering (inaudible) performance and quality, fast, easy, and configured for customer throughput and flexibility needs. Building out our PCR franchise through both internal development and the acquisition of technologies is just one example of how we are investing in our future. We have programs in place that will ultimately drive our business forward and it’s a smart and efficient allocation of resources to these programs that will set us up for success in the years to come.
With that, I will turn it over to David who will provide a little more color on our divisional performance and overall financial results. David?

Currency had a positive four point impact on reported revenue growth and acquisitions and divestitures had a negative one point impact. Excluding the effect of currency, acquisitions, and divestitures, revenue grew 10% organically.
This performance was the result of strong volume growth and better pricing in most areas of the business. In addition, growth was positively impacted by three items in particular. As Greg mentioned before, we recognized $8 million in revenue from the last installment of the Japanese police order. We also benefited from spending related to the supplemental budget in Japan which added $4 million in revenues.
And finally, revenue associated with the NIH stimulus totaled $10 million. These three items added about 3% to the overall growth rate.
Before I walk through some of divisional highlights, I’d like to point out a relatively small change in our division structure that went into effect at the beginning of the year. In order to better align certain technologies within our divisions, we created a new business unit called Applied Molecular Testing, which is now part of the Molecular Biology Systems division. Going forward, all of our animal, biosecurity, food, and environmental testing products will be accounted for in this new business unit.
In addition to this change, we moved certain products associated with our pharma analytics business from Genetic Systems to Cell Systems to more closely align our product offerings for pharmaceutical and biological production. As a result, product lines totaling approximately $50 million in revenue were moved between divisions. For year-over-year comparison purposes, we’ve posted a worksheet on our website that restates divisional revenue for 2009. In addition, we will be providing more detail during the post earnings Q&A call later this afternoon.
Now, I will get into the divisional highlights. Molecular Biology Systems grew approximately 10% organically to $432 million in revenue. Our PCR business grew in the teens, driven by particularly strong demand for instruments in the Americas and Asia as well as the Japanese police order that I referenced earlier. Genomic Assays also performed well with double-digit growth in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Japan. Lastly, the Molecular Biology Reagent business benefited from strong sales for reagents in all regions.
Genetic Systems grew 12% organically to $238 million. CE, our largest technology group in this division grew mid-single digits for the quarter, driven by growth in both consumables and instruments. Consumables continued to experience solid growth in research and applied applications. Instrument growth was driven by strong sales in clinical research, particularly for the newly launched 3500 Genetic Analyzer, partially offset by a year-over-year decline in instruments sold into applied markets due to a large sale in the first quarter of last year.
And finally, we continue to gain traction in next generation sequencing as we improve the ease-of-use and the performance of the SOLiD platform. Ongoing improvements in the technology, new product launches such as the SOLiD PI system, along with investments in our field support sales teams and marketing are paying off. A good example of this is the British Columbia Cancer Agency’s purchase of 10 SOLiD 4 units for their research. The accuracy of the SOLiD system is increasingly recognized by thought leaders as critical for cancer related research.
Cell systems had revenues of $214 million, representing 8% organic growth. Growth in this division increased compared to prior quarters as pharmaceutical and biotech end markets started to improve. This quarter saw a double-digit growth in bioproduction, driven by new drug introductions, and the timing of large customer orders.
Primary and stem cell systems also posted strong growth in the quarter, driven by demand for both media and reagents.
And lastly, our Dynal beads based business grew in the double digits on large orders from molecular diagnostic customers.
In terms of organic growth by region, the Americas grew 8%; Europe grew 5%, Asia-Pacific 25%, and Japan 23%.
As I mentioned earlier, currency added four points of growth to revenue for the quarter, net of our hedging program. The positive impact to EPS was approximately 7% or $0.07 including foreign currency impacts accounted for in revenue and other income.
First quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 68.3%, an increase of approximately 160 basis points over prior year. This improvement was primarily due to price, currency, synergies, and manufacturing productivity. On a sequential basis, gross margins increased by 330 basis points due to increases in price and royalty revenue and higher productivity in our plants. Keep in mind that gross margins in the fourth quarter are typically lower, so sequential increase was expected.
First quarter operating expenses were $343 million, an increase over prior year levels of 8% with currency, and 6% without currency. Operating expenses increased due to increases in R&D, depreciation, and cost associated with employee stock options. Sequentially, operating expenses were relatively flat, mainly due to delaying some investments until we had a better understanding of how stimulus related revenues would flow in the quarter.
Operating income was $262 million, an increase of 27% over prior year including the impact of currency, and 20% excluding currency. Operating margin was 29.5%, representing 330 basis points of improvement year-over-year, including the impact from currency. This level of operating margin expansion resulted from improved gross margins, synergies and other operating expense reductions. As we’ve said before, our goal over the next several years is to consistently deliver 50 plus basis points of operating margin improvements.
In terms of other income, we had $1 million of interest income, $3 million from currency gain, and $1 million of expense from our mass spec joint venture. Interest expense for the quarter was $30 million.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 30%, slightly higher than guidance due to the expiration of the federal R&D tax credit. We believe that this tax credit will be renewed at some time during the year. If renewed, the credit will reduce our full year tax rate by approximately one percentage point. Therefore, we expect our full year tax rate to be between 29% and 29.5%.
Our diluted share count for the quarter was 190 million shares. As you will recall, our share count is impacted by our stock price due to our convertible debt and employee stock options. We continue to expect a full year diluted share count of 192 million to 194 million shares, assuming an average stock price for the year between $52 and $55 per share.
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.48, which includes the gain of $0.14 per share on the sale of the mass spec division, $0.25 of acquisition related amortization expense, $0.03 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB 14-1, $0.08 per share of business integration cost and other items, and $0.17 per share of accelerated amortization of debt issuance cost resulting from the early repayment of debt.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these items, diluted earnings per share were $0.87, a 21% increase over last year.
Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, our ending cash and short term investments were $642 million. This compares to last year’s balance of $648 million. Cash from operating activities was $71 million, capital expenditures were $30 million, and free cash flow was $41 million. As a reminder, free cash flow is lower in the first quarter due to the payout of annual employee bonuses.
Return on invested capital increased 0.5% to 8.6%. We are making good progress towards our goal of a 10% return on invested capital in the next couple of years.
Paying down debt continues to be our top priority. To that end, we use the proceeds from the sale of the mass spec joint venture and the bond offering, as well as cash on hand to pay off term loans amounting to $1.97 billion. As a result, our ending debt as of March 31st was $2.64 billion. This balance is made up of our convertible debt of $1.15 billion and senior notes of $1.5 billion.
Our leverage ratio is approximately 2.7 times, and we still expect to be between 2.0 and 2.5 times by the end of the year. Since the merger of Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems, we’ve paid off $900 million in debt.
I’ll now move on to our expectations for the rest of the year. Our full year guidance is unchanged. Revenue growth is expected to be in the mid-to-high single digits and EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.50. As we stated in our Q4 call, the impact from the NIH stimulus is the main driver between the mid- and the high-single digit revenue growth.
As Greg mentioned earlier, the impact from the stimulus was approximately the same as we saw in the fourth quarter of last year, $10 million. At this point, we expect that the impact of stimulus funding will be spread over a longer period of time with more of the spending now pushed into 2011. We’ll keep you updated on the impact of the stimulus funding as we move through the year.
As is our practice, I will also give you a few specific items to take into consideration for the coming quarter. First, in regard to the stimulus, as we stated on the Q4 call, we intend to reinvest approximately half of the operating profit from the stimulus back into the business to fund future growth opportunities. These reinvestments will begin in the second quarter and will be primarily focused on R&D and commercial projects in emerging markets such as China and India.
Gross margins are expected to decrease sequentially as price is normally strongest in the first quarter. Additionally, in the second quarter we expect to sell a higher mix of instruments, which are lower margin than our consumables.
Operating expenses are expected to increase sequentially due to increases in investment in emerging markets and R&D as well as the full quarter impact of new hires and merit increases that went into effect at the beginning of April. Our currency guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect the impact on revenue will be one to two points of additional growth for the year, including the impact of our hedging programs.
And lastly, we’ve received questions on the impact to our business of the eruption of the volcano in Iceland, and we are pleased to report there has been no material impact on revenue. Delivery times did increase slightly due to a switch to - a switch from air to ground freight. However, we were able to supply our customers from stock at our European distribution centers.
And with that, I will now hand the call over to Eileen for Q&A.

I hope you've had a chance to review the press release we put out this afternoon. As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth, and we are pleas",1424,"Thanks, Eileen, and thanks to all of you for joining us. I hope you've had a chance to review the press release we put out this afternoon. As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth, and we are pleased with how we have started in 2010.
Revenue grew 10% organically to $887 million, a result of terrific growth in both instruments and consumables. Operating margins expanded by 330 basis points to hit a record 29.5%. And earnings per share grew 21% to $0.87 for the quarter. This quarter marks the 14th quarter in a row that this company has met or exceeded its financial targets on both the top and the bottom line. This milestone demonstrates how seriously we take our commitment to our shareholders. Our teams around the world have proven that they know how to put their heads down and get the work done, driving above market revenue growth with a relentless focus on execution.
As I do every quarter, I'll take a few moments now to talk about these results in the context of our strategic imperatives: Delivering on the integration, realizing the potential of this new company and investing for the future.
First, we made significant progress on our integration goals for the year. The sales force reorganization is complete and our reps are hitting the street with a singular purpose of adding value for our customers. Our ultimate goal is to become their partner of choice by providing unparalleled customer service and offering an expansive portfolio of innovative products that simplify and streamline entire workflows. 
In addition, we announced the closure of two manufacturing sites in Camarillo, California and Bromborough, U.K. The work to consolidate these operations into our facilities in Frederick, Maryland and Warrington, in the U.K. is well underway and going successfully. These initiatives, as well as many others, will generate an additional $20 million in annualized synergies. This brings us one step closer to our goal of putting action plans in place that will generate an additional $70 million in annualized savings by the end of this year.
Our diligent approach to the integration has not only paid off from a near-term synergy perspective, but has set us up for success in other important ways. In particular, we've made great strides in realizing the potential of the new company, which is our second strategic imperative. Let me now share with you some ways in which we optimize the value of our combined company in the first quarter.
As I mentioned, we grew revenue 10% organically. Regionally, Japan was a stand up performer with 23% growth for the quarter. Throughout 2009, our team in Japan executed on a strategy to optimize our commercial structure in the region. Among other actions, we increased the number of sales reps in the field and implemented a new dealer strategy that more closely align incentives with performance. These efforts position us well to take advantage of the additional research funding that the Japanese government released in the first quarter of 2010. As a result, we had strong sales across all of our businesses in Japan with a notable increase in sales of the new 3500 Genetic Analyzer and the Neon Transfection system.
Growth in Japan was also positively impacted from a list in realized priced in recognition of the last installment from the landmark police forensics deal. We are very pleased with this performance and recognize the tremendous efforts that our team in Japan is putting forth. However, this remains a very challenging region, and we expect growth to be in the low single digits for the balance of the year now.
The Americas region grew 8% in the quarter, with stimulus-related revenues contributing approximately 3% of this growth. While we did not see a significant ramp up in stimulus revenues from the fourth quarter, we are still confident in our estimate of greater than $100 million over the life of this federal program. However, because of the slow ramp up in stimulus-related spending, we believe that more of this revenue might now push into 2011 than we had originally anticipated.
I'd like to now talk a bit about our last strategic priority, investing for future growth. As I've stated in the past, we expect to grow revenue one to two points faster than the market for the foreseeable future. One of the ways in which we will achieve this goal is the consistent introduction of new and innovative products. It is critical to have an eye on the future and anticipate the areas that will drive growth in the months and the years to come. To that end, we have spent considerable efforts fine-tuning our innovation techniques over the last 24 months and focused our efforts on several key areas, including genetic sequencing, synthetic biology, flow cytometry, benchtop devices and PCR. In addition to meeting the needs of our research customers, investments in these areas will increasingly move us into higher growth, commercial and clinical realms.
We will go into more detail about our investment strategies at our upcoming Investor Day in June, but I'll give you a few highlights of some of our recent product introductions now.
Yesterday, we issued a press release about the debut of the industry's first benchtop proteomic and epigenetic sample preparation system, the MAGic Sample Processor. In line with our strategy of offering innovative products that simplify and streamline workflows, this new device cuts protocol times in half and dramatically reduces experimental errors by automating manual processes. MAGic utilizes microfluidics, thermal controls and integrated magnetic separation technology, which enables researchers to more easily perform technically challenging experiments in protein purification and epigenetics.
We are particularly excited about this launch as it is another product in a growing line of innovative, productivity-enhancing benchtop devices. And I might add, it combines the very best of Life Technologies' engineering, Dynabead technology and our consumables channel. It is a product that couldn't  have been created without the creation of Life Technologies.
In addition to the launch of MAGic, last week at the American Association for Cancer Research, we unveiled several new technologies, including research-only KRAS and BRAF mutation analysis reagents that can be analyzed using the 3500 Genetic Analyzer. We also announced our newest innovation in realtime PCR, the ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR system. The ViiA 7 system offers maximum productivity, ease of use and instrument-to-instrument consistency. While the ViiA 7 system is currently for research-use only, it was designed with clinical applications in mind. We expect to get a CE-IVD mark later in the year and ultimately plan for 510(k) clearance in the U.S.  Gaining these clearances will extend the application of the ViiA 7 system beyond research labs and into clinical and diagnostic markets.
The launch of the ViiA 7 system is part of our broader strategy to extend our leadership position in PCR by setting new technology standards. We began executing upon this strategy in 2009 when we acquired Cytonix for intellectual-property related to digital PCR technology, and then followed that with the acquisition of BioTrove for its OpenArray platform, enabling high throughput traditional genotyping into PCR as well as digital PCR reads.
Today, I'm pleased to announce the acquisition of Stokes Bio, whose ground-breaking technology redefines the current play-safe paradigm for the PCR process, generating orders of magnitude more data in less time. Stokes Bio has developed the microfluidic-base system for high throughput, highly flexible genotyping, gene expression analysis and digital PCR. This technology is well suited to meet the ever growing demand for higher throughput genomic analysis in agriculture, drug discovery, translational research and other applications being fueled by the rapid rate of discovery from next-generation sequencing systems such as ours.  The acquisition of Stokes Bio is another very exciting step forward as we continue to build out and redefine the PCR industry.  These combined assets will enable our vision of delivering TaqMan's performance in quality: Fast, easy and configured for customer throughput and flexibility needs.
Building out our PCR franchise through both internal development and the acquisition of technologies is just one example of how we are investing in our future. We have many programs in place that will ultimately drive our business forward and it's a smart and efficient allocation of resources to these programs that will set us up for success in the years to come.
With that, I'll turn it over to David who will provide a little more color on our divisional performance and overall financial results. David?"
30253,100477331,59141,"Life Technologies Corporation, Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2010",2010-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Life Technologies Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg.

Currency had a positive four-point impact on reported revenue growth, and acquisitions and divestitures had a negative one-point impact. Excluding the effect of currency, acquisitions and divestitures, revenue grew 10% organically.
This performance was the result of strong volume growth and better pricing in most areas of the business. In addition, growth was positively impacted by three items in particular. As Greg mentioned before, we recognized $8 million in revenue from the last installment of the Japanese police order. We also benefited from spending related to the supplemental budget in Japan, which added $4 million in revenues. And finally, revenue associated with the NIH stimulus totaled $10 million. These three items added about 3% to the overall growth rate.
Before I walk through some of the divisional highlights, I'd like to point out a relatively small change in our division structure that went into effect at the beginning of the year. In order to better align certain technologies within our divisions, we created a new business unit called Applied Molecular Testing, which is now part of the Molecular Biology Systems division.
Going forward, all of our animal, biosecurity, food and environmental testing products will be accounted for in this new business unit. In addition to this change, we moved certain products associate with our Pharma-Analytics business from Genetic Systems to Cell Systems to more closely align our product offerings for pharmaceutical and biological production.
As a result, product lines totaling approximately $50 million in revenue were moved between divisions. For year-over-year comparison purposes, we've posted a worksheet on our website that restates divisional revenue for 2009. In addition, we will be providing more detail during the post earnings Q&A call later this afternoon.
Now, I'll get into the divisional highlights. Molecular Biology Systems grew approximately 10% organically to $432 million in revenue. Our PCR business grew in the teens, driven by a particularly strong demand for instruments in the Americas and Asia, as well as the Japanese police order that I referenced earlier.  Genomic Assays also performed well with double-digit growth in the Americas, Asia-Pacific and Japan. Lastly, the Molecular Biology Reagent business benefited from strong sales of reagents in all regions.
Genetic Systems grew 12% organically to $238 million. CE, our largest technology group in this division grew mid-single digits for the quarter, driven by growth in both consumables and instruments. Consumables continue to experience solid growth in research and applied applications. Instrument growth was driven by strong sales in clinical research, particularly for the newly launched 3500 Genetic Analyzer, partially offset by a year-over-year decline in instruments sold into applied markets due to a large sale in the first quarter of last year.
And finally, we continue to gain traction in next-generation sequencing as we improved the ease-of-use and the performance of the SOLiD platform, ongoing improvements in the technology, new product launches such as the SOLiD PI system, along with investments in our field support, sales teams and marketing are paying off. A good example of this is the British Columbia Cancer Agency's purchase of 10 SOLiD 4 units for their research. The accuracy of the SOLiD System is increasingly recognized by thought leaders as critical for cancer-related research.
Cell Systems had revenues of $214 million, representing 8% organic growth. Growth in this division increased compared to prior quarters as pharmaceutical and biotech end markets started to improve. This quarter saw a double-digit growth in Bioproduction driven by new drug introductions, and the timing of large customer orders.
Primary and Stem Cell Systems also posted strong growth in the quarter driven by demand for both media and reagents. And lastly, our Dynabeads-based business grew in the double digits on large orders from molecular diagnostic customers.
In terms of organic growth by region, the Americas grew 8%, Europe grew 5%; Asia-Pacific, 25%; and Japan, 23%. As I mentioned earlier, currency added four points of growth to revenue for the quarter, net of our hedging program. The positive impact to EPS was approximately 7% or $0.07, including foreign currency impacts accounted for in revenue and other income.
First quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 68.3%, an increase of approximately 160 basis points over prior year. This improvement was primarily due to price, currency, synergies and manufacturing productivity.  On a sequential basis, gross margins increased by 330 basis points due to increases in price and royalty revenue, and higher productivity in our plants.  Keep in mind that gross margins in the fourth quarter are typically lower, so a sequential increase was expected. 
First quarter operating expenses were $343 million, an increase over prior year levels of 8% with currency and 6% without currency. Operating expenses increased due to increases in R&D, depreciation and cost associated with employee stock options. Sequentially, operating expenses were relatively flat, mainly due to delaying some investments until we had a better understanding of how stimulus-related revenues would flow in the quarter. Operating income was $262 million, an increase of 27% over prior year, including the impact of currency, and 20% excluding currency. Operating margin was 29.5%, representing 330 basis points of improvement year-over-year, including the impact from currency.
This level of operating margin expansion resulted from improved gross margins, synergies and other operating expense reductions. As we've said before, our goal over the next several years is to consistently deliver 50 plus basis points of operating margin improvements.
In terms of other income, we had $1 million of interest income, $3 million from currency gain and $1 million of expense from our mass spec joint venture. Interest expense for the quarter was $30 million.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 30%, slightly higher than guidance due to the expiration of the federal R&D tax credit. We believe that this tax credit will be renewed at some point during the year. If renewed, the credit will reduce our full year tax rate by approximately one percentage point. Therefore, we expect our full year tax rate to be between 29% and 29.5%. Our diluted share count for the quarter was $190 million shares. As you will recall, our share count is impacted our stock price due to our convertible debt and employee stock options.  We continue to expect a full year diluted share count of 192 million to 194 million shares, assuming an average stock price for the year between $52 and $55 per share.
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.48, which includes a gain of $0.14 per share on the sale of the mass spec division, $0.25 of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.03 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB 14-1, $0.08 per share of business integration cost and other items, and $0.17 per share of accelerated amortization of debt issuance cost resulting from the early repayment of debt. On a non-GAAP basis, which exclude these items, diluted earnings per share were $0.87, a 21% increase over last year.
Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, our ending cash and short-term investments were $642 million. This compares to last year's balance of $648 million. Cash from operating activities was $71 million, capital expenditures were $30 million, and free cash flow was $41 million. As a reminder, free cash flow is lower in the first quarter due to the payout of annual employee bonuses.
Return on invested capital increased 0.5% to 8.6%. We're making good progress towards our goal of a 10% return on invested capital in the next couple of years.
Paying down debt continues to be our top priority. To that end, we used the proceeds from the sale of the mass spec joint venture and the bond offering, as well as cash on hand, to pay off term loans amounting to $1.97 billion. As a result, our ending debt as of March 31 was $2.64 billion. This balance is made up of our convertible debt of $1.15 billion and senior notes of $1.5 billion.  Our leverage ratio is approximately 2.7x, and we still expect to be between 2x and 2.5x by the end of the year. Since the merger of Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems, we paid off $900 million in debt. 
I'll now move on to our expectations for the rest of the year. Our full year guidance is unchanged. Revenue growth is expected to be in the mid to high single digits, and EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.50.
As we stated in our Q4 call, the impact from the NIH stimulus is the Main driver between the mid and high single-digit revenue growth. As Greg mentioned earlier, the impact from the stimulus was approximately the same as we saw in the fourth quarter of last year, $10 million. At this point, we expect that the impact of stimulus funding will be spread over a longer period of time with more of the spending now pushed into 2011. We'll keep you updated on the impact of the stimulus funding as we move through the year.
As is our practice, I will also give you a few specific items to take into consideration for the coming quarter. First, in regard to the stimulus, as we stated on the Q4 call, we intend to reinvest approximately half of the operating profit from the stimulus back into the business to fund future growth opportunities. These reinvestments will begin in the second quarter and will be primarily focused on R&D and commercial projects in emerging markets such as China and India. Gross margins are expected to decrease sequentially as price is normally strongest in the first quarter. Additionally, in the second quarter, we expect to sell a higher mix of instruments which are lower margin than our consumables.
Operating expenses are expected to increase sequentially due to increases in investments in emerging markets and R&D, as well as the full quarter impact of new hires and merit increases that went into effect at the beginning of April. Our currency guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect the impact on revenue will be one to two points of additional growth for the year including the impact of our hedging programs.
And lastly, we received questions on the impact to our business of the eruption of the volcano in Iceland, and we're pleased to report there's been no material impact on revenue. Delivery times did increase slightly due to a switch from air to ground freight. However, we were able to supply our customers from stock at our European distribution centers.
And with that, I'll now hand the call over to Eileen for Q&A."

And the contamination issues you referenced didn't impact us, but as you say, I think further stimulates another part of our business, which is the use of PCR technology in quality control. So we see a very robust future of applying that technology at the Bioproduction. On the stem cell side, as you know, we started that business several years ago and brought in some real strong leadership. That's the business now that continues to grow at very strong double digits, spurred on by NIH work, California, overseas and just the general move towards primary cell usage. So it's been a great business for us and continues to do so."

Coming off the heels of our Investor Day just a few weeks ago, we are going to keep our prepared comments short this morning. So let's get started. As you can see from our results, we delivered another",1092,"Thanks, Eileen, and thank you, all for joining us. Coming off the heels of our Investor Day just a few weeks ago, we are going to keep our prepared comments short this morning. 
So let's get started. As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth. Revenue grew 6% organically to $906 million, 8% excluding the impact of H1N1 sales in 2009. Operating margins expanded by 290 basis points to reach a record 30.1%, and earnings per share grew 15% to $0.91 for the quarter.
We are pleased with our results for the second quarter in the first half of the year, which are a reflection of the fundamental strength of the business and the essential nature of our product offering. I'd like to extend my thanks to our teams around the world for their commitment to excellence and relentless focus on execution.
As I do every quarter, I'll take a few moments to talk about these results, give you an update on the integration and provide some color on the strength of our end markets. First, we continue to be very focused on the integration, and I'm pleased to report good progress towards our goal of putting actions in place that will generate $175 million in annual synergies by the end of 2010. 
In the second quarter, we continue to execute on an integration plan, including the placement of over 50 dual-branded supply centers around the world and further optimization of our combined eBusiness platforms. We are seeing good traction from these efforts and achieve new records for the number of the total transactions, both in North America and globally, that will process through eCommerce channels.
In terms of synergy capture, these actions, as well as many others, will generate another $15 million in annualized synergies, getting it halfway to our full year goal. Looking ahead in the second half of the year, we will continue to optimize the programs already started, as well as implement new initiatives, including additional site consolidations and cities where we have multiple offices, continuing to build out the combined eBusiness platforms and optimizing our distribution network.
Now beyond these integration activities, Life Technologies is well positioned to capture opportunities that will continue to drive strong revenue growth. Commercial execution, coupled with a broad product offering of innovative tools ensures that our products are an essential part of our customers' workflows. Recent launches have gone very well. Customer response to Attune, our flow cytometry offering and the ViiA 7 PCR instrument have been very positive, and the sales of our latest CE instrumentation, the 3500, have reinvigorated that business. Since the launch of the 3500 in Q4 of last year, we have placed approximately 400 instruments and demand continues to be very robust.
I'll take a moment now to walk you through more notable points on Q2 performance and give some color on what we're seeing on our end markets. The Americas delivered 7% organic growth in the quarter, 10% without the impact of H1N1. End markets in the Americas remain strong, with pharma and biotech continuing to pick up steam. Evidenced by the strong demand for our discovery and assay services business and double-digit growth in bioproduction. On the research side, stimulus-related revenues for the quarter were approximately $10 million, about the same as we've seen in prior quarters.
Our outlook for the stimulus is unchanged. We continue to estimate that we will generate more than $100 million in stimulus-related revenue over the life of this program. However, since we have not observed the material ramp-up in spending since the third quarter of last year, we estimate that stimulus-related revenues will be around $10 million per quarter in the second half of the year, with the rest of the benefit realized in 2011.
Europe grew 4% organically in the quarter. Growth for the quarter is slightly less than in recent periods due to the uncertainty about future government funding levels. At this time, we have no reason to believe that there will be declining government funding for our research in major European markets, such as U.K., Germany and France. However, some of our customers have reported that there have been delays in the release of funds from the institutions to researchers. In addition, researchers seem to be cautious in their spending due to fears that future funding may be curtailed. As a result, spending in these countries on both consumables and instruments softened towards the end of the quarter.
The situation in some of our smaller markets, such as Italy and Spain is slightly different. Funding in these countries have been negatively impacted to some degree as a result of the current economic environment. Revenue growth in these countries was flat during the second quarter. Looking forward to the second half, we expect that for the European region as a whole, revenue growth will be in the low-single digits or mid-single digits, excluding H1N1.
Moving on to other markets, Asia-Pacific had another strong quarter, growing 19% organically. End markets in the Asia Pacific region remain healthy, particularly in India and greater China, which grew an excess of 30% in the quarter. We were well positioned in these markets to continue to drive robust growth.
There's no change in our outlook for Japan. In the second quarter, Japan declined 4% organically as a result of a very difficult year-over-year comparison. As a reminder, Q2 of last year included revenue from a large police order, as well as H1N1. Excluding these items, Japan grew 3%, in line with expectations.
Now before I hand it over to David, I'm pleased to announce earlier this week, our Board of Directors approved a two-year $350 million share repurchase program, which is consistent with our strategy of balanced capital deployment. We intend to begin repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter after we have redeemed the 2% convertible notes in August, and we are within our target leverage ratio of 2x to 2.5x EBITDA. In general, the timing and amount of purchases would depend on quarterly fluctuations in cash associated with operating cash flow, capital expenditures and further debt prepayment. 
We remain committed to the financial goals we've outlined previously, and our priorities for cash remain the same. We will continue to pay down debt to keep our leverage within 2x to 2.5x EBITDA, as well as make investments in the business that will drive future growth and then return excess cash to shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to David."
30253,109039325,70382,"Life Technologies Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Life Technologies Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg.

Currency had a positive impact of 1.5 percentage points on reported revenue growth. And acquisitions and divestitures contributed half a point to growth. Excluding the impact from currency, acquisitions and divestitures, revenue grew 6% organically.
Genetic Systems had revenue of $235 million, representing 7% organic growth. Sales of CE instruments, including the new 3500 Genetic Analyzer and sales of CE consumables to research and clinical labs, grew in the mid-single digits. This was partially offset by a year-over-year decline in CE instruments and consumables sold into the applied markets, as this business experienced a difficult year-over-year comparison due to the Japanese police order received in 2009.
Customer feedback on the SOLiD 4 and ECB platforms continues to be very positive. As a result, the Next-Generation Sequencing business demonstrated strong double-digit growth during the quarter. At this point, approximately half of the installed base of SOLiD 3.5 instruments has been upgraded to the SOLiD 4 platform.
Molecular Biology Systems grew 2% organically to $434 million in revenue. Excluding H1N1-related revenue, organic growth was approximately 6%. Growth was driven by strong results in the Genomic Assays and Molecular Biology Reagents businesses. Demand for Genomic Assay products grew in the high-single digits. The Molecular Biology Reagents business grew in the mid-single digits and benefited from strong double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific, particularly China.
Cell Systems had revenue of $230 million representing 13% organic growth with strong demand across the portfolio. Double-digit growth in bioproduction was driven by continued improvement in demand from European and North American pharmaceutical customers, as well as the timing of large orders.
The Dynal Beads business also benefited from an improvement in pharma, biotech and clinical diagnostic end markets, resulting in double-digit growth for the quarter. And lastly, our Primary and Stem Cell business grew in the mid-teens, driven by worldwide demand for both media and reagents --
As I mentioned earlier, currency added 1.5 points of growth to revenue for the quarter, including the impact of our hedging program. The positive impact to EPS was approximately $0.04, including foreign currency effects accounted for in revenue and other income.
Moving on to other items. Second quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 67.7%, an increase of approximately 100 basis points over the prior-year quarter. This improvement was primarily due to positive price realization, synergies, manufacturing productivity and an increase in royalty revenue, partially offset by a mix, particularly increased sales of bioproduction and instruments. On a sequential basis, gross margin decreased by 60 basis points due to currency and increased sales of lower margin bioproduction products. 
Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% over prior year's levels to $341 million. This was as a result of headcount additions related to acquisitions and increase in depreciation resulting from capital expenditures associated with the AB and Invitrogen integration and currency. Sequentially, operating expenses declined 1%, mainly due to currency.
Non-GAAP operating income was $272 million, an increase of 19% over prior year, including the impact of currency, and 17% excluding currency. This quarter, operating margins reached a record level of 30.1% representing 290 basis points of improvement year-over-year. This operating margin expansion primarily resulted from improved gross margins and synergies.
In terms of other income line items, we had $1 million of interest income, $1 million from currency gains and interest expense for the quarter was $28 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 29.5%. Our diluted share count for the quarter was 191 million shares. As you will recall, our share count is impacted by our stock price in the quarter due to our convertible debt and employee stock options.
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.58, which includes $0.21 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.03 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB 14-1 and $0.09 per share of business integration costs and other items. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these items, diluted earnings per share was $0.91.
Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, our ending cash and short-term investments were $706 million. This compares to last quarter's balance of $642 million. Cash from operating activities was $228 million, capital expenditures were $25 million and free cash flow was $203 million. Included in our cash flow from operations is approximately $25 million of favorability associated with hedges on inter-company loans as a result of increased volatility and currency rates. Return on invested capital increased 40 basis points to 9%.
Our ending debt as of June 30 was approximately $2.64 billion. This balance is made up of our convertible debt of $1.1 billion and our senior notes of $1.5 billion. For the first half of 2010, revenue increased 8% organically, gross margins expanded 130 basis points and operating margins expanded 310 basis points. We feel good about our results thus far and are focused on continued execution in the second half of the year.
With that, I'll now move on to our expectations for the rest of this year. EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.50. Our full year guidance for organic revenue growth is unchanged and is still expected to be in the mid to high-single digits.
Given Greg's commentary on stimulus and end markets, I'll provide a bit more color on second half of  expectations. As a reminder, when we provided guidance in the beginning of the year, we stated that the difference between mid and high-single digit organic revenue growth was dependent on the amount of stimulus-related revenue that would be recognized during the year. We've not seen a notable increase in quarterly stimulus-related revenues since the third quarter of last year.  As a result, we expect second half organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. Revenue from prior acquisitions will add approximately one point to growth in each quarter. 
In terms of year-over-year comparables, keep in mind that in the second half of 2009, we had $15 million of H1N1 revenue per quarter, approximately $8 million to $9 million per quarter from the Japanese police order and stimulus revenues of $15 million.
Due to the volatility of currency rates over the last couple of months, I'll provide some detail on the expected impact of currency on our results. With rates as of June 30 and including the impact from our hedging programs, currency is expected to have a small negative impact on revenue, and no impact on EPS in the third quarter.
In the fourth quarter, currency is expected to have a negative three-point impact to revenue growth, and EPS is expected to be negatively impacted by $0.04 to $0.05. Q3 gross margins are expected to be lower sequentially due to lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower volume in the quarter and a decline in royalty revenue. Operating expenses in Q3 are expected to be approximately the same as in Q2. 
As we indicated on the last earnings call, we are reinvesting a portion of the operating-income impact from stimulus back into the business to fund future growth opportunities. These investments, which are primarily focused on R&D and commercial projects in emerging markets, began late in the second quarter and will continue through Q3. As a result, R&D expense as a percentage of sales in the third quarter will be slightly higher than our full year guidance. We continue to expect full year R&D expense to be 10% to 10.5% of revenue.
Q3 operating margins are expected to be approximately the same level as last year. For the full year, operating margin expansion is still expected to be within 175 to 225 basis points. We expect the average diluted share count for the second half of the year to be $192 million to $194 million shares assuming an average stock price between $45 and $50.
And finally, we've received a number of questions on our hedging programs as it relates to next year. Because of the continued uncertainty about the global economy and the resulting impact on exchange rates, we opted in June to continue with our currency hedging program in 2011. At this point, we have currency hedges in place for the first seven months of 2011 and intend to execute additional hedges each month until we are hedged for the full 12 months. Share repurchase program will be used to help mitigate the impact of currency on EPS.
And with that, I'll now hand the call back over to Eileen for Q&A."

And so that seemingly had a ripple effect through spending at the bench level on a company like ours towards the end of that second quarter. Now that's kind of a short-term reaction, and that's why our comments are that, perhaps that could persist a bit through the second half of the year. On long term, the second half of your question, it's unclear, but our opinion is that this side of government funding will probably remain intact. And it centers around what you said in that, the larger countries are committed to a agenda of innovation. And therefore, at least in their public pronouncements that we can understand, they have said they're going to ring fence innovation funding, and so again, we rely on that to say that over the next couple of years, the European business should do okay. So that's what we know at this point. We're not predicting dire consequences, and yet at the same time, we think the robust growth we saw in the last couple of years may be modulated a bit over the next couple of years."

So Forensics, Bioproduction, Animal Health, and those segments are growing very fast, and we see them continuing to grow as a percentage of the portfolio. So that's a good thing. Second, in terms of academic funding over the next couple of years, I think if you take my earlier comment, we think it's going to be okay. It's probably more of the funding environment we saw in the 2003 and '04 type of time frame, and we actually grew okay through that period by really focusing the portfolio on where the money would be spent. And I think that a very important point to be made is that all products aren't equal, and the funding does get directed then in a certain way and you just simply have to have the portfolio to capture it. So I think we're feeling pretty good that we'll be able to do well in the overall funding environment in the U.S. and Europe. And then lastly, importantly, is the geographic aspect, which is, we have built a very robust infrastructure across Asia. And I think you can see the benefits of that investment by our continued very strong growth across Asia. We are direct in a lot of the main countries. We're going ever more direct in all of the countries. We're building logistics centers across the region. And so geographically, we're exposed to where higher growth will be. So when you couple all of that together, Life Technologies will do fine over the next couple of years."

Coming off the heels of our Investor Day just a few weeks ago, we are going to keep our prepared comments short this morning. So let's get started. As you can see from our results, we delivered another",1092,"Thanks, Eileen, and thank you, all for joining us. Coming off the heels of our Investor Day just a few weeks ago, we are going to keep our prepared comments short this morning. 
So let's get started. As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth. Revenue grew 6% organically to $906 million, 8% excluding the impact of H1N1 sales in 2009. Operating margins expanded by 290 basis points to reach a record 30.1%, and earnings per share grew 15% to $0.91 for the quarter.
We are pleased with our results for the second quarter in the first half of the year, which are a reflection of the fundamental strength of the business and the essential nature of our product offering. I'd like to extend my thanks to our teams around the world for their commitment to excellence and relentless focus on execution.
As I do every quarter, I'll take a few moments to talk about these results, give you an update on the integration and provide some color on the strength of our end markets. First, we continue to be very focused on the integration, and I'm pleased to report good progress towards our goal of putting actions in place that will generate $175 million in annual synergies by the end of 2010. 
In the second quarter, we continue to execute on an integration plan, including the placement of over 50 dual-branded supply centers around the world and further optimization of our combined eBusiness platforms. We are seeing good traction from these efforts and achieve new records for the number of the total transactions, both in North America and globally, that will process through eCommerce channels.
In terms of synergy capture, these actions, as well as many others, will generate another $15 million in annualized synergies, getting it halfway to our full year goal. Looking ahead in the second half of the year, we will continue to optimize the programs already started, as well as implement new initiatives, including additional site consolidations and cities where we have multiple offices, continuing to build out the combined eBusiness platforms and optimizing our distribution network.
Now beyond these integration activities, Life Technologies is well positioned to capture opportunities that will continue to drive strong revenue growth. Commercial execution, coupled with a broad product offering of innovative tools ensures that our products are an essential part of our customers' workflows. Recent launches have gone very well. Customer response to Attune, our flow cytometry offering and the ViiA 7 PCR instrument have been very positive, and the sales of our latest CE instrumentation, the 3500, have reinvigorated that business. Since the launch of the 3500 in Q4 of last year, we have placed approximately 400 instruments and demand continues to be very robust.
I'll take a moment now to walk you through more notable points on Q2 performance and give some color on what we're seeing on our end markets. The Americas delivered 7% organic growth in the quarter, 10% without the impact of H1N1. End markets in the Americas remain strong, with pharma and biotech continuing to pick up steam. Evidenced by the strong demand for our discovery and assay services business and double-digit growth in bioproduction. On the research side, stimulus-related revenues for the quarter were approximately $10 million, about the same as we've seen in prior quarters.
Our outlook for the stimulus is unchanged. We continue to estimate that we will generate more than $100 million in stimulus-related revenue over the life of this program. However, since we have not observed the material ramp-up in spending since the third quarter of last year, we estimate that stimulus-related revenues will be around $10 million per quarter in the second half of the year, with the rest of the benefit realized in 2011.
Europe grew 4% organically in the quarter. Growth for the quarter is slightly less than in recent periods due to the uncertainty about future government funding levels. At this time, we have no reason to believe that there will be declining government funding for our research in major European markets, such as U.K., Germany and France. However, some of our customers have reported that there have been delays in the release of funds from the institutions to researchers. In addition, researchers seem to be cautious in their spending due to fears that future funding may be curtailed. As a result, spending in these countries on both consumables and instruments softened towards the end of the quarter.
The situation in some of our smaller markets, such as Italy and Spain is slightly different. Funding in these countries have been negatively impacted to some degree as a result of the current economic environment. Revenue growth in these countries was flat during the second quarter. Looking forward to the second half, we expect that for the European region as a whole, revenue growth will be in the low-single digits or mid-single digits, excluding H1N1.
Moving on to other markets, Asia-Pacific had another strong quarter, growing 19% organically. End markets in the Asia Pacific region remain healthy, particularly in India and greater China, which grew an excess of 30% in the quarter. We were well positioned in these markets to continue to drive robust growth.
There's no change in our outlook for Japan. In the second quarter, Japan declined 4% organically as a result of a very difficult year-over-year comparison. As a reminder, Q2 of last year included revenue from a large police order, as well as H1N1. Excluding these items, Japan grew 3%, in line with expectations.
Now before I hand it over to David, I'm pleased to announce earlier this week, our Board of Directors approved a two-year $350 million share repurchase program, which is consistent with our strategy of balanced capital deployment. We intend to begin repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter after we have redeemed the 2% convertible notes in August, and we are within our target leverage ratio of 2x to 2.5x EBITDA. In general, the timing and amount of purchases would depend on quarterly fluctuations in cash associated with operating cash flow, capital expenditures and further debt prepayment. 
We remain committed to the financial goals we've outlined previously, and our priorities for cash remain the same. We will continue to pay down debt to keep our leverage within 2x to 2.5x EBITDA, as well as make investments in the business that will drive future growth and then return excess cash to shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to David.

Currency had a positive impact of 1.5 percentage points on reported revenue growth. And acquisitions and divestitures contributed half a point to growth. Excluding the impact from currency, acquisitions and divestitures, revenue grew 6% organically.
Genetic Systems had revenue of $235 million, representing 7% organic growth. Sales of CE instruments, including the new 3500 Genetic Analyzer and sales of CE consumables to research and clinical labs, grew in the mid-single digits. This was partially offset by a year-over-year decline in CE instruments and consumables sold into the applied markets, as this business experienced a difficult year-over-year comparison due to the Japanese police order received in 2009.
Customer feedback on the SOLiD 4 and ECB platforms continues to be very positive. As a result, the Next-Generation Sequencing business demonstrated strong double-digit growth during the quarter. At this point, approximately half of the installed base of SOLiD 3.5 instruments has been upgraded to the SOLiD 4 platform.
Molecular Biology Systems grew 2% organically to $434 million in revenue. Excluding H1N1-related revenue, organic growth was approximately 6%. Growth was driven by strong results in the Genomic Assays and Molecular Biology Reagents businesses. Demand for Genomic Assay products grew in the high-single digits. The Molecular Biology Reagents business grew in the mid-single digits and benefited from strong double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific, particularly China.
Cell Systems had revenue of $230 million representing 13% organic growth with strong demand across the portfolio. Double-digit growth in bioproduction was driven by continued improvement in demand from European and North American pharmaceutical customers, as well as the timing of large orders.
The Dynal Beads business also benefited from an improvement in pharma, biotech and clinical diagnostic end markets, resulting in double-digit growth for the quarter. And lastly, our Primary and Stem Cell business grew in the mid-teens, driven by worldwide demand for both media and reagents --
As I mentioned earlier, currency added 1.5 points of growth to revenue for the quarter, including the impact of our hedging program. The positive impact to EPS was approximately $0.04, including foreign currency effects accounted for in revenue and other income.
Moving on to other items. Second quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 67.7%, an increase of approximately 100 basis points over the prior-year quarter. This improvement was primarily due to positive price realization, synergies, manufacturing productivity and an increase in royalty revenue, partially offset by a mix, particularly increased sales of bioproduction and instruments. On a sequential basis, gross margin decreased by 60 basis points due to currency and increased sales of lower margin bioproduction products. 
Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% over prior year's levels to $341 million. This was as a result of headcount additions related to acquisitions and increase in depreciation resulting from capital expenditures associated with the AB and Invitrogen integration and currency. Sequentially, operating expenses declined 1%, mainly due to currency.
Non-GAAP operating income was $272 million, an increase of 19% over prior year, including the impact of currency, and 17% excluding currency. This quarter, operating margins reached a record level of 30.1% representing 290 basis points of improvement year-over-year. This operating margin expansion primarily resulted from improved gross margins and synergies.
In terms of other income line items, we had $1 million of interest income, $1 million from currency gains and interest expense for the quarter was $28 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 29.5%. Our diluted share count for the quarter was 191 million shares. As you will recall, our share count is impacted by our stock price in the quarter due to our convertible debt and employee stock options.
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.58, which includes $0.21 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.03 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB 14-1 and $0.09 per share of business integration costs and other items. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these items, diluted earnings per share was $0.91.
Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, our ending cash and short-term investments were $706 million. This compares to last quarter's balance of $642 million. Cash from operating activities was $228 million, capital expenditures were $25 million and free cash flow was $203 million. Included in our cash flow from operations is approximately $25 million of favorability associated with hedges on inter-company loans as a result of increased volatility and currency rates. Return on invested capital increased 40 basis points to 9%.
Our ending debt as of June 30 was approximately $2.64 billion. This balance is made up of our convertible debt of $1.1 billion and our senior notes of $1.5 billion. For the first half of 2010, revenue increased 8% organically, gross margins expanded 130 basis points and operating margins expanded 310 basis points. We feel good about our results thus far and are focused on continued execution in the second half of the year.
With that, I'll now move on to our expectations for the rest of this year. EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.50. Our full year guidance for organic revenue growth is unchanged and is still expected to be in the mid to high-single digits.
Given Greg's commentary on stimulus and end markets, I'll provide a bit more color on second half of  expectations. As a reminder, when we provided guidance in the beginning of the year, we stated that the difference between mid and high-single digit organic revenue growth was dependent on the amount of stimulus-related revenue that would be recognized during the year. We've not seen a notable increase in quarterly stimulus-related revenues since the third quarter of last year.  As a result, we expect second half organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. Revenue from prior acquisitions will add approximately one point to growth in each quarter. 
In terms of year-over-year comparables, keep in mind that in the second half of 2009, we had $15 million of H1N1 revenue per quarter, approximately $8 million to $9 million per quarter from the Japanese police order and stimulus revenues of $15 million.
Due to the volatility of currency rates over the last couple of months, I'll provide some detail on the expected impact of currency on our results. With rates as of June 30 and including the impact from our hedging programs, currency is expected to have a small negative impact on revenue, and no impact on EPS in the third quarter.
In the fourth quarter, currency is expected to have a negative three-point impact to revenue growth, and EPS is expected to be negatively impacted by $0.04 to $0.05. Q3 gross margins are expected to be lower sequentially due to lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower volume in the quarter and a decline in royalty revenue. Operating expenses in Q3 are expected to be approximately the same as in Q2. 
As we indicated on the last earnings call, we are reinvesting a portion of the operating-income impact from stimulus back into the business to fund future growth opportunities. These investments, which are primarily focused on R&D and commercial projects in emerging markets, began late in the second quarter and will continue through Q3. As a result, R&D expense as a percentage of sales in the third quarter will be slightly higher than our full year guidance. We continue to expect full year R&D expense to be 10% to 10.5% of revenue.
Q3 operating margins are expected to be approximately the same level as last year. For the full year, operating margin expansion is still expected to be within 175 to 225 basis points. We expect the average diluted share count for the second half of the year to be $192 million to $194 million shares assuming an average stock price between $45 and $50.
And finally, we've received a number of questions on our hedging programs as it relates to next year. Because of the continued uncertainty about the global economy and the resulting impact on exchange rates, we opted in June to continue with our currency hedging program in 2011. At this point, we have currency hedges in place for the first seven months of 2011 and intend to execute additional hedges each month until we are hedged for the full 12 months. Share repurchase program will be used to help mitigate the impact of currency on EPS.
And with that, I'll now hand the call back over to Eileen for Q&A.

And so that seemingly had a ripple effect through spending at the bench level on a company like ours towards the end of that second quarter. Now that's kind of a short-term reaction, and that's why our comments are that, perhaps that could persist a bit through the second half of the year. On long term, the second half of your question, it's unclear, but our opinion is that this side of government funding will probably remain intact. And it centers around what you said in that, the larger countries are committed to a agenda of innovation. And therefore, at least in their public pronouncements that we can understand, they have said they're going to ring fence innovation funding, and so again, we rely on that to say that over the next couple of years, the European business should do okay. So that's what we know at this point. We're not predicting dire consequences, and yet at the same time, we think the robust growth we saw in the last couple of years may be modulated a bit over the next couple of years.

So Forensics, Bioproduction, Animal Health, and those segments are growing very fast, and we see them continuing to grow as a percentage of the portfolio. So that's a good thing. Second, in terms of academic funding over the next couple of years, I think if you take my earlier comment, we think it's going to be okay. It's probably more of the funding environment we saw in the 2003 and '04 type of time frame, and we actually grew okay through that period by really focusing the portfolio on where the money would be spent. And I think that a very important point to be made is that all products aren't equal, and the funding does get directed then in a certain way and you just simply have to have the portfolio to capture it. So I think we're feeling pretty good that we'll be able to do well in the overall funding environment in the U.S. and Europe. And then lastly, importantly, is the geographic aspect, which is, we have built a very robust infrastructure across Asia. And I think you can see the benefits of that investment by our continued very strong growth across Asia. We are direct in a lot of the main countries. We're going ever more direct in all of the countries. We're building logistics centers across the region. And so geographically, we're exposed to where higher growth will be. So when you couple all of that together, Life Technologies will do fine over the next couple of years.

Coming off the heels of our Investor Day just a few weeks ago, we are going to keep our prepared comments short this morning. So let's get started. As you can see from our results, we delivered another",1094,"Thanks, Eileen, and thank you, all for joining us. Coming off the heels of our Investor Day just a few weeks ago, we are going to keep our prepared comments short this morning. 
So let's get started. As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth. Revenue grew 6% organically to $906 million, 8% excluding the impact of H1N1 sales in 2009. Operating margins expanded by 290 basis points to reach a record 30.1%, and earnings per share grew 15% to $0.91 for the quarter.
We are pleased with our results for the second quarter in the first half of the year, which are a reflection of the fundamental strength of the business and the essential nature of our product offering. I'd like to extend my thanks to our teams around the world for their commitment to excellence and relentless focus on execution.
As I do every quarter, I'll take a few moments to talk about these results, give you an update on the integration and provide some color on the strength of our end markets. First, we continue to be very focused on the integration, and I'm pleased to report good progress towards our goal of putting actions in place that will generate $175 million in annual synergies by the end of 2010. 
In the second quarter, we continue to execute on an integration plan, including the placement of over 50 dual-branded supply centers around the world and further optimization of our combined eBusiness platforms. We are seeing good traction from these efforts and achieve new records for the number of the total transactions, both in North America and globally, that will process through eCommerce channels.
In terms of synergy capture, these actions, as well as many others, will generate another $15 million in annualized synergies, getting it halfway to our full year goal. Looking ahead in the second half of the year, we will continue to optimize the programs already started, as well as implement new initiatives, including additional site consolidations and cities where we have multiple offices, continuing to build out the combined eBusiness platforms and optimizing our distribution network.
Now beyond these integration activities, Life Technologies is well positioned to capture opportunities that will continue to drive strong revenue growth. Commercial execution, coupled with a broad product offering of innovative tools ensures that our products are an essential part of our customers' workflows. Recent launches have gone very well. Customer response to Attune, our flow cytometry offering and the ViiA 7 PCR instrument have been very positive, and the sales of our latest CE instrumentation, the 3500, have reinvigorated that business. Since the launch of the 3500 in Q4 of last year, we have placed approximately 400 instruments and demand continues to be very robust.
I'll take a moment now to walk you through more notable points on Q2 performance and give some color on what we're seeing on our end markets. The Americas delivered 7% organic growth in the quarter, 10% without the impact of H1N1. End markets in the Americas remain strong, with pharma and biotech continuing to pick up steam. Evidenced by the strong demand for our discovery and assay services business and double-digit growth in bioproduction. On the research side, stimulus-related revenues for the quarter were approximately $10 million, about the same as we've seen in prior quarters.
Our outlook for the stimulus is unchanged. We continue to estimate that we will generate more than $100 million in stimulus-related revenue over the life of this program. However, since we have not observed the material ramp up in spending since the third quarter of last year, we estimate that stimulus-related revenues will be around $10 million per quarter in the second half of the year, with the rest of the benefit realized in 2011.
Europe grew 4% organically in the quarter. Growth for the quarter is slightly less than in recent periods due to the uncertainty about future government funding levels. At this time, we have no reason to believe that there will be declining government funding for our research in major European markets, such as U.K., Germany and France. However, some of our customers have reported that there have been delays in the release of funds from the institutions to researchers. In addition, researchers seem to be cautious in their spending due to fears that future funding may be curtailed. As a result, spending in these countries on both consumables and instruments softened towards the end of the quarter.
The situation in some of our smaller markets, such as Italy and Spain is slightly different. Funding in these countries have been negatively impacted to some degree as a result of the current economic environment. Revenue growth in these countries was flat during the second quarter. Looking forward to the second half, we expect that for the European region as a whole, revenue growth will be in the low-single digits or mid-single digits, excluding H1N1.
Moving on to other markets, Asia Pacific had another strong quarter, growing 19% organically. End markets in the Asia Pacific region remain healthy, particularly in India and greater China, which grew an excess of 30% in the quarter. We were well positioned in these markets to continue to drive robust growth.
There's no change in our outlook for Japan. In the second quarter, Japan declined 4% organically as a result of a very difficult year-over-year comparison. As a reminder, Q2 of last year included revenue from a large police order, as well as H1N1. Excluding these items, Japan grew 3%, in line with expectations.
Now before I hand it over to David, I'm pleased to announce earlier this week, our Board of Directors approved a two-year $350 million share repurchase program, which is consistent with our strategy of balanced capital deployment. We intend to begin repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter after we have redeemed the 2% convertible notes in August, and we are within our target leverage ratio of 2x to 2.5x EBITDA. In general, the timing and amount of purchases would depend on quarterly fluctuations in cash associated with operating cash flow, capital expenditures and further debt repayment. 
We remain committed to the financial goals we've outlined previously, and our priorities for cash remain the same. We will continue to pay down debt to keep our leverage within 2x to 2.5x EBITDA, as well as make investments in the business that will drive future growth, and then return excess cash to shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to David."
30253,109039325,70540,"Life Technologies Corporation, Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Life Technologies Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg. This quarter, revenue grew 8% to $906 million. Currency had a positive impact of 1.5 percentage points on reported revenue growth. And acquisitions and divestitures contributed 0.5 to growth. Excluding the impact from currency, acquisitions",1418,"Thanks, Greg. This quarter, revenue grew 8% to $906 million. Currency had a positive impact of 1.5 percentage points on reported revenue growth. And acquisitions and divestitures contributed 0.5 to growth. Excluding the impact from currency, acquisitions and divestitures, revenue grew 6% organically.
Genetic Systems had revenue of $235 million, representing 7% organic growth. Sales of CE instruments, including the new 3500 Genetic Analyzer, and sales of CE consumables to research and clinical labs grew in the mid single digits. This was partially offset by a year-over-year decline in CE instruments and consumables sold into the applied markets, as this business experienced a difficult year-over-year comparison due to the Japanese police order received in 2009.
Customer feedback on the SOLiD 4 and EZ Bead platforms continues to be very positive. As a result, the Next-Generation Sequencing business demonstrated strong double-digit growth during the quarter. At this point, approximately half of the installed base of SOLiD 3.5 instruments has been upgraded to the SOLiD 4 platform.
Molecular Biology Systems grew 2% organically to $434 million in revenue. Excluding H1N1-related revenue, organic growth was approximately 6%. Growth was driven by strong results in the Genomic Assays and Molecular Biology Reagents businesses. Demand for Genomic Assay products grew in the high single digits. The Molecular Biology Reagents business grew in the mid single digits and benefited from strong double-digit growth in Asia Pacific, particularly China.
Cell Systems had revenue of $230 million, representing 13% organic growth with strong demand across the portfolio. Double-digit growth in bioproduction was driven by continued improvement in demand from European and North American pharmaceutical customers, as well as the timing of large orders. The Dynal Beads business also benefited from an improvement in pharma, biotech and clinical diagnostic end markets, resulting in double-digit growth for the quarter. 
And lastly, our Primary and Stem Cell business grew in the midteens, driven by worldwide demand for both media and reagents. 
As I mentioned earlier, currency added 1.5 points of growth to revenue for the quarter, including the impact of our hedging program. The positive impact to EPS was approximately $0.04, including foreign currency effects accounted for in revenue and other income.
Moving on to other items. Second quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 67.7%, an increase of approximately 100 basis points over the prior-year quarter. This improvement was primarily due to positive price realization, synergies, manufacturing productivity and an increase in royalty revenue, partially offset by a mix, particularly, increased sales of bioproduction and instruments. On a sequential basis, gross margin decreased by 60 basis points due to currency and increased sales of lower margin bioproduction products. 
Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% over prior year's levels to $341 million. This was as a result of headcount additions related to acquisitions and increase in depreciation resulting from capital expenditures associated with the AB and Invitrogen integration and currency. Sequentially, operating expenses declined 1%, mainly due to currency.
Non-GAAP operating income was $272 million, an increase of 19% over prior year including the impact of currency and 17% excluding currency. This quarter, operating margins reached a record level of 30.1% representing 290 basis points of improvement year-over-year. This operating margin expansion primarily resulted from improved gross margins and synergies.
In terms of other income line items, we had $1 million of interest income, $1 million from currency gains and interest expense for the quarter was $28 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 29.5%. 
Our diluted share count for the quarter was 191 million shares. As you will recall, our share count is impacted by our stock price in the quarter due to our convertible debt and employee stock options. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.58, which includes $0.21 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.03 per share of noncash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB 14-1 and $0.09 per share of business integration costs and other items. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these items, diluted earnings per share was $0.91.
Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our ending cash and short-term investments were $706 million. This compares to last quarter's balance of $642 million. Cash from operating activities was $228 million, capital expenditures were $25 million and free cash flow was $203 million. Included in our cash flow from operations is approximately $25 million of favorability associated with hedges on inter-company loans as a result of increased volatility and currency rates. Return on invested capital increased 40 basis points to 9%. Our ending debt as of June 30 was approximately $2.64 billion. This balance is made up of our convertible debt of $1.1 billion and our senior notes of $1.5 billion. 
For the first half of 2010, revenue increased 8% organically, gross margins expanded 130 basis points and operating margins expanded 310 basis points. We feel good about our results thus far and are focused on continued execution in the second half of the year.
With that, I'll now move on to our expectations for the rest of this year. EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.50. Our full year guidance for organic revenue growth is unchanged and is still expected to be in the mid to high single digits.
Given Greg's commentary on stimulus and end markets, I'll provide a bit more color on second half of  expectations. As a reminder, when we provided guidance in the beginning of the year, we stated that the difference between mid and high single-digit organic revenue growth was dependent on the amount of stimulus-related revenue that would be recognized during the year. 
We've not seen a notable increase in quarterly stimulus-related revenues since the third quarter of last year. As a result, we expect second half organic revenue growth to be in the mid single digits. Revenue from prior acquisitions will add approximately one point to growth in each quarter. In terms of year-over-year comparables, keep in mind that in the second half of 2009, we had $15 million of H1N1 revenue per quarter, approximately $8 million to $9 million per quarter from the Japanese police order and stimulus revenues of $15 million.
Due to the volatility of currency rates over the last couple of months, I'll provide some detail on the expected impact of currency on our results. With rates as of June 30 and including the impact from our hedging programs, currency is expected to have a small negative impact on revenue, and no impact on EPS in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, currency is expected to have a negative three-point impact to revenue growth, and EPS is expected to be negatively impacted by $0.04 to $0.05. 
Q3 gross margins are expected to be lower sequentially due to lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower volume in the quarter and a decline in royalty revenue. Operating expenses in Q3 are expected to be approximately the same as in Q2. 
As we indicated on the last earnings call, we are reinvesting a portion of the operating-income impact from stimulus back into the business to fund future growth opportunities. These investments, which are primarily focused on R&D and commercial projects in emerging markets, began late in the second quarter and will continue through Q3. As a result, R&D expense as a percentage of sales in the third quarter will be slightly higher than our full year guidance. We continue to expect full year R&D expense to be 10% to 10.5% of revenue.
Q3 operating margins are expected to be approximately the same level as last year. For the full year, operating margin expansion is still expected to be within 175 to 225 basis points. We expect the average diluted share count for the second half of the year to be $192 million to $194 million shares assuming an average stock price between $45 and $50.
And finally, we've received a number of questions on our hedging programs as it relates to next year. Because of the continued uncertainty about the global economy and the resulting impact on exchange rates, we opted in June to continue with our currency hedging program in 2011. At this point, we have currency hedges in place for the first seven months of 2011 and intend to execute additional hedges each month until we are hedged for the full 12 months. Share repurchase program will be used to help mitigate the impact of currency on EPS.
And with that, I'll now hand the call back over to Eileen for Q&A."

And so that seemingly had a ripple effect through spending at the bench level on a company like ours towards the end of that second quarter. Now that's kind of a short-term reaction, and that's why our comments are that, perhaps that could persist a bit through the second half of the year. On long term, the second half of your question, it's unclear, but our opinion is that this side of government funding will probably remain intact. And it centers around what you said in that, the larger countries are committed to a agenda of innovation. And therefore, at least in their public pronouncements that we can understand, they have said they're going to ring fence innovation funding, and so again, we rely on that to say that over the next couple of years, the European business should do okay. So that's what we know at this point. We're not predicting dire consequences, and yet at the same time, we think the robust growth we saw in the last couple of years may be modulated a bit over the next couple of years."

It's probably more of the funding environment we saw in the 2003 and '04 type of time frame, and we actually grew okay through that period by really focusing the portfolio on where the money would be spent.

And then lastly, importantly, is the geographic aspect, which is, we have built a very robust infrastructure across Asia, and I think you can see the benefits of that investment by our continued very strong growth across Asia. We are direct in a lot of the main countries. We're going ever more direct in all of the countries. We're building logistics centers across the region, and so geographically, we're exposed to where higher growth will be. So when you couple all of that together, Life Technologies will do fine over the next couple of years."

Coming off the heels of our Investor Day just a few weeks ago, we are going to keep our prepared comments short this morning. So let's get started. As you can see from our results, we delivered another",1094,"Thanks, Eileen, and thank you, all for joining us. Coming off the heels of our Investor Day just a few weeks ago, we are going to keep our prepared comments short this morning. 
So let's get started. As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth. Revenue grew 6% organically to $906 million, 8% excluding the impact of H1N1 sales in 2009. Operating margins expanded by 290 basis points to reach a record 30.1%, and earnings per share grew 15% to $0.91 for the quarter.
We are pleased with our results for the second quarter in the first half of the year, which are a reflection of the fundamental strength of the business and the essential nature of our product offering. I'd like to extend my thanks to our teams around the world for their commitment to excellence and relentless focus on execution.
As I do every quarter, I'll take a few moments to talk about these results, give you an update on the integration and provide some color on the strength of our end markets. First, we continue to be very focused on the integration, and I'm pleased to report good progress towards our goal of putting actions in place that will generate $175 million in annual synergies by the end of 2010. 
In the second quarter, we continue to execute on an integration plan, including the placement of over 50 dual-branded supply centers around the world and further optimization of our combined eBusiness platforms. We are seeing good traction from these efforts and achieve new records for the number of the total transactions, both in North America and globally, that will process through eCommerce channels.
In terms of synergy capture, these actions, as well as many others, will generate another $15 million in annualized synergies, getting it halfway to our full year goal. Looking ahead in the second half of the year, we will continue to optimize the programs already started, as well as implement new initiatives, including additional site consolidations and cities where we have multiple offices, continuing to build out the combined eBusiness platforms and optimizing our distribution network.
Now beyond these integration activities, Life Technologies is well positioned to capture opportunities that will continue to drive strong revenue growth. Commercial execution, coupled with a broad product offering of innovative tools ensures that our products are an essential part of our customers' workflows. Recent launches have gone very well. Customer response to Attune, our flow cytometry offering and the ViiA 7 PCR instrument have been very positive, and the sales of our latest CE instrumentation, the 3500, have reinvigorated that business. Since the launch of the 3500 in Q4 of last year, we have placed approximately 400 instruments and demand continues to be very robust.
I'll take a moment now to walk you through more notable points on Q2 performance and give some color on what we're seeing on our end markets. The Americas delivered 7% organic growth in the quarter, 10% without the impact of H1N1. End markets in the Americas remain strong, with pharma and biotech continuing to pick up steam. Evidenced by the strong demand for our discovery and assay services business and double-digit growth in bioproduction. On the research side, stimulus-related revenues for the quarter were approximately $10 million, about the same as we've seen in prior quarters.
Our outlook for the stimulus is unchanged. We continue to estimate that we will generate more than $100 million in stimulus-related revenue over the life of this program. However, since we have not observed the material ramp up in spending since the third quarter of last year, we estimate that stimulus-related revenues will be around $10 million per quarter in the second half of the year, with the rest of the benefit realized in 2011.
Europe grew 4% organically in the quarter. Growth for the quarter is slightly less than in recent periods due to the uncertainty about future government funding levels. At this time, we have no reason to believe that there will be declining government funding for our research in major European markets, such as U.K., Germany and France. However, some of our customers have reported that there have been delays in the release of funds from the institutions to researchers. In addition, researchers seem to be cautious in their spending due to fears that future funding may be curtailed. As a result, spending in these countries on both consumables and instruments softened towards the end of the quarter.
The situation in some of our smaller markets, such as Italy and Spain is slightly different. Funding in these countries have been negatively impacted to some degree as a result of the current economic environment. Revenue growth in these countries was flat during the second quarter. Looking forward to the second half, we expect that for the European region as a whole, revenue growth will be in the low-single digits or mid-single digits, excluding H1N1.
Moving on to other markets, Asia Pacific had another strong quarter, growing 19% organically. End markets in the Asia Pacific region remain healthy, particularly in India and greater China, which grew an excess of 30% in the quarter. We were well positioned in these markets to continue to drive robust growth.
There's no change in our outlook for Japan. In the second quarter, Japan declined 4% organically as a result of a very difficult year-over-year comparison. As a reminder, Q2 of last year included revenue from a large police order, as well as H1N1. Excluding these items, Japan grew 3%, in line with expectations.
Now before I hand it over to David, I'm pleased to announce earlier this week, our Board of Directors approved a two-year $350 million share repurchase program, which is consistent with our strategy of balanced capital deployment. We intend to begin repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter after we have redeemed the 2% convertible notes in August, and we are within our target leverage ratio of 2x to 2.5x EBITDA. In general, the timing and amount of purchases would depend on quarterly fluctuations in cash associated with operating cash flow, capital expenditures and further debt repayment. 
We remain committed to the financial goals we've outlined previously, and our priorities for cash remain the same. We will continue to pay down debt to keep our leverage within 2x to 2.5x EBITDA, as well as make investments in the business that will drive future growth, and then return excess cash to shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to David."

This quarter, revenue grew 8% to $906 million. Currency had a positive impact of 1.5 percentage points on reported revenue growth. And acquisitions and divestitures contributed 0.5 to growth. Excluding the impact from currency, acquisitions",1418,"Thanks, Greg. This quarter, revenue grew 8% to $906 million. Currency had a positive impact of 1.5 percentage points on reported revenue growth. And acquisitions and divestitures contributed 0.5 to growth. Excluding the impact from currency, acquisitions and divestitures, revenue grew 6% organically.
Genetic Systems had revenue of $235 million, representing 7% organic growth. Sales of CE instruments, including the new 3500 Genetic Analyzer, and sales of CE consumables to research and clinical labs grew in the mid single digits. This was partially offset by a year-over-year decline in CE instruments and consumables sold into the applied markets, as this business experienced a difficult year-over-year comparison due to the Japanese police order received in 2009.
Customer feedback on the SOLiD 4 and EZ Bead platforms continues to be very positive. As a result, the Next-Generation Sequencing business demonstrated strong double-digit growth during the quarter. At this point, approximately half of the installed base of SOLiD 3.5 instruments has been upgraded to the SOLiD 4 platform.
Molecular Biology Systems grew 2% organically to $434 million in revenue. Excluding H1N1-related revenue, organic growth was approximately 6%. Growth was driven by strong results in the Genomic Assays and Molecular Biology Reagents businesses. Demand for Genomic Assay products grew in the high single digits. The Molecular Biology Reagents business grew in the mid single digits and benefited from strong double-digit growth in Asia Pacific, particularly China.
Cell Systems had revenue of $230 million, representing 13% organic growth with strong demand across the portfolio. Double-digit growth in bioproduction was driven by continued improvement in demand from European and North American pharmaceutical customers, as well as the timing of large orders. The Dynal Beads business also benefited from an improvement in pharma, biotech and clinical diagnostic end markets, resulting in double-digit growth for the quarter. 
And lastly, our Primary and Stem Cell business grew in the midteens, driven by worldwide demand for both media and reagents. 
As I mentioned earlier, currency added 1.5 points of growth to revenue for the quarter, including the impact of our hedging program. The positive impact to EPS was approximately $0.04, including foreign currency effects accounted for in revenue and other income.
Moving on to other items. Second quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 67.7%, an increase of approximately 100 basis points over the prior-year quarter. This improvement was primarily due to positive price realization, synergies, manufacturing productivity and an increase in royalty revenue, partially offset by a mix, particularly, increased sales of bioproduction and instruments. On a sequential basis, gross margin decreased by 60 basis points due to currency and increased sales of lower margin bioproduction products. 
Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% over prior year's levels to $341 million. This was as a result of headcount additions related to acquisitions and increase in depreciation resulting from capital expenditures associated with the AB and Invitrogen integration and currency. Sequentially, operating expenses declined 1%, mainly due to currency.
Non-GAAP operating income was $272 million, an increase of 19% over prior year including the impact of currency and 17% excluding currency. This quarter, operating margins reached a record level of 30.1% representing 290 basis points of improvement year-over-year. This operating margin expansion primarily resulted from improved gross margins and synergies.
In terms of other income line items, we had $1 million of interest income, $1 million from currency gains and interest expense for the quarter was $28 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 29.5%. 
Our diluted share count for the quarter was 191 million shares. As you will recall, our share count is impacted by our stock price in the quarter due to our convertible debt and employee stock options. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.58, which includes $0.21 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.03 per share of noncash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB 14-1 and $0.09 per share of business integration costs and other items. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these items, diluted earnings per share was $0.91.
Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our ending cash and short-term investments were $706 million. This compares to last quarter's balance of $642 million. Cash from operating activities was $228 million, capital expenditures were $25 million and free cash flow was $203 million. Included in our cash flow from operations is approximately $25 million of favorability associated with hedges on inter-company loans as a result of increased volatility and currency rates. Return on invested capital increased 40 basis points to 9%. Our ending debt as of June 30 was approximately $2.64 billion. This balance is made up of our convertible debt of $1.1 billion and our senior notes of $1.5 billion. 
For the first half of 2010, revenue increased 8% organically, gross margins expanded 130 basis points and operating margins expanded 310 basis points. We feel good about our results thus far and are focused on continued execution in the second half of the year.
With that, I'll now move on to our expectations for the rest of this year. EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.50. Our full year guidance for organic revenue growth is unchanged and is still expected to be in the mid to high single digits.
Given Greg's commentary on stimulus and end markets, I'll provide a bit more color on second half of  expectations. As a reminder, when we provided guidance in the beginning of the year, we stated that the difference between mid and high single-digit organic revenue growth was dependent on the amount of stimulus-related revenue that would be recognized during the year. 
We've not seen a notable increase in quarterly stimulus-related revenues since the third quarter of last year. As a result, we expect second half organic revenue growth to be in the mid single digits. Revenue from prior acquisitions will add approximately one point to growth in each quarter. In terms of year-over-year comparables, keep in mind that in the second half of 2009, we had $15 million of H1N1 revenue per quarter, approximately $8 million to $9 million per quarter from the Japanese police order and stimulus revenues of $15 million.
Due to the volatility of currency rates over the last couple of months, I'll provide some detail on the expected impact of currency on our results. With rates as of June 30 and including the impact from our hedging programs, currency is expected to have a small negative impact on revenue, and no impact on EPS in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, currency is expected to have a negative three-point impact to revenue growth, and EPS is expected to be negatively impacted by $0.04 to $0.05. 
Q3 gross margins are expected to be lower sequentially due to lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower volume in the quarter and a decline in royalty revenue. Operating expenses in Q3 are expected to be approximately the same as in Q2. 
As we indicated on the last earnings call, we are reinvesting a portion of the operating-income impact from stimulus back into the business to fund future growth opportunities. These investments, which are primarily focused on R&D and commercial projects in emerging markets, began late in the second quarter and will continue through Q3. As a result, R&D expense as a percentage of sales in the third quarter will be slightly higher than our full year guidance. We continue to expect full year R&D expense to be 10% to 10.5% of revenue.
Q3 operating margins are expected to be approximately the same level as last year. For the full year, operating margin expansion is still expected to be within 175 to 225 basis points. We expect the average diluted share count for the second half of the year to be $192 million to $194 million shares assuming an average stock price between $45 and $50.
And finally, we've received a number of questions on our hedging programs as it relates to next year. Because of the continued uncertainty about the global economy and the resulting impact on exchange rates, we opted in June to continue with our currency hedging program in 2011. At this point, we have currency hedges in place for the first seven months of 2011 and intend to execute additional hedges each month until we are hedged for the full 12 months. Share repurchase program will be used to help mitigate the impact of currency on EPS.
And with that, I'll now hand the call back over to Eileen for Q&A."

And so that seemingly had a ripple effect through spending at the bench level on a company like ours towards the end of that second quarter. Now that's kind of a short-term reaction, and that's why our comments are that, perhaps that could persist a bit through the second half of the year. On long term, the second half of your question, it's unclear, but our opinion is that this side of government funding will probably remain intact. And it centers around what you said in that, the larger countries are committed to a agenda of innovation. And therefore, at least in their public pronouncements that we can understand, they have said they're going to ring fence innovation funding, and so again, we rely on that to say that over the next couple of years, the European business should do okay. So that's what we know at this point. We're not predicting dire consequences, and yet at the same time, we think the robust growth we saw in the last couple of years may be modulated a bit over the next couple of years."

There will be changes in how the funding actually gets spent, and we certainly saw this earlier in the Bush administration and I think we learned pretty smartly on how to navigate that.

Second, in terms of academic funding over the next couple of years, I think if you take my earlier comment, we think it's going to be okay. It's probably more of the funding environment we saw in the 2003 and '04 type of time frame, and we actually grew okay through that period by really focusing the portfolio on where the money would be spent. And I think that's a very important point to be made is that all products aren't equal, and the funding does get directed then in a certain way and you just simply have to have the portfolio to capture it. So I think we're feeling pretty good that we'll be able to do well in the overall funding environment in the U.S. and Europe. And then lastly, importantly, is the geographic aspect, which is, we have built a very robust infrastructure across Asia, and I think you can see the benefits of that investment by our continued very strong growth across Asia. We are direct in a lot of the main countries. We're going ever more direct in all of the countries.

I hope you had a chance to review the press release that we issued earlier today. As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth.
Revenue grew 6% organically to $869 million. And excluding the impact from the H1N1 pandemic, as well as the very large forensics deal for the Japanese police, organic revenue grew 9% for the quarter, driven by strong demand for both instruments and consumables across all of our customer end markets. Operating margins expanded by 170 basis points to reach 29%, and earnings per share grew 19% to $0.87 for the quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, organic revenue has grown 7.5% over prior year, 9.5% excluding H1N1 and that Japanese police forensics deal. Operating margins have expanded by 270 basis points. These are terrific results for the third quarter and for the year-to-date and is a testament to the execution mindset of our teams from around the world.
Now this quarter marks the 16th quarter in a row that we have exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom line. I'm particularly proud of this achievement as it demonstrates ability and commitment to deliver consistent, strong financial results to our shareholders.
Since 2007, EPS has grown at a compounded annual rate of 19% from $2.03 to the current consensus of $3.43, and free cash flow has more than doubled. Looking forward, you can expect the same focus on execution and commitment to great results as you've seen in the past.
This management team has built an incredibly unique business that is proven to be resilient enough to manage through the ups and the downs of the market that naturally occur over the years. With opportunities for both revenue growth and margin expansion that we see in the horizon, there's just no reason to believe that we will do anything but strengthen our position, allowing us to deliver double-digit organic earnings growth per share in 2011 and the foreseeable future.
Let me share with you our thinking about how we will deliver on this promise by walking you through a little bit of history. Over the last two years, we've been taking very deliberate average action to set the stage for our future. The planning process began actually several years ago when we set out to create optimal portfolio products. Today, we believe we had the best mix by far in the Life Science tools industry. 20% of our revenue is derived from proprietary instruments, which drive demand for the higher-margin consumables that make up the remaining 80% of our revenue stream. The consumables portion of our portfolio provides stability and add to the resiliency of the company over time. In addition, specific investments we've made over the last few years have refreshened certain aspects of our portfolio, such as PCR, and laid the groundwork for Life Technologies to build leading positions in areas such as synthetic biology and genomic medicine. With the recent close of the Ion Torrent deal, our portfolio optimization is largely now complete. The stage is set for us to leverage this industry-leading portfolio for significant growth.
The balance of our product portfolio is only part of the story. Our revenues are also diversified by region, affording us a certain level of protection in periods where weakness in any one region could negatively impact a less resilient business. As a result, we've been able to grow to some relatively challenging periods in the last few years.
Since 2007, Life Technologies has grown organic revenues each and every quarter between 5% and 11%, even during some very difficult funding environment and when the overall market was flat or declining for our competitors. In order to manage regional expansion and the overall growth in volume we have experienced, we have reinvested in the business to build a scalable infrastructure so that new products and technologies could be easily incorporated into our network.
Since 2007, we have consolidated eight ERPs into two main systems and grown our e-commerce platforms to the point where over 50% of our global transactions are processed through this high-margin channel of the web b2b connection in automated supply centers. Our investment in emerging markets, such as China and India, have enabled us to build out direct sales channels and distribution networks to build and meet the needs of these customers and their growing supply demands.
As a result of this effort, Life Technologies' unparalleled scale and scope in its commercial, manufacturing distribution capabilities around the globe.
So with the infrastructure now in place, we look to refine and optimize their operations. Again, since 2007, operating margins have increased 390 basis points from 24.9% to the 2010 consensus estimate of 28.8%. But there is still a lot of room for improvement here. Over the next three years, we will continue to drive significant margin expansion to very specific programs, designed to capture productivity in manufacturing, distribution and our supply chain.
The creation of multi-mix manufacturing site is a very good example of the programs we're working on. Our substantial expansion of the Frederick, Maryland  Campus and the continued growth of our Singaporean operations this year are key to this trust. Through these efforts and others like them, we can maximize operational productivity and expect to be able to deliver margins in excess of 31% in 2013.
While we are executing on the strategies that I have described to you today, we are also laying the groundwork for future revenue growth. Researchers in every field of science use our products to perform the fundamental research that advances scientific discovery. Over the next few years, we will leverage our strength in R&D and manufacturing to launch thousands of innovative products in the fastest-growing areas of research.
We also see a very bright future in applied markets, where for a relatively low cost, we can adapt the technologies used in biological research for use in fast-growing industries, such as forensics, and food and water testing. Over the next few years, we will be focused on building out industry-leading franchises in high-growth technology areas, applied markets and emerging geographies, all of which will be key drivers of growth for the company going forward.
One of the greatest benefits of our portfolio is that our product mix heavily weighted towards high-volume, higher-margin consumables allows us to generate significant free cash flow on a very consistent and predictable basis. Since the acquisition of Applied Biosystems, our priorities for the deployment of this cash have been to pay down debt, invest in the business and then return any excess cash to shareholders.
At the end of Q3, we reached our target debt levels, and with the recent acquisition of Ion Torrent, we believe our product portfolio is where it needs to be to drive significant future growth. In keeping with our philosophy of balanced capital deployment, the level of investment to acquire technologies will now come down in the next 24 months to approximately $100 million or so per year. After we have serviced our debt requirement, excess cash will be returned to shareholders.
So I've given you a little insight on what we've been working towards and more importantly, some thoughts in the future and what we can achieve. We'll go into more detail of our specific plans in the Q4 call in February, but suffice it to say, we are very optimistic about the future and confident in our ability to deliver on our financial goals in the very same consistent fashion that we have now done in the past. The track record is proven. 
Thanks. And with that, I'll hand it over to David to give you an update on the integration and more details on our  financial results for the third quarter."
30253,114142881,81912,"Life Technologies Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Life Technologies Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg. This quarter, revenue grew 8% to $869 million. Currency had a positive 0.5 impact on reported revenue growth, and acquisitions added 1.5 points. Excluding the impact from currency, acquisitions and divestitures, revenue grew 6%, and grew 9%",1542,"Thanks, Greg. This quarter, revenue grew 8% to $869 million. Currency had a positive 0.5 impact on reported revenue growth, and acquisitions added 1.5 points. Excluding the impact from currency, acquisitions and divestitures, revenue grew 6%, and grew 9% also excluding the impact of H1N1 and the Japanese police deal.
Moving on to the divisional results, the Genetic Systems division had revenues of $227 million, representing 12% organic growth. Overall, sales of CE instruments and consumables grew 5% for the quarter, driven by high-single digit growth in consumables and continued strong demand for our recently launched 3500 Genetic Analyzer.
Growth in this business was negatively impacted by a difficult year-over-year comparison, resulting from last year's Japanese police order. Excluding the impact of this order, overall sales of CE instruments and consumables grew 9% for the quarter.
The CE business has proven to be incredibly resilient and continues to be the gold standard for many sequencing applications, not only in research, but increasingly in forensics and other applied markets.
Sales of CE consumables and instruments into hospital clinics and labs for diagnostic testing are particularly strong and have been a major driver of growth for the 3500 instrument. 
Lastly, the Next Generation Sequencing business demonstrated very strong double-digit growth during the quarter, driven by record sales of the SOLiD 4 system. Molecular Biology Systems had revenue of $415 million, flat to last year. However, excluding H1N1-related revenue, organic growth was approximately 4%, driven by strong demand for Genomic Assays and the recently launched ViiA 7 PCR instrument.
Customer reaction to the ViiA 7 has been very positive, and this is the first of several innovations that will refresh our entire qPCR franchise.
Shelf systems had revenue of $221 million, representing 15% organic growth. Growth was driven by strong demand across the portfolio. The Bioproduction, Dynal Beads and Stem Cell businesses all delivered double-digit growth in the quarter.
Organic growth by region in the quarter was as follows: The Americas grew 8%; Europe 5%; Asia-Pacific 7%; and Japan declined 1%. Excluding the impact of H1N1 and the Japanese police order, the Americas grew 10%, Europe 6%, Japan 13% and Asia-Pacific 11%.
Revenue growth in the Asia-Pacific region is slightly lower than in the past due to the timing of orders and a slowdown in order processing associated with an information systems implementation. This is similar to what we experienced when we implemented systems in Europe and the U.S. The project is now largely complete, and we expect fourth quarter growth for the region to return to historical levels.
In line with expectations, stimulus-related revenues for the third quarter were approximately $10 million. We also expect $10 million of stimulus-related revenue in the fourth quarter, the same level as prior year.
Moving on to other items. Third quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 66.8%, largely unchanged from the same period last year. Higher price and synergies were offset by mix, particularly increased sales of bioproduction and instruments.
On a sequential basis, gross margin declined by 90 basis points, primarily due to lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower volume in the quarter.
Third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% over prior year levels to $328 million. The increase was a result of acquisition-related headcount additions and an increase in depreciation, resulting from integration-related capital expenditures. Sequentially, operating expenses declined 4% as a result of cost controls implemented in the quarter, including a slowdown in spending on some commercial projects in our emerging markets.
These projects, such as building out our e-commerce platforms in Asia, are expected to ramp back up in the fourth quarter.
Non-GAAP operating income was $252 million, an increase of 15% over prior year, including the impact of currency, and 12% excluding currency. Third quarter operating margins were 29.0%, representing 170 basis points of improvement year-over-year. Operating margin expansion, primarily resulted from synergies and other operating expense reductions.
In terms of other income line items, we had $1 million of interest income, a loss of $5 million from currency, and interest expense for the quarter was $27 million.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 25.8%. The tax rate is lower in the quarter due to the benefit of a one-time savings associated with the consolidation of foreign entities. This contributed approximately $0.02 to EPS.
Other items contributing to the lower tax rate are the settlement of prior year IRS audits and an adjustment to account for a higher portion of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions. These other items contributed an additional $0.02 to earnings per share.
Our diluted share count for the quarter was $190.1 million. As you will recall, our share count is impacted by our stock price due to our convertible debt and employee stock options.
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.56, which includes $0.22 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.03 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB14-1 and $0.06 per share of business integration costs and other items. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these items, diluted earnings per share was $0.87.
Moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow. Our ending cash and short-term investments were $537 million. This compares to last quarter's balance of $706 million. Cash from operating activities was $215 million. Capital expenditures were $28 million, and free cash flow was $187 million.
Return on invested capital increased 20 basis points to 9.2%. We remain on track to achieve our goal of 10% ROIC by 2012.
Our ending debt as of September 30 was approximately $2.3 billion. This balance is made up of our convertible debt of $800 million and senior notes of $1.5 billion. During the quarter, we retired $350 million of convertible debt.
As for our ongoing integration efforts, during the quarter, we executed plans to generate an additional $25 million in annualized synergies. Specific actions included the completion of the European back-office consolidation, site consolidations in Asia and the placement of approximately 90 dual-branded supply centers worldwide.
At this point, we're on track to meet our goal of $175 million in annualized run rate synergies by the end of the fourth quarter, a year ahead of schedule.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits, but slightly lower than the third quarter due to a difficult year-over-year comparison. As a reminder, organic growth in the fourth quarter of last year was 11% as a result of several large one-time items. Revenue from acquisitions will add approximately 1.5 points to growth in the quarter. 
Due to the volatility of currency rates over the last couple of months, our estimate of the impact of currency on fourth quarter results has changed. As of September 30 rates, currency is expected to be neutral to the fourth quarter revenue growth and EPS.
Q4 gross margins are expected to be lower sequentially due to the impact of mix and lower price realization. Operating expenses in Q4 are expected to increase sequentially due to projects and activities that were delayed in the third quarter, acquisition-related expenses and increased depreciation from integration-related capital expenditures. Operating margins for the quarter are expected to expand approximately 150 basis points year-over-year.
The fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 29.5%, and the full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 29%, excluding any impact from the R&D tax credit. If the R&D tax credit is extended, then the full year tax rate will be reduced by approximately a point to 28%, and that would add $0.02 to earnings per share.  Our full year EPS guidance does not include any benefit from the tax credit.
Average diluted shares in the fourth quarter are expected to range from 191 million to 192 million, assuming an average stock price of between $46 and $50 a share. To date, we've repurchased 2.7 million shares at a cost of approximately $128 million, and are on track to complete the $350 million repurchase authorization and the repurchase of shares associated with the Ion Torrent transaction by the end of the year.
As Greg mentioned earlier, we're proud of our results so far this year and feel good about our ability to deliver on our financial goals. We are nearing the end of a successful integration, and despite minimal impact from the stimulus, we are on track to deliver between $3.48 and $3.52 earnings per share for the year.
And finally, since the dollar has weakened considerably over the last few months, I'll give you an update on the expected impact from currency on our 2011 results. As a reminder, we have currency hedges in place for the first seven months of 2011. We do not intend to hedge the remaining five months of the year.
As of September month-end rates, EPS is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.12. In order to help you estimate the effect of currency for 2011, we've calculated the impact on earnings per share if all currencies moved by 5% versus the dollar.

We'll give much more detail about that and our plans next week at ASHG and update you on where we are both on the platforms and throughput, and very much is an upgrade of old parts for all our customers.

I hope you had a chance to review the press release that we issued earlier today.

I hope you had a chance to review the press release that we issued earlier today. As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth.
Revenue grew 6% organically to $869 million. And excluding the impact from the H1N1 pandemic, as well as the very large forensics deal for the Japanese police, organic revenue grew 9% for the quarter, driven by strong demand for both instruments and consumables across all of our customer end markets. Operating margins expanded by 170 basis points to reach 29%, and earnings per share grew 19% to $0.87 for the quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, organic revenue has grown 7.5% over prior year, 9.5% excluding H1N1 and that Japanese police forensics deal. Operating margins have expanded by 270 basis points. These are terrific results for the third quarter and for the year-to-date and is a testament to the execution mindset of our teams from around the world.
Now this quarter marks the 16th quarter in a row that we have exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom line. I'm particularly proud of this achievement as it demonstrates ability and commitment to deliver consistent, strong financial results to our shareholders.
Since 2007, EPS has grown at a compounded annual rate of 19% from $2.03 to the current consensus of $3.43, and free cash flow has more than doubled. Looking forward, you can expect the same focus on execution and commitment to great results as you've seen in the past.
This management team has built an incredibly unique business that is proven to be resilient enough to manage through the ups and the downs of the market that naturally occur over the years. With opportunities for both revenue growth and margin expansion that we see in the horizon, there's just no reason to believe that we will do anything but strengthen our position, allowing us to deliver double-digit organic earnings growth per share in 2011 and the foreseeable future.
Let me share with you our thinking about how we will deliver on this promise by walking you through a little bit of history. Over the last two years, we've been taking very deliberate average action to set the stage for our future. The planning process began actually several years ago when we set out to create optimal portfolio products. Today, we believe we had the best mix by far in the Life Science tools industry. 20% of our revenue is derived from proprietary instruments, which drive demand for the higher-margin consumables that make up the remaining 80% of our revenue stream. The consumables portion of our portfolio provides stability and add to the resiliency of the company over time. In addition, specific investments we've made over the last few years have refreshened certain aspects of our portfolio, such as PCR, and laid the groundwork for Life Technologies to build leading positions in areas such as synthetic biology and genomic medicine. With the recent close of the Ion Torrent deal, our portfolio optimization is largely now complete. The stage is set for us to leverage this industry-leading portfolio for significant growth.
The balance of our product portfolio is only part of the story. Our revenues are also diversified by region, affording us a certain level of protection in periods where weakness in any one region could negatively impact a less resilient business. As a result, we've been able to grow to some relatively challenging periods in the last few years.
Since 2007, Life Technologies has grown organic revenues each and every quarter between 5% and 11%, even during some very difficult funding environment and when the overall market was flat or declining for our competitors. In order to manage regional expansion and the overall growth in volume we have experienced, we have reinvested in the business to build a scalable infrastructure so that new products and technologies could be easily incorporated into our network.
Since 2007, we have consolidated eight ERPs into two main systems and grown our e-commerce platforms to the point where over 50% of our global transactions are processed through this high-margin channel of the web b2b connection in automated supply centers. Our investment in emerging markets, such as China and India, have enabled us to build out direct sales channels and distribution networks to build and meet the needs of these customers and their growing supply demands.
As a result of this effort, Life Technologies' unparalleled scale and scope in its commercial, manufacturing distribution capabilities around the globe.
So with the infrastructure now in place, we look to refine and optimize their operations. Again, since 2007, operating margins have increased 390 basis points from 24.9% to the 2010 consensus estimate of 28.8%. But there is still a lot of room for improvement here. Over the next three years, we will continue to drive significant margin expansion to very specific programs, designed to capture productivity in manufacturing, distribution and our supply chain.
The creation of multi-mix manufacturing site is a very good example of the programs we're working on. Our substantial expansion of the Frederick, Maryland  Campus and the continued growth of our Singaporean operations this year are key to this trust. Through these efforts and others like them, we can maximize operational productivity and expect to be able to deliver margins in excess of 31% in 2013.
While we are executing on the strategies that I have described to you today, we are also laying the groundwork for future revenue growth. Researchers in every field of science use our products to perform the fundamental research that advances scientific discovery. Over the next few years, we will leverage our strength in R&D and manufacturing to launch thousands of innovative products in the fastest-growing areas of research.
We also see a very bright future in applied markets, where for a relatively low cost, we can adapt the technologies used in biological research for use in fast-growing industries, such as forensics, and food and water testing. Over the next few years, we will be focused on building out industry-leading franchises in high-growth technology areas, applied markets and emerging geographies, all of which will be key drivers of growth for the company going forward.
One of the greatest benefits of our portfolio is that our product mix heavily weighted towards high-volume, higher-margin consumables allows us to generate significant free cash flow on a very consistent and predictable basis. Since the acquisition of Applied Biosystems, our priorities for the deployment of this cash have been to pay down debt, invest in the business and then return any excess cash to shareholders.
At the end of Q3, we reached our target debt levels, and with the recent acquisition of Ion Torrent, we believe our product portfolio is where it needs to be to drive significant future growth. In keeping with our philosophy of balanced capital deployment, the level of investment to acquire technologies will now come down in the next 24 months to approximately $100 million or so per year. After we have serviced our debt requirement, excess cash will be returned to shareholders.
So I've given you a little insight on what we've been working towards and more importantly, some thoughts in the future and what we can achieve. We'll go into more detail of our specific plans in the Q4 call in February, but suffice it to say, we are very optimistic about the future and confident in our ability to deliver on our financial goals in the very same consistent fashion that we have now done in the past. The track record is proven. 
Thanks. And with that, I'll hand it over to David to give you an update on the integration and more details on our  financial results for the third quarter.

This quarter, revenue grew 8% to $869 million. Currency had a positive 0.5 impact on reported revenue growth, and acquisitions added 1.5 points. Excluding the impact from currency, acquisitions and divestitures, revenue grew 6%, and grew 9%",1542,"Thanks, Greg. This quarter, revenue grew 8% to $869 million. Currency had a positive 0.5 impact on reported revenue growth, and acquisitions added 1.5 points. Excluding the impact from currency, acquisitions and divestitures, revenue grew 6%, and grew 9% also excluding the impact of H1N1 and the Japanese police deal.
Moving on to the divisional results, the Genetic Systems division had revenues of $227 million, representing 12% organic growth. Overall, sales of CE instruments and consumables grew 5% for the quarter, driven by high-single digit growth in consumables and continued strong demand for our recently launched 3500 Genetic Analyzer.
Growth in this business was negatively impacted by a difficult year-over-year comparison, resulting from last year's Japanese police order. Excluding the impact of this order, overall sales of CE instruments and consumables grew 9% for the quarter.
The CE business has proven to be incredibly resilient and continues to be the gold standard for many sequencing applications, not only in research, but increasingly in forensics and other applied markets.
Sales of CE consumables and instruments into hospital clinics and labs for diagnostic testing are particularly strong and have been a major driver of growth for the 3500 instrument. 
Lastly, the Next Generation Sequencing business demonstrated very strong double-digit growth during the quarter, driven by record sales of the SOLiD 4 system. Molecular Biology Systems had revenue of $415 million, flat to last year. However, excluding H1N1-related revenue, organic growth was approximately 4%, driven by strong demand for Genomic Assays and the recently launched ViiA 7 PCR instrument.
Customer reaction to the ViiA 7 has been very positive, and this is the first of several innovations that will refresh our entire qPCR franchise.
Shelf systems had revenue of $221 million, representing 15% organic growth. Growth was driven by strong demand across the portfolio. The Bioproduction, Dynal Beads and Stem Cell businesses all delivered double-digit growth in the quarter.
Organic growth by region in the quarter was as follows: The Americas grew 8%; Europe 5%; Asia-Pacific 7%; and Japan declined 1%. Excluding the impact of H1N1 and the Japanese police order, the Americas grew 10%, Europe 6%, Japan 13% and Asia-Pacific 11%.
Revenue growth in the Asia-Pacific region is slightly lower than in the past due to the timing of orders and a slowdown in order processing associated with an information systems implementation. This is similar to what we experienced when we implemented systems in Europe and the U.S. The project is now largely complete, and we expect fourth quarter growth for the region to return to historical levels.
In line with expectations, stimulus-related revenues for the third quarter were approximately $10 million. We also expect $10 million of stimulus-related revenue in the fourth quarter, the same level as prior year.
Moving on to other items. Third quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 66.8%, largely unchanged from the same period last year. Higher price and synergies were offset by mix, particularly increased sales of bioproduction and instruments.
On a sequential basis, gross margin declined by 90 basis points, primarily due to lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower volume in the quarter.
Third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% over prior year levels to $328 million. The increase was a result of acquisition-related headcount additions and an increase in depreciation, resulting from integration-related capital expenditures. Sequentially, operating expenses declined 4% as a result of cost controls implemented in the quarter, including a slowdown in spending on some commercial projects in our emerging markets.
These projects, such as building out our e-commerce platforms in Asia, are expected to ramp back up in the fourth quarter.
Non-GAAP operating income was $252 million, an increase of 15% over prior year, including the impact of currency, and 12% excluding currency. Third quarter operating margins were 29.0%, representing 170 basis points of improvement year-over-year. Operating margin expansion, primarily resulted from synergies and other operating expense reductions.
In terms of other income line items, we had $1 million of interest income, a loss of $5 million from currency, and interest expense for the quarter was $27 million.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 25.8%. The tax rate is lower in the quarter due to the benefit of a one-time savings associated with the consolidation of foreign entities. This contributed approximately $0.02 to EPS.
Other items contributing to the lower tax rate are the settlement of prior year IRS audits and an adjustment to account for a higher portion of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions. These other items contributed an additional $0.02 to earnings per share.
Our diluted share count for the quarter was $190.1 million. As you will recall, our share count is impacted by our stock price due to our convertible debt and employee stock options.
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.56, which includes $0.22 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.03 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB14-1 and $0.06 per share of business integration costs and other items. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these items, diluted earnings per share was $0.87.
Moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow. Our ending cash and short-term investments were $537 million. This compares to last quarter's balance of $706 million. Cash from operating activities was $215 million. Capital expenditures were $28 million, and free cash flow was $187 million.
Return on invested capital increased 20 basis points to 9.2%. We remain on track to achieve our goal of 10% ROIC by 2012.
Our ending debt as of September 30 was approximately $2.3 billion. This balance is made up of our convertible debt of $800 million and senior notes of $1.5 billion. During the quarter, we retired $350 million of convertible debt.
As for our ongoing integration efforts, during the quarter, we executed plans to generate an additional $25 million in annualized synergies. Specific actions included the completion of the European back-office consolidation, site consolidations in Asia and the placement of approximately 90 dual-branded supply centers worldwide.
At this point, we're on track to meet our goal of $175 million in annualized run rate synergies by the end of the fourth quarter, a year ahead of schedule.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits, but slightly lower than the third quarter due to a difficult year-over-year comparison. As a reminder, organic growth in the fourth quarter of last year was 11% as a result of several large one-time items. Revenue from acquisitions will add approximately 1.5 points to growth in the quarter. 
Due to the volatility of currency rates over the last couple of months, our estimate of the impact of currency on fourth quarter results has changed. As of September 30 rates, currency is expected to be neutral to the fourth quarter revenue growth and EPS.
Q4 gross margins are expected to be lower sequentially due to the impact of mix and lower price realization. Operating expenses in Q4 are expected to increase sequentially due to projects and activities that were delayed in the third quarter, acquisition-related expenses and increased depreciation from integration-related capital expenditures. Operating margins for the quarter are expected to expand approximately 150 basis points year-over-year.
The fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 29.5%, and the full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 29%, excluding any impact from the R&D tax credit. If the R&D tax credit is extended, then the full year tax rate will be reduced by approximately a point to 28%, and that would add $0.02 to earnings per share.  Our full year EPS guidance does not include any benefit from the tax credit.
Average diluted shares in the fourth quarter are expected to range from 191 million to 192 million, assuming an average stock price of between $46 and $50 a share. To date, we've repurchased 2.7 million shares at a cost of approximately $128 million, and are on track to complete the $350 million repurchase authorization and the repurchase of shares associated with the Ion Torrent transaction by the end of the year.
As Greg mentioned earlier, we're proud of our results so far this year and feel good about our ability to deliver on our financial goals. We are nearing the end of a successful integration, and despite minimal impact from the stimulus, we are on track to deliver between $3.48 and $3.52 earnings per share for the year.
And finally, since the dollar has weakened considerably over the last few months, I'll give you an update on the expected impact from currency on our 2011 results. As a reminder, we have currency hedges in place for the first seven months of 2011. We do not intend to hedge the remaining five months of the year.
As of September month-end rates, EPS is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.12. In order to help you estimate the effect of currency for 2011, we've calculated the impact on earnings per share if all currencies moved by 5% versus the dollar. And our mix of foreign currencies stayed the same. In this case, the impact on earnings per share would be plus or minus $0.11.
And with that, I'll now hand the call back over to Eileen. Eileen?

I hope you had a chance to review the press release that we issued earlier today. As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth.Revenue grew 6% organi",1311,"Thanks, Eileen, and thank you all for joining us. I hope you had a chance to review the press release that we issued earlier today. As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth.
Revenue grew 6% organically to $869 million. And excluding the impact from the H1N1 pandemic, as well as the very large forensics deal for the Japanese police, organic revenue grew 9% for the quarter, driven by strong demand for both instruments and consumables across all of our customer end markets. Operating margins expanded by 170 basis points to reach 29%, and earnings per share grew 19% to $0.87 for the quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, organic revenue has grown 7.5% over prior year, 9.5% excluding H1N1 and that Japanese police forensics deal. Operating margins have expanded by 270 basis points. These are terrific results for the third quarter and for the year-to-date and is a testament to the execution mindset of our teams from around the world.
Now this quarter marks the 16th quarter in a row that we have exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom line. I'm particularly proud of this achievement as it demonstrates our ability and commitment to deliver consistent, strong financial results to our shareholders.
Since 2007, EPS has grown at a compounded annual rate of 19% from $2.03 to the current consensus of $3.43, and free cash flow has more than doubled. Looking forward, you can expect the same focus on execution and commitment to great results as you've seen in the past.
This management team has built an incredibly unique business that is proven to be resilient enough to manage through the ups and the downs of the market that naturally occur over the years. With the opportunities for both revenue growth and margin expansion that we see on the horizon, there's just no reason to believe that we will do anything but strengthen our position, allowing us to deliver double-digit organic earnings growth per share in 2011 and the foreseeable future.
Let me share with you our thinking about how we will deliver on this promise by walking you through a little bit of history. Over the last two years, we've been taking very deliberate action to set the stage for our future. The planning process began actually several years ago when we set out to create the optimal portfolio of products. Today, we believe that we have the best mix by far in the Life Science tools industry. 20% of our revenue is derived from proprietary instruments, which drive demand for the high-margin consumables that make up the remaining 80% of our revenue stream. The consumables portion of our portfolio provides stability and adds to the resiliency of the company over time. In addition, specific investments we've made over the last few years have refreshened certain aspects of our portfolio, such as PCR, and laid the groundwork for Life Technologies to build leading positions in areas such as synthetic biology and genomic medicine. With the recent close of the Ion Torrent deal, our portfolio optimization is largely now complete. The stage is set for us to leverage this industry-leading portfolio for significant growth.
The balance of our product portfolio is only part of the story. Our revenues are also diversified by region, affording us a certain level of protection in periods where weakness in any one region could negatively impact a less resilient business. As a result, we've been able to grow through some relatively challenging periods in the last few years.
Since 2007, Life Technologies has grown organic revenue each and every quarter between 5% and 11%, even during some very difficult funding environments and when the overall market was flat or declining for our competitors. In order to manage regional expansion and the overall growth in volume we have experienced, we have reinvested in the business to build a scalable infrastructure so that new products and technologies could be easily incorporated into our network.
Since 2007, we have consolidated eight ERPs into two main systems and grown our e-commerce platforms to the point where over 50% of our global transactions are processed through this high-margin channel of the Web B2B connection in automated supply centers. Our investment in emerging markets, such as China and India, have enabled us to build out direct sales channels and distribution networks to build and meet the needs of these customers and their growing supply demands.
As a result of these efforts, Life Technologies has unparalleled scale and scope in its commercial, manufacturing and distribution capabilities around the globe.
So with the infrastructure now in place, we look to refine and optimize our operations. Again, since 2007, operating margins have increased 390 basis points from 24.9% to the 2010 consensus estimate of 28.8%. But there is still a lot of room for improvement here. Over the next three years, we will continue to drive significant margin expansion through very specific programs, designed to capture productivity in manufacturing, distribution and our supply chain.
The creation of multi-mix manufacturing sites is a very good example of the programs we're working on. Our substantial expansion of the Frederick, Maryland campus and the continued growth of our Singaporean operations this year are key to this thrust. Through these efforts and others like them, we can maximize operational productivity and expect to be able to deliver margins in excess of 31% in 2013.
While we are executing on the strategies that I have described to you today, we are also laying the groundwork for future revenue growth. Researchers in every field of science use our products to perform the fundamental research that advances scientific discovery. Over the next few years, we will leverage our strength in R&D and manufacturing to launch thousands of innovative products in the fastest-growing areas of research.
We also see a very bright future in applied markets, where for a relatively low cost, we can adapt the technologies used in biological research for use in fast-growing industries, such as forensics and food and water testing. Over the next few years, we will be focused on building out industry-leading franchises in high-growth technology areas, applied markets and emerging geographies, all of which will be key drivers of growth for the company going forward.
One of the greatest benefits of our portfolio is that our product mix heavily weighted towards high-volume, high-margin consumables allows us to generate significant free cash flow on a very consistent and predictable basis. Since the acquisition of Applied Biosystems, our priorities for the deployment of this cash have been to pay down debt, invest in the business and then return any excess cash to shareholders.
At the end of Q3, we reached our target debt levels, and with the recent acquisition of Ion Torrent, we believe our product portfolio is where it needs to be to drive significant future growth. In keeping with our philosophy of balanced capital deployment, the level of investment to acquire technologies will now come down in the next 24 months to approximately $100 million or so per year. After we have serviced our debt requirement, excess cash will be returned to shareholders.
So I've given you a little insight on what we've been working towards and more importantly, some thoughts on the future and what we can achieve. We'll go into more detail of our specific plans in the Q4 call in February, but suffice it to say, we are very optimistic about the future and confident in our ability to deliver on our financial goals in the very same consistent fashion that we have now done in the past. The track record is proven. 
Thanks. And with that, I'll hand it over to David to give you an update on the integration and more details on our  financial results for the third quarter."
30253,114142881,81958,"Life Technologies Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Life Technologies Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg.

Currency had a positive half point impact on reported revenue growth, and acquisitions added 1½ points. Excluding the impact from currency, acquisitions and divestitures, revenue grew 6% and grew 9% also excluding the impact of H1N1 and the Japanese police deal.
Moving on to the divisional results, the Genetic Systems division had revenues of $227 million, representing 12% organic growth. Overall, sales of CE instruments and consumables grew 5% for the quarter, driven by high-single digit growth in consumables and continued strong demand for our recently launched 3500 Genetic Analyzer.
Growth in this business was negatively impacted by a difficult year-over-year comparison, resulting from last year's Japanese police order. Excluding the impact of this order, overall sales of CE instruments and consumables grew 9% for the quarter.
The CE business has proven to be incredibly resilient and continues to be the gold standard for many sequencing applications, not only in research, but increasingly in forensics and other applied markets.
Sales of CE consumables and instruments into hospital clinics and labs for diagnostic testing are particularly strong and have been a major driver of growth for the 3500 instrument. 
Lastly, the Next Generation Sequencing business demonstrated very strong double-digit growth during the quarter, driven by record sales of the SOLiD 4 system. Molecular Biology Systems had revenue of $415 million, flat to last year. However, excluding H1N1-related revenue, organic growth was approximately 4%, driven by strong demand for Genomic Assays and the recently launched ViiA 7 PCR instrument.
Customer reaction to the ViiA 7 has been very positive, and this is the first of several innovations that will refresh our entire qPCR franchise.
Shelf systems had revenue of $221 million, representing 15% organic growth. Growth was driven by strong demand across the portfolio. The Bioproduction, Dynal Beads and Stem Cell businesses all delivered double-digit growth in the quarter.
Organic growth by region in the quarter was as follows: The Americas grew 8%; Europe 5%; Asia-Pacific 7%; and Japan declined 1%. Excluding the impact of H1N1 and the Japanese police order, the Americas grew 10%, Europe 6%, Japan 13% and Asia-Pacific 11%.
Revenue growth in the Asia-Pacific region is slightly lower than in the past due to the timing of orders and a slowdown in order processing associated with an information systems implementation. This is similar to what we experienced when we implemented systems in Europe and the U.S. The project is now largely complete, and we expect fourth quarter growth for the region to return to historical levels.
In line with expectations, stimulus-related revenues for the third quarter were approximately $10 million. We also expect $10 million of stimulus-related revenue in the fourth quarter, the same level as prior year.
Moving on to other items. Third quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 66.8%, largely unchanged from the same period last year. Higher price and synergies were offset by mix, particularly increased sales of bioproduction and instruments.
On a sequential basis, gross margin declined by 90 basis points, primarily due to lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower volume in the quarter.
Third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% over prior year levels to $328 million. The increase was a result of acquisition-related headcount additions and an increase in depreciation, resulting from integration-related capital expenditures. Sequentially, operating expenses declined 4% as a result of cost controls implemented in the quarter, including a slowdown in spending on some commercial projects in our emerging markets.
These projects, such as building out our e-commerce platforms in Asia, are expected to ramp back up in the fourth quarter.
Non-GAAP operating income was $252 million, an increase of 15% over prior year, including the impact of currency, and 12% excluding currency. Third quarter operating margins were 29.0%, representing 170 basis points of improvement year-over-year. Operating margin expansion, primarily resulted from synergies and other operating expense reductions.
In terms of other income line items, we had $1 million of interest income, a loss of $5 million from currency, and interest expense for the quarter was $27 million.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 25.8%. The tax rate is lower in the quarter due to the benefit of a one-time savings associated with the consolidation of foreign entities. This contributed approximately $0.02 to EPS.
Other items contributing to the lower tax rate are the settlement of prior year IRS audits and an adjustment to account for a higher portion of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions. These other items contributed an additional $0.02 to earnings per share.
Our diluted share count for the quarter was $190.1 million. As you will recall, our share count is impacted by our stock price due to our convertible debt and employee stock options.
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.56, which includes $0.22 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.03 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB14-1 and $0.06 per share of business integration costs and other items. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these items, diluted earnings per share was $0.87.
Moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow. Our ending cash and short-term investments were $537 million. This compares to last quarter's balance of $706 million. Cash from operating activities was $215 million. Capital expenditures were $28 million, and free cash flow was $187 million.
Return on invested capital increased 20 basis points to 9.2%. We remain on track to achieve our goal of 10% ROIC by 2012.
Our ending debt as of September 30 was approximately $2.3 billion. This balance is made up of our convertible debt of $800 million and senior notes of $1.5 billion. During the quarter, we retired $350 million of convertible debt.
As for our ongoing integration efforts, during the quarter, we executed plans to generate an additional $25 million in annualized synergies. Specific actions included the completion of the European back-office consolidation, site consolidations in Asia and the placement of approximately 90 dual-branded supply centers worldwide.
At this point, we're on track to meet our goal of $175 million in annualized run rate synergies by the end of the fourth quarter, a year ahead of schedule.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits, but slightly lower than the third quarter due to a difficult year-over-year comparison. As a reminder, organic growth in the fourth quarter of last year was 11% as a result of several large one-time items. Revenue from acquisitions will add approximately 1½ points to growth in the quarter. 
Due to the volatility of currency rates over the last couple of months, our estimate of the impact of currency on fourth quarter results has changed. As of September 30 rates, currency is expected to be neutral to the fourth quarter revenue growth and EPS.
Q4 gross margins are expected to be lower sequentially due to the impact of mix and lower price realization. Operating expenses in Q4 are expected to increase sequentially due to projects and activities that were delayed in the third quarter, acquisition-related expenses and increased depreciation from integration-related capital expenditures. Operating margins for the quarter are expected to expand approximately 150 basis points year-over-year.
The fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 29.5%, and the full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 29%, excluding any impact from the R&D tax credit. If the R&D tax credit is extended, then the full year tax rate will be reduced by approximately a point to 28%, and that would add $0.02 to earnings per share. Our full year EPS guidance does not include any benefit from the tax credit.
Average diluted shares in the fourth quarter are expected to range from 191 million to 192 million, assuming an average stock price of between $46 and $50 a share. To date, we've repurchased 2.7 million shares at a cost of approximately $128 million and are on track to complete the $350 million repurchase authorization and the repurchase of shares associated with the Ion Torrent transaction by the end of the year.
As Greg mentioned earlier, we're proud of our results so far this year and feel good about our ability to deliver on our financial goals. We are nearing the end of a successful integration, and despite minimal impact from the stimulus, we are on track to deliver between $3.48 and $3.52 earnings per share for the year.
And finally, since the dollar has weakened considerably over the last few months, I'll give you an update on the expected impact from currency on our 2011 results. As a reminder, we have currency hedges in place for the first seven months of 2011. We do not intend to hedge the remaining five months of the year.
As of September month-end rates, EPS is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.12. In order to help you estimate the effect of currency for 2011, we've calculated the impact on earnings per share if all currencies moved by 5% versus the dollar, and our mix of foreign currencies stayed the same. In this case, the impact on earnings per share would be plus or minus $0.11.
And with that, I'll now hand the call back over to Eileen. Eileen?"

When we looked at Q3 at the end of Q2, there was some concern about weakness in Europe, what the impact would be in terms of sales elsewhere around the world. So we were cautious in terms of what our spending was. And we actually put some of the projects that we intended to begin on hold to get a better idea of what the revenue outlook was going to be. Good news is that revenues came in as we expected or better. And that, combined with lower spending, drove up our margins. What we're saying about Q4 is we're pretty confident in the outlook at this point. I think the markets and the funding around the world has stabilized from what it was at the end of Q2. And we plan to ramp back up some of those programs, particularly, some of the spending in commercial areas and on the Web in emerging markets."

I hope you had a chance to review the press release that we issued earlier today. As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth.
Revenue grew 6% organically to $869 million. And excluding the impact from the H1N1 pandemic, as well as the very large forensics deal for the Japanese police, organic revenue grew 9% for the quarter, driven by strong demand for both instruments and consumables across all of our customer end markets. Operating margins expanded by 170 basis points to reach 29%, and earnings per share grew 19% to $0.87 for the quarter.
On a year-to-date basis, organic revenue has grown 7.5% over prior year, 9.5% excluding H1N1 and that Japanese police forensics deal. Operating margins have expanded by 270 basis points. These are terrific results for the third quarter and for the year-to-date and is a testament to the execution mindset of our teams from around the world.
Now this quarter marks the 16th quarter in a row that we have exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom line. I'm particularly proud of this achievement as it demonstrates our ability and commitment to deliver consistent, strong financial results to our shareholders.
Since 2007, EPS has grown at a compounded annual rate of 19% from $2.03 to the current consensus of $3.43, and free cash flow has more than doubled. Looking forward, you can expect the same focus on execution and commitment to great results as you've seen in the past.
This management team has built an incredibly unique business that is proven to be resilient enough to manage through the ups and the downs of the market that naturally occur over the years. With the opportunities for both revenue growth and margin expansion that we see on the horizon, there's just no reason to believe that we will do anything but strengthen our position, allowing us to deliver double-digit organic earnings growth per share in 2011 and the foreseeable future.
Let me share with you our thinking about how we will deliver on this promise by walking you through a little bit of history. Over the last two years, we've been taking very deliberate action to set the stage for our future. The planning process began actually several years ago when we set out to create the optimal portfolio of products. Today, we believe that we have the best mix by far in the Life Science tools industry. 20% of our revenue is derived from proprietary instruments, which drive demand for the high-margin consumables that make up the remaining 80% of our revenue stream. The consumables portion of our portfolio provides stability and adds to the resiliency of the company over time. In addition, specific investments we've made over the last few years have refreshened certain aspects of our portfolio, such as PCR, and laid the groundwork for Life Technologies to build leading positions in areas such as synthetic biology and genomic medicine. With the recent close of the Ion Torrent deal, our portfolio optimization is largely now complete. The stage is set for us to leverage this industry-leading portfolio for significant growth.
The balance of our product portfolio is only part of the story. Our revenues are also diversified by region, affording us a certain level of protection in periods where weakness in any one region could negatively impact a less resilient business. As a result, we've been able to grow through some relatively challenging periods in the last few years.
Since 2007, Life Technologies has grown organic revenue each and every quarter between 5% and 11%, even during some very difficult funding environments and when the overall market was flat or declining for our competitors. In order to manage regional expansion and the overall growth in volume we have experienced, we have reinvested in the business to build a scalable infrastructure so that new products and technologies could be easily incorporated into our network.
Since 2007, we have consolidated eight ERPs into two main systems and grown our e-commerce platforms to the point where over 50% of our global transactions are processed through this high-margin channel of the Web B2B connection in automated supply centers. Our investment in emerging markets, such as China and India, have enabled us to build out direct sales channels and distribution networks to build and meet the needs of these customers and their growing supply demands.
As a result of these efforts, Life Technologies has unparalleled scale and scope in its commercial, manufacturing and distribution capabilities around the globe.
So with the infrastructure now in place, we look to refine and optimize our operations. Again, since 2007, operating margins have increased 390 basis points from 24.9% to the 2010 consensus estimate of 28.8%. But there is still a lot of room for improvement here. Over the next three years, we will continue to drive significant margin expansion through very specific programs, designed to capture productivity in manufacturing, distribution and our supply chain.
The creation of multi-mix manufacturing sites is a very good example of the programs we're working on. Our substantial expansion of the Frederick, Maryland campus and the continued growth of our Singaporean operations this year are key to this thrust. Through these efforts and others like them, we can maximize operational productivity and expect to be able to deliver margins in excess of 31% in 2013.
While we are executing on the strategies that I have described to you today, we are also laying the groundwork for future revenue growth. Researchers in every field of science use our products to perform the fundamental research that advances scientific discovery. Over the next few years, we will leverage our strength in R&D and manufacturing to launch thousands of innovative products in the fastest-growing areas of research.
We also see a very bright future in applied markets, where for a relatively low cost, we can adapt the technologies used in biological research for use in fast-growing industries, such as forensics and food and water testing. Over the next few years, we will be focused on building out industry-leading franchises in high-growth technology areas, applied markets and emerging geographies, all of which will be key drivers of growth for the company going forward.
One of the greatest benefits of our portfolio is that our product mix heavily weighted towards high-volume, high-margin consumables allows us to generate significant free cash flow on a very consistent and predictable basis. Since the acquisition of Applied Biosystems, our priorities for the deployment of this cash have been to pay down debt, invest in the business and then return any excess cash to shareholders.
At the end of Q3, we reached our target debt levels, and with the recent acquisition of Ion Torrent, we believe our product portfolio is where it needs to be to drive significant future growth. In keeping with our philosophy of balanced capital deployment, the level of investment to acquire technologies will now come down in the next 24 months to approximately $100 million or so per year. After we have serviced our debt requirement, excess cash will be returned to shareholders.
So I've given you a little insight on what we've been working towards and more importantly, some thoughts on the future and what we can achieve. We'll go into more detail of our specific plans in the Q4 call in February, but suffice it to say, we are very optimistic about the future and confident in our ability to deliver on our financial goals in the very same consistent fashion that we have now done in the past. The track record is proven. 
Thanks. And with that, I'll hand it over to David to give you an update on the integration and more details on our  financial results for the third quarter."
30253,114142881,82052,"Life Technologies Corporation, Q3 2010 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2010",2010-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Life Technologies Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg.

Currency had a positive half point impact on reported revenue growth, and acquisitions added 1½ points. Excluding the impact from currency, acquisitions and divestitures, revenue grew 6% and grew 9% also excluding the impact of H1N1 and the Japanese police deal.
Moving on to the divisional results, the Genetic Systems division had revenues of $227 million, representing 12% organic growth. Overall, sales of CE instruments and consumables grew 5% for the quarter, driven by high-single digit growth in consumables and continued strong demand for our recently launched 3500 Genetic Analyzer.
Growth in this business was negatively impacted by a difficult year-over-year comparison, resulting from last year's Japanese police order. Excluding the impact of this order, overall sales of CE instruments and consumables grew 9% for the quarter.
The CE business has proven to be incredibly resilient and continues to be the gold standard for many sequencing applications, not only in research, but increasingly in forensics and other applied markets.
Sales of CE consumables and instruments into hospital clinics and labs for diagnostic testing are particularly strong and have been a major driver of growth for the 3500 instrument. 
Lastly, the Next Generation Sequencing business demonstrated very strong double-digit growth during the quarter, driven by record sales of the SOLiD 4 system. Molecular Biology Systems had revenue of $415 million, flat to last year. However, excluding H1N1-related revenue, organic growth was approximately 4%, driven by strong demand for Genomic Assays and the recently launched ViiA 7 PCR instrument.
Customer reaction to the ViiA 7 has been very positive, and this is the first of several innovations that will refresh our entire qPCR franchise.
Shelf systems had revenue of $221 million, representing 15% organic growth. Growth was driven by strong demand across the portfolio. The Bioproduction, Dynal Beads and Stem Cell businesses all delivered double-digit growth in the quarter.
Organic growth by region in the quarter was as follows: The Americas grew 8%; Europe 5%; Asia-Pacific 7%; and Japan declined 1%. Excluding the impact of H1N1 and the Japanese police order, the Americas grew 10%, Europe 6%, Japan 13% and Asia-Pacific 11%.
Revenue growth in the Asia-Pacific region is slightly lower than in the past due to the timing of orders and a slowdown in order processing associated with an information systems implementation. This is similar to what we experienced when we implemented systems in Europe and the U.S. The project is now largely complete, and we expect fourth quarter growth for the region to return to historical levels.
In line with expectations, stimulus-related revenues for the third quarter were approximately $10 million. We also expect $10 million of stimulus-related revenue in the fourth quarter, the same level as prior year.
Moving on to other items. Third quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 66.8%, largely unchanged from the same period last year. Higher price and synergies were offset by mix, particularly increased sales of bioproduction and instruments.
On a sequential basis, gross margin declined by 90 basis points, primarily due to lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower volume in the quarter.
Third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% over prior year levels to $328 million. The increase was a result of acquisition-related headcount additions and an increase in depreciation, resulting from integration-related capital expenditures. Sequentially, operating expenses declined 4% as a result of cost controls implemented in the quarter, including a slowdown in spending on some commercial projects in our emerging markets.
These projects, such as building out our e-commerce platforms in Asia, are expected to ramp back up in the fourth quarter.
Non-GAAP operating income was $252 million, an increase of 15% over prior year, including the impact of currency, and 12% excluding currency. Third quarter operating margins were 29.0%, representing 170 basis points of improvement year-over-year. Operating margin expansion, primarily resulted from synergies and other operating expense reductions.
In terms of other income line items, we had $1 million of interest income, a loss of $5 million from currency, and interest expense for the quarter was $27 million.
Our non-GAAP tax rate was 25.8%. The tax rate is lower in the quarter due to the benefit of a one-time savings associated with the consolidation of foreign entities. This contributed approximately $0.02 to EPS.
Other items contributing to the lower tax rate are the settlement of prior year IRS audits and an adjustment to account for a higher portion of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions. These other items contributed an additional $0.02 to earnings per share.
Our diluted share count for the quarter was $190.1 million. As you will recall, our share count is impacted by our stock price due to our convertible debt and employee stock options.
GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.56, which includes $0.22 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.03 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB14-1 and $0.06 per share of business integration costs and other items. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these items, diluted earnings per share was $0.87.
Moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow. Our ending cash and short-term investments were $537 million. This compares to last quarter's balance of $706 million. Cash from operating activities was $215 million. Capital expenditures were $28 million, and free cash flow was $187 million.
Return on invested capital increased 20 basis points to 9.2%. We remain on track to achieve our goal of 10% ROIC by 2012.
Our ending debt as of September 30 was approximately $2.3 billion. This balance is made up of our convertible debt of $800 million and senior notes of $1.5 billion. During the quarter, we retired $350 million of convertible debt.
As for our ongoing integration efforts, during the quarter, we executed plans to generate an additional $25 million in annualized synergies. Specific actions included the completion of the European back-office consolidation, site consolidations in Asia and the placement of approximately 90 dual-branded supply centers worldwide.
At this point, we're on track to meet our goal of $175 million in annualized run rate synergies by the end of the fourth quarter, a year ahead of schedule.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits, but slightly lower than the third quarter due to a difficult year-over-year comparison. As a reminder, organic growth in the fourth quarter of last year was 11% as a result of several large one-time items. Revenue from acquisitions will add approximately 1½ points to growth in the quarter. 
Due to the volatility of currency rates over the last couple of months, our estimate of the impact of currency on fourth quarter results has changed. As of September 30 rates, currency is expected to be neutral to the fourth quarter revenue growth and EPS.
Q4 gross margins are expected to be lower sequentially due to the impact of mix and lower price realization. Operating expenses in Q4 are expected to increase sequentially due to projects and activities that were delayed in the third quarter, acquisition-related expenses and increased depreciation from integration-related capital expenditures. Operating margins for the quarter are expected to expand approximately 150 basis points year-over-year.
The fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 29.5%, and the full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 29%, excluding any impact from the R&D tax credit. If the R&D tax credit is extended, then the full year tax rate will be reduced by approximately a point to 28%, and that would add $0.02 to earnings per share. Our full year EPS guidance does not include any benefit from the tax credit.
Average diluted shares in the fourth quarter are expected to range from 191 million to 192 million, assuming an average stock price of between $46 and $50 a share. To date, we've repurchased 2.7 million shares at a cost of approximately $128 million and are on track to complete the $350 million repurchase authorization and the repurchase of shares associated with the Ion Torrent transaction by the end of the year.
As Greg mentioned earlier, we're proud of our results so far this year and feel good about our ability to deliver on our financial goals. We are nearing the end of a successful integration, and despite minimal impact from the stimulus, we are on track to deliver between $3.48 and $3.52 earnings per share for the year.
And finally, since the dollar has weakened considerably over the last few months, I'll give you an update on the expected impact from currency on our 2011 results. As a reminder, we have currency hedges in place for the first seven months of 2011. We do not intend to hedge the remaining five months of the year.
As of September month-end rates, EPS is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.12. In order to help you estimate the effect of currency for 2011, we've calculated the impact on earnings per share if all currencies moved by 5% versus the dollar, and our mix of foreign currencies stayed the same. In this case, the impact on earnings per share would be plus or minus $0.11.

And that particular platform has lots of multi-generational growth in it as well. So it will be launched at a certain throughput, and then it will go up over time in basically the same box. In terms of the target customers, Mark, I'll let you give some more color commentary on how we see it being introduced into the market."

We're initially starting, we started taking orders across that breadth of customer base. And we'll be talking more again next week during ASHG with that customer set and also at the Association Molecular Pathology meeting, one of the early access customers will be presenting some data.

And so Ion Torrent, as we got to understand it better, test it better, understand where it was going, really presented to us the technology that would enable this technology to move into the clinical realm, and that's why we made the acquisition of Ion Torrent. We continue to monitor all sorts of different paths to read the genome. But again, we're quite bullish that we have the right platform here to complement the very high accuracy -- even higher accuracy than is even known today that Mark will talk about this next week of SOLiD.
