Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.In view of the weak economy and some very challenging energy markets, I believe our company performed pretty well in 2009. That took hard work and dedication on the part of our employees. And I'd like to begin by acknowledging their accomplishments. We improved the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations, strengthened business relationships, captured new business opportunities and continued to strengthen our balance sheet, improving our overall financial flexibility and strength. As a result of these collective efforts, I believe the company is well-positioned to face the uncertainties in the economy and energy markets, and emerge even stronger.This morning, I'll discuss our 2009 financial results as well as describe the plans and prospects for each of our business units as we head into 2010. Let me begin with an overview of our fourth quarter 2009 results. This morning, we reported net income of $105 million for the fourth quarter or $0.27 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $87 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the same period of 2008. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $299 million compared to $303 million for the same period of 2008. Our regulated electric natural gas distribution utilities achieved solid results of this quarter. Houston Electric's operating income increased $6 million primarily due to customer growth, higher transmission-related revenues and earnings related to our advanced metering investment, partially offset by reduced energy demand and higher labor cost.Our Natural Gas Distribution segment reported a $3 million increase in operating income primarily from rate increases and lower bad debt expense, partially offset by an $11 million increase in pension expense. The energy markets had a greater effect on our other business units. Our Interstate Pipelines and Field Services segments were each down $4 million. Our Pipelines were impacted by reduced ancillary revenues, primarily as a result of lower off-system sales. Field Services revenues were down as natural gas and liquids prices we received dropped from 2008 levels.  Due to reduced basis differentials, operating income at our Energy Services business declined by $5 million. Overall however, this was a solid quarter, which again demonstrates the benefit of our balanced portfolio.Let me now turn to our full year 2009 performance. Our reported net income for 2009 was $372 million or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to $446 million or $1.30 per diluted share for 2008. Operating income was $1,124,000,000 compared to $1,273,000,000 in 2008.While operating and net income were down from what was a banner year in 2008, I believe that there is much about 2009 to make us optimistic about the future. Let me give you a little more detail regarding the full year performance of each of our business segments.Our regulated transmission and distribution utility, Houston Electric, reported operating income of $414 million compared to $407 million for 2008. This increase was primarily the result of higher transmission-related revenues, customer growth and income from our investment in an advanced metering system, offset in part by reduced energy demand and higher operating expenses. Operating income for 2008 was negatively impacted by $7 million as a result of Hurricane Ike, but included a gain of $9 million for a land sale and $5 million from a state franchise tax refund. In 2008, we adjusted for these items. In 2009, operating income would have been up $14 million or approximately 3.5%. It is worth noting that even in a weak economy, we added over 29,000 customers in 2009, a growth rate of almost 1.5%. As we have discussed in the past, Houston Electric is progressing well in implementing our advanced metering system. During 2009, we installed over 150,000 smart meters along with the supporting communications equipment and information systems. We are currently in negotiations with the Department of Energy for our $200 million in federal stimulus funds composed of $150 million to accelerate the implementation of our advanced metering system and $50 million to support our Intelligent Grid Initiative.Assuming that the project is funded in accordance with our application, we will accelerate our AMS deployment to substantially complete the project in 2012 rather than 2014 as originally planned. Because the DOE requires matching expenditures, there will be some acceleration of company funding, but we don't expect it to be material to either cash flow or earnings.Finally, in our expanded cost true-up appeal, the Texas Supreme Court heard oral arguments last October. All briefs have been submitted and we are now awaiting the court's decision. There is no statutory deadline for the court to act, but we anticipate a decision sometime this year. Now let me turn to our Natural Gas Distribution business. This unit reported operating income of $204 million compared to $215 million in 2008. Operating income benefited from rate increases totaling $36 million and lower bad debt expense of $15 million. Offsetting these benefits were increased pension expense of $37 million, higher operating expenses, primarily employee-related cost and higher depreciation and taxes.This business unit has worked diligently on reducing customer delinquencies and bad debt expense. And I'm pleased to say that we saw the benefit of that effort in 2009. Unfortunately, unlike our electric utility, our natural gas utilities cannot defer pension expense increases. Had it not been for these increases, this business unit would have had an outstanding year.Over the last several years, our natural gas utilities have been focused on obtaining necessary rate increases and improving rate design. Last July, we filed two gas rate cases. In our Houston service territory, which now covers 30 cities serving nearly $1 million metered customers, we requested a revenue increase of a little over $20 million.Earlier this week, the Texas Railroad Commission authorized the $5 million base rate increase, recovery over three years of $2.6 million of Hurricane Ike-related cost and lower depreciation rates than requested. We are disappointed in a number of aspects of this decision. And we'll have to evaluate when another case will be necessary.In Mississippi, we filed a $6.2 million rate increase request. We subsequently reached an agreement with the commission that allows us to retain the benefits from an asset management agreement. And we were able to withdraw this request for rate relief.In our Minnesota rate case, which we filed with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission in November 2008, we asked to increase rates by $60 million and to decouple revenues from the volume of gas sold. In January of 2009, we implemented a $51 million interim rate increase. In January of this year, the Minnesota Commission approved a $41 million increase and a three-year decoupling pilot. With this decision, we now have decoupled cost recovery from the volume of gas consumed for approximately one-half of our $3.2 million customers.Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business reported operating income of $21 million for 2009 compared to $62 million for 2008. We recorded mark-to-market charges of $23 million in 2009 compared to gains of $13 million in 2008. As you know, these mark-to-market impacts are associated with derivatives we used to lock in economic gains.In addition, in 2009, we recorded a $6 million write-down of inventory to lower of average cost or market compared to a $30 million inventory write-down in 2008. Excluding these items, our Energy Services business would've reported $50 million for 2009 compared to $79 million for 2008. This decline was principally the result of reduced wholesale opportunities because of significantly tighter locational price differentials and an absence of summer storage spreads.  However, our retail sales were stable in 2009. And we added nearly 1,400 customers to our total customer base. Now let me turn to our Interstate Pipelines unit. Interstate Pipelines recorded operating income of $256 million for 2009 compared to $293 million for 2008. 2008 included a net gain of $11 million associated with the sale of two storage development projects offset by a write-down of pipeline assets removed from service. Adjusting for these two items, operating income decreased approximately $26 million. Our Core business continues to perform well, building on its strong fee-based foundation with increased margins from our Carthage to Perryville pipeline, as well as increased revenues related to several new firm contracts to serve power generation facilities on our system. Our fee-based margin grew by 9%. But this growth was more than offset by reduced ancillary services, as well as incremental operating cost associated with new facilities and increased pension expense. Our equity income from ongoing operations from the Southeast Supply Header or SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $23 million for the year. However, this income was partially offset by a $16 million non-cash charge to reflect SESH's discontinued use of regulatory accounting. In 2008, equity income was $36 million primarily from allowance for funds used during construction. Last March, our Interstate Pipelines group signed an agreement with Chesapeake to take 80% of the capacity on the Phase IV  expansion of our Carthage to Perryville pipeline. We completed these facilities and began the contracted service at the beginning of this month, two months ahead of schedule. Last November, we signed a joint development agreement with the subsidiary of FPL Group to explore constructing a new pipe in north Louisiana, primarily focused on moving natural gas from the Haynesville Shale area. We are currently in discussions with possible shippers to assess the size, timing and scope of a potential new pipeline.Now let me turn to our Field Services segment. We reported operating income of $94 million for 2009 compared to $147 million for 2008. Operating income for 2008 included gains of $17 million associated with the sale of non-strategic assets and the settlement of a contractual dispute. The remaining $36 million decrease in operating income was primarily the result of significantly lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices in 2009.Field Services achieved a 23% increase in core gathering margins primarily associated with the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Woodford Shales. These new volumes more than offset the reduced gathering in our traditional natural gas basins resulting from the significant decline in drilling activity in those basins. In addition to operating income, we also recorded equity income of $8 million from our jointly-owned natural gas processing facilities compared to $15 million the previous year. Again, the decline was primarily due to lower liquids prices.Last September, we signed long-term agreements with subsidiaries of Shell and EnCana to provide gathering and treating services for their growing Haynesville Shale natural gas production. We acquired facilities that are gathering and treating production of over 100 million cubic feet per day, and are expanding these facilities to gather and treat up to 700 million cubic feet per day. We are well underway having completed several significant milestones.Overall, investment in this project is expected to be around $325 million. In 2009, we invested more than $175 million in acquiring and expanding the facilities, and expect to spend approximately $80 million this year.The agreements with Shell and EnCana have minimum volume commitments and provide us exclusive rights to gather and treat their natural gas production in designated Haynesville acreage. As part of the agreements, EnCana and Shell can commit to additional volumes. And if they do, we will further expand the facilities to gather and treat up to an additional 1 billion cubic feet per day at a capital cost of up to an additional $300 million. This expansion can be requested in increments of 100 million cubic feet per day to coincide with increases in their Haynesville production. Most of our contracts in the shale production areas include acreage dedications, volume commitments and our guaranteed return contracts. We are also beginning to see a resumption of drilling activity on our traditional gathering footprint, although drilling levels there remain well below 2008 levels.Taking into account the performance of all of our business units under demanding conditions, I believe the company had a very solid year. Moreover, I believe we are well-positioned as the economy improves and energy markets rebound, and that our overall financial results continue to demonstrate the benefits of our balanced portfolio of electric and natural gas assets.Now let me turn to our outlook for 2010. We believe that the combination of the stability provided by regulated electric and natural gas utilities and the high level of activity in a number of producing areas served by our pipeline and Field Services segments should allow us to achieve solid performance across our various business units in 2010. We expect Houston Electric to continue to perform well. However, operating income will be reduced by $24 million to account for the effect of deferred taxes associated with Hurricane Ike. This deferred tax effect will decline each year, but will last for the 13-year duration of the storm cost recovery bonds.We anticipate that our customer base will grow at a pace comparable to the level experienced in 2009. In addition, we expect to file a transmission rate case this fall to reflect increased transmission investments, and recover the remaining $20 million of Hurricane Ike-related restoration cost associated with our transmission system. Under the terms of a 2006 settlement that froze rates through June of this year, we are required to file a rate case unless the PUC staff and intervenors suspend such requirement based on an earnings monitoring report we will file with the PUC next week. We are currently assessing whether or not we will file a rate case even if we are not required to do so. Capital requirements for our Electric business are budgeted at $560 million including approximately $167 million related to our advanced meter deployment. Our Natural Gas Distribution utility should continue to see the benefits from rate increases and rate decoupling, as well as ongoing expense control measures. We expect to see residential customer growth similar to the levels we experienced in 2009, and some additional benefits associated with the asset management agreement entered into this past year.Our capital plan for 2010 of $210 million reflects an increase in capital spending from 2009 levels primarily for system and public improvements. Our Interstate Pipelines will realize the benefits of the Carthage to Perryville Phase IV pipeline expansion project, which went into service in February. We believe we are well-positioned to capture ancillary revenues when market dynamics and commodity prices rebound. We are pleased with the additional fee-based contracts added in 2009, which will provide further stability to earnings. We continue to see a very high level of drilling in the shale areas particularly the Haynesville, Woodford and Fayetteville Shales. This is driving opportunities for both our Pipelines and Field Services. Increased gathering volumes from the Haynesville and Fayetteville Shale areas are expected in 2010. And as a result of the contracts entered into in late 2008 and in 2009, we expect our Field Services results to improve this year. Current natural gas and natural gas liquids prices are also running at/or above prices we experienced in 2009.  Our Pipelines capital budget will be approximately $171 million or about the same as 2009. Our capital budget for Field Services is $226 million for 2010. We spent about $350 million in 2009, which was a record for this business unit and reflected significant investments in the shale areas. Gary will provide our overall earnings guidance for 2010 in his remarks.In closing, I'd like to remind you of the $0.195 per share quarterly dividend declared by our board of directors on January 21. This is a 2.6% increase over the dividend we paid in 2009, and the fifth consecutive year that we have raised our dividend. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the board of directors has on our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow. With that, I will now turn the call over to Gary."

As David mentioned, 2009 was a very challenging year for the overall economy and for energy markets in particular. In addition to these challenges, we began the year with a number of significant concerns about the overall strength of the capital and bank markets following a very difficult second half of 2008. In spite of these challenges, our businesses performed well, which again highlights the benefits of our balanced portfolio in delivering stable earnings and cash flow.We're also pleased that the steps we took during the year to significantly improve our balance sheet, enhance our credit metrics and expand our available liquidity in order to ensure that we maintain the financial flexibility to effectively execute our business plan. Let me discuss some specific improvements. Excluding securitization debt, we reduced our corporate debt from $8.1 billion at year end 2008 to $7 billion at year end 2009 while funding a capital program of approximately $1.1 billion.  Our debt-to-total capitalization improved from approximately 80% to approximately 73% at year end 2009. We ended the year with net debt of $6.4 billion, a reduction of over $1.6 billion from 2008, which includes $589 million of available cash. Subsequent to year end, we continued to pay down debt to reduce the negative carry associated with our significant cash balance. We redeemed approximately $45 million of CERC's 6% convertible subordinated debentures due in 2012. In addition, we've repurchased three series of 5 1/8% secured pollution control bonds totaling $290 million of 101% of their principal amount. Let me point out that we have the ability to remarket these pollution control bonds in the future if beneficial. We also executed a number of financings as well as operational improvements to enhance our strong liquidity position. As you know, we have had and will continue to have a relatively large capital budget, which includes franchise-required capital in our regulated operations combined with a number of very attractive projects, particularly in our Field Services segment where producer activity remains strong especially in the shale production areas.To ensure that we maintain the financial flexibilities to effectively execute our business plan, we raised approximately $504 million of additional equity through the sale of approximately 46 million shares of common stock last year. Of this amount, $280 million came from an underwritten equity offering in conjunction with the announcement of our Field Services business signing excellent long term agreement with EnCana and Shell to expand gathering and treating facilities in the Haynesville Shale. The remaining equity was raised through the sale of stock in a continuous offering program and the issuance of stock through our savings plan and dividend reinvestment plan. In November, Houston Electric recovered its distribution-related storm costs associated with Hurricane Ike through the issuance of approximately $665 million in storm restoration bonds. These bonds were issued at very favorable interest rates and will provide significant savings to consumers over the next 13 years compared to traditional cost recovery methods. Just as important, the legislation that authorized these bonds also gave the PUC ongoing authority to allow utilities to recover costs associated with future hurricanes and other natural disasters through securitization financing. In August, SESH secured permanent financing through the issuance of $375 million of senior notes with CERC receiving a construction loan repayment of $186 million. In addition to the sources of cash from financing, we continue to manage our working capital requirements very efficiently. Our Natural Gas Distribution business entered into a number of asset-management agreements that reduced our working capital requirements and optimized the operations of our transportation and storage capacity. These agreements benefit our customers through regulatory-approved sharing arrangements. We also benefited from the continuation of bonus depreciation in 2009 and are hopeful legislation will be enacted to continue it in 2010.  With the improvements we have put in place in 2009, the absolute level of our working capital needs has decreased. Now let me touch on liquidity. In October, CERC extended its receivable facility for another year, with the size of the facility ranging from $150 million to $375 million, consistent with the seasonal changes in receivable balances.  In February of this year, we amended the financial covenant in our $1.2 billion bank credit facility to permit approximately $800 million of additional debt in the event we would have another storm in our service territory requiring us to incur significant costs to restore power to our customers. This is similar to the amendment that we obtained after Hurricane Ike struck our service territory. But instead of having to wait to seek covenant relief after the fact, we now have an agreement with our banks that the covenant will automatically adjust should another major storm strike our service territory.  We were very pleased to have had the support of 100% of our bank group on this amendment. We ended 2009 with $589 million of available cash and no significant borrowings under any of our credit facilities. Our improved liquidity, significantly lower leverage and improved cash flow metrics better position us to continue the effective execution of our business plan in 2010. Now let me turn to my final topic, our 2010 earnings guidance.  This morning in our earnings release, we announced 2010 earnings guidance in the range of $1.02 to $1.12 per diluted share. However as you compare our 2010 earnings guidance to our prior year results, I would like to provide a few items. First, our business units' financial performance will improve as the combination of the earnings stability provided by our regulated operation and the high level of activity in a number of gas producing areas where our Pipeline and Field Services businesses have made significant capital investments will allow us to achieve improved operating income in 2010. Second, we expect to benefit in 2010 from reduced net interest expense. Third, we expect our tax rate to return to a more normal level in 2010 of approximately 37.5% compared to a 2009 tax rate of 32%. And then fourth, as I mentioned earlier, we raised equity last year to support our value growth initiatives. And we ended 2009 with approximately 392 million shares outstanding.Finally, as you know in providing guidance, we have routinely excluded the effects of mark-to-market andinventory accounting as they are timing related. And we do not try to predict the potential impact to income from our pending true-up appeal, the change in the value of Time Warner stock and the related ZENS securities or any mandated accounting changes that may occur during the year. As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Marianne."

One was [ph] basis was much tighter across the year that in '08, and that was a big piece of it. But we're also running our pipeline at a much higher capacity factor. Not a lot of excess capacity that we can sell on a daily firm are an uninterruptible basis, and that clearly has its impact as well. So I think those two items are the biggest driver for all-system sales. The other pieces, in ancillary services, we have PAL service, we have system balancing we have system management, we have processing. All of those kind of move around depending on really -- some's on the behavior of our customers and some is just on where gas is moving in from. But I would say, processing, because of the drop in liquids, was a fairly significant piece of the drop in 2009 compared to 2008."

The good news is our Core business, our Fee-based business, which is demand base and not volume based, it's solid. And it'll be even increasing over 2009 levels with the Phase IV of Carthage to Perryville and some other projects that we've put in service. I think the overall business is very well positioned.

On a weather-adjusted basis, we're probably close to 10% ROE. And then, depending on where your capitalization is, we believe we ought to have a 45% equity level in the business and not a 40% equity level. But we're pretty close to earning our authorized rate of return on a weather-adjusted basis. But there's some things that we're not covering. For example, we're deferring these pension costs. They're very significant. Even if we don't get an earnings uplift, we certainly would get the cash flow and start covering this pension expense and rates. So lots of things we have to think about there before we make that decision. PUC staff and interveners can require us to go in and file in June of this year based on a December 31, 2009, test year. We filed that report on Monday. And so they'll take a few weeks. I'm sure to look at it, and then we'll start talking with them. But we're earning pretty close, maybe a little bit less than we think the real return is. I mean, I think the commission's looking at 10½% ROE in that range. And I think on a weather-adjusted basis, we're earning less than that."

Prices today are running ahead of those. But it's hard to predict exactly where that's going to go. We know that it's going to depend in part on demand for gas and how fast this economy comes back. But certainly, gas prices today are in that $5 range. So they're a little above '09. We're not predicting big increases in commodity prices in our forecast. We have some slight increases especially on liquid's prices. But I'll also probably need to remind you that in '09, we did fix some natural gas prices in advance of the year. So we got some gas sold at $5, give or take a few pennies, which is about where the price is today. So we're predicting a little uptick in liquid's prices. Maybe a little bit in natural gas but not much. In terms of ancillary services, I think we addressed that. And when I talk to Carl, we could see some bounce back, but we're not counting on a lot of bounce back there in our earnings guidance. And there is not just anything we could do with this pension increase until we get our gas rates to fully reflect these increases, and they don't get. We do have a little bit in the Minnesota rates, and I don't think that the recent decision we got for Houston really reflects the level of expense we're incurring there. They used some averaging that really didn't reflect the actual expense we're incurring."

You can back in to kind of what it takes to get to a full rate of return, whether it's 10½% or whatever you're assuming. So there's some nice upside there. And then you have -- and part of that, the reason we're not earning our rate of return is because of the pension. It's a big part. If we would have been earning or recovering our pension expense, my expectation is, we would've heard our regulated rate of return. So that's an upside down the road. It takes time to get those in. We talked about Houston Electric. And we've got some sizable investments ahead of us in Field Services. But we spent $350 million, 80% of which was for growth projects, if not more. So those projects are going to pay off for us in the long run. Those are, over the next 10 years, we're going to get the benefit of all those investments. And we'll continue to make investments.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.In view of the weak economy and some very challenging energy markets, I believe our company performed pretty well in 2009. That took hard work and dedication on the part of our employees. And I'd like to begin by acknowledging their accomplishments. We improved the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations, strengthened business relationships, captured new business opportunities and continued to strengthen our balance sheet, improving our overall financial flexibility and strength. As a result of these collective efforts, I believe the company is well-positioned to face the uncertainties in the economy and the energy markets, and emerge even stronger.This morning, I'll discuss our 2009 financial results as well as describe the plans and prospects for each of our business units as we head into 2010. Let me begin with an overview of our fourth quarter 2009 results. This morning, we reported net income of $105 million for the fourth quarter or $0.27 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $87 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the same period of 2008. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $299 million compared to $303 million for the same period of 2008. Our regulated electric and natural gas distribution utilities achieved solid results of this quarter. Houston Electric's operating income increased $6 million primarily due to customer growth, higher transmission-related revenues and earnings related to our advanced metering investment, partially offset by reduced energy demand and higher labor cost.Our Natural Gas Distribution segment reported a $3 million increase in operating income primarily from rate increases and lower bad debt expense, partially offset by an $11 million increase in pension expense. The energy markets had a greater effect on our other business units. Our Interstate Pipelines and Field Services segments were each down $4 million. Our Pipelines were impacted by reduced ancillary revenues, primarily as a result of lower off-system sales. Field Services revenues were down as natural gas and liquids prices we received dropped from 2008 levels.  Due to reduced basis differentials, operating income at our Energy Services business declined by $5 million. Overall however, this was a solid quarter, which again demonstrates the benefit of our balanced portfolio.Let me now turn to our full year 2009 performance. Our reported net income for 2009 was $372 million or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to $446 million or $1.30 per diluted share for 2008. Operating income was $1,124,000,000 in 2009 compared to $1,273,000,000 in 2008.While operating and net income were down from what was a banner year in 2008, I believe that there is much about 2009 to make us optimistic about the future. Let me give you a little more detail regarding the full year performance of each of our business segments.Our regulated transmission and distribution utility, Houston Electric, reported operating income of $414 million compared to $407 million for 2008. This increase was primarily the result of higher transmission-related revenues, customer growth and income from our investment in an advanced metering system, offset in part by reduced energy demand and higher operating expenses. Operating income for 2008 was negatively impacted by $7 million as a result of Hurricane Ike, but included a gain of $9 million for a land sale and $5 million from a state franchise tax refund. In 2008, we're adjusted for these items. In 2009, operating income would have been up $14 million or approximately 3.5%. It is worth noting that even in a weak economy, we added over 29,000 customers in 2009, a growth rate of almost 1.5%. As we have discussed in the past, Houston Electric is progressing well in implementing our advanced metering system. During 2009, we installed over 150,000 smart meters along with the supporting communications equipment and information systems. We are currently in negotiations with the Department of Energy for our $200 million in federal stimulus funds composed of $150 million to accelerate the implementation of our advanced metering system and $50 million to support our Intelligent Grid Initiative.Assuming that the project is funded in accordance with our application, we will accelerate our AMS deployment to substantially complete the project in 2012 rather than 2014 as originally planned. Because the DOE requires matching expenditures, there will be some acceleration of company funding, but we don't expect it to be material to either cash flow or earnings.Finally, in our expanded cost true-up appeal, the Texas Supreme Court heard oral arguments last October. All briefs have been submitted and we are now awaiting the court's decision. There is no statutory deadline for the court to act, but we anticipate a decision some time this year. Now let me turn to our Natural Gas Distribution business. This unit reported operating income of $204 million compared to $215 million in 2008. Operating income benefited from rate increases totaling $36 million and lower bad debt expense of $15 million. Offsetting these benefits were increased pension expense of $37 million, higher operating expenses, primarily employee-related cost and higher depreciation and taxes.This business unit has worked diligently on reducing customer delinquencies and bad debt expense. And I'm pleased to say that we saw the benefit of that effort in 2009. Unfortunately, unlike our electric utility, our natural gas utilities cannot defer pension expense increases. Had it not been for these increases, this business unit would have had an outstanding year.Over the last several years, our natural gas utilities have been focused on obtaining necessary rate increases and improving rate design. Last July, we filed two gas rate cases. In our Houston service territory, which now covers 30 cities serving nearly $1 million metered customers, we requested a revenue increase of a little over $20 million.Earlier this week, the Texas Railroad Commission authorized the $5 million base rate increase, recovery over three years of $2.6 million of Hurricane Ike-related cost and lower depreciation rates than requested. We are disappointed in a number of aspects of this decision. And we'll have to evaluate when another case will be necessary.In Mississippi, we filed a $6.2 million rate increase request. We subsequently reached an agreement with the commission that allows us to retain the benefits from an asset management agreement. And we were able to withdraw this request for rate relief.In our Minnesota rate case, which we filed with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission in November 2008, we asked to increase rates by $60 million and to decouple revenues from the volume of gas sold. In January of 2009, we implemented a $51 million interim rate increase. In January of this year, the Minnesota Commission approved a $41 million increase and a three-year decoupling pilot. With this decision, we now have decoupled cost recovery from the volume of gas consumed for approximately one-half of our $3.2 million customers.Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business reported operating income of $21 million for 2009 compared to $62 million for 2008. We recorded mark-to-market charges of $23 million in 2009 compared to gains of $13 million in 2008. As you know, these mark-to-market impacts are associated with derivatives we used to lock in economic gains.In addition, in 2009, we recorded a $6 million write-down of inventory to lower of average cost or market compared to a $30 million inventory write-down in 2008. Excluding these items, our Energy Services business would've reported $50 million for 2009 compared to $79 million for 2008. This decline was principally the result of reduced wholesale opportunities because of significantly tighter locational price differentials and an absence of summer storage spreads.  However, our retail sales were stable in 2009. And we added nearly 1,400 customers to our total customer base. Now let me turn to our Interstate Pipelines unit. Interstate Pipelines recorded operating income of $256 million for 2009 compared to $293 million for 2008. 2008 included a net gain of $11 million associated with the sale of two storage development projects offset by a write-down of pipeline assets removed from service. Adjusting for these two items, operating income decreased approximately $26 million. Our Core business continues to perform well, building on its strong fee-based foundation with increased margins from our Carthage to Perryville pipeline, as well as increased revenues related to several new firm contracts to serve power generation facilities on our system. Our fee-based margin grew by 9%. But this growth was more than offset by reduced ancillary services, as well as incremental operating cost associated with new facilities and increased pension expense. Our equity income from ongoing operations from the Southeast Supply Header or SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $23 million for the year. However, this income was partially offset by a $16 million non-cash charge to reflect SESH's discontinued use of regulatory accounting. In 2008, equity income was $36 million primarily from allowance for funds used during construction. Last March, our Interstate Pipelines group signed an agreement with Chesapeake to take 80% of the capacity on the Phase IV  expansion of our Carthage to Perryville pipeline. We completed these facilities and began the contracted service at the beginning of this month, two months ahead of schedule. Last November, we signed a joint development agreement with the subsidiary of FPL Group to explore constructing a new pipe in north Louisiana, primarily focused on moving natural gas from the Haynesville Shale area. We are currently in discussions with possible shippers to assess the size, timing and scope of a potential new pipeline.Now let me turn to our Field Services segment. We reported operating income of $94 million for 2009 compared to $147 million for 2008. Operating income for 2008 included gains of $17 million associated with the sale of non-strategic assets and the settlement of a contractual dispute. The remaining $36 million decrease in operating income was primarily the result of significantly lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices in 2009.Field Services achieved a 23% increase in core gathering margins primarily associated with the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Woodford Shales. These new volumes more than offset the reduced gathering in our traditional natural gas basins resulting from the significant decline in drilling activity in those basins. In addition to operating income, we also recorded equity income of $8 million from our jointly-owned natural gas processing facilities compared to $15 million the previous year. Again, the decline was primarily due to lower liquids prices.Last September, we signed long-term agreements with subsidiaries of Shell and EnCana to provide gathering and treating services for their growing Haynesville Shale natural gas production. We acquired facilities that are gathering and treating production of over 100 million cubic feet per day, and are expanding these facilities to gather and treat up to 700 million cubic feet per day. We are well underway having completed several significant milestones.Overall, investment in this project is expected to be around $325 million. In 2009, we invested more than $175 million in acquiring and expanding the facilities, and expect to spend approximately $80 million this year.The agreements with Shell and EnCana have minimum volume commitments and provide us exclusive rights to gather and treat their natural gas production in designated Haynesville acreage. As part of the agreements, EnCana and Shell can commit to additional volumes. And if they do, we will further expand the facilities to gather and treat up to an additional 1 billion cubic feet per day at a capital cost of up to an additional $300 million. This expansion can be requested in increments of 100 million cubic feet per day to coincide with increases in their Haynesville production. Most of our contracts in the shale production areas include acreage dedications, volume commitments and our guaranteed return contracts. We are also beginning to see a resumption of drilling activity on our traditional gathering footprint, although drilling levels there remain well below 2008 levels.Taking into account the performance of all of our business units under demanding conditions, I believe the company had a very solid year. Moreover, I believe we are well-positioned as the economy improves and energy markets rebound, and that our overall financial results continue to demonstrate the benefits of our balanced portfolio of electric and natural gas assets.Now let me turn to our outlook for 2010. We believe that the combination of the stability provided by regulated electric and natural gas utilities and the high level of activity in a number of producing areas served by our pipeline and Field Services segments should allow us to achieve solid performance across our various business units in 2010. We expect Houston Electric to continue to perform well. However, operating income will be reduced by $24 million to account for the effect of deferred taxes associated with Hurricane Ike. This deferred tax effect will decline each year, but will last for the 13-year duration of the storm cost recovery bonds.We anticipate that our customer base will grow at a pace comparable to the level experienced in 2009. In addition, we expect to file a transmission rate case this fall to reflect increased transmission investments, and recover the remaining $20 million of Hurricane Ike-related restoration cost associated with our transmission system. Under the terms of a 2006 settlement that froze rates through June of this year, we are required to file a rate case unless the PUC staff and intervenors suspend such requirement based on an earnings monitoring report we will file with the PUC next week. We are currently assessing whether or not we will file a rate case even if we are not required to do so. Capital requirements for our Electric business are budgeted at $560 million including approximately $167 million related to our advanced meter deployment. Our Natural Gas Distribution utility should continue to see the benefits from rate increases and rate decoupling, as well as ongoing expense control measures. We expect to see residential customer growth similar to the levels we experienced in 2009, and some additional benefits associated with the asset management agreement entered into this past year.Our capital plan for 2010 of $210 million reflects an increase in capital spending from 2009 levels primarily for system and public improvements. Our Interstate Pipelines will realize the benefits of the Carthage to Perryville Phase IV pipeline expansion project, which went into service in February. We believe we are well-positioned to capture ancillary revenues when market dynamics and commodity prices rebound. We are pleased with the additional fee-based contracts added in 2009, which will provide further stability to earnings. We continue to see a very high level of drilling in the shale areas particularly the Haynesville, Woodford and Fayetteville Shales. This is driving opportunities for both our Pipelines and Field Services. Increased gathering volumes from the Haynesville and Fayetteville Shale areas are expected in 2010. And as a result of the contracts entered into in late 2008 and in 2009, we expect our Field Services results to improve this year. Current natural gas and natural gas liquids prices are also running at/or above prices we experienced in 2009.  Our Pipelines capital budget will be approximately $171 million or about the same as 2009. Our capital budget for Field Services is $226 million for 2010. We spent about $350 million in 2009, which was a record for this business unit and reflected significant investments in the shale areas. Gary will provide our overall earnings guidance for 2010 in his remarks.In closing, I'd like to remind you of the $0.195 per share quarterly dividend declared by our board of directors on January 21. This is a 2.6% increase over the dividend we paid in 2009, and the fifth consecutive year that we have raised our dividend. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the board of directors has on our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow. With that, I will now turn the call over to Gary."

As David mentioned, 2009 was a very challenging year for the overall economy and for energy markets in particular. In addition to these challenges, we began the year with a number of significant concerns about the overall strength of the capital and bank markets following a very difficult second half of 2008. In spite of these challenges, our businesses performed well, which again highlights the benefits of our balanced portfolio in delivering stable earnings and cash flow.We're also pleased that the steps we took during the year to significantly improve our balance sheet, enhance our credit metrics and expand our available liquidity in order to ensure that we maintain the financial flexibility to effectively execute our business plan. Let me discuss some specific improvements. Excluding securitization debt, we reduced our corporate debt from $8.1 billion at year end 2008 to $7 billion at year end 2009 while funding a capital program of approximately $1.1 billion.  Our debt-to-total capitalization improved from approximately 80% to approximately 73% at year end 2009. We ended the year with net debt of $6.4 billion, a reduction of over $1.6 billion from 2008, which includes $589 million of available cash. Subsequent to year end, we continued to pay down debt to reduce the negative carry associated with our significant cash balance. We redeemed approximately $45 million of CERC's 6% convertible subordinated debentures due in 2012. In addition, we've repurchased three series of 5 1/8% secured pollution control bonds totaling $290 million of 101% of their principal amount. Let me point out that we have the ability to remarket these pollution control bonds in the future if beneficial. We also executed a number of financings as well as operational improvements to enhance our strong liquidity position. As you know, we have had and will continue to have a relatively large capital budget, which includes franchise-required capital in our regulated operations combined with a number of very attractive projects, particularly in our Field Services segment where producer activity remains strong especially in the shale production areas.To ensure that we maintain the financial flexibilities to effectively execute our business plan, we raised approximately $504 million of additional equity through the sale of approximately 46 million shares of common stock last year. Of this amount, $280 million came from an underwritten equity offering in conjunction with the announcement of our Field Services business signing excellent long term agreement with EnCana and Shell to expand gathering and treating facilities in the Haynesville Shale. The remaining equity was raised through the sale of stock in a continuous offering program and the issuance of stock through our savings plan and dividend reinvestment plan. In November, Houston Electric recovered its distribution-related storm costs associated with Hurricane Ike through the issuance of approximately $665 million in storm restoration bonds. These bonds were issued at very favorable interest rates and will provide significant savings to consumers over the next 13 years compared to traditional cost recovery methods. Just as important, the legislation that authorized these bonds also gave the PUC ongoing authority to allow utilities to recover costs associated with future hurricanes and other natural disasters through securitization financing. In August, SESH secured permanent financing through the issuance of $375 million of senior notes with CERC receiving a construction loan repayment of $186 million. In addition to the sources of cash from financing, we continue to manage our working capital requirements very efficiently. Our Natural Gas Distribution business entered into a number of asset-management agreements that reduced our working capital requirements and optimized the operations of our transportation and storage capacity. These agreements benefit our customers through regulatory-approved sharing arrangements. We also benefited from the continuation of bonus depreciation in 2009 and are hopeful legislation will be enacted to continue it in 2010.  With the improvements we have put in place in 2009, the absolute level of our working capital needs has decreased. Now let me touch on liquidity. In October, CERC extended its receivable facility for another year, with the size of the facility ranging from $150 million to $375 million, consistent with the seasonal changes in receivable balances.  In February of this year, we amended the financial covenant in our $1.2 billion bank credit facility to permit approximately $800 million of additional debt in the event we would have another storm in our service territory requiring us to incur significant costs to restore power to our customers. This is similar to the amendment that we obtained after Hurricane Ike struck our service territory. But instead of having to wait to seek covenant relief after the fact, we now have an agreement with our banks that the covenant will automatically adjust should another major storm strike our service territory.  We were very pleased to have had the support of 100% of our bank group on this amendment. We ended 2009 with $589 million of available cash and no significant borrowings under any of our credit facilities. Our improved liquidity, significantly lower leverage and improved cash flow metrics better position us to continue the effective execution of our business plan in 2010. Now let me turn to my final topic, our 2010 earnings guidance.  This morning in our earnings release, we announced 2010 earnings guidance in the range of $1.02 to $1.12 per diluted share. However as you compare our 2010 earnings guidance to our prior year results, I would like to provide a few items. First, our business units' financial performance will improve as the combination of the earnings stability provided by our regulated operation and the high level of activity in a number of gas producing areas where our Pipeline and Field Services businesses have made significant capital investments will allow us to achieve improved operating income in 2010. Second, we expect to benefit in 2010 from reduced net interest expense. Third, we expect our tax rate to return to a more normal level in 2010 of approximately 37.5% compared to a 2009 tax rate of 32%. And then fourth, as I mentioned earlier, we raised equity last year to support our value growth initiatives. And we ended 2009 with approximately 392 million shares outstanding.Finally, as you know in providing guidance, we have routinely excluded the effects of mark-to-market andinventory accounting as they are timing related. And we do not try to predict the potential impact to income from our pending true-up appeal, the change in the value of Time Warner stock and the related ZENS securities or any mandated accounting changes that may occur during the year. As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Marianne."

Not a lot of excess capacity that we can sell on a daily firm are an uninterruptible basis, and that clearly has its impact as well. So I think those two items are the biggest driver for all-system sales. The other pieces, in ancillary services, we have PAL service, we have system balancing we have system management, we have processing. All of those kind of move around depending on really -- some's on the behavior of our customers and some is just on where gas is moving in from. But I would say, processing, because of the drop in liquids, was a fairly significant piece of the drop in 2009 compared to 2008."

But we could see a little bit more of the other services than we saw in '09. It's just really hard to predict. The good news is our Core business, our Fee-based business, which is demand base and not volume based, it's solid. And it'll be even increasing over 2009 levels with the Phase IV of Carthage to Perryville and some other projects that we've put in service. I think the overall business is very well positioned.

They're very significant. Even if we don't get an earnings uplift, we certainly would get the cash flow and start covering this pension expense and rates. So lots of things we have to think about there before we make that decision. PUC staff and interveners can require us to go in and file in June of this year based on a December 31, 2009, test year. We filed that report on Monday. And so they'll take a few weeks. I'm sure to look at it, and then we'll start talking with them. But we're earning pretty close, maybe a little bit less than we think the real return is. I mean, I think the commission's looking at 10½% ROE in that range.

We have some slight increases especially on liquid's prices. But I'll also probably need to remind you that in '09, we did fix some natural gas prices in advance of the year.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thanks for joining us today, and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.In view of the weak economy and some very challenging energy markets, I believe our company performed pretty well in 2009. That took hard work and dedication on the part of our employees. And I'd like to begin by acknowledging their accomplishments. We improved the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations, strengthened business relationships, captured new business opportunities and continued to strengthen our balance sheet, improving our overall financial flexibility and strength. As a result of these collective efforts, I believe the company is well-positioned to face the uncertainties in the economy and the energy markets, and emerge even stronger.This morning, I'll discuss our 2009 financial results as well as describe the plans and prospects for each of our business units as we head into 2010. Let me begin with an overview of our fourth quarter 2009 results. This morning, we reported net income of $105 million for the fourth quarter or $0.27 per diluted share. This compares to net income of $87 million or $0.25 per diluted share for the same period of 2008. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2009 was $299 million compared to $303 million for the same period of 2008. Our regulated electric and natural gas distribution utilities achieved solid results of this quarter. Houston Electric's operating income increased $6 million primarily due to customer growth, higher transmission-related revenues and earnings related to our advanced metering investment, partially offset by reduced energy demand and higher labor cost.Our Natural Gas Distribution segment reported a $3 million increase in operating income primarily from rate increases and lower bad debt expense, partially offset by an $11 million increase in pension expense. The energy markets had a greater effect on our other business units. Our Interstate Pipelines and Field Services segments were each down $4 million. Our Pipelines were impacted by reduced ancillary revenues, primarily as a result of lower off-system sales. Field Services revenues were down as natural gas and liquids prices we received dropped from 2008 levels.  Due to reduced basis differentials, operating income at our Energy Services business declined by $5 million. Overall however, this was a solid quarter, which again demonstrates the benefit of our balanced portfolio.Let me now turn to our full year 2009 performance. Our reported net income for 2009 was $372 million or $1.01 per diluted share, compared to $446 million or $1.30 per diluted share for 2008. Operating income was $1,124,000,000 in 2009 compared to $1,273,000,000 in 2008.While operating and net income were down from what was a banner year in 2008, I believe that there is much about 2009 to make us optimistic about the future. Let me give you a little more detail regarding the full year performance of each of our business segments.Our regulated transmission and distribution utility, Houston Electric, reported operating income of $414 million compared to $407 million for 2008. This increase was primarily the result of higher transmission-related revenues, customer growth and income from our investment in an advanced metering system, offset in part by reduced energy demand and higher operating expenses. Operating income for 2008 was negatively impacted by $7 million as a result of Hurricane Ike, but included a gain of $9 million for a land sale and $5 million from a state franchise tax refund. In 2008, we're adjusted for these items. In 2009, operating income would have been up $14 million or approximately 3.5%. It is worth noting that even in a weak economy, we added over 29,000 customers in 2009, a growth rate of almost 1.5%. As we have discussed in the past, Houston Electric is progressing well in implementing our advanced metering system. During 2009, we installed over 150,000 smart meters along with the supporting communications equipment and information systems. We are currently in negotiations with the Department of Energy for our $200 million in federal stimulus funds composed of $150 million to accelerate the implementation of our advanced metering system and $50 million to support our Intelligent Grid Initiative.Assuming that the project is funded in accordance with our application, we will accelerate our AMS deployment to substantially complete the project in 2012 rather than 2014 as originally planned. Because the DOE requires matching expenditures, there will be some acceleration of company funding, but we don't expect it to be material to either cash flow or earnings.Finally, in our expanded cost true-up appeal, the Texas Supreme Court heard oral arguments last October. All briefs have been submitted and we are now awaiting the court's decision. There is no statutory deadline for the court to act, but we anticipate a decision some time this year. Now let me turn to our Natural Gas Distribution business. This unit reported operating income of $204 million compared to $215 million in 2008. Operating income benefited from rate increases totaling $36 million and lower bad debt expense of $15 million. Offsetting these benefits were increased pension expense of $37 million, higher operating expenses, primarily employee-related cost and higher depreciation and taxes.This business unit has worked diligently on reducing customer delinquencies and bad debt expense. And I'm pleased to say that we saw the benefit of that effort in 2009. Unfortunately, unlike our electric utility, our natural gas utilities cannot defer pension expense increases. Had it not been for these increases, this business unit would have had an outstanding year.Over the last several years, our natural gas utilities have been focused on obtaining necessary rate increases and improving rate design. Last July, we filed two gas rate cases. In our Houston service territory, which now covers 30 cities serving nearly $1 million metered customers, we requested a revenue increase of a little over $20 million.Earlier this week, the Texas Railroad Commission authorized the $5 million base rate increase, recovery over three years of $2.6 million of Hurricane Ike-related cost and lower depreciation rates than requested. We are disappointed in a number of aspects of this decision. And we'll have to evaluate when another case will be necessary.In Mississippi, we filed a $6.2 million rate increase request. We subsequently reached an agreement with the commission that allows us to retain the benefits from an asset management agreement. And we were able to withdraw this request for rate relief.In our Minnesota rate case, which we filed with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission in November 2008, we asked to increase rates by $60 million and to decouple revenues from the volume of gas sold. In January of 2009, we implemented a $51 million interim rate increase. In January of this year, the Minnesota Commission approved a $41 million increase and a three-year decoupling pilot. With this decision, we now have decoupled cost recovery from the volume of gas consumed for approximately one-half of our $3.2 million customers.Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business reported operating income of $21 million for 2009 compared to $62 million for 2008. We recorded mark-to-market charges of $23 million in 2009 compared to gains of $13 million in 2008. As you know, these mark-to-market impacts are associated with derivatives we used to lock in economic gains.In addition, in 2009, we recorded a $6 million write-down of inventory to lower of average cost or market compared to a $30 million inventory write-down in 2008. Excluding these items, our Energy Services business would've reported $50 million for 2009 compared to $79 million for 2008. This decline was principally the result of reduced wholesale opportunities because of significantly tighter locational price differentials and an absence of summer storage spreads.  However, our retail sales were stable in 2009. And we added nearly 1,400 customers to our total customer base. Now let me turn to our Interstate Pipelines unit. Interstate Pipelines recorded operating income of $256 million for 2009 compared to $293 million for 2008. 2008 included a net gain of $11 million associated with the sale of two storage development projects offset by a write-down of pipeline assets removed from service. Adjusting for these two items, operating income decreased approximately $26 million. Our Core business continues to perform well, building on its strong fee-based foundation with increased margins from our Carthage to Perryville pipeline, as well as increased revenues related to several new firm contracts to serve power generation facilities on our system. Our fee-based margin grew by 9%. But this growth was more than offset by reduced ancillary services, as well as incremental operating cost associated with new facilities and increased pension expense. Our equity income from ongoing operations from the Southeast Supply Header or SESH, our joint venture with Spectra, was $23 million for the year. However, this income was partially offset by a $16 million non-cash charge to reflect SESH's discontinued use of regulatory accounting. In 2008, equity income was $36 million primarily from allowance for funds used during construction. Last March, our Interstate Pipelines group signed an agreement with Chesapeake to take 80% of the capacity on the Phase IV  expansion of our Carthage to Perryville pipeline. We completed these facilities and began the contracted service at the beginning of this month, two months ahead of schedule. Last November, we signed a joint development agreement with the subsidiary of FPL Group to explore constructing a new pipe in north Louisiana, primarily focused on moving natural gas from the Haynesville Shale area. We are currently in discussions with possible shippers to assess the size, timing and scope of a potential new pipeline.Now let me turn to our Field Services segment. We reported operating income of $94 million for 2009 compared to $147 million for 2008. Operating income for 2008 included gains of $17 million associated with the sale of non-strategic assets and the settlement of a contractual dispute. The remaining $36 million decrease in operating income was primarily the result of significantly lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices in 2009.Field Services achieved a 23% increase in core gathering margins primarily associated with the Haynesville, Fayetteville and Woodford Shales. These new volumes more than offset the reduced gathering in our traditional natural gas basins resulting from the significant decline in drilling activity in those basins. In addition to operating income, we also recorded equity income of $8 million from our jointly-owned natural gas processing facilities compared to $15 million the previous year. Again, the decline was primarily due to lower liquids prices.Last September, we signed long-term agreements with subsidiaries of Shell and EnCana to provide gathering and treating services for their growing Haynesville Shale natural gas production. We acquired facilities that are gathering and treating production of over 100 million cubic feet per day, and are expanding these facilities to gather and treat up to 700 million cubic feet per day. We are well underway having completed several significant milestones.Overall, investment in this project is expected to be around $325 million. In 2009, we invested more than $175 million in acquiring and expanding the facilities, and expect to spend approximately $80 million this year.The agreements with Shell and EnCana have minimum volume commitments and provide us exclusive rights to gather and treat their natural gas production in designated Haynesville acreage. As part of the agreements, EnCana and Shell can commit to additional volumes. And if they do, we will further expand the facilities to gather and treat up to an additional 1 billion cubic feet per day at a capital cost of up to an additional $300 million. This expansion can be requested in increments of 100 million cubic feet per day to coincide with increases in their Haynesville production. Most of our contracts in the shale production areas include acreage dedications, volume commitments and our guaranteed return contracts. We are also beginning to see a resumption of drilling activity on our traditional gathering footprint, although drilling levels there remain well below 2008 levels.Taking into account the performance of all of our business units under demanding conditions, I believe the company had a very solid year. Moreover, I believe we are well-positioned as the economy improves and energy markets rebound, and that our overall financial results continue to demonstrate the benefits of our balanced portfolio of electric and natural gas assets.Now let me turn to our outlook for 2010. We believe that the combination of the stability provided by regulated electric and natural gas utilities and the high level of activity in a number of producing areas served by our pipeline and Field Services segments should allow us to achieve solid performance across our various business units in 2010. We expect Houston Electric to continue to perform well. However, operating income will be reduced by $24 million to account for the effect of deferred taxes associated with Hurricane Ike. This deferred tax effect will decline each year, but will last for the 13-year duration of the storm cost recovery bonds.We anticipate that our customer base will grow at a pace comparable to the level experienced in 2009. In addition, we expect to file a transmission rate case this fall to reflect increased transmission investments, and recover the remaining $20 million of Hurricane Ike-related restoration cost associated with our transmission system. Under the terms of a 2006 settlement that froze rates through June of this year, we are required to file a rate case unless the PUC staff and intervenors suspend such requirement based on an earnings monitoring report we will file with the PUC next week. We are currently assessing whether or not we will file a rate case even if we are not required to do so. Capital requirements for our Electric business are budgeted at $560 million including approximately $167 million related to our advanced meter deployment. Our Natural Gas Distribution utility should continue to see the benefits from rate increases and rate decoupling, as well as ongoing expense control measures. We expect to see residential customer growth similar to the levels we experienced in 2009, and some additional benefits associated with the asset management agreement entered into this past year.Our capital plan for 2010 of $210 million reflects an increase in capital spending from 2009 levels primarily for system and public improvements. Our Interstate Pipelines will realize the benefits of the Carthage to Perryville Phase IV pipeline expansion project, which went into service in February. We believe we are well-positioned to capture ancillary revenues when market dynamics and commodity prices rebound. We are pleased with the additional fee-based contracts added in 2009, which will provide further stability to earnings. We continue to see a very high level of drilling in the shale areas particularly the Haynesville, Woodford and Fayetteville Shales. This is driving opportunities for both our Pipelines and Field Services. Increased gathering volumes from the Haynesville and Fayetteville Shale areas are expected in 2010. And as a result of the contracts entered into in late 2008 and in 2009, we expect our Field Services results to improve this year. Current natural gas and natural gas liquids prices are also running at/or above prices we experienced in 2009.  Our Pipelines capital budget will be approximately $171 million or about the same as 2009. Our capital budget for Field Services is $226 million for 2010. We spent about $350 million in 2009, which was a record for this business unit and reflected significant investments in the shale areas. Gary will provide our overall earnings guidance for 2010 in his remarks.In closing, I'd like to remind you of the $0.195 per share quarterly dividend declared by our board of directors on January 21. This is a 2.6% increase over the dividend we paid in 2009, and the fifth consecutive year that we have raised our dividend. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the board of directors has on our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow. With that, I will now turn the call over to Gary."

In addition to these challenges, we beg",1126,"Thank you, David, and good morning to everyone. Today, I would like to discuss a few items with you. As David mentioned, 2009 was a very challenging year for the overall economy and for energy markets in particular. In addition to these challenges, we began the year with a number of significant concerns about the overall strength of the capital and bank markets following a very difficult second half of 2008. In spite of these challenges, our businesses performed well, which again highlights the benefits of our balanced portfolio in delivering stable earnings and cash flow.We're also pleased that the steps we took during the year to significantly improve our balance sheet, enhance our credit metrics and expand our available liquidity in order to ensure that we maintain the financial flexibility to effectively execute our business plan. Let me discuss some specific improvements. Excluding securitization debt, we reduced our corporate debt from $8.1 billion at year end 2008 to $7 billion at year end 2009 while funding a capital program of approximately $1.1 billion.  Our debt-to-total capitalization improved from approximately 80% to approximately 73% at year end 2009. We ended the year with net debt of $6.4 billion, a reduction of over $1.6 billion from 2008, which includes $589 million of available cash. Subsequent to year end, we continued to pay down debt to reduce the negative carry associated with our significant cash balance. We redeemed approximately $45 million of CERC's 6% convertible subordinated debentures due in 2012. In addition, we've repurchased three series of 5 1/8% secured pollution control bonds totaling $290 million of 101% of their principal amount. Let me point out that we have the ability to remarket these pollution control bonds in the future if beneficial. We also executed a number of financings as well as operational improvements to enhance our strong liquidity position. As you know, we have had and will continue to have a relatively large capital budget, which includes franchise-required capital in our regulated operations combined with a number of very attractive projects, particularly in our Field Services segment where producer activity remains strong especially in the shale production areas.To ensure that we maintain the financial flexibilities to effectively execute our business plan, we raised approximately $504 million of additional equity through the sale of approximately 46 million shares of common stock last year. Of this amount, $280 million came from an underwritten equity offering in conjunction with the announcement of our Field Services business signing excellent long term agreement with EnCana and Shell to expand gathering and treating facilities in the Haynesville Shale. The remaining equity was raised through the sale of stock in a continuous offering program and the issuance of stock through our savings plan and dividend reinvestment plan. In November, Houston Electric recovered its distribution-related storm costs associated with Hurricane Ike through the issuance of approximately $665 million in storm restoration bonds. These bonds were issued at very favorable interest rates and will provide significant savings to consumers over the next 13 years compared to traditional cost recovery methods. Just as important, the legislation that authorized these bonds also gave the PUC ongoing authority to allow utilities to recover costs associated with future hurricanes and other natural disasters through securitization financing. In August, SESH secured permanent financing through the issuance of $375 million of senior notes with CERC receiving a construction loan repayment of $186 million. In addition to the sources of cash from financing, we continue to manage our working capital requirements very efficiently. Our Natural Gas Distribution business entered into a number of asset-management agreements that reduced our working capital requirements and optimized the operations of our transportation and storage capacity. These agreements benefit our customers through regulatory-approved sharing arrangements. We also benefited from the continuation of bonus depreciation in 2009 and are hopeful legislation will be enacted to continue it in 2010.  With the improvements we have put in place in 2009, the absolute level of our working capital needs has decreased. Now let me touch on liquidity. In October, CERC extended its receivable facility for another year, with the size of the facility ranging from $150 million to $375 million, consistent with the seasonal changes in receivable balances.  In February of this year, we amended the financial covenant in our $1.2 billion bank credit facility to permit approximately $800 million of additional debt in the event we would have another storm in our service territory requiring us to incur significant costs to restore power to our customers. This is similar to the amendment that we obtained after Hurricane Ike struck our service territory. But instead of having to wait to seek covenant relief after the fact, we now have an agreement with our banks that the covenant will automatically adjust should another major storm strike our service territory.  We were very pleased to have had the support of 100% of our bank group on this amendment. We ended 2009 with $589 million of available cash and no significant borrowings under any of our credit facilities. Our improved liquidity, significantly lower leverage and improved cash flow metrics better position us to continue the effective execution of our business plan in 2010. Now let me turn to my final topic, our 2010 earnings guidance.  This morning in our earnings release, we announced 2010 earnings guidance in the range of $1.02 to $1.12 per diluted share. However as you compare our 2010 earnings guidance to our prior year results, I would like to provide a few items. First, our business units' financial performance will improve as the combination of the earnings stability provided by our regulated operation and the high level of activity in a number of gas producing areas where our Pipeline and Field Services businesses have made significant capital investments will allow us to achieve improved operating income in 2010. Second, we expect to benefit in 2010 from reduced net interest expense. Third, we expect our tax rate to return to a more normal level in 2010 of approximately 37.5% compared to a 2009 tax rate of 32%. And then fourth, as I mentioned earlier, we raised equity last year to support our value growth initiatives. And we ended 2009 with approximately 392 million shares outstanding.Finally, as you know in providing guidance, we have routinely excluded the effects of mark-to-market andinventory accounting as they are timing related. And we do not try to predict the potential impact to income from our pending true-up appeal, the change in the value of Time Warner stock and the related ZENS securities or any mandated accounting changes that may occur during the year. As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings expectations. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Marianne."

Not a lot of excess capacity that we can sell on a daily firm are an uninterruptible basis, and that clearly has its impact as well. So I think those two items are the biggest driver for all-system sales. The other pieces, in ancillary services, we have PAL service, we have system balancing we have system management, we have processing. All of those kind of move around depending on really -- some's on the behavior of our customers and some is just on where gas is moving in from. But I would say, processing, because of the drop in liquids, was a fairly significant piece of the drop in 2009 compared to 2008."

They're very significant. Even if we don't get an earnings uplift, we certainly would get the cash flow and start covering this pension expense and rates. So lots of things we have to think about there before we make that decision. PUC staff and interveners can require us to go in and file in June of this year based on a December 31, 2009, test year. We filed that report on Monday. And so they'll take a few weeks. I'm sure to look at it, and then we'll start talking with them.

We have some slight increases especially on liquid's prices. But I'll also probably need to remind you that in '09, we did fix some natural gas prices in advance of the year. So we got some gas sold at $5, give or take a few pennies, which is about where the price is today. So we're predicting a little uptick in liquid's prices.

The other thing, Daniele, is we have the Shell EnCana projects. Certainly, we're investing a lot of money. We expect those volumes to ramp up kind of throughout the year '10. And we also had some projects in the Fayetteville and Woodford area. And we think we're going to see some ramp up in those areas as drilling picks back up. In the Fayetteville area, we saw some slight reduction in drilling in the fourth quarter really related to pipeline capacity coming out of that area. There were some shut-in pipes and some rigs left the area. We expect those to come back. And as they do, we expect volumes to pick up from those areas as well."

Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. Today, I am going to give my prepared remarks in a somewhat different fashion. I am first going to talk about new",1608,"Thank you, Marianne. Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy. Today, I am going to give my prepared remarks in a somewhat different fashion. I am first going to talk about new developments that occurred during the second quarter and provide some details around certain business operations that I believe are of interest to many of you. I will briefly describe our overall financial results and Gary will provide details regarding the performance of each of our business units.
Recently, there have been three questions that I am asked most often when talking to analysts or shareholders about CenterPoint Energy. First, what can you tell me about the Houston Electric rate case? Second, how are your new investments in field services doing and what are key sensitivities around profitability in that business? And finally, is there anything new with the True-Up case.
Let me take the last one first. There still has been no decision by the Texas Supreme Court on our True-Up appeal. While the Supreme Court has already ruled on some appeals that were heard after ours, we know our case is complex and are not surprised the court has yet to render a decision. We still believe that there’s a good chance and that the Supreme Court will reach a decision before the end of this year.
As most of you probably know we filed a Houston Electric rate case on June 30. This filing was required as part of the settlement we reached in our last rate case over four years ago. Our rate request has 2 pieces, a $76 million increase in our distribution rates and an $18 million in our wholesale transmission rates.
Since our filing we have determined that our present distribution rates will not produce quite as much revenue on a normalized basis as we first calculated. And accordingly, the revenue deficiency in our filings, may actually be another $15 million or still higher. The increases we have requested in our base rates are influenced raised significantly by three factors.
First, we are shifting the base rates, the investment we have made to date in our advanced metering system. This increased our revenue requirement by about $38 million. Secondly, we requested an increase in the equity component of our capital structure from the 40% level currently in rate to 50%. As a rule of thumb, each 5% movement in equity capitalization would have about a $20 million revenue requirement impact.
We have also requested an 11.25% return on equity. This is the return set by the commission in our last fully litigated rate case in 2001. For each 25 basis point change in ROE, the revenue requirement impact would be about $7 million. In addition, to these three factors, we have requested recovery of increased pension cost as well as the amortization of pension costs we deferred over the last few years.
The impact of the pension costs is substantially offset by lower depreciation expense due to revisions we have requested in our overall depreciation schedule. There have also been other typical increases in our cost of service since 2006 when our present rates were set. As a part of this filing we also requested a distribution cost recovery mechanism that would allow us to annually adjust the distribution rates to reflect changes in expense, capital investment and customer usage. The Commission currently has a rule making under consideration that encompasses some of these same principles. 
Last Friday, the Commission severed this part of our rate application due to this rule making. While we were aware that the timing of our request for the adjustment mechanism was not ideal due to the pending rule making, we felt it was important to include it in our filings. We hope that the distribution rates that come out of our case will be the baseline for any future adjustment mechanism. We expect the Commission will render a decision in our case around the end of this year.
Now let me turn to our field services businesses. This is our fastest growing business segment and one that is changing very rapidly. I believe a good way to think about this business is to divide it into two pieces. Our traditional basins where our customers develop their projects using vertical drilling and our Shale plays where horizontal drilling is the norm.
In our traditional basins, we both gather and process natural gas. We typically have dedicated acreage provisions in our contracts, but no throughput guarantees. The majority of our processing whether from our wholly owned plants or our Watscom joint venture comes from our traditional basins. 
For the first six months of this year, approximately $66 million or nearly 60% of our total operating margin was realized from our traditional basins on gathering volumes of approximately 156 billion cubic feet. For clarity, I would note that our operating margin is our reported revenues less natural gas expense. This operating margin includes gathering and processing fees and the sale of retained gas and natural gas liquids.
We estimate that the year-to-date operating margins from our traditional basins is about $20 million lower than last year, primarily as a result of the decline in drilling and production. However, we have seen some recent indications that this decline has begun to moderate. Our gathering business in the Shale plays is different. In these areas we have either volume commitments or rate of return guarantees and thus we are not exposed to the throughput risk of the traditional basins.
There are minimal amount of liquids in the natural gas we currently gathered from the Shales and therefore limited processing opportunities. Our three largest customers in the Shale plays are Shale, Encana and Exxon Mobil, the successor to our long time customer XTO. Gathering for Exxon Mobil is concentrated in the Fayetteville and Woodford Shale while gathering for Shale in Encana is concentrated in the Haynesville Shale.
The majority of our activities and investments this year have been in Haynesville so let me focus on that area for a moment. We have two major gathering systems in this region. The Magnolia system which is in North Haynesville is substantially complete with only well-connect activity remaining.
To date, we’ve spent about $286 million of our projected $325 million budget for the original 700 million cubic feet per day system. In addition, Shale and Encana have made their first request for an expansion to this system for an additional 200 million cubic feet per day. This expansion, which should cost approximately $60 million is underway and should be in service in the first quarter of next year.
The Olympia system in Southern Haynesville is under construction and is expected to be substantially complete except for well connect by the end of this year at a cost of approximately $400 million. This includes the existing facilities we purchased at closing. Construction on the trump line is underway and permits are pending for the net gathering and treating facilities.
Our gathering volumes in the Haynesville area have increased substantially during the first six months of this year and includes some third party volumes not related to Shale and Encana. In the second quarter our average gathering volumes from the Magnolia and Olympia systems were about 500 million cubic feet per day.
We have also seen some modest increases in gathering from other Shale areas. In total, our estimated average daily volume, year-to-date from all the Shale areas was approximately 700 million cubic feet per day. Operating margins from these areas was about $42 million or about 35% of our total margins for the first six months of this year on gathering volumes of approximately 128 billion cubic feet. Once again this margin includes both our gathering fees and sale of retained natural gas.
In the first six months of last year we had only minimal operating margins from the Shale area. We have been asked how to estimate the impact of changes in natural gas prices on the operating margins of our field services business. As a reminder, our gathering revenues are primarily derived from fees but there is a portion related to sales of retained natural gas. We retain gas from either a usage component of our contract or from compressor efficiencies.
As a rule of thumb we currently retain about 1% and 1.5% of all gathering volumes. So for example if we gather 100 billion cubic feet of gas we retain 1.5 bcf. Thus a $1 change in the price of gas would impact our operating margin by approximately $1.5 million.
I have covered this fairly quickly but we can spend more time during the Q&A session if further clarification is needed. With respect to our operating results for the second quarter, we had a good solid quarter overall with both business units performing at or ahead of our expectations. Operating income was $263 million this quarter compared to $253 million last year. Our net income was $81 million or $0.20 per diluted share compared to $86 million or $0.24 per diluted share in the second quarter of last year. Gary will give you additional details regarding our segment results in a moment.
In closing, I would like to remind you of the $0.195 per share quarterly dividend declared by the Board of Directors on July 22. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings in cash flows.
With that I will now turn the call over to Gary.

Let me give you a little more details about the performance of our individual business units. Houston Electric reported operating income of $122 million compared to the $129 million in 2009. As part of our sec",1083,"Thank you David and good morning to everyone. Let me give you a little more details about the performance of our individual business units. Houston Electric reported operating income of $122 million compared to the $129 million in 2009. As part of our securitization of Hurricane Ike restoration cost late last year we were required to implement a tariff that gave our customers credit for the time value of the accelerated tax benefits associated with those storm costs.
The credit mechanism chosen by the Commission resulted in a larger securitized amount but required a credit to customer billed during the life of the securitization bond. The reduction in revenues from this credit, accounts for substantially all of decline in Houston Electric’s operating income this quarter. Increased revenues associated with our customer growth of approximately 21,000 and higher income from our advanced metering system investments offset our operating expense increases.
Our gas LDCs had another solid quarter, and are having a very good year. Operating income was $10 million compared to $2 million last year. This increase was primarily due to rate changes, non-volume metric revenues such as reconnect fees and lower operating expenses. The continued success of this unit is a reflection of the efforts we have devoted to improving our rate structure as well as the continued focus on minimizing delinquencies and bad debt.
Our competitive natural gas sales and services business reported an operating loss of $6 million compared to operating income of $6 million last year. Adjusting for of the mark-to-market impact associated with the revenues this year’s operating income would have been $2 million compared to $3 million last year. While the second quarter is not typically a strong quarter for this unit, this year there was less market volatility and therefore fewer opportunities to optimize our transportation and storage assets. Without such opportunities, operating income will be primarily tied to margins from natural gas sales to commercial, industrial and wholesale customers.
Finally, let me turn to our pipeline in field services segment. Our industry pipelines reported operating income of $67 million compared to $61 million last year. Our core business performed well with increased margins from Phase IV of our Carthage to Perryville line and reduced operating expense. However, all system sales declined due to a tightening of basis spreads across our system and ancillary revenues were also down.
Our equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectra was $4 million for the second quarter of 2010 compared to $9 million last year which included $5 million related to a reduction in estimated property tax and a one-time fee received in connection with the construction of the pipeline. Our field services segment reported operating income of $31 million compared to $23 million in 2009. Substantially all of the increase was a result of the increased volumes associated with our new gathering systems in the Haynesville area and higher retained natural gas volumes and prices.
Although production from the traditional basins was down significantly, overall gathering volumes increased from the daily average of 1.1 bcf in the second quarter of 2009 to 1.7 bcf this year, a 53% increase due to increased production in the Shale play. Natural gas prices received from the sales of retained gas were about $1 more than last year. Now, before I talk about our second quarter financing activity, I would like to share with you some good news that we received yesterday.
Following the conclusion of its rating review, Moody’s upgraded the ratings of Houston Electric’s debt and assigned it a stable outlook. Houston Electric’s senior secured ratings which are the ratings assigned to Houston Electric’s mortgage bonds were upgraded to A3 from Baa1 and its senior unsecured initial ratings were upgrading to Baa2 from Baa3.
Houston Electric was the only one of our companies that was on the ratings review at Moody’s. The Moody’s continues to have positive ratings outlook from the parent company and on (inaudible). We have worked very hard to strengthen our balance sheet and are gratified by this action.
Turning to financing activity in the second quarter on June 9, we executed a $326 million equity offering consisting of 25.3 million shares following the announcement of our second set of field services agreement with Shale and Encana. As has been our practice for last several years, we have raised another $55 million year-to-date by issuing approximately 4.4 million shares through our Benefit and Investor’s Choice plans.
The proceeds from the issuance of these shares are being used primarily to fund growth in our field services unit and to strengthen our balance sheet. We now estimate our 2010 capital budget to be approximately $1.4 billion with more than $550 million of that amount being invested in our field services business.
As you know, over the last 18 months we have significantly improved our balance sheet through the issuance of the shares. In addition, we have reduced our debt level, improved our credit metrics and credit ratings and remained in a very strong liquidity position. Our overall business performance remains solid and we will continue to generate significant cash flow from operations.
Therefore, absent a very significant new capital project, we feel we have the balance sheet strength and the financial flexibility to execute our business plan without any additional equity issuances other than the modest amount of new equities that we will continue to raise through our Benefit and Investor’s Choice plans.
Finally, let me discuss our earnings guidance. We are pleased with our overall business performance in the second quarter and this morning we reaffirmed our 2010 earnings guidance in the range of $1.2 to $1.12 per diluted share. This guidance reflects the earnings per share impact of the new shares we have issued this year and an estimate of the shares being issued in our Benefit and Investor’s Choice plan.
In providing earnings guidance, we have taken into consideration our year-to-date performance as well as various economic, operational and regulatory assumptions. And as you know, we routinely exclude the effects of mark-to-market and inventory accounting as they are timing related. Also we do not try to include any potential impact to income from our pending True-Up appeal, the change in the value of Time Warner stock and the related events securities or any mandated accounting changes that may occur during the year. 
As the year progresses, we will keep you updated on our earnings’ expectations. Now, I would like to turn the call back to Marianne.

But let’s just say that $105 million or so and what we are trying to do just give you the sensitivities, of that $105 million, $38 million is AMS. And we were required to reconcile our AMS investments and we move that into base rates. So that accounts for a part of it.
$40 million accounts for the increase in the capital structure, of the equity components. Now, we firmly believe that the Commission at least some of the commissioners have indicated that they think we need a (thicker) equity component. And we believe that too and we asked for 50%. If we get 50% that has that $40 million effect, if we get 45%, well, take $20 million off of that.
And then the ROE simply, we are giving sensitivities around that and you can guess kind of what the Commission might do there as well if we can. These are the big components but there were some other big components but they were offset by other things we did that reduced expenses. So net-net those are the big items and I think those are ones that our case is most sensitive to.

We currently have about, we are building 1.5 bcf of system capacity in the Haynesville and there's an additional expansion option that Shell Encana could elect on both those systems that could take that capacity to 2.8. So we got 1.5 committed and it could go to 2.8.
If you look at where we were in our traditional basin, a year ago we were gathering 1.1 bcf a day so the Shale plays are going to quickly be the biggest part of our system and we have things from erosion in our traditional basin. So I expect that we are going to see the Shales overtake the conditional basins this year and then going forward we are going to have more and more of our revenues are going to be from these throughput guarantee contracts and rate of return guaranteed contracts.
I haven’t done the mix but we try to give you a little flavor around so far this year we have got 158 bcf a year in total from traditional and a 126 from Shale plays. My guess is by the end of this year the Shale plays will catch up and surpass the traditional basins or be very close to.

But we will urge them and the rule-making proceeding to expand the adjustment mechanism to include (mentors) and there are other parties who will have different ideas about how the Commission should do it.

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.Today, I’m first going to talk about new developments that occurred during the third quarter and provide some",2079,"Thank you, Marianne. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in CenterPoint Energy.
Today, I’m first going to talk about new developments that occurred during the third quarter and provide some details around certain business operations that I believe are of interest to many of you. Next, I’ll briefly describe our overall financial results, and then we’ll provide some details around the performance of each of our business units.
Let me begin with our true-up case. There has not yet been a decision by the Texas Supreme Court on our true-up appeal. While the Supreme Court has already ruled on some appeals that were heard after ours, we know our case is complex and I’m not surprised that the court has yet to render a decision. We still believe that there is a good chance that the Supreme Court will reach a decision before the end of this year.
In a related matter, we were pleased that last Friday the Texas Supreme Court rendered a favorable ruling in our competition transition charge, our CTC case. This case was an appeal by several intervener groups challenging the interest rate used by the PUC in establishing the CTC as well as the PUC’s decision to allow us to recover the cost of a third-party evaluation panel. The Supreme Court upheld the PUC’s order. Because our books reflect the PUC’s original order, there is no financial impact as a result of this ruling.
As most of you probably know, we filed a Houston Electric rate case on June 30. Our rate request was for $92 million increase in our distribution rates and an $18 million increase in our transmission rates. Hearings were conducted in the week of October 11.
As you would expect, most of the attention during the hearings was focused on our proposed capital structure and return on equity and our requested adjustments for depreciation, pension expense and federal income taxes.
As a reminder, we requested a capital structure with a 50% equity component and an 11.25% return. Each 5% change in equity capitalization has about a $20 million revenue requirement impact. Each 0.25% change in the equity return has a $7 million impact on revenue requirements.
I would also note that there were no significant challenges to our overall investment in rate base or to our operating expenses. We expect the administrative law judges’ recommendation in late November and a final order by the commission in late December or early January.
In a positive regulatory development, last month the PUC amended its rules relating to the transmission cost recovery factor or TCRF. This amendment authorizes electric distribution utilities to defer for future recovery, increases in cost charged by other transmission providers until such costs are reflected in rates, thereby reducing regulatory lag. This amendment is particularly important as new large transmission lines are being placed into service by other transmission providers.
We are progressing well in our implementation of an advanced metering system in our Houston Electric service territory. We are currently installing over 80,000 smart meters per month and expect to have 1 million installed by January of next year. To-date, we have invested approximately $290 million and have received $58 million of the $200 million DOE grant.
In our Gas Distribution business, early next year, we expect to begin installing remote electronic transmitters on the 1.2 million natural gas meters in and around our Houston service territory.
These devices, along with related communications infrastructure, will initially allow us to automate natural gas meter readings and ultimately enable other functionality in the years to come. We expect to invest approximately $85 million on this project, which should be completed within 36 months.
Now let me turn to our Field Services business. This has been our fastest-growing business segment and we expect significant growth to continue for the next few years. Out daily gathering volume has grown from an average of 1.2 billion cubic feet per day in the third quarter of last year to 2 billion cubic feet this year, an increase of nearly 70%.
Our gathering revenues are primarily fee based, but there is a portion related to sales of retained natural gas. We retain gas from either a usage component of our contracts or from compressor efficiencies. As a rule of thumb, we generally retain about 1.5% of all gathered volumes.
Activity in our traditional gathering basins continues to be below historical levels. In these basins, we both gather and process natural gas and the majority of our processing comes from these areas.
Our operating margin, which is our reported revenue less natural gas expense, includes gathering and processing fees as well as the sale of retained gas and natural gas liquids.
For the third quarter of this year, approximately $35 million or about 46% of our total operating margin was realized from our traditional basins on gathering volumes of approximately 77 billion cubic feet.
We estimate that the third quarter operating margin from our traditional basins has declined by about $4 million from the same period of last year, primarily as a result of the decline in drilling and production in those basins.
Our largest gathering volumes have now shifted from the traditional basins to the shale plays. In the shales, our three largest customers are subsidiaries of Shell, EnCana and Exxon Mobil, the successor to our long-time customer XTO.
Gathering for Exxon Mobil is concentrated in the Fayetteville and Woodford shales, while gathering for Shell and EnCana is concentrated in the Haynesville Shale. The majority of our activities and investments last year and this year have been in the Haynesville Shale, where we have two major gathering systems.
The Magnolia system in North Haynesville is substantially complete with only well-connect activity remaining. Through September, we have spent about $294 million of our projected $325 million budget for the original project scope.
In addition, construction of the 200 million cubic feet per day expansion that Shell and EnCana requested is underway and should be in service in the first quarter of next year at a cost of approximately $60 million.
The Olympia system in Southern Haynesville is also under construction. This system is designed to gather and create about 600 million cubic feet per day and will cost approximately $400 million of which $210 million has been spent through September.
Construction is going well and we expect to have the necessary treating plants in service before the end of the year and substantially all facilities except for well-connects completed in the first quarter of next year.
Shell and EnCana have contracted for a total of 1.5 billion cubic feet per day in capacity on the Magnolia and Olympia systems, and have the option to request expansions totaling an additional 1.3 billion cubic feet per day.
Our total gathering volumes in the Haynesville Shale in Northwest Louisiana includes some third-party volumes not related to show in EnCana. Of the nearly 900 million cubic feet of daily volumes gathered in the third quarter, about 175 million cubic feet were not related to Shell and EnCana.
We have also seen some modest increases in gathering from other shale areas. In total, our estimated daily volume from all of the shale areas in the third quarter was approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet per day.
Operating margin from these areas was about $40 million or about 54% of our total margin on gathering volumes of approximately 103 billion cubic feet. In the third quarter of last year, we had less than $10 million in operating margin from the shale areas.
We remain interested in investing in gathering facilities in other areas and continue to have discussions with producers in the Eagle Ford and Marcellus shales.
Now, let me review the company’s overall operating results for the third quarter. We had a good solid quarter, with most business units performing at or ahead of our expectations. Operating income for the company was $327 million this quarter, compared to $287 million last year.
Our net income was $123 million compared to $114 million last year. However, earnings per diluted share declined by $0.02 to $0.29 as a result of the new shares that have been issued this year.
Let me give you a little more detail about the performance of our individual business units. Houston Electric reported operating income of $178 million compared to $187 million in 2009. As Gary explained last quarter, our rates now include a credit to customer bills to reflect the time value of the accelerated tax benefits we received in connection with the cost associated with Hurricane Ike.
The reduction in revenues from this credit was approximately $9 million to the third quarter and accounted for substantially all of the decline in Houston Electric’s operating income this quarter.
Since the third quarter of last year, we have added approximately 21,000 customers to our system. Customer growth is running at about 1% or half of our historical growth rate.
We also experienced some increased operating expenses compared to last year. Exceptionally warm weather this past summer did not have a significant impact compared to last year when weather was also warmer than normal.
Our gas LDCs, typically report a loss in the third quarter due to the seasonal nature of the business. However, the operating loss this year of $4 million was significantly less than the loss of $50 million last year. This improvement was primarily due to rate increases and improved rate designs, which we have incorporated into our rate structures in several of our service territories.
The continued success of this unit is a reflection of the efforts we’ve devoted to improving our rate structure, as well as continued efforts to control our operating expenses. Our customer to employee ratio continues to improve as we maintain focus on productivity and efficiency. Particularly, noteworthy are our efforts to reduce delinquencies and bad debt expenses.
Our Competitive Natural Gas Sales and Services business reported operating income of $7 million compared to an operating loss of $8 million last year. Adjusting for mark-to-market impacts and the write down of inventory to lower cost to market, we would have had an operating loss of $6 million this year compared to a loss of $2 million last year.
This unit continues to be impacted by a significantly reduced locational and seasonal price differentials. However, retail sales to commercial and industrial customers were slightly ahead of the third quarter of last year.
Our interstate pipelines reported operating income of $68 million compared to $64 million last year. Our core business performed well and benefited from increased margins from Phase IV of our Carthage to Perryville line and deliveries to our power generation customers. However, ancillary services continued to be impacted, primarily due to a tightening of basis spreads across our system and reduced commodity prices.
Our equity income from SESH, our joint venture with Spectra was $8 million for the third quarter of 2010 compared to a loss of $5 million last year. The third quarter of last year included an $11 million non-cash charge to reflect SESH’s discontinued use of regulatory accounting.
Our Field Services segment reported operating income of $40 million compared to $23 million last year. Substantially, all of the increase was a result of increased volumes associated with our new gathering systems in the Haynesville area.
Overall, gathering volumes increased from 106 billion cubic feet in the third quarter of 2009 to 180 billion cubic feet this year, a 70% increase. Operating expenses were higher this quarter due primarily to the new facilities placed in service in the shale areas.
Overall, we are pleased with our business performance through the third quarter and this morning we reaffirmed our 2010 earnings guidance in the range $1.02 to $1.12 per diluted share. This guidance reflects the earnings per share impact of the new shares we have issued earlier this year and an estimate of the shares that will be issued in our Benefit and Investor Choice plans for the remainder of the year.
In closing, I’d like to remind to you of the $0.195 per share quarterly dividend declared by our Board of Directors on October 21. We believe our dividend actions continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to our shareholders and the confidence the Board of Directors has in our ability to deliver sustainable earnings and cash flow.
With that, I will now turn the call back to Marianne.

The point that you raised is a good one.
