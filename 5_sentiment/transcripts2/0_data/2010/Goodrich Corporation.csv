I assume you've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings release and the related presentation. There's a lot of information in both of those documents that you'll find helpful as you think about Goodrich. Rather than spend all of my prepared remarks on the information already contained in the press release, today, I will only spend a few minutes on our actual results for the fourth quarter and our outlook for 2010. Then I'll focus on trends and indicators of what we are seeing in our markets right now and what we think those trends mean to Goodrich. Overall, my remarks will be shorter than in the past which will leave more time for questions.Let's start with a quick overview of our fourth quarter results and our outlook for 2010. Our fourth quarter earnings per share of $0.82 per share were consistent with our prior outlook range of $0.72 to $0.87. Included in those earnings were several items that were non-operational in nature. The following items affected our fourth quarter 2009 earnings compared to the fourth quarter 2008. Higher expenses for restructuring, acquisition and China JV formation costs and environmental reserves totaling about $0.05 a share; higher share base compensation of about $0.05 this year; higher pension expense of about $0.13 per share; a higher tax rate, which resulted lower income of about $0.08 per share; and finally, last year, we had income related to the formation of our engine controls joint venture of about $0.12 per share. This was not repeated during the fourth quarter of 2009.The remaining change in income was primarily due to decreased commercial aftermarket sales. The unfavorable impact on income of lower aftermarket sales was once again partially offset by the continued success of our cost-containment initiatives that are in place throughout the company. Our fourth quarter 2009 sales, compared to fourth quarter 2008, decreased by about 3% or $53 million. Our large commercial airplane original equipment market experienced a sales increase of 22% and our regional, business and general aviation original equipment sales decreased by about 44% during the quarter.Sales in our commercial aftermarket channel decreased 20% in the fourth quarter 2009 compared to the fourth quarter 2008. Our defense and space market channel continues to show strong growth, with an increase in fourth quarter 2009 sales of 11% compared to the fourth quarter 2008. In the fourth quarter 2009, we achieved segment operating income margins of 14.2% compared to 16.3% in the fourth quarter of 2008. The fourth quarter 2009 margins included increased pension expense of about 1.6% of sales. For the fourth quarter 2009, net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures was excellent at $176 million or about 166% of income from continuing operations, even after we contributed $50 million more than our prior outlook to our worldwide pension plans. For the full year 2009, our free cash flow conversion was 87%, including total pension plan contributions of $238 million. If you exclude the $50 million in incremental pension contributions, our conversion rate would have been about 96%.During the fourth quarter, there were two especially noteworthy events. We completed the acquisition of Atlantic Inertial Systems or AIS during the fourth quarter. AIS is a leading provider of mission-critical guidance, stabilization and navigation products and systems for military and defense market. This will be a great addition to our portfolio, and their products serve markets that should see substantial growth in the years to come, even in a flat military spending environment. For 2010, we expect AIS to be slightly accretive to earnings including the impact of purchase accounting adjustments. The first slide of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner was the second noteworthy event. As a reminder, the Boeing 787 features a significant number of our products. Goodrich systems and components in the 787 include the company's nacelle and thrust reverser system, electric braking system, air data sensors, ice detectors, engine data concentrators, fuel management software and fuel quantity indicating systems. In addition, we provide the aircraft's proximity sensing system, the integrated fuel system for the auxiliary power unit, the cargo operating system, cabin attendant seating, exterior and flight deck lighting systems, integrated heated composite floor panels and a unique flight deck entry video surveillance system designed to interface with the aircraft's electronic flight bag system.Now I'll shift to our full year outlook for 2010. We believe the economic recovery will continue in 2010. And therefore, we expect sales growth in most of our major market channels for 2010. Overall, we expect 2010 sales of approximately $7.1 billion, up 6% to 7% from our 2009 sales of $6.7 billion. A little less than 1/2 the increase is from the added AIS sales. We expect large commercial airplane original equipment sales to increase by about 5%, assuming that current narrowbody production rates are maintained through at least early 2011, and 787 deliveries begin in late 2010. We expect regional, business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales to decrease by more than 10%, reflecting flat performance versus the second half of 2009. Large commercial regional, business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales are expected to increase by about 4% to 7%, assuming that worldwide available seat miles, ASMs, increase in the range of 1% to 3% in 2010. We expect aftermarket sales to continue to be weak for the first few months of 2010, with more significant recovery beginning towards the middle of the year. That said, we do expect the first quarter to be sequentially higher than the fourth quarter of 2009.Finally, defense and space sales of both original equipment and aftermarket products and services are expected to increase by about 15%, including sales generated by the AIS acquisition.Our outlook for 2010 net income per diluted share remains the same as we announced last October, in a range of $4.15 to $4.40. For 2010, we continue to believe that the first quarter will be higher than fourth quarter 2009, but will be our weakest quarter in 2010. Our 2010 outlook incorporates the following assumptions: A full year effective tax rate of 29% to 30%, reducing income per diluted share by about $0.19 compared to our 2009 results, pension expense is expected to be about the same as pension expense recorded in 2009. During 2009, we achieved a return on U.S. plan assets of about 11%. We will use a discount rate of about 5.9% for our U.S. plans in 2010.For 2010, we expect net cash flow provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures to exceed 85% of net income, a little better than we forecast last October. We continue to expect capital expenditures for 2010 to be in a range of $250 million to $275 million,And now expect pension contributions to be between $100 million and $150 million.Now I'll spend a few minutes on our market channels and some recent information about what we're seeing in them. Our expectations for large commercial production rates haven't changed since our prior outlook. We continue to expect Boeing and Airbus to maintain narrowbody production rates, and that they will deliver about the same number of airplanes in total as they delivered in 2009. For the commercial aftermarket, some of the macro indicators are showing improvement. Passenger airline trends continue to improve. Airline load factors remain at high levels, and RPM data continues to show positive trends. There are indications that some airlines will be raising capacity in 2010 compared to 2009.Rate traffic, which is usually a leading indicator of passenger recovery, has continued to rebound. According to IATA data, freight traffic in November of 2009 was strongly ahead of the same period in 2008. Keep in mind that there is usually a lag between traffic and capacity improvements and higher aftermarket sales, and this lag is different for all of our products. We expect that our first quarter aftermarket sales will be sequentially higher than our fourth quarter 2009 sales, but they will still be well below levels achieved during the first quarter 2009. Within our businesses, we are seeing some interesting things. Some of these observations are based on only two to three weeks data. So while they're hopeful signs, they are not yet trends.Landings for planes that we have under cost for great [ph] landing agreements were flat to slightly up in December 2009 compared to December 2008. And our wheel and brake order backlog increased sequentially in December 2009 compared to November 2009. In our Aerostructures business, piece parts sales are higher in early January than they were in December, and intake levels at our MRO facilities in U.S. and Europe are higher in January than they were in November and December of 2009. Major part sales in the fourth quarter of last year decreased significantly compared to both the prior and year-ago quarters. But the fourth quarter sales levels are consistent with our quarterly expectations for all of 2010.Aftermarket backlog in our Interiors business appears to have stabilized, which has order intake in our Landing Gear business. The market for our defense and space products remains strong. Our fourth quarter defense and space sales continue to show above-trend growth at 11%, and we expect 2010 sales to grow at a rate of about 15%. Without AIS sales, we still would be expecting a good growth of about 5% in this market channel. Overall, our performance during a very challenging 2009 was very good, and we look forward to 2010 as a year during which we return to a growth trend in most of our markets.We've been able to maintain strong margins despite significantly higher pension expense and reduced sales in our most profitable market channel. I attribute our strong results to a continued focus on cost control and operational excellence. Our focus on flight-critical systems with the non-discretionary aftermarket, our strong positions on newer large commercial aircraft and our significant and growing Defense and Space business has positioned us very well to grow sales and earnings as the economy emerges from this recession. Our longer-term prospects for sustainable growth are also excellent, fueled by our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft and development. Our financial position is excellent, with about $800 million of cash on our balance sheet and a significant cash flow generation expectations for 2010. This allows us to continue to seek acquisition opportunities that would enhance shareholder value and help our company to grow and thrive. I'm looking forward to talking to you all throughout 2010 about Goodrich as we continue to tell our story. Now I look forward to your questions."

If we look at the quarter results and add back what would be viewed as one time, how do we get to your guidance, to the midrange of your guidance? I suspect that the aftermarket growth, let's call that 5%, you've said in the past, that's about $0.06 per percentage point? So maybe that's $0.30, but how do we think about the real run rate in this fourth quarter, and then apply that $0.30?"
61199,84137176,47479,"Goodrich Corp., Q4 2009 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2010",2010-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Goodrich Corporation","Executives","That's two slightly different questions.

I mean, if you think about what we saw in the fourth quarter that is unusual, there's probably roughly $0.10 of share in the fourth quarter numbers that's unusual, non-operational if you will. And that relates to some reserve activities that we've had and restructuring, environmental, compensation reserves, et cetera that are higher than we would expect on an ongoing basis; so about a $0.10 there. And then as we mentioned, you are starting from a pretty low level of aftermarket that we expect to improve on sequentially and get growth throughout the year 2010. So the run rate is clearly above the level that we've posted in Q4 of 2009 as a starting point. When we look at our full year, if you try to gap 2009 from continuing ops of $4.43 to our guidance for 2010, there's probably four items that I'd focus on. Two up, two down. Again, restructuring, compensation reserves, other reserves, foreign exchange, that probably adds about $0.15 to our 2010 numbers. The other positive is coming from the sales activity, as you mentioned, aftermarket sales, we do expect those to be up in 2010. They're high-margin sales. So if we achieve growth rates there, we'll get incremental margin from that. Our defense and space sales is also growing. If you strip out the effect of the acquisition, they're up well. Regional business, general aviation, OE sales however are down. So the net of that is probably somewhere around a quarter. And then on the downside, we had a pretty high level of contract accounting adjustments, deferred revenue adjustments in 2009 that we would expect not to repeat at that same level in 2010. And also, we'll have low-charge hardware going to the OEs as they start to ramp up production on 787 as we start to win positions on the 737 carbon programs as well. So higher level of that activity, and then higher tax rate in 2010 versus 2009. So that's roughly $0.40 or so of negative. So the pluses and minuses are about to offset, which is why our guidance is about flat in 2010 versus 2009. And the whole trend there will be focused on how fast the aftermarket improves sequentially going through 2010. We expect it to be better in the first quarter, and the pace of that recovery will define those results."

Same growth rate, but off of a lower base. So $50 million or so less aftermarket sales of the margins we've indicated is about $0.12 a share negative. So it basically offsets the gain that we had from pension. So that's why we've left our guidance exactly where it is.

I assume you’ve all had the opportunity to review today’s earnings release and the related presentation. There’s a lot of information in both these documents that you’ll find helpful as you think about Goodrich. So, rather than spend all of my prepared remarks on the information already contained in the press release, today I will only spend a few minutes on our first quarter results and our outlook for 2010.
Then I’ll focus on trends and indicators of what we are seeing in our markets right now and what we think those trends mean for Goodrich. Let’s start with a quick overview of our first quarter results and our outlook for the year.
Our first quarter results were consistent with our expectations. Earnings per share of $0.87 were solidly operational, and were impacted by tax expense of approximately $0.12 per share higher than our prior outlook for the full year tax rate. Specifically, we incurred additional tax expense of $0.08 in the quarter related to the passage of the healthcare reform legislation, and additional expense of $0.02 per share related to delays in extending the R&D tax credit.
Our first quarter 2010 sales were nearly the same as our first quarter 2009 sales. Large commercial original equipment market channel experienced a sales increase of 12%, which was mostly attributable to the impact of the Boeing strike on quarter one 2009 sales. Our regional business and general aviation original equipment sales decreased by about 31% compared to the first quarter of 2009.
Sales in this market channel declined abruptly in the first three quarters of 2009, stabilized in the fourth quarter, and we experienced sequential growth in quarter one of 2010. Sales in our commercial aftermarket channel decreased 10% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. However, three of our eight commercial businesses reported higher aftermarket sales in the first quarter 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009.
Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were 9% higher in the first quarter 2010 than during the fourth quarter of 2009 with seven of our eight commercial businesses recording higher aftermarket sales in Q1 2010 than Q4 of 2009.
Our defense and space sales exhibited strong growth in the first quarter of 2010, increasing by 13% compared to the first quarter of 2009. Our acquisition of AIS contributed 8% of this growth, in organic sales about 5%, driven primarily by strong sales in our sensors and integrated systems business, in our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance business.
In the first quarter 2010, we achieved segment operating income margins of 15.3% compared to 17.2% in the first quarter of 2009. Sequentially, segment operating income margins were more than 1% higher than the fourth quarter of 2009. The sequential improvement was due to higher aftermarket sales and continuing emphasis on cost containment.
Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures for the first quarter 2010 was $9 million. During the first quarter 2010, we contributed $105 to our worldwide pension plans compared to contributions of $8 million in the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the first quarter 2010 pension contribution, net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures, was more than 100% of net income.
Now I will shift to our full year outlook for 2010. Our full year 2010 outlook for sales remains at approximately $7.1 billion and represents growth of about 6% compared to 2009. The outlook for 2010 net income per diluted share remains in a range of $4.15 to $4.40, even though we now expect a higher effective tax rate for the year.
We continue to expect large commercial airplane original equipment sales to increase by about 5%, assuming the 787 deliveries begin in late 2010. We expect regional business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales to decrease by more than 10%, reflecting flat performance versus the second half of 2009. We have not changed our expectations for large commercial regional business and general aviation aftermarket sales growth of about 4% to 7%, assuming that worldwide available seat miles, ASMs, increasing in the range of 1% to 3% in 2010.
We continue to expect sequentially higher aftermarket sales each quarter as we progress through the year, but don't expect sales to be higher than the year ago quarter until the second half. Finally, our outlook for defense and space sales growth is unchanged at about 15%, including sales generated by the AIS acquisition.
2010 outlook for earnings per diluted share includes a fully effective tax rate of about 31% for 2010, an increase from our prior outlook of 29% to 30%. Our tax rate outlook continues to include a full year benefit of approximately 1.5% related to an assumed extension of the US R&D tax credit, retroactive to the beginning of the year.
For 2010, we expect net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures to exceed 85% of net income, and we expect capital expenditures for 2010 to be in a range of $250 million to $275 million, and expect worldwide pension contributions to be $100 million to $150 million. Approximately $105 million has been funded year-to-date.
Now I will spend a few minutes on current activities and trends in our primary market channels. Large commercial OE production outlook has improved significantly over the last three months. Airbus announced that it is increasing A320 production rate about 6% to 36 per month later this year, and Boeing has announced that it will increase 777 production from 5 per month to 7 per month in the middle of next year, and that it will accelerate its 747-8 rate increase to 2 per month from 2013, moving forward to 2012.
For the commercial aftermarket, some of the macro indicators are showing improvements. Our sequential sales improvement from the fourth quarter 2009 was the first sequential improvement since the third quarter of 2008, and we continue to believe that each quarter this year will show sequential improvements over the previous quarter. We expect strong commercial aftermarket growth beyond 2010. Over the last two years, the active fleet of commercial aircraft has grown by about 6%. As the fleet continues to grow and airline maintenance practices return to more normal levels they should see very good growth rates driven by both catch up demand and normal ageing.
Passenger airline and freight trains continue to improve. Airline load factors remain at high levels especially in the US and RBM [ph] data continues to show positive trends. Within our businesses, we are also seeing some positive developments that indicate recovery in the aftermarket is under way. During the first quarter, our wheels and brakes business saw a pickup in activity on 747 and A330 airplanes, an indicator of good international and freight traffic trends.
In our aerostructures business, piece part sales trends continued to be favorable. Major part sales in the first quarter were consistent with our expectations for the year. Order intake and coding [ph] activity in most of our MRO shops is also improving. We are also seeing favorable code aging trends, indicating that airplanes, airlines rather are making decisions to order parts repairs faster than they were last year.
Market for our defense and space products remains strong. Our first quarter defense and space sales growth of 13% included 5% organic growth and was in line with our expectations. Overall, our performance during the first quarter was in line with our expectations and the quarter was a good step towards this being a year in which we returned to growth trends in most of our markets.
We have been able to maintain strong margins despite our class of aftermarket sales through a continued focus on cost control and operational excellence. Our longer-term prospects for sustainable growth are also excellent, fuelled by our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft currently in development.
As I noted in our investor conference last year, I believe that Goodrich can grow to a company with more than $10 billion in sales and higher segment operating income margins by 2014. Our financial position remains excellent with almost $800 million of cash on our balance sheet, and significant cash flow generation expectations for 2010. This allows us to continue to seek acquisition opportunities that would further enhance our growth rates and cash generation and drive shareholder value. I look forward to talking to all of you through 2010 as we continue to tell the Goodrich story.
And now we will open it up for questions.

In terms of assumptions, we did see the 9% growth from the fourth quarter of 2009. So that sets us on a real solid growth trend sequentially. To get to the 4% to 7%, we need to average somewhere in the 4% to 5% sequential growth for each of the next three quarters to get into that range.
And based on the trends that we have seen so far developing in the first quarter with respect to order backlog, the pace of orders, code activities, things like that as well as the breath that we’ve seen across all of our commercially oriented businesses. We have pretty good confidence that at least moving into Q2, we are on that same kind of a track. We don't have a lot of visibility going out to Q3 and Q4, but if you look at the kind of macro trends, the recovering schedules that the airlines have posted through the middle of the year et cetera, it seems to be shaping up very consistent with those expectations.

We do supply spirit on parts of those nacelles. We would expect to try to maintain that kind of relationships, especially if they term this a derivative and it is another single engine procurement. If it is two engine procurement that opens up opportunities, more opportunities.
As far as Airbus goes, we would intend to bid on that. We currently have the nacelles on both the v2500 and CFM56. And we think there will be lot of aircraft even with the old model that will overlap for a while. We think there will be probably at least 6000 of those aircraft eventually flying made through 2015, and aftermarket long after that. So even if we worked on the new one, we are still going to get lot of aftermarket, but we would expect to be on the new one if they decide to reengine. And I don't think - those decisions haven't been made. So a lot of this is pure speculation at this point. So that is about all I can tell you.

We have got the flight control actuation systems on the A320 aircraft and as they continue to age you know, we just see good year-over-year growth in that particular business. The wheels and brakes business is one of the earlier businesses to turn because it is got the shorter cycle from airline activity to aftermarket sales.

The majors, which are very large pieces of the nacelle structure or the thrust reverser have always been lumpy in terms of sales during the year, but what we've seen so far in the first quarter is absolutely consistent with the rate we were in the last half of 2009, and so when we get to 2011 and there is more activity, we get back to more normal ASMs in some of these, and we get through the kind of engine destocking. I think we'll see a greater amount of major sales by the time we get to 2011.

You know, we had guided I think last year's total was about $45 million and our expectation is that they would be positive in 2010 but less than last year of 45, and we're still tracking you know pretty well with that.
The nature of the contract adjustments is similar to what we've seen before, you know, when contracts roll over and they are repriced, we get a benefit there as some contracts that are shorter cycle add volume or they get extended you know, three months at a time, et cetera we add volume to those units. That’s a help and we continue to work the cost side you know, very diligently within our aerostructures business in particular. So they continue to drive you know, overheads down, drive you know, production costs down, you know, continue to move products where we can to low-cost countries and low-cost suppliers. So we continue to get benefit there as well.
And on the wheels and brakes side, you know, it has been a longer-term story that continues which is the quality of the brake material and the life that we get on that material has continued to be better than expected and we are seeing benefits there.

We also have some one-time adjustments that we expect as we settle various disputes and cases with the IRS, here as well as outside the US.

We have taken out a plant in Arizona, moved to Mexico. We keep moving more product to low-cost country. We are really driving continuous improvement in our factories worldwide. We certainly have had a fair amount of indirect cost come out and we were - like everyone else our travel was reduced and our travel and entertainment expenses. But some of that will have to comeback as you got to go see your customer.
But a lot of the other stuff isn’t coming back, and that is the idea on the continuous improvement. We want to keep getting more and more efficient. I think one of the reasons that we didn't have the same reduction in force on this recession, with only 1000 people out of 25,000 as opposed to 5000 after 9/11, when SARS and the Iraqi war hit back in 2003. It is because we have gotten much, much more efficient and we just haven't hired people as rapidly as in the past, because we are able to do more with less.

I assume you've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings press release and the related presentation. There's a lot of information in both of these documents that you will find helpful as you think about",1421,"Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. I assume you've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings press release and the related presentation. There's a lot of information in both of these documents that you will find helpful as you think about Goodrich. So rather than spend all of my prepared remarks on the information already contained in the press release, today, I'll only spend a few minutes on our first quarter results and our outlook for 2010. Then I'll focus on trends and indicators of what we are seeing in our markets right now, and what we think those trends mean for Goodrich. Let's start with a quick overview of our first quarter results and our outlook for the year.
Our first quarter results were consistent with our expectations. Earnings per share of $0.87 were solidly operational and were impacted by tax expense approximately up $0.12 per share higher than our prior outlook for the full year tax rate. Specifically, we incurred additional tax expense of $0.08 in the quarter related to the passage of the healthcare reform legislation and additional expense of $0.02 per share related to delays in extending the R&D tax credit.
Our first quarter 2010 sales were nearly the same as our first quarter 2009 sales. Large commercial airplane original equipment market channel experienced a sales increase of 12%, which was mostly attributable to the impact of the Boeing strike on quarter one 2009 sales. Our Regional business and general aviation original equipment sales decreased by about 31% compared to the first quarter of 2009.  Sales in this market channel declined abruptly in the first three quarters of 2009, stabilized in the fourth quarter and we experienced sequential growth in quarter one of 2010. 
Sales in our Commercial AfterMarket channel decreased 10% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. However, three of our eight commercial businesses reported higher aftermarket sales in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the first quarter of 2009. Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were 9% higher in the first quarter 2010 than during the fourth 2009 with seven of our eight commercial businesses reporting higher -- aftermarket -- sales in Q1 2010 than Q4 2009.
Our defense and space sales exhibit strong growth in the first quarter of 2010, increasing by 13% compared to the first quarter of 2009. Our acquisition of AIS contributed 8% of this growth and organic sales about 5%, driven primarily by strong sales in our Sensors and Integrated Systems business and our Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance business.
The first quarter 2010, we achieved segment operating income margins of 15.3%, compared to 17.2% in the first quarter of 2009. Sequentially, segment operating income margins were more than 1% higher than the fourth quarter of 2009. The sequential improvement was due to higher aftermarket sales and continuing emphasis on cost containment. Net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures for the first quarter 2010 was $9 million. During the first quarter 2010, we contributed $105 million to our worldwide pension plans, compared to contributions of $8 million in the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the first quarter 2010 pension contribution, net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures was more than 100% of net income. 
Now let's shift to our full year outlook for 2010.  Our full year 2010 outlook for sales remains at approximately $7.1 billion and represents growth of about 6% compared to 2009. The outlook for 2010 net income per diluted share remains in a range of $4.15 to $4.40 a share, even though we now expect a higher effective tax rate for the year.
We continue to expect large commercial airplane original equipment sales to increase by about 5%, assuming that 787 deliveries begin in late 2010. We expect Regional business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales to decrease by more than 10%, reflecting flat performance versus the second half of 2009. We have not changed our expectations for large commercial regional business and general aviation aftermarket sales growth of about 4% to 7%, assuming that worldwide available seat miles, ASMs, increase in the range of 1% to 3% in 2010. We continue to expect sequentially higher aftermarket sales each quarter as we progress through the year but don't expect sales to be higher than the year ago quarter until the second half. Finally, our outlook for defense and space sales growth is unchanged at about 15%, including sales generated by the AIS acquisition.
2010 outlook for earnings per diluted share includes a full year effective tax rate of about 31% for 2010, an increase from our prior outlook of 29% to 30%. Our tax rate outlook continues to include a full year benefit of approximately 1.5% related to an assumed extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit retroactive to the beginning of the year. For 2010 we expect net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures to exceed 85% of net income. We continue to expect capital expenditures for 2010 to be in a range of $250 million to $275 million and expect worldwide contributions to be $100 million to $150 million, approximately $105 million has been funded year to date.
Now I'll spend a few minutes on current activity and trends in our primary market channels. Large commercial OE production outlook has improved significantly over the last three months. Airbus announced that it is increasing A320 production rate, about 6% to 36 per month later this year. And Boeing has announced that it will increase 777 production from five per month to seven per month in the middle of next year and that it will accelerate its 747-8 rate increase to two per month from 2013 moving forward to 2012. 
For the commercial aftermarket, some of the macro indicators are showing improvements. Our sequential sales improvement from the fourth quarter 2009 was the first sequential improvement since the third quarter of 2008, and we continue to believe that each quarter this year will show sequential improvements over the previous quarter. We expect strong commercial aftermarket growth beyond 2010. Over the last two years, the active fleet of commercial aircraft has grown by about 6%. As the fleet continues to grow and airline maintenance practices return to more normal levels, we should see very good growth rates, driven by both catch-up demand and normal aging.
Passenger airline and freight trends continue to improve. Airline load factors remain at high levels, especially in the U.S., and RPM data continues to show positive trends.  Within our businesses, we're also seeing some positive developments that indicate recovery in the aftermarket is underway. During the first quarter, our Wheel and Brake business saw a pickup in activity on 747 and A330 airplanes, an indicator of good international and freight traffic trends. In our Aero Structures business, piece part sales trends continued to be favorable. Major part sales in the first quarter were consistent with our expectations for the year. 
Order intake and quote activity in most of our MRO shops is also improving. We are also seeing favorable quote aging trends indicating that airlines are making decisions to order parts repairs faster then they were last year. Market for our defense and space products remains strong. Our first quarter defense and space sales growth of 13% included 5% organic growth and was in line with our expectations.
Overall, our performance during the first quarter was in line with our expectations, and the quarter was a good step towards this being a year in which we return to growth trends in most of our markets. We've been able to maintain strong margins despite our loss of aftermarket sales through a continued focus on cost control and operational excellence. Our longer-term prospects for sustainable growth are also excellent, fueled by our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft currently in development. As I noted in our investor conference last year, I believe that Goodrich can grow to a company with more than $10 billion in sales and higher segment operating income margins by 2014.
Our financial position remains excellent with almost $800 million of cash on our balance sheet and significant cash flow generation expectations for 2010. This has allowed us to continue to seek acquisition opportunities that would further enhance our growth rates and cash generation and drive shareholder value. I look forward to talking to all of you through 2010 as we continue to tell the Goodrich story. And now we'll open up for questions."

And based on the trends that we've seen so far developing in the first quarter with respect to order backlog, the pace of orders, quote activity, things like that, as well is the breadth that we've seen across all of our commercially-oriented businesses, we have pretty good confidence that, at least moving into Q2, we're on that same kind of a track. We don't have a lot of visibility going out to Q3 and four, but if you look at the kind of macro trends the recovering schedules that the airlines have posted through the middle of the year, etcetera, it seems to be shaping up very consistent with those expectations."

We currently have the nacelles on both the B2500 and CFM56, and we think there will be a lot of aircraft even with the old model that will overlap for a while. And we think there will be probably at least 6,000 of those aircraft eventually flying made through 2015 and aftermarket long after that.

We've got the flight control actuation systems on the A320 aircraft, and as they continue to age, we just see good year-over-year growth in that particular business. The Wheel and Brake business is one of the earlier businesses to turn because it's got the shortest cycle from airline activity to aftermarket sales. So we think that's being driven by the upturn in aircraft activity, and actuation actually driven more by the longer-term trend of a lot of content on high-volume production airplanes that are aging and, therefore, driving a lot of additional aftermarket."

In the room with me today are Marshall Larsen, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Scott Kuechle, our CFO. We will start with brief prepared remarks followed by Q&A. A presentation is available at our Web site www.goodrich.com, which together with our press release, provides the basis for most of our remarks.
Before we start, let me remind you that today's remarks include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. They are also detailed in today's earnings press release. I urge you to read them carefully. This conference call is being webcast and replays will be available at our Internet site beginning this afternoon. 
Once again, we ask that callers limit themselves to one question each so that we can have time to allow all of you to ask your questions. If you have further unanswered questions, you can get back into the queue and ask another question, time permitting. Now I'll turn the call over to Marshall, who will provide you with an overview of our first quarter 2010 results and our updated full year outlook for 2010."
61199,100477666,59831,"Goodrich Corp., Q1 2010 Earnings Call, Apr-22-2010",2010-04-22,"Earnings Calls","Goodrich Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. I assume you've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings press release and the related presentation. There's a lot of information in both of these documents that you will find helpful as you think about",1421,"Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. I assume you've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings press release and the related presentation. There's a lot of information in both of these documents that you will find helpful as you think about Goodrich. So rather than spend all of my prepared remarks on the information already contained in the press release, today, I'll only spend a few minutes on our first quarter results and our outlook for 2010. Then I'll focus on trends and indicators of what we are seeing in our markets right now, and what we think those trends mean for Goodrich. Let's start with a quick overview of our first quarter results and our outlook for the year.
Our first quarter results were consistent with our expectations. Earnings per share of $0.87 were solidly operational and were impacted by tax expense approximately up $0.12 per share higher than our prior outlook for the full year tax rate. Specifically, we incurred additional tax expense of $0.08 in the quarter related to the passage of the healthcare reform legislation and additional expense of $0.02 per share related to delays in extending the R&D tax credit.
Our first quarter 2010 sales were nearly the same as our first quarter 2009 sales. Large commercial airplane original equipment market channel experienced a sales increase of 12%, which was mostly attributable to the impact of the Boeing strike on quarter one 2009 sales. Our Regional business and general aviation original equipment sales decreased by about 31% compared to the first quarter of 2009. Sales in this market channel declined abruptly in the first three quarters of 2009, stabilized in the fourth quarter and we experienced sequential growth in quarter one of 2010. 
Sales in our Commercial Aftermarket channel decreased 10% in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the first quarter of 2009. However, three of our eight commercial businesses reported higher aftermarket sales in the first quarter of 2010, compared to the first quarter of 2009. Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were 9% higher in the first quarter 2010 than during the fourth 2009 with seven of our eight commercial businesses reporting higher -- aftermarket -- sales in Q1 2010 than Q4 2009.
Our defense and space sales exhibit strong growth in the first quarter of 2010, increasing by 13% compared to the first quarter of 2009. Our acquisition of AIS contributed 8% of this growth and organic sales about 5%, driven primarily by strong sales in our Sensors and Integrated Systems business and our Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance business.
The first quarter 2010, we achieved segment operating income margins of 15.3% compared to 17.2% in the first quarter of 2009. Sequentially, segment operating income margins were more than 1% higher than the fourth quarter of 2009. The sequential improvement was due to higher aftermarket sales and continuing emphasis on cost containment. Net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures for the first quarter 2010 was $9 million. During the first quarter 2010, we contributed $105 million to our worldwide pension plans compared to contributions of $8 million in the first quarter of 2009. Excluding the first quarter 2010 pension contribution, net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures was more than 100% of net income. 
Now let's shift to our full year outlook for 2010. Our full year 2010 outlook for sales remains at approximately $7.1 billion and represents growth of about 6% compared to 2009. The outlook for 2010 net income per diluted share remains in a range of $4.15 to $4.40 a share, even though we now expect a higher effective tax rate for the year.
We continue to expect large commercial airplane original equipment sales to increase by about 5%, assuming that 787 deliveries begin in late 2010. We expect Regional business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales to decrease by more than 10%, reflecting flat performance versus the second half of 2009. We have not changed our expectations for large commercial regional business and general aviation aftermarket sales growth of about 4% to 7%, assuming that worldwide available seat miles, ASMs, increase in the range of 1% to 3% in 2010. We continue to expect sequentially higher aftermarket sales each quarter as we progress through the year but don't expect sales to be higher than the year-ago quarter until the second half. Finally, our outlook for defense and space sales growth is unchanged at about 15%, including sales generated by the AIS acquisition.
2010 outlook for earnings per diluted share includes a full year effective tax rate of about 31% for 2010, an increase from our prior outlook of 29% to 30%. Our tax rate outlook continues to include a full year benefit of approximately 1.5% related to an assumed extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit retroactive to the beginning of the year. For 2010, we expect net cash provided by operating activities, minus capital expenditures to exceed 85% of net income. We continue to expect capital expenditures for 2010 to be in a range of $250 million to $275 million and expect worldwide pension contributions to be $100 million to $150 million. Approximately $105 million has been funded year to date.
Now I'll spend a few minutes on current activity and trends in our primary market channels. Large commercial OE production outlook has improved significantly over the last three months. Airbus announced that it is increasing A320 production rate about 6% to 36 per month later this year. And Boeing has announced that it will increase 777 production from five per month to seven per month in the middle of next year and that it will accelerate its 747-8 rate increase to two per month from 2013 moving forward to 2012. 
For the commercial aftermarket, some of the macro indicators are showing improvements. Our sequential sales improvement from the fourth quarter 2009 was the first sequential improvement since the third quarter of 2008, and we continue to believe that each quarter this year will show sequential improvements over the previous quarter. We expect strong commercial aftermarket growth beyond 2010. Over the last two years, the active fleet of commercial aircraft has grown by about 6%. As the fleet continues to grow and airline maintenance practices return to more normal levels, we should see very good growth rates, driven by both catch-up demand and normal aging.
Passenger airline and freight trends continue to improve. Airline load factors remain at high levels especially in the U.S., and RPM data continues to show positive trends. Within our businesses, we're also seeing some positive developments that indicate recovery in the aftermarket is underway. During the first quarter, our Wheel and Brake business saw a pickup in activity on 747 and A330 airplanes, an indicator of good international and freight traffic trends. In our Aero Structures business, piece part sales trends continued to be favorable. Major part sales in the first quarter were consistent with our expectations for the year. 
Order intake and quote activity in most of our MRO shops is also improving. We are also seeing favorable quote aging trends indicating that airlines are making decisions to order parts repairs faster then they were last year. Market for our defense and space products remains strong. Our first quarter defense and space sales growth of 13% included 5% organic growth and was in line with our expectations.
Overall, our performance during the first quarter was in line with our expectations, and the quarter was a good step towards this being a year in which we return to growth trends in most of our markets. We've been able to maintain strong margins despite our loss of aftermarket sales through a continued focus on cost control and operational excellence. Our longer-term prospects for sustainable growth are also excellent, fueled by our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft currently in development. As I noted in our investor conference last year, I believe that Goodrich can grow to a company with more than $10 billion in sales and higher segment operating income margins by 2014.
Our financial position remains excellent with almost $800 million of cash on our balance sheet and significant cash flow generation expectations for 2010. This has allowed us to continue to seek acquisition opportunities that would further enhance our growth rates and cash generation and drive shareholder value. I look forward to talking to all of you through 2010 as we continue to tell the Goodrich story. And now we'll open up for questions."

In terms of assumptions, we did see the 9% growth from the fourth quarter of 2009. So that sets us on a real solid growth trend sequentially. To get to the 4% to 7%, we need to average somewhere in the 4% to 5% sequential growth for each of the next three quarters to get into that range. And based on the trends that we've seen so far developing in the first quarter with respect to order backlog, the pace of orders, quote activity, things like that, as well is the breadth that we've seen across all of our commercially oriented businesses, we have pretty good confidence that, at least moving into Q2, we're on that same kind of a track. We don't have a lot of visibility going out to Q3 and four, but if you look at the kind of macro trends the recovering schedules that the airlines have posted through the middle of the year, etcetera, it seems to be shaping up very consistent with those expectations."

We do supply Spirit on parts of those nacelle's. We would expect to try to maintain that kind of a relationship, especially if they turn this a derivative, and it's another single-engine procurement. If it's two-engine procurement, that opens up opportunities, more opportunities. As far as Airbus goes, we would intend to bid on that. We currently have the nacelles on both the B2500 and CFM56, and we think there will be a lot of aircraft even with the old model that will overlap for a while. And we think there will be probably at least 6,000 of those aircraft eventually flying made through 2015 and aftermarket long after that. So even if we worked on a new one, we're still going to get a lot of aftermarket, but we would expect to be on a new one if they decide to re-engine. And I don't think those decisions haven't been made, so a lot of this is pure speculation at this point. So that's about all I can tell you."

At least the first two of those -- I think there's a good tail wind from the secular trend of just aging aircraft where we have a lot of content. We've got the flight control actuation systems on the A320 aircraft, and as they continue to age, we just see good year-over-year growth in that particular business. The Wheel and Brake business is one of the earlier businesses to turn because it's got the shortest cycle from airline activity to aftermarket sales. So we think that's being driven by the upturn in aircraft activity, and actuation actually driven more by the longer-term trend of a lot of content on high-volume production airplanes that are aging and, therefore, driving a lot of additional aftermarket."

I assume you've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings release and the related presentation. There's a lot of information in both of those documents that I think you'll find helpful about Goodrich. 
Today I'll spend just a few minutes on the second quarter results and our outlook for 2010. Then I'll focus on trends and indicators of what we are currently seeing in our markets and what we think these trends mean to Goodrich.
Overall, our second quarter earnings continued to show the sustainability of our cost-containment efforts, and our sales showed year-over-year growth for the first time in several quarters. Our earnings per share of $1.24 were excellent operationally despite a higher-than-expected tax rate. Our 17.9% operating income margin was our highest reported margin since the third quarter of 2008. Our strong operational performance allowed us to increase our full year EPS expectation to $4.30 to $4.45 from our prior outlook of $4.15 to $4.40.
Our second quarter 2010 sales rose by 1% compared to our second quarter 2009. Our large commercial airplane original equipment market channel decreased by 1%, which was simply a result of the timing of deliveries to Boeing and Airbus.
Our regional, business and general aviation original equipment sales decreased about 10% compared to the second quarter of '09. However, sales in this market channel were up 5% sequentially and are up over 15% from their bottom in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Sales in our commercial aftermarket channel decreased 3% in the second quarter 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009. Three of our eight commercial businesses reported higher aftermarket sales in the second quarter 2010 compared to the same period a year ago. Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were 3% higher in the second quarter 2010 than in the first quarter 2010.
We continue to see positive aftermarket trends, which I'll discuss more about in a few minutes.
In our defense and space, sales exhibited good overall growth in the second quarter of 2010, increasing by 11% compared to the second quarter of 2009. Our acquisition of Atlantic Inertial Systems, AIS, contributed 9% of this growth.
Organic sales growth of about 2% was driven primarily by our strong sales in our Landing Gear, Sensors and Integrated Systems, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Engine Controls and Power Systems businesses.
In the second quarter 2010, we achieved segment operating income margins of 17.9% compared to 16% in the second quarter 2009 and 15.3% in the first quarter of this year. The improvement was due to strong operational performance, relentless pursuit of continuous improvement and favorable revisions and estimates for certain long-term contracts.
Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures for the second quarter 2010 was very strong at $193 million, which is approximately 121% of second quarter net income.
For our full year 2010 outlook, sales are unchanged at approximately $7.1 billion. Our current outlook represents growth of about 6% compared to 2009.
The outlook for 2010 net income per diluted share has been increased to $4.30 to $4.45 compared to our prior outlook of $4.15 to $4.40, driven primarily by better operating margin performance.
We now expect large commercial airplane original equipment sales to increase about 3%. The slight reduction compared to our prior outlook simply represents minor scheduling adjustments by Boeing and Airbus. We now expect regional, business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales to decrease by 8% to 10%, which is an improvement compared to our prior outlook. We believe that sales in this market channel bottomed in late 2009, and we should see year-over-year growth beginning next quarter. 
We have slightly lowered our expectations for the large commercial, regional, business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales growth. We now expect this channel to grow in the low-single-digit range compared to our prior outlook of 4% to 7%. We continue to expect sequentially higher aftermarket sales each quarter as we progress through the year. 
We should start to see higher year-over-year sales beginning in the third quarter. We believe sales for this market channel bottomed in the fourth quarter 2009, and we are currently more than 10% above those levels.
Finally, our outlook for defense and space sales growth has risen. We now expect sales growth in excess of 15% including sales generated by the AIS acquisition that closed in December of last year. Organic growth in this market channel is expected to be greater than 5%.
Our 2010 outlook for earnings per diluted share includes a full year effective tax rate of about 31% for 2010, unchanged from our prior outlook. Our tax rate outlook continues to include a full year benefit of approximately 1.5% or $0.10 per diluted share related to an assumed extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit retroactive to the beginning of the year.
For 2010, we continue to expect net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures to exceed 85% of net income. We now expect capital expenditures for 2010 to be approximately $250 million and expect worldwide pension contributions to be approximately $150 million pre-tax.
Now I'll focus on current activity and trends in our primary market channels. The large commercial OE production outlook continues to look very strong for the next several years. The order flow at the Farnborough Airshow was excellent. The production rate increases announced by Boeing and Airbus over the last several months will have no significant impact in our 2010 sales, but these rates, along with increasing 787 deliveries, should provide for strong growth in this market channel for several years.
For the commercial aftermarket, some of the macro indicators are showing improvement. Passenger airline and freight trends continue to improve. Airline load factors remain at high levels, especially in the U.S., and RPM data continues to show positive trends.
Load factors are at all-time highs for some U.S. airlines. Freight traffic continues to grow faster than passenger traffic. Although freight capacity growth is still lagging traffic growth, we believe freight traffic trends are a good leading indicator of future economic trends. While these trends don't affect current period aftermarket sales, they bode well for the future.
Even though capacity growth is lagging significantly behind passenger growth this cycle, if the airlines can keep growing RPMs and profits, they will eventually add additional capacity. Such capacity increases can come in the form of new airplanes, increased utilization of existing airplanes or returning airplanes from storage. All three actions like these on the part of airlines result in increased aftermarket sales for companies like Goodrich.
Over the past two years, the active fleet of large commercial aircraft has grown about 6%. As the fleet continues to grow in age and airline maintenance practices return to more normal levels, we should see a very good and sustainable aftermarket sales growth rates driven by both catch-up demand and normal aging.
Within our businesses, we continue to see some positive trends indicating that recovery in the aftermarket is underway and is sustainable. Our Wheels and Break business experienced year-over-year sales growth for the second quarter in a row. It's a very good sign as we believe this business is one of the leading indicators of overall activity growth in the commercial aftermarket channel.
In our Aerostructures business, major sales are filling in very nicely, and we remain confident they will meet our full year expectations. Even though Aerostructures’ MRO sales have been weaker than expected so far this year, we have seen our MRO booking backlog increase during the last two months.
Our Landing Gear business is seeing significant quote activity, mostly for sales that will occur in 2011 due to long lead times for these parts. In our Interiors business, the book-to-bill ratio is now solidly over 1.0.
Overall, most of our businesses are seeing favorable quote trends and improving backlogs. We continue to see very strong demand for our defense and space products, including products supporting helicopters, ISR and wheels and brakes on fixed-wing aircraft worldwide.
Overall, our performance during the second quarter was excellent from an operational standpoint and in line with our expectations at the market-channel level. We've been able to grow our already strong margins despite slightly lower aftermarket sales through a continued focus on cost control and operational excellence. Our longer-term prospects for sustainable growth are also bright, fueled by our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft currently in development.
Goodrich's financial position remains excellent with more than $850 million of cash on our balance sheet, and a significant cash flow generation expectations for 2010. This allows us to continue to seek acquisition opportunities that would further enhance our growth rates and cash generation and drive shareholder value.
I'm looking forward to talking to all of you throughout 2010, and I'm confident that the commercial aerospace is on the upswing. I look forward to your questions."

I did make comments about -- I didn't think it was in the best interest of the supply chain to re-engine either on Boeing or Airbus single-aisle. And the reasoning behind that is that going to stretch our supply base even thinner. And I'm not talking about the Tier 1s like Goodrich. If one of them decides to re-engine or both, we can do it. We've got the resources to do it, and our customers at Airbus and Boeing know that. It's the smaller suppliers throughout the supply chain, those that supply us and other people like other companies like Goodrich, that I worry about getting stretched too thin. So it's more on a supply base comment. And I think if you listen to the Boeing CEO the other day, they have some concerns about the same thing in addition to productivity enhancements that can be had by a re-engining and what the timing of that could be. So as you look at the backlog on A320s and 737MGs, the backlog is huge. And so there is an ability to continue to produce those aircraft with a very good sales rate. So it just takes a supply base that's already producing for those increased rates that are being announced, and then have to come in and do an additional engine or engines for both aircraft. So it's more of a supply chain issue. And for Goodrich, if Airbus decides to do it, then we'll pursue it. If Boeing decides to do it, we'll pursue it. I mean, it's something that we're capable of doing and capable of doing profitably."

The underlying strength that drove those is pretty broad, and it relates to the same things we've talked about in prior quarters. We’ve got labor hour improvements, which is productivity and efficiency. We’ve got added units to the forecast. We’ve got some supply chain savings as our supply chain organization continues to renegotiate and negotiate new contracts with existing suppliers and with suppliers located in lower-cost areas of the world. We completed some contract negotiations with some customers that were also favorable in the quarter. And we continue as contracts terminate to get price increases as well, occasionally on those contracts as well. So there's a good mix of drivers that in general are sustainable, and they’ve driven favorable adjustments in the past. And with a rising volume environment as the OEs continue to increase production, that bodes well toward favorable adjustments in the future. I don't see them coming at the same rate that we got them in the second quarter. That's not a sustainable level. So if you take that out and move it to a more sustainable level, we're still producing operating income margins in the 16%-type range in the quarter. And that's kind of our expectation for the full year 2010. We got excellent growth in margins in the Electronic Systems business for reasons other than, obviously, the contract adjustments, and those are sustainable going forward -- again, not at the same level that they posted in the second quarter, but it's real good progress on the margin line this year.

On sustainability, Rob, if you think about when this financial recession first hit at the end of '08, September of '08, and people were taking out costs, we took out a lot of indirect cost as well as direct. And there was a combination of supply chain savings, continuous improvement in our operations and in our offices. And certainly, we pared down some of the indirect like travel and so on. Well, if you look at the 17.9% right now in the year-to-date margins, our travel this year is up between 8% and 9%. So we're coming back on that. We knew some of that would come back. Our professional services and fees are up a little bit. Our R&D spend is up. That's all hitting P&L. But we're benefiting from securing some long-term agreements with our suppliers at reasonable prices, and we're seeing the benefit of some of the restructuring we've initiated last year. And we're achieving sustained savings from continuous improvement activity by lowering the core cost of quality, scrap, rework and more efficient production flow in our factories. So there's a lot of sustainability to the continuous improvement. And that's why what Scott was saying about we can maintain a pretty good margin going forward. One small example in a plant, and I won't tell you which one at this point in time. But they have about over a 10% return on sales operating margin in the product lines in there, and we think we can take that up another eight to 10 percentage points in the next 12 months through continuous improvement by getting one-piece flow into plant and so on. So we've really made a concerted effort, and the same thing is true on the cash flow side. Every one of our businesses now has a macro plan implemented through continuous improvement to increase that cash flow. So these are things that are not going to stop."

So the incremental margins are favorable in most of the businesses, but when you think about OE coming from 787, that's an area that's not going to be incremental margin for the company in the early stages of production for that aircraft. And it's going to be years, like it has been in the past when we've introduced a new aircraft, to get to a maturity level where we are producing solid margins on those programs. So we don't expect 787 volume to be helpful from a margin standpoint or an EPS standpoint near term. On the military side, some of the military growth that we're going to see moving into 2011 is related to government-contract work, which also comes in at slightly lower margins than our average. So the real trick to moving margins north is, like Marshall said, sustaining the cost-reduction initiative, productivity initiatives that we have. And then, there's a question on exactly where the aftermarket growth rate will be for 2011. We're very bullish that it will be higher than this year. But just how high is going to determine kind of where we set the margin target for 2011, and it's just a little bit too early to do that."

So it's not where we want to get, but I think it will, and you see the worldwide ASKs and the RPMs. The trends are favorable, particularly when you get continent to continent. We've seen large double-digit increases in the international travel. So I think one of the things that's happening with 737MGs and A320s is that they are delivering quite a few new aircraft, obviously, into the worldwide fleet. And so you're getting brand new aircraft that take a while before you get the aftermarket. Now Wheels and Brakes turns around pretty quickly, but it's still going to be probably a year before you start seeing too much MRO on the Wheel and Brake side of it.

If we were to keep the same discount rate as '09 and achieve our long-term rate of return assumption on asset, we would expect that to be about $150 million, $152 million in 2011. Obviously, discount rates have come down significantly so far this year, and asset returns through the first six months of the year have been about zero. You go through July, we're probably up 4% or so for the asset-return assumption. So if you said, it doesn't get any better or change from the end of July, we would probably be around $205 million to $210 million of pension expense for next year. So that's about a $0.25 delta over where we would expect to be this year. And I just remind you that we’ve got five more months to go in 2010 for discount rates to change, assets to continue to improve, we hope. So it's obviously too early to specify a number for 2011.

I assume you've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings release and the related presentation. There's a lot of information in both of those documents that I think you'll find helpful about Goodrich. 
Today I'll spend just a few minutes on the second quarter results and our outlook for 2010. Then I'll focus on trends and indicators of what we are currently seeing in our markets and what we think these trends mean to Goodrich.
Overall, our second quarter earnings continued to show the sustainability of our cost-containment efforts, and our sales showed year-over-year growth for the first time in several quarters. Our earnings per share of $1.24 were excellent operationally despite a higher-than-expected tax rate. Our 17.9% operating income margin was our highest reported margin since the third quarter of 2008. Our strong operational performance allowed us to increase our full year EPS expectation to $4.30 to $4.45 from our prior outlook of $4.15 to $4.40.
Our second quarter 2010 sales rose by 1% compared to our second quarter 2009. Our large commercial airplane original equipment market channel decreased by 1%, which was simply a result of the timing of deliveries to Boeing and Airbus.
Our regional, business and general aviation original equipment sales decreased about 10% compared to the second quarter of '09. However, sales in this market channel were up 5% sequentially and are up over 15% from their bottom in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Sales in our commercial aftermarket channel decreased 3% in the second quarter 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009. Three of our eight commercial businesses reported higher aftermarket sales in the second quarter 2010 compared to the same period a year ago. Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were 3% higher in the second quarter 2010 than in the first quarter 2010.
We continue to see positive aftermarket trends, which I'll discuss more about in a few minutes.
In our defense and space, sales exhibited good overall growth in the second quarter of 2010, increasing by 11% compared to the second quarter of 2009. Our acquisition of Atlantic Inertial Systems, AIS, contributed 9% of this growth.
Organic sales growth of about 2% was driven primarily by our strong sales in our Landing Gear, Sensors and Integrated Systems, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Engine Controls and Power Systems businesses.
In the second quarter 2010, we achieved segment operating income margins of 17.9% compared to 16% in the second quarter 2009 and 15.3% in the first quarter of this year. The improvement was due to strong operational performance, relentless pursuit of continuous improvement and favorable revisions and estimates for certain long-term contracts.
Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures for the second quarter 2010 was very strong at $193 million, which is approximately 121% of second quarter net income.
For our full year 2010 outlook, sales are unchanged at approximately $7.1 billion. Our current outlook represents growth of about 6% compared to 2009.
The outlook for 2010 net income per diluted share has been increased to $4.30 to $4.45 compared to our prior outlook of $4.15 to $4.40, driven primarily by better operating margin performance.
We now expect large commercial airplane original equipment sales to increase about 3%. The slight reduction compared to our prior outlook simply represents minor scheduling adjustments by Boeing and Airbus. We now expect regional, business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales to decrease by 8% to 10%, which is an improvement compared to our prior outlook. We believe that sales in this market channel bottomed in late 2009, and we should see year-over-year growth beginning next quarter. 
We have slightly lowered our expectations for the large commercial, regional, business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales growth. We now expect this channel to grow in the low-single-digit range compared to our prior outlook of 4% to 7%. We continue to expect sequentially higher aftermarket sales each quarter as we progress through the year. 
We should start to see higher year-over-year sales beginning in the third quarter. We believe sales for this market channel bottomed in the fourth quarter 2009, and we are currently more than 10% above those levels.
Finally, our outlook for defense and space sales growth has risen. We now expect sales growth in excess of 15% including sales generated by the AIS acquisition that closed in December of last year. Organic growth in this market channel is expected to be greater than 5%.
Our 2010 outlook for earnings per diluted share includes a full year effective tax rate of about 31% for 2010, unchanged from our prior outlook. Our tax rate outlook continues to include a full year benefit of approximately 1.5% or $0.10 per diluted share related to an assumed extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit retroactive to the beginning of the year.
For 2010, we continue to expect net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures to exceed 85% of net income. We now expect capital expenditures for 2010 to be approximately $250 million and expect worldwide pension contributions to be approximately $150 million pre-tax.
Now I'll focus on current activity and trends in our primary market channels. The large commercial OE production outlook continues to look very strong for the next several years. The order flow at the Farnborough Airshow was excellent. The production rate increases announced by Boeing and Airbus over the last several months will have no significant impact in our 2010 sales, but these rates, along with increasing 787 deliveries, should provide for strong growth in this market channel for several years.
For the commercial aftermarket, some of the macro indicators are showing improvement. Passenger airline and freight trends continue to improve. Airline load factors remain at high levels, especially in the U.S., and RPM data continues to show positive trends.
Load factors are at all-time highs for some U.S. airlines. Freight traffic continues to grow faster than passenger traffic. Although freight capacity growth is still lagging traffic growth, we believe freight traffic trends are a good leading indicator of future economic trends. While these trends don't affect current period aftermarket sales, they bode well for the future.
Even though capacity growth is lagging significantly behind passenger growth this cycle, if the airlines can keep growing RPMs and profits, they will eventually add additional capacity. Such capacity increases can come in the form of new airplanes, increased utilization of existing airplanes or returning airplanes from storage. All three actions like these on the part of airlines result in increased aftermarket sales for companies like Goodrich.
Over the past two years, the active fleet of large commercial aircraft has grown about 6%. As the fleet continues to grow in age and airline maintenance practices return to more normal levels, we should see a very good and sustainable aftermarket sales growth rates driven by both catch-up demand and normal aging.
Within our businesses, we continue to see some positive trends indicating that recovery in the aftermarket is underway and is sustainable. Our Wheels and Break business experienced year-over-year sales growth for the second quarter in a row. It's a very good sign as we believe this business is one of the leading indicators of overall activity growth in the commercial aftermarket channel.
In our Aerostructures business, major sales are filling in very nicely, and we remain confident they will meet our full year expectations. Even though Aerostructures’ MRO sales have been weaker than expected so far this year, we have seen our MRO booking backlog increase during the last two months.
Our Landing Gear business is seeing significant quote activity, mostly for sales that will occur in 2011 due to long lead times for these parts. In our Interiors business, the book-to-bill ratio is now solidly over 1.0.
Overall, most of our businesses are seeing favorable quote trends and improving backlogs. We continue to see very strong demand for our defense and space products, including products supporting helicopters, ISR and wheels and brakes on fixed-wing aircraft worldwide.
Overall, our performance during the second quarter was excellent from an operational standpoint and in line with our expectations at the market-channel level. We've been able to grow our already strong margins despite slightly lower aftermarket sales through a continued focus on cost control and operational excellence. Our longer-term prospects for sustainable growth are also bright, fueled by our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft currently in development.
Goodrich's financial position remains excellent with more than $850 million of cash on our balance sheet and a significant cash flow generation expectations for 2010. This allows us to continue to seek acquisition opportunities that would further enhance our growth rates and cash generation and drive shareholder value.
I'm looking forward to talking to all of you throughout 2010, and I'm confident that the commercial aerospace is on the upswing. I look forward to your questions."

I did make comments about -- I didn't think it was in the best interest of the supply chain to re-engine either on Boeing or Airbus single-aisle. And the reasoning behind that is that going to stretch our supply base even thinner. And I'm not talking about the Tier 1s like Goodrich. If one of them decides to re-engine or both, we can do it. We've got the resources to do it, and our customers at Airbus and Boeing know that. It's the smaller suppliers throughout the supply chain, those that supply us and other people like other companies like Goodrich, that I worry about getting stretched too thin. So it's more on a supply base comment. And I think if you listen to the Boeing CEO the other day, they have some concerns about the same thing in addition to productivity enhancements that can be had by a re-engining and what the timing of that could be. So as you look at the backlog on A320s and 737MGs, the backlog is huge. And so there is an ability to continue to produce those aircraft with a very good sales rate. So it just takes a supply base that's already producing for those increased rates that are being announced, and then have to come in and do an additional engine or engines for both aircraft. So it's more of a supply chain issue. And for Goodrich, if Airbus decides to do it, then we'll pursue it. If Boeing decides to do it, we'll pursue it. I mean, it's something that we're capable of doing and capable of doing profitably."

The underlying strength that drove those is pretty broad, and it relates to the same things we've talked about in prior quarters. We’ve got labor hour improvements, which is productivity and efficiency. We’ve got added units to the forecast. We’ve got some supply chain savings as our supply chain organization continues to renegotiate and negotiate new contracts with existing suppliers and with suppliers located in lower-cost areas of the world. We completed some contract negotiations with some customers that were also favorable in the quarter. And we continue as contracts terminate to get price increases as well, occasionally on those contracts as well. So there's a good mix of drivers that in general are sustainable, and they’ve driven favorable adjustments in the past. And with a rising volume environment as the OEs continue to increase production, that bodes well toward favorable adjustments in the future. I don't see them coming at the same rate that we got them in the second quarter. That's not a sustainable level. So if you take that out and move it to a more sustainable level, we're still producing operating income margins in the 16%-type range in the quarter. And that's kind of our expectation for the full year 2010. We got excellent growth in margins in the Electronic Systems business for reasons other than, obviously, the contract adjustments, and those are sustainable going forward -- again, not at the same level that they posted in the second quarter, but it's real good progress on the margin line this year.

On sustainability, Rob, if you think about when this financial recession first hit at the end of '08, September of '08, and people were taking out costs, we took out a lot of indirect cost as well as direct. And there was a combination of supply chain savings, continuous improvement in our operations and in our offices. And certainly, we pared down some of the indirect like travel and so on. Well, if you look at the 17.9% right now in the year-to-date margins, our travel this year is up between 8% and 9%. So we're coming back on that. We knew some of that would come back. Our professional services and fees are up a little bit. Our R&D spend is up. That's all hitting P&L. But we're benefiting from securing some long-term agreements with our suppliers at reasonable prices, and we're seeing the benefit of some of the restructuring we've initiated last year. And we're achieving sustained savings from continuous improvement activity by lowering the core cost of quality, scrap, rework and more efficient production flow in our factories. So there's a lot of sustainability to the continuous improvement. And that's why what Scott was saying about we can maintain a pretty good margin going forward. One small example in a plant, and I won't tell you which one at this point in time. But they have about over a 10% return on sales operating margin in the product lines in there, and we think we can take that up another eight to 10 percentage points in the next 12 months through continuous improvement by getting one-piece flow into plant and so on. So we've really made a concerted effort, and the same thing is true on the cash flow side. Every one of our businesses now has a macro plan implemented through continuous improvement to increase that cash flow. So these are things that are not going to stop."

So we don't expect 787 volume to be helpful from a margin standpoint or an EPS standpoint near term. On the military side, some of the military growth that we're going to see moving into 2011 is related to government-contract work, which also comes in at slightly lower margins than our average. So the real trick to moving margins north is, like Marshall said, sustaining the cost-reduction initiative, productivity initiatives that we have. And then, there's a question on exactly where the aftermarket growth rate will be for 2011. We're very bullish that it will be higher than this year. But just how high is going to determine kind of where we set the margin target for 2011, and it's just a little bit too early to do that."

So it's not where we want to get, but I think it will, and you see the worldwide ASKs and the RPMs. The trends are favorable, particularly when you get continent to continent. We've seen large double-digit increases in the international travel. So I think one of the things that's happening with 737MGs and A320s is that they are delivering quite a few new aircraft, obviously, into the worldwide fleet. And so you're getting brand new aircraft that take a while before you get the aftermarket. Now Wheels and Brakes turns around pretty quickly, but it's still going to be probably a year before you start seeing too much MRO on the Wheel and Brake side of it. So even though the fleet’s up 6%, it’s up with new airplanes. And they haven't started bringing old airplanes back yet, really.

They're getting more revenue per seat mile that they fly. Those are positive trends, but they haven't transitioned that into more rapid capacity growth. And unless capacity is growing faster than the delivery rates of new airplanes, you're going to see suppressed levels of utilization on the older aircraft, which are the ones that drive near-term aftermarket sales. So what we're seeing in May, June, ASM rates year-over-year are up more like 6%. And that's the level at which I think you start to see increased utilization. You start to see aircraft being pulled out of storage and go back into service. But we haven't seen much of that yet. It's the early stages of that, and that's what will drive faster aftermarket.

I assume you've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings release and the related presentation. There's a lot of information in both of those documents that I think you'll find helpful about Goodrich. Today I'll spend just a few m",1480,"Thanks, Paul. I assume you've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings release and the related presentation. There's a lot of information in both of those documents that I think you'll find helpful about Goodrich. 
Today I'll spend just a few minutes on the second quarter results and our outlook for 2010. Then I'll focus on trends and indicators of what we are currently seeing in our markets and what we think these trends mean to Goodrich.
Overall, our second quarter earnings continued to show the sustainability of our cost-containment efforts, and our sales showed year-over-year growth for the first time in several quarters. Our earnings per share of $1.24 were excellent operationally despite a higher-than-expected tax rate. Our 17.9% operating income margin was our highest reported margin since the third quarter of 2008. Our strong operational performance allowed us to increase our full year EPS expectation to $4.30 to $4.45 from our prior outlook of $4.15 to $4.40.
Our second quarter 2010 sales rose by 1% compared to our second quarter 2009. Our large commercial airplane original equipment market channel decreased by 1%, which was simply a result of the timing of deliveries to Boeing and Airbus.
Our regional, business and general aviation original equipment sales decreased about 10% compared to the second quarter of '09. However, sales in this market channel were up 5% sequentially and are up over 15% from their bottom in the fourth quarter of 2009.
Sales in our commercial aftermarket channel decreased 3% in the second quarter 2010 compared to the second quarter of 2009. Three of our eight commercial businesses reported higher aftermarket sales in the second quarter 2010 compared to the same period a year ago. Sequentially, commercial aftermarket sales were 3% higher in the second quarter 2010 than in the first quarter 2010.
We continue to see positive aftermarket trends, which I'll discuss more about in a few minutes.
In our defense and space, sales exhibited good overall growth in the second quarter of 2010, increasing by 11% compared to the second quarter of 2009. Our acquisition of Atlantic Inertial Systems, AIS, contributed 9% of this growth.
Organic sales growth of about 2% was driven primarily by our strong sales in our Landing Gear, Sensors and Integrated Systems, Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Engine Controls and Power Systems businesses.
In the second quarter 2010, we achieved segment operating income margins of 17.9% compared to 16% in the second quarter 2009 and 15.3% in the first quarter of this year. The improvement was due to strong operational performance, relentless pursuit of continuous improvement and favorable revisions and estimates for certain long-term contracts.
Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures for the second quarter 2010 was very strong at $193 million, which is approximately 121% of second quarter net income.
For our full year 2010 outlook, sales are unchanged at approximately $7.1 billion. Our current outlook represents growth of about 6% compared to 2009.
The outlook for 2010 net income per diluted share has been increased to $4.30 to $4.45 compared to our prior outlook of $4.15 to $4.40, driven primarily by better operating margin performance.
We now expect large commercial airplane original equipment sales to increase about 3%. The slight reduction compared to our prior outlook simply represents minor scheduling adjustments by Boeing and Airbus. We now expect regional, business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales to decrease by 8% to 10%, which is an improvement compared to our prior outlook. We believe that sales in this market channel bottomed in late 2009, and we should see year-over-year growth beginning next quarter. 
We have slightly lowered our expectations for the large commercial, regional, business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales growth. We now expect this channel to grow in the low-single-digit range compared to our prior outlook of 4% to 7%. We continue to expect sequentially higher aftermarket sales each quarter as we progress through the year. 
We should start to see higher year-over-year sales beginning in the third quarter. We believe sales for this market channel bottomed in the fourth quarter 2009, and we are currently more than 10% above those levels.
Finally, our outlook for defense and space sales growth has risen. We now expect sales growth in excess of 15% including sales generated by the AIS acquisition that closed in December of last year. Organic growth in this market channel is expected to be greater than 5%.
Our 2010 outlook for earnings per diluted share includes a full year effective tax rate of about 31% for 2010, unchanged from our prior outlook. Our tax rate outlook continues to include a full year benefit of approximately 1.5% or $0.10 per diluted share related to an assumed extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit retroactive to the beginning of the year.
For 2010, we continue to expect net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures to exceed 85% of net income. We now expect capital expenditures for 2010 to be approximately $250 million and expect worldwide pension contributions to be approximately $150 million pre-tax.
Now I'll focus on current activity and trends in our primary market channels. The large commercial OE production outlook continues to look very strong for the next several years. The order flow at the Farnborough Airshow was excellent. The production rate increases announced by Boeing and Airbus over the last several months will have no significant impact in our 2010 sales, but these rates, along with increasing 787 deliveries, should provide for strong growth in this market channel for several years.
For the commercial aftermarket, some of the macro indicators are showing improvement. Passenger airline and freight trends continue to improve. Airline load factors remain at high levels, especially in the U.S., and RPM data continues to show positive trends.
Load factors are at all-time highs for some U.S. airlines. Freight traffic continues to grow faster than passenger traffic. Although freight capacity growth is still lagging traffic growth, we believe freight traffic trends are a good leading indicator of future economic trends. While these trends don't affect current period aftermarket sales, they bode well for the future.
Even though capacity growth is lagging significantly behind passenger growth this cycle, if the airlines can keep growing RPMs and profits, they will eventually add additional capacity. Such capacity increases can come in the form of new airplanes, increased utilization of existing airplanes or returning airplanes from storage. All three actions like these on the part of airlines result in increased aftermarket sales for companies like Goodrich.
Over the past two years, the active fleet of large commercial aircraft has grown about 6%. As the fleet continues to grow in age and airline maintenance practices return to more normal levels, we should see a very good and sustainable aftermarket sales growth rates driven by both catch-up demand and normal aging.
Within our businesses, we continue to see some positive trends indicating that recovery in the aftermarket is underway and is sustainable. Our Wheels and Break business experienced year-over-year sales growth for the second quarter in a row. It's a very good sign as we believe this business is one of the leading indicators of overall activity growth in the commercial aftermarket channel.
In our Aerostructures business, major sales are filling in very nicely, and we remain confident they will meet our full year expectations. Even though Aerostructures’ MRO sales have been weaker than expected so far this year, we have seen our MRO booking backlog increase during the last two months.
Our Landing Gear business is seeing significant quote activity, mostly for sales that will occur in 2011 due to long lead times for these parts. In our Interiors business, the book-to-bill ratio is now solidly over 1.0.
Overall, most of our businesses are seeing favorable quote trends and improving backlogs. We continue to see very strong demand for our defense and space products, including products supporting helicopters, ISR and wheels and brakes on fixed-wing aircraft worldwide.
Overall, our performance during the second quarter was excellent from an operational standpoint and in line with our expectations at the market-channel level. We've been able to grow our already strong margins despite slightly lower aftermarket sales through a continued focus on cost control and operational excellence. Our longer-term prospects for sustainable growth are also bright, fueled by our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft currently in development.
Goodrich's financial position remains excellent with more than $850 million of cash on our balance sheet and a significant cash flow generation expectations for 2010. This allows us to continue to seek acquisition opportunities that would further enhance our growth rates and cash generation and drive shareholder value.
I'm looking forward to talking to all of you throughout 2010, and I'm confident that the commercial aerospace is on the upswing. I look forward to your questions."

I did make comments about -- I didn't think it was in the best interest of the supply chain to re-engine either on Boeing or Airbus single-aisle. And the reasoning behind that is that going to stretch our supply base even thinner. And I'm not talking about the Tier 1s like Goodrich. If one of them decides to re-engine or both, we can do it. We've got the resources to do it, and our customers at Airbus and Boeing know that. It's the smaller suppliers throughout the supply chain, those that supply us and other people like other companies like Goodrich, that I worry about getting stretched too thin. So it's more on a supply base comment. And I think if you listen to the Boeing CEO the other day, they have some concerns about the same thing in addition to productivity enhancements that can be had by a re-engining and what the timing of that could be. So as you look at the backlog on A320s and 737MGs, the backlog is huge. And so there is an ability to continue to produce those aircraft with a very good sales rate. So it just takes a supply base that's already producing for those increased rates that are being announced, and then have to come in and do an additional engine or engines for both aircraft. So it's more of a supply chain issue. And for Goodrich, if Airbus decides to do it, then we'll pursue it. If Boeing decides to do it, we'll pursue it. I mean, it's something that we're capable of doing and capable of doing profitably."

The underlying strength that drove those is pretty broad, and it relates to the same things we've talked about in prior quarters. We’ve got labor hour improvements, which is productivity and efficiency. We’ve got added units to the forecast. We’ve got some supply chain savings as our supply chain organization continues to renegotiate and negotiate new contracts with existing suppliers and with suppliers located in lower-cost areas of the world. We completed some contract negotiations with some customers that were also favorable in the quarter. And we continue as contracts terminate to get price increases as well, occasionally on those contracts as well. So there's a good mix of drivers that in general are sustainable, and they’ve driven favorable adjustments in the past. And with a rising volume environment as the OEs continue to increase production, that bodes well toward favorable adjustments in the future. I don't see them coming at the same rate that we got them in the second quarter. That's not a sustainable level. So if you take that out and move it to a more sustainable level, we're still producing operating income margins in the 16%-type range in the quarter. And that's kind of our expectation for the full year 2010. We got excellent growth in margins in the Electronic Systems business for reasons other than, obviously, the contract adjustments, and those are sustainable going forward -- again, not at the same level that they posted in the second quarter, but it's real good progress on the margin line this year.

On sustainability, Rob, if you think about when this financial recession first hit at the end of '08, September of '08, and people were taking out costs, we took out a lot of indirect cost as well as direct. And there was a combination of supply chain savings, continuous improvement in our operations and in our offices. And certainly, we pared down some of the indirect like travel and so on. Well, if you look at the 17.9% right now in the year-to-date margins, our travel this year is up between 8% and 9%. So we're coming back on that. We knew some of that would come back. Our professional services and fees are up a little bit. Our R&D spend is up. That's all hitting P&L. But we're benefiting from securing some long-term agreements with our suppliers at reasonable prices, and we're seeing the benefit of some of the restructuring we've initiated last year. And we're achieving sustained savings from continuous improvement activity by lowering the core cost of quality, scrap, rework and more efficient production flow in our factories. So there's a lot of sustainability to the continuous improvement. And that's why what Scott was saying about we can maintain a pretty good margin going forward. One small example in a plant, and I won't tell you which one at this point in time. But they have about over a 10% return on sales operating margin in the product lines in there, and we think we can take that up another eight to 10 percentage points in the next 12 months through continuous improvement by getting one-piece flow into plant and so on. So we've really made a concerted effort, and the same thing is true on the cash flow side. Every one of our businesses now has a macro plan implemented through continuous improvement to increase that cash flow. So these are things that are not going to stop."

So the incremental margins are favorable in most of the businesses, but when you think about OE coming from 787, that's an area that's not going to be incremental margin for the company in the early stages of production for that aircraft. And it's going to be years, like it has been in the past when we've introduced a new aircraft, to get to a maturity level where we are producing solid margins on those programs. So we don't expect 787 volume to be helpful from a margin standpoint or an EPS standpoint near term. On the military side, some of the military growth that we're going to see moving into 2011 is related to government-contract work, which also comes in at slightly lower margins than our average. So the real trick to moving margins north is, like Marshall said, sustaining the cost-reduction initiative, productivity initiatives that we have. And then, there's a question on exactly where the aftermarket growth rate will be for 2011. We're very bullish that it will be higher than this year. But just how high is going to determine kind of where we set the margin target for 2011, and it's just a little bit too early to do that."

We've seen large double-digit increases in the international travel. So I think one of the things that's happening with 737MGs and A320s is that they are delivering quite a few new aircraft, obviously, into the worldwide fleet. And so you're getting brand new aircraft that take a while before you get the aftermarket. Now Wheels and Brakes turns around pretty quickly, but it's still going to be probably a year before you start seeing too much MRO on the Wheel and Brake side of it.

And unless capacity is growing faster than the delivery rates of new airplanes, you're going to see suppressed levels of utilization on the older aircraft, which are the ones that drive near-term aftermarket sales. So what we're seeing in May, June, ASM rates year-over-year are up more like 6%. And that's the level at which I think you start to see increased utilization. You start to see aircraft being pulled out of storage and go back into service. But we haven't seen much of that yet. It's the early stages of that, and that's what will drive faster aftermarket.

We continued our strong performance during the third quarter. Our sales growth of 6% was accompanied by net income growth of 10%. All of our major market channels, including the commercial aftermarket reported year-over-year sales growth. 
Our large commercial airplane original equipment market channel grew by 2%, and that growth was relatively evenly split between Boeing and Airbus. 
Our regional business and general aviation original equipment sales increased by about 21%, including sales associated with the recent acquisition of DeCrane's Cabin Management assets. Organic growth in this market channel was about 15%.
Commercial aftermarket sales were 3% higher than the third quarter last year and 2% higher than in the second quarter of 2010. Six of our eight commercial businesses reported higher aftermarket sales in the third quarter of 2010, compared to the year-ago period.
Our defense and space sales continued to exhibit growth in the third quarter of 2010, increasing by 12% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Our acquisition of Atlantic Inertial Systems contributed 8% of this growth. Organic sales growth of about 4% was driven primarily by strong sales in our Wheels and Brakes, Aerostructures and Sensors and Integrated Systems businesses.
In the third quarter of 2010, we achieved segment operating income margins of 17.3% compared to 15.8% in the third quarter of 2009. The improvement was due to strong operational performance, relentless pursuit of continuous improvement and favorable revisions and estimates for certain long-term contracts. 
Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2010 was very strong at $204 million, which is approximately 128% of third quarter net income.
Since last July, we've taken several additional steps to increase shareholder value. Among them, in October, our Board of Directors approved a 7% increase in our company's quarterly dividend to $0.29 per share from the previous level of $0.27 per share on its common stock. This was our fourth consecutive annual increase in our dividend.
In September, we completed the acquisition of the Cabin Management assets of DeCrane Holdings Co. The purchase price was approximately $280 million. We expect this acquisition to be neutral to earnings in 2010 and to be accretive beginning in the first quarter 2011. And in September, we issued $600 million of 10-year debt at 3.6% interest. We used the proceeds to complete the redemption of $257 million of debt due in 2012, which carried a 7.6% interest rate, and we are accelerating $300 million of pension contributions into the fourth quarter of 2010.
For our full year 2010 outlook, we have adjusted our sales outlook to approximately $7 billion, which represents growth of about 5% compared to 2009. The outlook for 2010 net income per diluted share has been adjusted to $4.30 to $4.35, compared to the prior outlook of $4.30 to $4.45. Current outlook includes debt redemption costs of approximately $0.18 per diluted share, which were not included in the prior outlook and will be recognized in the fourth quarter 2010. Excluding these costs, the current outlook would have increased above the prior outlook by $0.10 to $0.20 per diluted share, driven primarily by better operating margin performance.
We now expect large commercial airplane original equipment sales to increase by about 4%, which includes the impact of all of the recently announced production rate changes and incorporates the new delivery schedules for the Boeing 787 and 747-8. We now expect regional business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales to grow by about 4%, including sales associated with the DeCrane acquisition. Excluding sales from the DeCrane acquisition, sales in this market channel would be expected to decrease by about 6% to 7%, a slight improvement over our prior outlook.
We have slightly lowered our total 2010 expectations for large commercial, regional business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales growth. We now expect sales in this market channel to be approximately the same as they were in 2009, compared to our prior outlook of low single-digit growth. We continue to expect year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter 2010 to exceed 10%. We believe sales for this market channel bottomed in the fourth quarter of 2009, and we are currently operating at more than 14% above those levels.
Our outlook for defense and space sales growth is largely unchanged at about 15%, including sales generated by the AIS acquisition that closed in December of last year. Organic growth in this market channel is expected to be about 5%.
Our 2010 outlook for earnings per diluted share includes a full year effective tax rate of about 30% for 2010, a slight improvement compared to our prior outlook of 31%. Our tax rate no longer includes a full year benefit of approximately 1.5% or $0.10 per diluted share related to an assumed extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit retroactive to the beginning of 2010. Our effective tax rate outlook does now include a tax benefit of approximately $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to a settlement last week with the California Franchise Tax Board concerning issues related to Goodrich and Rohr for all tax years through 2001.
For 2010, we now expect net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures to be approximately 50% of net income, including an expected incremental $300 million pension contribution in the fourth quarter. Excluding this incremental contribution, net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures would have increased to approximately 100% of net income, a significant improvement compared to our prior outlook of greater than 85% conversion. We now expect capital expenditures for 2010 to be approximately $225 million to $250 million and expect worldwide pension contributions to be approximately $450 million, pretax.
Now I'll turn to 2011. We're excited about the prospects for 2011. A large airframe manufacturers have announced production rate increases on single-isle aircraft and new programs like Boeing 787 will begin deliveries soon. We expect the commercial aftermarket to grow in 2011 as airlines and package carriers add capacity and increase utilization rates on their existing fleet. In addition, our defense and space sales should experience solid growth as demand for electro-optical reconnaissance sensors, helicopter products, inertial sensors and aftermarket parts and services for fighter and transport aircraft continue to increase. Overall, we are expecting sales growth of about 10% to 11%, including good growth in every market channel and earnings growth of between 15% to 20%.
We expect sales in 2011 to be approximately $7.7  billion to $7.8 billion, driven by growth in every market channel. Large commercial airplane original equipment sales are expected to increase by about 15% to 20% assuming all announced production rate increases are implemented and assuming Boeing 787 deliveries begin in the first quarter of 2011 and 747-8 deliveries to begin in midyear 2011.
Regional business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales are expected to grow by about 35% to 40%, including sales associated with the DeCrane acquisition. Excluding the incremental 2011 sales from DeCrane acquisition, we would expect sales growth of about 4%. 
Large commercial, regional business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales are expected to increase by about 5% to 7%. Our outlook assumes worldwide available seat miles, ASMs, increase by 4% to 6% compared to 2010, which is roughly consistent with the latest IATA forecast. And defense and space sales are expected to increase by about 5% to 6%, organically.
Based on these sales increases, benefits from our continuous improvement in productivity initiatives and lower pension expense, we expect 2011 net income per diluted share to be in the range of $5 to $5.20, an increase of 15% to 20% compared to expectations for 2010 net income per diluted share. Our 2011 outlook includes operating margins of 16%, reflecting very rapid growth in the lower margin commercial original equipment and cost plus military contracts, offset by growth in the aftermarket and the benefit of continuous improvement and lean initiatives on costs.
Lower worldwide pretax pension expense of approximately $30 million or $0.15 per diluted share. Our estimate for 2011 pension expense assumes a 2010 actual return on U.S. plan assets of 9% and a 2011 U.S. discount rate of 5%, both of which reflect conditions as of September 30, 2010. The lower 2011 pension expense is the result of actuarial changes and the benefit of the $300 million incremental contribution I mentioned earlier, which we expect to make during the fourth quarter of 2010. Because almost all of the plan participants are now inactive, the company is changing its amortization period for gains and losses on the U.S. salary pension plan to the estimated remaining life of plan participants rather than the estimated the remaining service period of active plan participants. This change will have the added benefit of lowering pension expense sensitivity to changes in discount rates and the rate-of-return on plan assets in future years. The company also expects to reduce its expected long-term rate-of-return assumptions as of January 1, 2011. I remind you that our pension expense for 2011 will be finalized based on actual asset values and discount rates on December 31, 2010.
We are expecting a 2011 full year effective tax rate of approximately 30%, consistent with the expected tax rate for 2010. The 2011 effective tax rate does include a full year 2011 benefit of approximately 1.5% or $0.10 per diluted share related to an assumed extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit, which has not yet occurred.
We expect net cash provided from operating activities, minus capital expenditures, to exceed 85% of net income for 2011. Our outlook includes expected capital expenditures of $300 million to $350 million and a pretax worldwide pension plan contributions of $50 million to $100 million.
Overall, our performance during the third quarter was excellent from an operational standpoint. We've been able to improve our already strong margins despite slow aftermarket sales growth through a continued focus on cost control and operational excellence. We continue to expect long-term sustainable growth in sales and earnings fueled by our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft, currently in development, and steadily increasing commercial aftermarket sales.
Our financial position remains excellent with more than $1.3 billion of cash on our balance sheet as of September 30 and significant cash flow expectations for 2011. We've used about $300 million of cash to redeem the debt due 2011, and we'll use another $300 million in the fourth quarter to fund our pension plan. At year-end 2010, we expect to have about $800 million of cash on hand with no significant debt maturities until 2016. This will allow us the flexibility to continue to seek acquisition opportunities that further enhance our sales and earnings growth, contribute to cash generation and drive shareholder value.
I'm looking forward to talking to all of you throughout the rest of this year and through 2011, and I'm confident that the commercial aerospace is back on a solid growth track.
Let's open up the call for questions."

So we're looking at $75 million to $100 million net build in non-product inventory, which is both capitalized R&D and excess over average for 2010. So a use of cash, full year, in the $75 million to $100 million range. And then when we look at 2011, that will go back to more normal levels of $200 million to $250 million of growth in the area.

We still continue to benefit from rising production rates, rising aftermarket, which helps us spread our overall rates, continue to drive cost reductions with our supply chain as well. And then as we add units to certain contracts, that's also a benefit. And those will continue into 2011. Some of the unusual things we got in 2010 that don't repeat are the significant changes in volumes on some of the -- in production aircraft that were announced in 2010, those drive immediate changes to some of those contracts, which we got the benefit of in 2010.

The other is we did some accelerated contributions to the plan. Between those two, we did about $100 million reduction and then we're offsetting a bit of that by becoming a little more conservative in our long-term rate of return assumptions, mortality tables, et cetera. Then again, that will reduce the volatility of those sensitivities going forward. So as discount rates change, return assumptions are either above or below what our expectation is, we'll see less volatility in expense going forward. So those are the major movers."

That's going to cost us maybe 3/10 of a point.

You've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings release and the related presentation. There's a lot of information in both of these documents that you'll find helpful as you think about Goodrich.
Today, I'll spend a few minutes on our third quarter results and our outlook for 2010, then I'll turn to our outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers. We continued our strong performance during the third quarter, our sales growth of 6% was accompanied by net income growth of 10%. All of our major market channels, including the commercial after market reported year-over-year sales growth.
Our large commercial airplane original equipment market channel group grew by 2% and that growth was relatively evenly split between Boeing and Airbus. Our regional business in general aviation original equipment sales increased by about 21%, including sales associated with the recent acquisition of DeCrane's Cabin Management assets. Organic growth in this market channel was about 15%.
Commercial aftermarket sales were 3% higher than the third quarter last year and 2% higher than in the second quarter of 2010. Six of our eight commercial businesses reported higher aftermarket sales in the third quarter 2010 compared to the year-ago period.
Our defense and space sales continued to exhibit good growth in the third quarter of 2010 increasing by 12% compared to the third quarter 2009. Our acquisition of Atlantic Inertial Systems contributed 8% of this growth. Organic sales growth of about 4% was driven primarily by strong sales in our wheels and brakes, aerostructures and sensors and integrated systems businesses.
In the third quarter of 2010, we achieved segment operating income margins of 17.3%, compared to 15.8% in the third quarter of 2009. The improvement was due to strong operational performance, relentless pursuit of continuous improvement and favorable revisions in estimates for certain long-term contracts.
Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures for the third quarter 2010 was very strong at $204 million, which is approximately 128% of third quarter net income. Since last July, we've taken several additional steps to increase shareholder value. Among them, in October, our Board of Directors approved a 7% increase in our company's quarterly dividend to $0.29 per share from the previous level of $0.27 per share on its common stock.
This is our fourth consecutive annual increase in our dividend. In September, we completed the acquisition of the Cabin Management Assets of DeCrane Holdings Company. The purchase price was approximately $280 million. We expect this acquisition to be neutral to earnings in 2010 and to be accretive beginning in the first quarter, 2011.
And in September, we issued $600 million of 10-year debt at 3.6% interest. We used the proceeds to complete the redemption of $257 million of debt due in 2012, which carried a 7.6% interest rate. And we are accelerating $300 million of pension contributions into the fourth quarter of 2010.
For our full year 2010 outlook, we have adjusted our sales outlook to approximately $7 billion which represents growth of about 5% compared to 2009. The outlook for 2010 net income per diluted share has been adjusted to $4.30 to $4.35 compared to the prior outlook of $4.30 to $4.45. Current outlook includes debt redemption costs of approximately $0.18 per diluted share which were not included in the prior outlook and will be recognized in the fourth quarter, 2010.
Excluding these costs, the current outlook would have increased, above the prior outlook by $0.10 to $0.20 per diluted share driven primarily by better operating margin performance. We now expect large commercial airplane original equipment sales to increase by about 4%, which includes the impact of all of the recently announced production rate changes and incorporates that new delivery schedules for the Boeing 787 and 747-8.
We now expect regional business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales to grow by about 4%, including sales associated with DeCrane acquisition. Excluding sales from the DeCrane acquisition, sales in this market channel would be expected to decrease by about 6% to 7%, a slight improvement over our prior outlook.
We have slightly lowered our 2010 expectations for large commercial regional business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales growth. We now expect sales in this market channel to be approximately the same as they were in 2009, compared to our prior outlook of low single-digit growth.
We continue to expect year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter 2010 to exceed 10%. We believe sales for this market channel bottomed in the fourth quarter of 2009 and we are currently operating at more than 14% above those levels.
Our outlook for defense and space sales growth is largely unchanged at about 15% including sales generated by the AIS acquisition that closed in December of last year. Organic growth in this market channel is expected to be about 5%.
Our 2010 outlook for earnings per diluted share includes a full year effective tax rate of about 30% for 2010, a slight improvement compared to our prior outlook of 31%. Our tax rate, no longer includes a full year benefit of approximately 1.5% or $0.10 per diluted share related to an assumed extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit retroactive to the beginning of 2010.
Our effective tax rate outlook does now include a tax benefit of approximately $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, related to a settlement last week with the California franchise tax board concerning issues related to Goodrich and (inaudible) for all tax years through 2001.
For 2010, we now expect net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures to be approximately 50% of net income, including an expected incremental $300 million pension contribution in the fourth quarter. Excluding this incremental contribution, net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures would have increased to approximately 100% of net income, a significant improvement compared to our prior outlook of greater than 85% conversion.
We now expect capital expenditures for 2010 to be approximately $225 million to $250 million and expect worldwide pension contributions to be approximately $450 million pretax.
Now, I'll turn to 2011. We're excited about the prospects for 2011. A large air freight manufacturers have announced production rate increased on single aisle aircraft and new programs like Boeing 787 will begin delivery soon. We expect the commercial aftermarket to grow in 2011 as airlines and package carriers add capacity and increase utilization rates on their existing fleet.
In addition, our defense and space sales should experience solid growth as demand for electro-optical reconnaissance sensors, helicopter products, inertial sensors and aftermarket parts and services for fighter and transport aircraft continue to increase. Overall, we are expecting sales growth of about 10% to 11% including good growth in every market channel and earnings growth of between 15% to 20%.
We expect sales in 2011 to be approximately $7.7 to $7.8 billion driven by growth in every market channel. Large commercial airplane original equipment sales are expected to increase by about 15% to 20%, assuming all announced production rate increases are implemented and assuming Boeing 787 deliveries begin in the first quarter of 2011 and 747-8 deliveries begin in mid-year 2011.
Regional business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales are expected to grow by about 35% to 40%, including sales associated with the DeCrane acquisition. Excluding the incremental 2011 sales from the DeCrane acquisition, we would expect sales growth of about 4%.
Large commercial regional business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales are expected to increase by about 5% to 7%. Our outlook assumes worldwide available seat miles, ASMs, increased by about 4% to 6% compared to 2010, which is roughly consistent with the latest IATA forecast. And defense and space sales are expected to increase by about 5% to 6% organically.
Based on these sales increased, benefits from our continuous improvement and productivity initiatives and lower pension expense, we expect 2011 net income per diluted share to be in the range of $5 to $5.20, an increase of 15% to 20% compared to expectations for 2010 net income per diluted share.
Our 2011 outlook includes operating margins of 16%, reflecting very rapid growth in the lower margin commercial original equipment and cost plus military contracts, offset by growth in the aftermarket and the benefit of continuous improvement and lean initiatives on costs.
Lower worldwide pretax pension expense of approximately $30 million or $0.15 per diluted share, our estimate for 2011 pension expense assumes a 2010 actual return on U.S. plan assets of 9% and a 2011 U.S. discount rate of approximately 5%, both of which reflect conditions as of September 30th 2010. The lower 2011 pension expense is a result of actuarial changes in the benefit of the $300 million incremental contribution, I mentioned earlier, which we expect to make during the fourth quarter of 2010. Because almost all of the planned participants are now inactive, the company is changing its amortization period for gains and losses on the U.S. salaried pension plan to the estimated remaining life of planned participants rather than the estimated remaining service period of active plan participants.
This change will have the added benefit of lowering pension expense sensitivity to changes in discount rates and the rate of return on plan assets and future years. The company also expects to reduce its expected long-term rate of return assumption as of January 1, 2011.
I'll remind you, that our pension expense for 2011 will be finalized based on actual asset values and discount rates on December 31, 2010. We’re expecting a 2011 full year effective tax rate of approximately 30% consistent with the expected tax rate for 2010. The 2011 effective tax rate does include a full year 2011 benefit of approximately 1.5% or $0.10 per diluted share, related to an assumed extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit which has not yet occurred.
We expect net cash provided from operating activities, minus capital expenditures to exceed 85% of net income for 2011. Our outlook includes expected capital expenditures of $300 million to $350 million and a pretax worldwide pension plan contribution of $50 million to $100 million.
Overall, our performance during the third quarter was excellent from an operational standpoint. We've been able to improve our already-strong margins, despite slow aftermarket sales growth through our continued focus on cost control and operational excellence.
We continue to expect long-term sustainable growth in sales and earnings, fueled by our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft currently in development and steadily increasing commercial aftermarket sales Our financial position remains excellent, with more than $1.3 billion of cash on our balance sheet as of September 30th and significant cash flow expectations for 2011.
We've used about $300 million of cash to - we've used about $300 million of cash to redeem the debt due in 2011 and we'll use another $300 million in the fourth quarter to fund our pension plan. At year end 2010, we expect to have about $800 million of cash on hand with no significant debt maturities until 2016. This will allow us the flexibility to continue to see acquisition opportunities that further enhance our sales and earnings growth, contribute to cash generation and drive shareholder value.
I’m looking forward to talking to all of you throughout the rest of this year and through 2011 and I'm confident that the commercial aerospace is back on a solid growth track. Let's open up the call for questions.

I was heartened by how the U.S. airlines did in the third quarter and the comments by Doug Parker of U.S. Airways, about how they've maintain a pretty good discipline and how Richard Anderson from Delta has said that the structure of the industry right now has certainly promoted a higher profitability.

Then, in addition to the - then we've done two things to reduce that. One is the actuarial change. The other is we did some accelerated contributions to the plan. Between those two, we get about $100 million reduction and then we're offsetting a bit of that by being, coming a little more conservative in our long-term rate of return assumptions, mortality tables, et cetera. I mean, again, that will reduce the volatility of those sensitivities going forward. So as discount rates change, return assumptions are either above or below what our expectation is. We'll see less volatility and expense going forward. So those are the major movers.

But remember because of purchase accounting, you have to write up the inventory to full fair value, so you get very little margin in the fourth quarter, so you get sales with no margin in that business until you flush the inventory. So that's, that's about another, almost a half a point to margin in the quarter. So that gets most of the Q3 to Q4 margin.

Today, I'll spend a few minutes on our third quarter results and our outlook for 2010, then I'll turn to our outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers.
We continued our strong performance during the third quarter. Our sales growth of 6% was accompanied by net income growth of 10%. All of our major market channels, including the commercial aftermarket reported year-over-year sales growth. 
Our large commercial airplane original equipment market channel grew by 2%, and that growth was relatively evenly split between Boeing and Airbus. 
Our regional business and general aviation original equipment sales increased by about 21%, including sales associated with the recent acquisition of DeCrane's Cabin Management assets. Organic growth in this market channel was about 15%.
Commercial aftermarket sales were 3% higher than the third quarter last year and 2% higher than in the second quarter of 2010. Six of our eight commercial businesses reported higher aftermarket sales in the third quarter of 2010, compared to the year-ago period.
Our defense and space sales continued to exhibit growth in the third quarter of 2010, increasing by 12% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Our acquisition of Atlantic Inertial Systems contributed 8% of this growth. Organic sales growth of about 4% was driven primarily by strong sales in our Wheels and Brakes, Aerostructures and Sensors and Integrated Systems businesses.
In the third quarter of 2010, we achieved segment operating income margins of 17.3% compared to 15.8% in the third quarter of 2009. The improvement was due to strong operational performance, relentless pursuit of continuous improvement and favorable revisions and estimates for certain long-term contracts. 
Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2010 was very strong at $204 million, which is approximately 128% of third quarter net income.
Since last July, we've taken several additional steps to increase shareholder value. Among them, in October, our Board of Directors approved a 7% increase in our company's quarterly dividend to $0.29 per share from the previous level of $0.27 per share on its common stock. This was our fourth consecutive annual increase in our dividend.
In September, we completed the acquisition of the Cabin Management assets of DeCrane Holdings Co. The purchase price was approximately $280 million. We expect this acquisition to be neutral to earnings in 2010 and to be accretive beginning in the first quarter 2011. And in September, we issued $600 million of 10-year debt at 3.6% interest. We used the proceeds to complete the redemption of $257 million of debt due in 2012, which carried a 7.6% interest rate, and we are accelerating $300 million of pension contributions into the fourth quarter of 2010.
For our full year 2010 outlook, we have adjusted our sales outlook to approximately $7 billion, which represents growth of about 5% compared to 2009. The outlook for 2010 net income per diluted share has been adjusted to $4.30 to $4.35, compared to the prior outlook of $4.30 to $4.45. Current outlook includes debt redemption costs of approximately $0.18 per diluted share, which were not included in the prior outlook and will be recognized in the fourth quarter 2010. Excluding these costs, the current outlook would have increased above the prior outlook by $0.10 to $0.20 per diluted share, driven primarily by better operating margin performance.
We now expect large commercial airplane original equipment sales to increase by about 4%, which includes the impact of all of the recently announced production rate changes and incorporates the new delivery schedules for the Boeing 787 and 747-8. We now expect regional business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales to grow by about 4%, including sales associated with the DeCrane acquisition. Excluding sales from the DeCrane acquisition, sales in this market channel would be expected to decrease by about 6% to 7%, a slight improvement over our prior outlook.
We have slightly lowered our total 2010 expectations for large commercial, regional business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales growth. We now expect sales in this market channel to be approximately the same as they were in 2009, compared to our prior outlook of low single-digit growth. We continue to expect year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter 2010 to exceed 10%. We believe sales for this market channel bottomed in the fourth quarter of 2009, and we are currently operating at more than 14% above those levels.
Our outlook for defense and space sales growth is largely unchanged at about 15%, including sales generated by the AIS acquisition that closed in December of last year. Organic growth in this market channel is expected to be about 5%.
Our 2010 outlook for earnings per diluted share includes a full year effective tax rate of about 30% for 2010, a slight improvement compared to our prior outlook of 31%. Our tax rate no longer includes a full year benefit of approximately 1.5% or $0.10 per diluted share related to an assumed extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit retroactive to the beginning of 2010. Our effective tax rate outlook does now include a tax benefit of approximately $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to a settlement last week with the California Franchise Tax Board concerning issues related to Goodrich and Rohr for all tax years through 2001.
For 2010, we now expect net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures to be approximately 50% of net income, including an expected incremental $300 million pension contribution in the fourth quarter. Excluding this incremental contribution, net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures would have increased to approximately 100% of net income, a significant improvement compared to our prior outlook of greater than 85% conversion. We now expect capital expenditures for 2010 to be approximately $225 million to $250 million and expect worldwide pension contributions to be approximately $450 million, pretax.
Now I'll turn to 2011. We're excited about the prospects for 2011. A large airframe manufacturers have announced production rate increases on single-aisle aircraft and new programs like Boeing 787 will begin deliveries soon. We expect the commercial aftermarket to grow in 2011 as airlines and package carriers add capacity and increase utilization rates on their existing fleet. In addition, our defense and space sales should experience solid growth as demand for electro-optical reconnaissance sensors, helicopter products, inertial sensors and aftermarket parts and services for fighter and transport aircraft continue to increase. Overall, we are expecting sales growth of about 10% to 11%, including good growth in every market channel and earnings growth of between 15% to 20%.
We expect sales in 2011 to be approximately $7.7 billion to $7.8 billion, driven by growth in every market channel. Large commercial airplane original equipment sales are expected to increase by about 15% to 20% assuming all announced production rate increases are implemented and assuming Boeing 787 deliveries begin in the first quarter of 2011 and 747-8 deliveries begin in midyear 2011.
Regional business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales are expected to grow by about 35% to 40%, including sales associated with the DeCrane acquisition. Excluding the incremental 2011 sales from DeCrane acquisition, we would expect sales growth of about 4%. 
Large commercial, regional business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales are expected to increase by about 5% to 7%. Our outlook assumes worldwide available seat miles, ASMs, increase by 4% to 6% compared to 2010, which is roughly consistent with the latest IATA forecast. And defense and space sales are expected to increase by about 5% to 6%, organically.
Based on these sales increases, benefits from our continuous improvement in productivity initiatives and lower pension expense, we expect 2011 net income per diluted share to be in the range of $5 to $5.20, an increase of 15% to 20% compared to expectations for 2010 net income per diluted share. Our 2011 outlook includes operating margins of 16%, reflecting very rapid growth in the lower margin commercial original equipment and cost plus military contracts, offset by growth in the aftermarket and the benefit of continuous improvement and lean initiatives on costs.
Lower worldwide pretax pension expense of approximately $30 million or $0.15 per diluted share. Our estimate for 2011 pension expense assumes a 2010 actual return on U.S. plan assets of 9% and a 2011 U.S. discount rate of 5%, both of which reflect conditions as of September 30, 2010. The lower 2011 pension expense is the result of actuarial changes and the benefit of the $300 million incremental contribution I mentioned earlier, which we expect to make during the fourth quarter of 2010. Because almost all of the plan participants are now inactive, the company is changing its amortization period for gains and losses on the U.S. salary pension plan to the estimated remaining life of plan participants rather than the estimated remaining service period of active plan participants. This change will have the added benefit of lowering pension expense sensitivity to changes in discount rates and the rate-of-return on plan assets in future years. The company also expects to reduce its expected long-term rate-of-return assumptions as of January 1, 2011. I remind you that our pension expense for 2011 will be finalized based on actual asset values and discount rates on December 31, 2010.
We are expecting a 2011 full year effective tax rate of approximately 30%, consistent with the expected tax rate for 2010. The 2011 effective tax rate does include a full year 2011 benefit of approximately 1.5% or $0.10 per diluted share related to an assumed extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit, which has not yet occurred.
We expect net cash provided from operating activities, minus capital expenditures, to exceed 85% of net income for 2011. Our outlook includes expected capital expenditures of $300 million to $350 million and a pretax worldwide pension plan contributions of $50 million to $100 million.
Overall, our performance during the third quarter was excellent from an operational standpoint. We've been able to improve our already strong margins despite slow aftermarket sales growth through a continued focus on cost control and operational excellence. We continue to expect long-term sustainable growth in sales and earnings fueled by our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft, currently in development, and steadily increasing commercial aftermarket sales.
Our financial position remains excellent with more than $1.3 billion of cash on our balance sheet as of September 30 and significant cash flow expectations for 2011. We've used about $300 million of cash to redeem the debt due 2011, and we'll use another $300 million in the fourth quarter to fund our pension plan. At year-end 2010, we expect to have about $800 million of cash on hand with no significant debt maturities until 2016. This will allow us the flexibility to continue to seek acquisition opportunities that further enhance our sales and earnings growth, contribute to cash generation and drive shareholder value.
I'm looking forward to talking to all of you throughout the rest of this year and through 2011, and I'm confident that the commercial aerospace is back on a solid growth track.

So a use of cash, full year, in the $75 million to $100 million range.

We still continue to benefit from rising production rates, rising aftermarket, which helps us spread our overall rates, continue to drive cost reductions with our supply chain as well. And then as we add units to certain contracts, that's also a benefit. And those will continue into 2011. Some of the unusual things we got in 2010 that don't repeat are the significant changes in volumes on some of the -- in production aircraft that were announced in 2010, those drive immediate changes to some of those contracts, which we got the benefit of in 2010. And we also had some price negotiations that concluded with both customers and suppliers that drove some changes in 2010, and those are lumpy by definition. They depend on when contracts expire."

So we started off with kind of a normal margin, but we can improve that margin if we can drive costs out of that program and we share that benefit with the government. That's a decent model going forward and it benefits both the customer and ourselves. So it's not all downside."

You've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings release and the related presentation. There's a lot of information in both of these documents that you'll find helpful as you think about Goodrich.
Today, I'll spend a few minutes on our third quarter results and our outlook for 2010, then I'll turn to our outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers.
We continued our strong performance during the third quarter. Our sales growth of 6% was accompanied by net income growth of 10%. All of our major market channels, including the commercial aftermarket reported year-over-year sales growth. 
Our large commercial airplane original equipment market channel grew by 2%, and that growth was relatively evenly split between Boeing and Airbus. 
Our regional business and general aviation original equipment sales increased by about 21%, including sales associated with the recent acquisition of DeCrane's Cabin Management assets. Organic growth in this market channel was about 15%.
Commercial aftermarket sales were 3% higher than the third quarter last year and 2% higher than in the second quarter of 2010. Six of our eight commercial businesses reported higher aftermarket sales in the third quarter of 2010, compared to the year-ago period.
Our defense and space sales continued to exhibit growth in the third quarter of 2010, increasing by 12% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Our acquisition of Atlantic Inertial Systems contributed 8% of this growth. Organic sales growth of about 4% was driven primarily by strong sales in our Wheels and Brakes, Aerostructures and Sensors and Integrated Systems businesses.
In the third quarter of 2010, we achieved segment operating income margins of 17.3% compared to 15.8% in the third quarter of 2009. The improvement was due to strong operational performance, relentless pursuit of continuous improvement and favorable revisions and estimates for certain long-term contracts. 
Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2010 was very strong at $204 million, which is approximately 128% of third quarter net income.
Since last July, we've taken several additional steps to increase shareholder value. Among them, in October, our Board of Directors approved a 7% increase in our company's quarterly dividend to $0.29 per share from the previous level of $0.27 per share on its common stock. This was our fourth consecutive annual increase in our dividend.
In September, we completed the acquisition of the Cabin Management assets of DeCrane Holdings Co. The purchase price was approximately $280 million. We expect this acquisition to be neutral to earnings in 2010 and to be accretive beginning in the first quarter 2011. And in September, we issued $600 million of 10-year debt at 3.6% interest. We used the proceeds to complete the redemption of $257 million of debt due in 2012, which carried a 7.6% interest rate, and we are accelerating $300 million of pension contributions into the fourth quarter of 2010.
For our full year 2010 outlook, we have adjusted our sales outlook to approximately $7 billion, which represents growth of about 5% compared to 2009. The outlook for 2010 net income per diluted share has been adjusted to $4.30 to $4.35, compared to the prior outlook of $4.30 to $4.45. Current outlook includes debt redemption costs of approximately $0.18 per diluted share, which were not included in the prior outlook and will be recognized in the fourth quarter 2010. Excluding these costs, the current outlook would have increased above the prior outlook by $0.10 to $0.20 per diluted share, driven primarily by better operating margin performance.
We now expect large commercial airplane original equipment sales to increase by about 4%, which includes the impact of all of the recently announced production rate changes and incorporates the new delivery schedules for the Boeing 787 and 747-8. We now expect regional business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales to grow by about 4%, including sales associated with the DeCrane acquisition. Excluding sales from the DeCrane acquisition, sales in this market channel would be expected to decrease by about 6% to 7%, a slight improvement over our prior outlook.
We have slightly lowered our total 2010 expectations for large commercial, regional business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales growth. We now expect sales in this market channel to be approximately the same as they were in 2009, compared to our prior outlook of low single-digit growth. We continue to expect year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter 2010 to exceed 10%. We believe sales for this market channel bottomed in the fourth quarter of 2009, and we are currently operating at more than 14% above those levels.
Our outlook for defense and space sales growth is largely unchanged at about 15%, including sales generated by the AIS acquisition that closed in December of last year. Organic growth in this market channel is expected to be about 5%.
Our 2010 outlook for earnings per diluted share includes a full year effective tax rate of about 30% for 2010, a slight improvement compared to our prior outlook of 31%. Our tax rate no longer includes a full year benefit of approximately 1.5% or $0.10 per diluted share related to an assumed extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit retroactive to the beginning of 2010. Our effective tax rate outlook does now include a tax benefit of approximately $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to a settlement last week with the California Franchise Tax Board concerning issues related to Goodrich and Rohr for all tax years through 2001.
For 2010, we now expect net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures to be approximately 50% of net income, including an expected incremental $300 million pension contribution in the fourth quarter. Excluding this incremental contribution, net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures would have increased to approximately 100% of net income, a significant improvement compared to our prior outlook of greater than 85% conversion. We now expect capital expenditures for 2010 to be approximately $225 million to $250 million and expect worldwide pension contributions to be approximately $450 million, pretax.
Now I'll turn to 2011. We're excited about the prospects for 2011. A large airframe manufacturers have announced production rate increases on single-isle aircraft and new programs like Boeing 787 will begin deliveries soon. We expect the commercial aftermarket to grow in 2011 as airlines and package carriers add capacity and increase utilization rates on their existing fleet. In addition, our defense and space sales should experience solid growth as demand for electro-optical reconnaissance sensors, helicopter products, inertial sensors and aftermarket parts and services for fighter and transport aircraft continue to increase. Overall, we are expecting sales growth of about 10% to 11%, including good growth in every market channel and earnings growth of between 15% to 20%.
We expect sales in 2011 to be approximately $7.7  billion to $7.8 billion, driven by growth in every market channel. Large commercial airplane original equipment sales are expected to increase by about 15% to 20% assuming all announced production rate increases are implemented and assuming Boeing 787 deliveries begin in the first quarter of 2011 and 747-8 deliveries to begin in midyear 2011.
Regional business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales are expected to grow by about 35% to 40%, including sales associated with the DeCrane acquisition. Excluding the incremental 2011 sales from DeCrane acquisition, we would expect sales growth of about 4%. 
Large commercial, regional business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales are expected to increase by about 5% to 7%. Our outlook assumes worldwide available seat miles, ASMs, increase by 4% to 6% compared to 2010, which is roughly consistent with the latest IATA forecast. And defense and space sales are expected to increase by about 5% to 6%, organically.
Based on these sales increases, benefits from our continuous improvement in productivity initiatives and lower pension expense, we expect 2011 net income per diluted share to be in the range of $5 to $5.20, an increase of 15% to 20% compared to expectations for 2010 net income per diluted share. Our 2011 outlook includes operating margins of 16%, reflecting very rapid growth in the lower margin commercial original equipment and cost plus military contracts, offset by growth in the aftermarket and the benefit of continuous improvement and lean initiatives on costs.
Lower worldwide pretax pension expense of approximately $30 million or $0.15 per diluted share. Our estimate for 2011 pension expense assumes a 2010 actual return on U.S. plan assets of 9% and a 2011 U.S. discount rate of 5%, both of which reflect conditions as of September 30, 2010. The lower 2011 pension expense is the result of actuarial changes and the benefit of the $300 million incremental contribution I mentioned earlier, which we expect to make during the fourth quarter of 2010. Because almost all of the plan participants are now inactive, the company is changing its amortization period for gains and losses on the U.S. salary pension plan to the estimated remaining life of plan participants rather than the estimated the remaining service period of active plan participants. This change will have the added benefit of lowering pension expense sensitivity to changes in discount rates and the rate-of-return on plan assets in future years. The company also expects to reduce its expected long-term rate-of-return assumptions as of January 1, 2011. I remind you that our pension expense for 2011 will be finalized based on actual asset values and discount rates on December 31, 2010.
We are expecting a 2011 full year effective tax rate of approximately 30%, consistent with the expected tax rate for 2010. The 2011 effective tax rate does include a full year 2011 benefit of approximately 1.5% or $0.10 per diluted share related to an assumed extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit, which has not yet occurred.
We expect net cash provided from operating activities, minus capital expenditures, to exceed 85% of net income for 2011. Our outlook includes expected capital expenditures of $300 million to $350 million and a pretax worldwide pension plan contributions of $50 million to $100 million.
Overall, our performance during the third quarter was excellent from an operational standpoint. We've been able to improve our already strong margins despite slow aftermarket sales growth through a continued focus on cost control and operational excellence. We continue to expect long-term sustainable growth in sales and earnings fueled by our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft, currently in development, and steadily increasing commercial aftermarket sales.
Our financial position remains excellent with more than $1.3 billion of cash on our balance sheet as of September 30 and significant cash flow expectations for 2011. We've used about $300 million of cash to redeem the debt due 2011, and we'll use another $300 million in the fourth quarter to fund our pension plan. At year-end 2010, we expect to have about $800 million of cash on hand with no significant debt maturities until 2016. This will allow us the flexibility to continue to seek acquisition opportunities that further enhance our sales and earnings growth, contribute to cash generation and drive shareholder value.
I'm looking forward to talking to all of you throughout the rest of this year and through 2011, and I'm confident that the commercial aerospace is back on a solid growth track.

So there is a little bit of seasonality because the package carriers are not going to -- they're flying heck out of their airplanes in the fourth quarter, and you see the same thing around the holidays with the airlines. So there's less opportunity for MRO during the fourth quarter than there is in the third quarter. So we've kind of factored that in, in our forecast, but I think what Scott said is correct.

We were able to -- through continuous improvement and enhancing particularly at our Landing Systems business and Electronic Systems business we're able to move the overall total margins up to 17%-plus. As we go move forward, we don't expect to lose that momentum on continuous improvement, and we do expect to see a more robust aftermarket in 2011 and 2012. So I think we can both move top line and bottom line."

The other is we did some accelerated contributions to the plan. Between those two, we did about $100 million reduction and then we're offsetting a bit of that by becoming a little more conservative in our long-term rate of return assumptions, mortality tables, et cetera. Then again, that will reduce the volatility of those sensitivities going forward. So as discount rates change, return assumptions are either above or below what our expectation is, we'll see less volatility in expense going forward. So those are the major movers."

You've all had the opportunity to review today's earnings release and the related presentation. There's a lot of information in both of these documents that you'll find helpful as you think about Goodrich.
Today, I'll spend a few minutes on our third quarter results and our outlook for 2010, then I'll turn to our outlook for 2011 and discuss its drivers.
We continued our strong performance during the third quarter. Our sales growth of 6% was accompanied by net income growth of 10%. All of our major market channels, including the commercial aftermarket reported year-over-year sales growth. 
Our large commercial airplane original equipment market channel grew by 2%, and that growth was relatively evenly split between Boeing and Airbus. 
Our regional business and general aviation original equipment sales increased by about 21%, including sales associated with the recent acquisition of DeCrane's Cabin Management assets. Organic growth in this market channel was about 15%.
Commercial aftermarket sales were 3% higher than the third quarter last year and 2% higher than in the second quarter of 2010. Six of our eight commercial businesses reported higher aftermarket sales in the third quarter of 2010, compared to the year-ago period.
Our defense and space sales continued to exhibit growth in the third quarter of 2010, increasing by 12% compared to the third quarter of 2009. Our acquisition of Atlantic Inertial Systems contributed 8% of this growth. Organic sales growth of about 4% was driven primarily by strong sales in our Wheels and Brakes, Aerostructures and Sensors and Integrated Systems businesses.
In the third quarter of 2010, we achieved segment operating income margins of 17.3% compared to 15.8% in the third quarter of 2009. The improvement was due to strong operational performance, relentless pursuit of continuous improvement and favorable revisions and estimates for certain long-term contracts. 
Net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2010 was very strong at $204 million, which is approximately 128% of third quarter net income.
Since last July, we've taken several additional steps to increase shareholder value. Among them, in October, our Board of Directors approved a 7% increase in our company's quarterly dividend to $0.29 per share from the previous level of $0.27 per share on its common stock. This was our fourth consecutive annual increase in our dividend.
In September, we completed the acquisition of the Cabin Management assets of DeCrane Holdings Co. The purchase price was approximately $280 million. We expect this acquisition to be neutral to earnings in 2010 and to be accretive beginning in the first quarter 2011. And in September, we issued $600 million of 10-year debt at 3.6% interest. We used the proceeds to complete the redemption of $257 million of debt due in 2012, which carried a 7.6% interest rate, and we are accelerating $300 million of pension contributions into the fourth quarter of 2010.
For our full year 2010 outlook, we have adjusted our sales outlook to approximately $7 billion, which represents growth of about 5% compared to 2009. The outlook for 2010 net income per diluted share has been adjusted to $4.30 to $4.35, compared to the prior outlook of $4.30 to $4.45. Current outlook includes debt redemption costs of approximately $0.18 per diluted share, which were not included in the prior outlook and will be recognized in the fourth quarter 2010. Excluding these costs, the current outlook would have increased above the prior outlook by $0.10 to $0.20 per diluted share, driven primarily by better operating margin performance.
We now expect large commercial airplane original equipment sales to increase by about 4%, which includes the impact of all of the recently announced production rate changes and incorporates the new delivery schedules for the Boeing 787 and 747-8. We now expect regional business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales to grow by about 4%, including sales associated with the DeCrane acquisition. Excluding sales from the DeCrane acquisition, sales in this market channel would be expected to decrease by about 6% to 7%, a slight improvement over our prior outlook.
We have slightly lowered our total 2010 expectations for large commercial, regional business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales growth. We now expect sales in this market channel to be approximately the same as they were in 2009, compared to our prior outlook of low single-digit growth. We continue to expect year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter 2010 to exceed 10%. We believe sales for this market channel bottomed in the fourth quarter of 2009, and we are currently operating at more than 14% above those levels.
Our outlook for defense and space sales growth is largely unchanged at about 15%, including sales generated by the AIS acquisition that closed in December of last year. Organic growth in this market channel is expected to be about 5%.
Our 2010 outlook for earnings per diluted share includes a full year effective tax rate of about 30% for 2010, a slight improvement compared to our prior outlook of 31%. Our tax rate no longer includes a full year benefit of approximately 1.5% or $0.10 per diluted share related to an assumed extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit retroactive to the beginning of 2010. Our effective tax rate outlook does now include a tax benefit of approximately $23 million in the fourth quarter of 2010 related to a settlement last week with the California Franchise Tax Board concerning issues related to Goodrich and Rohr for all tax years through 2001.
For 2010, we now expect net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures to be approximately 50% of net income, including an expected incremental $300 million pension contribution in the fourth quarter. Excluding this incremental contribution, net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures would have increased to approximately 100% of net income, a significant improvement compared to our prior outlook of greater than 85% conversion. We now expect capital expenditures for 2010 to be approximately $225 million to $250 million and expect worldwide pension contributions to be approximately $450 million, pretax.
Now I'll turn to 2011. We're excited about the prospects for 2011. A large airframe manufacturers have announced production rate increases on single-isle aircraft and new programs like Boeing 787 will begin deliveries soon. We expect the commercial aftermarket to grow in 2011 as airlines and package carriers add capacity and increase utilization rates on their existing fleet. In addition, our defense and space sales should experience solid growth as demand for electro-optical reconnaissance sensors, helicopter products, inertial sensors and aftermarket parts and services for fighter and transport aircraft continue to increase. Overall, we are expecting sales growth of about 10% to 11%, including good growth in every market channel and earnings growth of between 15% to 20%.
We expect sales in 2011 to be approximately $7.7  billion to $7.8 billion, driven by growth in every market channel. Large commercial airplane original equipment sales are expected to increase by about 15% to 20% assuming all announced production rate increases are implemented and assuming Boeing 787 deliveries begin in the first quarter of 2011 and 747-8 deliveries to begin in midyear 2011.
Regional business and general aviation airplane original equipment sales are expected to grow by about 35% to 40%, including sales associated with the DeCrane acquisition. Excluding the incremental 2011 sales from DeCrane acquisition, we would expect sales growth of about 4%. 
Large commercial, regional business and general aviation airplane aftermarket sales are expected to increase by about 5% to 7%. Our outlook assumes worldwide available seat miles, ASMs, increase by 4% to 6% compared to 2010, which is roughly consistent with the latest IATA forecast. And defense and space sales are expected to increase by about 5% to 6%, organically.
Based on these sales increases, benefits from our continuous improvement in productivity initiatives and lower pension expense, we expect 2011 net income per diluted share to be in the range of $5 to $5.20, an increase of 15% to 20% compared to expectations for 2010 net income per diluted share. Our 2011 outlook includes operating margins of 16%, reflecting very rapid growth in the lower margin commercial original equipment and cost plus military contracts, offset by growth in the aftermarket and the benefit of continuous improvement and lean initiatives on costs.
Lower worldwide pretax pension expense of approximately $30 million or $0.15 per diluted share. Our estimate for 2011 pension expense assumes a 2010 actual return on U.S. plan assets of 9% and a 2011 U.S. discount rate of 5%, both of which reflect conditions as of September 30, 2010. The lower 2011 pension expense is the result of actuarial changes and the benefit of the $300 million incremental contribution I mentioned earlier, which we expect to make during the fourth quarter of 2010. Because almost all of the plan participants are now inactive, the company is changing its amortization period for gains and losses on the U.S. salary pension plan to the estimated remaining life of plan participants rather than the estimated the remaining service period of active plan participants. This change will have the added benefit of lowering pension expense sensitivity to changes in discount rates and the rate-of-return on plan assets in future years. The company also expects to reduce its expected long-term rate-of-return assumptions as of January 1, 2011. I remind you that our pension expense for 2011 will be finalized based on actual asset values and discount rates on December 31, 2010.
We are expecting a 2011 full year effective tax rate of approximately 30%, consistent with the expected tax rate for 2010. The 2011 effective tax rate does include a full year 2011 benefit of approximately 1.5% or $0.10 per diluted share related to an assumed extension of the U.S. R&D tax credit, which has not yet occurred.
We expect net cash provided from operating activities, minus capital expenditures, to exceed 85% of net income for 2011. Our outlook includes expected capital expenditures of $300 million to $350 million and a pretax worldwide pension plan contributions of $50 million to $100 million.
Overall, our performance during the third quarter was excellent from an operational standpoint. We've been able to improve our already strong margins despite slow aftermarket sales growth through a continued focus on cost control and operational excellence. We continue to expect long-term sustainable growth in sales and earnings fueled by our significant market share gains on new commercial and military aircraft, currently in development, and steadily increasing commercial aftermarket sales.
Our financial position remains excellent with more than $1.3 billion of cash on our balance sheet as of September 30 and significant cash flow expectations for 2011. We've used about $300 million of cash to redeem the debt due 2011, and we'll use another $300 million in the fourth quarter to fund our pension plan. At year-end 2010, we expect to have about $800 million of cash on hand with no significant debt maturities until 2016. This will allow us the flexibility to continue to seek acquisition opportunities that further enhance our sales and earnings growth, contribute to cash generation and drive shareholder value.
I'm looking forward to talking to all of you throughout the rest of this year and through 2011, and I'm confident that the commercial aerospace is back on a solid growth track.
Let's open up the call for questions."

Because I think that has the potential if the worldwide economy continues to improve of going higher. And our piece parts are not as discretionary as maybe majors. And majors will come as those engine orders, those big engine orders come also. So I saw it as a good sign that they were getting those kinds of orders, but I'm not going to count my chickens before they hatch."

The discount rate change that we've seen in the first nine months of the year going from 5.9% down to 5%, that would have cost us about another $57 million in pension expense. So that would have pushed us to about $203 million. Then in addition -- then we've done two things to reduce that. One is the actuarial change. The other is we did some accelerated contributions to the plan. Between those two, we did about $100 million reduction and then we're offsetting a bit of that by becoming a little more conservative in our long-term rate of return assumptions, mortality tables, et cetera. Then again, that will reduce the volatility of those sensitivities going forward. So as discount rates change, return assumptions are either above or below what our expectation is, we'll see less volatility in expense going forward. So those are the major movers."
