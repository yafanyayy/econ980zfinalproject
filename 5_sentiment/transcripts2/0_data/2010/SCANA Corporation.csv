I would also like to welcome each of you to our call. Continuing on to Slide 3, we reported 2009 full year earnings of $2.85 per share compared to $2.95 per share in 2008. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $0.6",1271,"Thanks, Betty, and good afternoon. I would also like to welcome each of you to our call. Continuing on to Slide 3, we reported 2009 full year earnings of $2.85 per share compared to $2.95 per share in 2008. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2009 were $0.62 per share, down from $0.73 per share in the same quarter of 2008. Our results were within our 2009 earnings guidance of $2.80 to $2.95 per share, which had been narrowed from $2.65 to $2.95 on our third quarter call.This quarterly and year-over-year decline in earnings was attributable to several factors as outlined on Slide 4. First, in our regulated Electric operations, margins were down $0.09 for the year, and down $0.05 for the quarter. That decrease was driven by a continued weakened economy resulting in lower weather normalized usage for our residential, commercial and industrial and electric customers. This lower usage, which collectively had an estimated earnings impact of $0.20 per share for the year, offset the $0.03 per share favorable impact of customer growth, $0.05 per share impact from the BLRA increase, and $0.10 per share from favorable weather. Additionally, we realized an $0.08 per share decline in off-system sales and transmission revenue, largely due to the economy.The reduction in electric margins of $0.05 for the quarter looks disproportionate in relation to the $0.09 for the entire year. But considering the $0.10 benefit of weather all occurred in the first three quarters, it's more comparable. We see the economic impact in Q4 is fairly consistent with the earlier trend.We saw a significant decline in our earnings at SCANA Energy for our Retail and Natural Gas Marketing business in Georgia. For 2009, we reported earnings of $24 million or $0.20 per share compared to $33 million or $0.28 per share in 2008. Consistent with the earlier quarters of 2009, this decline is largely a result of the shift in marketplace as more customers opted for fixed rate pricing plans to lock in lower natural gas prices. This shift more than offset the positive gas margin impact from our North and South Carolina regulated businesses, that were driven primarily by increased revenues and lower bad debt expenses.We continued our strong trend of cost control in Q4 and accumulated $0.18 per share in savings over 2008, and recognized $0.11 benefit from a state tax issue as reported in the third quarter. However, this was not enough to offset the challenge of the economy and dilution. While both the fourth quarter and all of 2009 have been very challenging, we remained focused on our commitment to operational safety and reliability, providing high quality customer service and delivering competitive returns to our shareholders in spite of a very weak economy.Slide 5 presents earnings per share by company. For SCE&G [South Carolina Electric & Gas Company], 2009 earnings were down $0.05 per share due primarily to reduced electric margins from lower customer usage and dilution, which more than offset lower O&M, the impact of the BLRA increases and favorable weather. PSNC showed solid earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2009, due primarily to continued customer growth, lower O&M and the November 2008 general rate increase.PGTC had another solid year with earnings of $0.08 per share. We expect this business to generate similar earnings in 2010. We've already discussed SCANA Energy's $0.08 decline in earnings, driven by customers switching to fixed-rate plans. For 2010, we expect this business to earn approximately $0.20 to $0.22 per share, assuming normal weather. And finally, earnings at the other entities were essentially flat year-over-year.Please turn to Slide 6, and I'll take a minute to discuss the effectiveness of our expense control measures for 2009. These efforts included holding non-labor O&M spending for 2009 to amounts below 2008 actual levels, and reducing our number of outside contractors substantially, to lower labor related costs. Additionally, 2009 saw a year of no salary increases for all exempt employees, including management, and very limited hiring. As I stated earlier, these measures resulted in our year-over-year decrease of $0.18 per share compared to 2008. Given the ongoing economic uncertainty, we're targeting 2010 O&M expenses at the same overall run rate we saw in 2009. There are a limited number of exceptions but we should be able to sustain the majority of the savings realized in 2009. As we begin to see economic recovery, we will increase the necessary spending to support the increased growth. As always, we will continue to do what is required to run our businesses safely and reliably while providing exceptional service.Speaking of customers, as you can see on Slide 7, we continue to show positive growth in our regulated Electric and Gas service territories. On the Electric side, we added approximately 5,000 customers. We added over 8,000 Natural Gas customers over the same period in our Regulated businesses. As we have said before, we expect this growth to return to more normal levels as we see signs of improvement in the economy.Slide 8 presents our preliminary three-year CapEx forecast. I've stressed this is preliminary as we are constantly evaluating additional reductions based upon the economy. Consistent with our quarterly BLRA filings, spending on our nuclear project is on track and is forecasted to remain relatively steady through 2011 with a substantial increase occurring in the 2012 time frame.On Slide 9, you see a summary of our near-term financing plans. On a consolidated basis, we issued approximately $480 million of new debt in 2009, including $150 million of junior subordinated notes that we used to call our then-outstanding preferred  stock. We also raised approximately $186 million in equity through our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment plans in 2009, and through a follow-on offering concurrent with being added to the S&P 500 at the beginning of the year. As you can see, for 2010 through '12, we are forecasting approximately $245 million in equity each year, including that raised via our existing plans. This is an estimate for planning purposes, and will be refined based upon actual cash needs and market conditions among other factors.Regarding our dividend announcement earlier today, I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors raised the indicated annual dividend rate to $1.90 per share, a 1.1% increase from the previous rate of $1.88. The dividend is payable April 1 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 10, 2010. Our Board remains confident about the company's long-term future despite the challenging economy, and felt it important to relay that message to all our SCANA shareholders with this increase.On Slide 10, you see our 2010 earnings guidance and assumptions necessary to achieve these results. As we look forward to 2010, our focus continues to be very cautious and conservative in both operations and finance, while maintaining our standards for customer service, reliability and safety. In preparing our guidance for 2010, we considered the operating results of 2009, projected production of our largest industrial customers and known changes in property taxes, governmental fees and other major expense categories. We are issuing preliminary guidance for 2010 of $2.85 to $3.05 per share. This guidance assumes normal weather in our Electric and Natural Gas service areas and an effective tax rate of approximately 31%.We have also assumed reasonable regulatory relief from our pending electric rate proceeding, which Kevin will be discussing further. Of course, we will continue to monitor the economy and other developments as we move through the year, gaining additional clarity on drivers like customer growth, usage, market conditions, et cetera.I'd now like to turn the call over to Kevin for our regulatory and operational update for SCE&G."

I'll begin with a few operational highlights on Slide 11. Our current performance at V.C. Summer Unit 1 continues to demonstrate why we chose nuclear power as our next increment of base load generation. Our most recent operating cycle, which ended due to a scheduled refueling outage in October, was the most successful in the V.C. Summer's history. We set a continuous run record of 475 days, which means the plant was operating non-stop, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, providing reliable emissions-free power for well over a year. During this cycle, we also surpassed 5.5 million continuous safe work hours demonstrating our commitment to safety.SCE&G's fossil generation fleet also continued to operate at a high level during 2009. Our forced outage rate was 1.42%, which is our best performance in the past five years. We were very pleased to once again have two plants listed on Electric Light & Power's top 20 plants in the nation, based on their heat rates, which is a measure of how efficiently a generator uses heat energy. Our McMeekin plant was ranked fourth and the Cope plant was ranked 12th.Finally, we set a new winter peak of 4,718 megawatts on January 11 of this year. We are pleased we were able to serve this load with our existing generation fleet and did not need to purchase any power to meet this peak demand.Our very important environmental scrubber projects at Wateree and Williams stations are in their final stages. We anticipate placing the Williams scrubber in service this month, with the Wateree scrubber to be placed in service later this year. As a result, SO2 emissions at these two plants will be reduced by more than 95%, and mercury emissions reduced by 60% to 90%.Now, turning to Slide 12, you see a summary of our recent regulatory proceedings and their outcomes at the top of the slide, and a regulatory schedule for 2010 at the bottom of the page. On the first two lines, please note the consistency of our BLRA approvals related to our new nuclear construction as this process is working as designed.Slide 13 details our most recent electric filing. On January 15, we filed an application with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, requesting a 9.52% increase in retail electric base rates. The requested increase, based on a 9.03% overall return on rate base and an 11.6% return on common equity, will produce $198 million in additional annual revenues based on an adjusted test year ended September 30, 2009. This requested rate increase is driven primarily by the need to recover the cost of mandatory environmental upgrades to the company's generating plants, including costs for the scrubbers at our Wateree and Williams plants. It also includes the remaining unrecovered capital cost for the Lake Murray backup dam. Expenditures for maintaining reliability of the electric transmission and distribution systems and other operating expenses.A public hearing on SCE&G's application is scheduled to begin May 24. As with all regulatory proceedings, we anticipate working with intervenors in an effort to reach a reasonable settlement. Recognizing the financial challenge this increase will represent for many of our customers in this economy, we've asked the Commission to phase in this increase in three stages over 18 months. If approved, the first stage would generate approximately $66 million in annual revenues, and would be effective on July 15, 2010. Stage two would generate $64 million and be effective on January 1, 2011. And stage three would be approximately $68 million in annual revenues, effective on July 1, 2011.Turning now to our new nuclear project update beginning on Slide 14. I am pleased to report our pre-construction work on V.C. Summer Units 2 and 3 is proceeding in full compliance with the schedule approved by the Commission. We made tremendous progress in our new nuclear activities during 2009, including receiving a comprehensive pre-construction prudency review under the Base Load Review Act, and approval for the siting of the two new plants. In addition, the Commission recently approved an updated construction and capital cost schedule for the construction of these units. The updated construction schedule is site-specific for our particular project and will replace the generic AP1000 Westinghouse construction milestone schedule included in the initial 2008 base load review filings. It does not change the previously approved cost of $4.53 billion and 2007 dollars, but rather better matches the cost to the years in which they are expected to be incurred.Detailed quarterly status reports on our new nuclear project, which includes supporting data from the information on Slide 14, is available on SCANA's website under Investor Relations. Once there, click on the Nuclear Financial Information link. We will be filing a new report with the Commission on February 16, next Tuesday, and I encourage you to review these filings each quarter.With regards to our combined operating license or COL application with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, discussions between Westinghouse and the NRC on the AP1000 design certification document Revision 17 or DCD 17, shield building issues are still ongoing. Westinghouse remains confident that they satisfy the NRC concerns on this issue. There will be a conforming DCD 18 submitted by Westinghouse this year, which incorporates all of the responses to NRC questions and updates. We still expect to receive our COL in late 2011 or early 2012 depending on the NRC review of DCD 18. But we do not believe this will impact our first unit commercial operation date in 2016.Finally, I would like to give you a brief update on our Department of Energy loan guarantee application. Today, SCE&G has filed both parts one and two of the application for our loan guarantee. We are still awaiting a term sheet before determining our participation in this program. Recent announcements by the DOE indicating their desire to speed up their process, as well as comments by the administration regarding expansions of the program are encouraging. As we have said all along, we are confident in our ability to finance this project without loan guarantees and will only participate if it's beneficial for our customers and shareholders.That concludes our prepared remarks. And we'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have. Thank you."

The 9.5% is a larger number than we typically file for in our regular rate cases. And the fact that it's been driven by the mandatory expenditures on the environmental abatement program allowed most people to understand that. Certainly it's a tough time to be filing a rate case in South Carolina right now with the unemployment and challenges at our state and others have. So certainly, initially, when we filed the case, there was a lot of pushback, a lot of people trying to understand what was driving it and we have a lot of information, go out meeting with all the folks that are helping us deliver the messages to what's driving it. And if you look at that case, and you look at the impact that's coming from the government mandates on the environmental equipment, the remaining expenditure over Saluda Dam, and I think it's about a $17 million increase in property taxes that makes up almost 2/3 of the case as filed. So certainly that's driving the larger numbers. The O&M we filed in this case was less than what we filed in our last case based on our cost control efforts. And that's certainly something we intend to emphasize in the hearings because that's a big message for us and I think shows the effort our team has put forward to hold down cost. We've had some additional maintenance that we're going to have to spend on our power plants because they are older plants, to keep them reliable. And about $7 million in additional tree trimming, and all of which goes to help system reliability. So when you add up the government mandate, the system reliability and what we're spending on customer growth that we had already spent on customer growth before the system slowed down due to the economy, and that makes up almost 90% of the request. So our goal has been to communicate that information, to have people understand what's driving it. The fact that we waited a year to file this case and then you all asked us last year several times on when we are going to file to try to recover the dollars for the scrubbers, And then we repostponed it last year and even in this filing this year since we pushed it out 18 months. I think shows we're doing everything we can to minimize the impact. But the reality is, we've got the dollars invested over $700 million in these expenditures that we've simply got to recover and find the easiest way to make that happen."

So we think that -- and I think this year was $0.21, we'd see it right in that range prospectively or $0.20 this year so we really, really don't see a lot of volatility in it going forward. We think the markets made the move. But it's really not driven so much by the price of natural gas. It's driven more by just the competitiveness of the market that has gotten the margins down to the level that they are on the variable side. You know on the fixed side, you're exactly right. We do hedge those completely. So each month, when we offer fixed rate programs, for example, on this month of February, for all of those that opt for a 12 month fixed rate plan, we will aggregate those customers and put a financial hedge behind it so that our risk is eliminated and we know what those margins are during the term of the contract. So it's not that we didn't hedge it, it's not that we're losing it because of volatility and the price of gas, it's a fundamental shift that the market itself, as a whole, is offering lower net margins on fixed contracts than there are on variable contracts and we're simply a part of that market.

On addition to that, I think I might just turn it over to Kevin in a minute to talk about kind of his strategy for how he's looking to manage CapEx during the economy here."

So we've taken that and gone back and taken a hard look at our capital budget and we try to make some adjustments to that as we go through 2010. Our annual run rate on depreciation expense now is between, I think, is $260 million and $270 million. And I don't think that number won't change because that property is already been put into service and that depreciation will continue. So it's a matter of how well can we control those capital expenditures in terms of how much we will add to that number on an annual basis. But that fits right into our strategy, we're trying to manage the capital, especially while we're in this tough economic period and do the best we can to hold that down."

I would like to start on slide three, which reflects SCANA's first quarter earnings on a GAAP basis of $1.02 per share compared to $0.94 per share in the first quarter of 2009.
These results were driven by several positive factors, including higher consumption due to weather and other factors, increased revenues associated with the Base Load Review Act and Natural Gas Rate Stabilization Act and customer growth on our system. These factors more than offset the negative impact of higher operating and maintenance expenses, incremental interest expense, increased property tax and share dilution.
During this recession, we've been very diligent with our cost control. The majority of the $13 million increase in O&M expense is due to recorded bad debt expense related to substantially increased sales and some increase in incentive compensation accruals due in part to the recent performance of our sock.
O&M, net of these two components, is only up about $6 million or $0.03 per share. Principal factors for this increase are outage costs at our Jasper plant, the performance of more tree trimming earlier in the year and growth in labor at PSNC to support new customer adds.
As shown in the graph on slide four, kilowatt hour sales of electricity to our retail customers in 2010 were up 10% over 2009. Residential sales increased 18.6%. Commercial sales were up 3.4% and industrial sales rose 6.9%. Overall, total kilowatt hour sales of electricity, which includes sales to other utilities were up just under 9%. We estimate sales exclusive of weather were up approximately 3.7%. We're encouraged by these results.
Consolidated therm sales of natural gas in 2010 were up 11.9%. Residential sales increased 24.6%, commercial sales rose 11.8% and industrial sales were up 3.8%. Additionally, this quarter we deferred for potential refund $25 million of estimated incremental electric revenues earned during the quarter due to the unusually cold weather.
This deferral is part of a proposed pilot weather normalization or WNA mechanism we made to the office of regulatory staff or ROS in rate case settlement negotiations. Kevin Marsh will talk more about the rate case including this provision in a few minutes.
Now, I'd like to review first quarter results for our principal lines of business on slide five. As you know, the majority of SCANA's operations are regulated. Our regulated utility businesses, South Carolina Electric & Gas, PSNC Energy and Carolina Gas Transmission collectively represent more than 90% of the company's total assets and annual earnings per share.
SCE&G, our largest subsidiary reported earnings of $0.51 per share, unchanged compared to the same quarter last year. These results are net of the $25 million WNA revenue deferral previously discussed and are attributable to higher non-weather related consumption, customer growth and the impact of increases in rates under the base load review act and the national gas rates stabilization act. These increases were offset by higher O&M and interest expenses and share dilution.
On slide six, as of March 31 of this year, SCE&G was serving approximately 659,000 electric customers, which represents a 1.1% increase during the year. Over the same period, SCE&G's natural gas customer base increased 1.2% to approximately 313,000. PSNC Energy, our retail natural gas distribution company in North Carolina, reported earnings for the first quarter of $0.25 per share, unchanged compared to the same quarter in 2009.
These results are due primarily to improved margins, offset by slightly higher operating expenses and depreciation. At March 31, 2010 PSNC Energy was serving approximately 475,000 natural gas customers, an increase of 1.3% over the last 12 months. We're very encouraged to see improving customer growth in our system and increased non-weather related consumption.
SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported earnings of $0.24 per share in the first quarter of 2010 compared to $0.18 per share in the comparable period of 2009. This improvement is due primarily to unusually cold weather, which drove higher volumes and resulted in improved margins.
At March 31, 2010 SCANA Energy was serving approximately 465,000 customers in Georgia, maintaining its position as the second largest natural gas marketer in the state. SCANA's corporate and other businesses, which include Carolina Gas Transmission, SCANA Communications, ServiceCare, SCANA Energy Marketing and the holding company reported earnings of $2 million or $0.02 per share compared to breakeven results in the first quarter of 2009. This improvement is due primarily to a lower effective tax rate.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Kevin for a regulatory update on SCE&G.

Before I discuss the rate case, I would like to take a minute to address a few other regulatory items at SCE&G and we'll start on slide seven.On May 17th, we will file our quarterly status report with the PSC and office",591,"Thanks, Jimmy and good afternoon. Before I discuss the rate case, I would like to take a minute to address a few other regulatory items at SCE&G and we'll start on slide seven.
On May 17th, we will file our quarterly status report with the PSC and office of regulatory staff, as required under our recent base load review order associated with our new nuclear activities. This report will provide a detailed update of our capital costs incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project and will be available on our website.
As information, the updated project costs, through December 31st, 2009 is outlined on slide eight. As you can see, the only changes between the approved costs and our latest estimate relate to the fluctuations in projected escalation.
On May 28th, we also expect to submit our annual revised rate adjustment filing with the PSC for the annual recover of financing costs related to CWIP. The requested rate adjustment will be based on the incremental CWIP incurred, since the June 2009 filing and an updated capital structure. The ROE is set at 11%. New rates under this filing will go into effect October 30th of this year after a review by the ORS and approval by the PSC.
On a related note, I am pleased to report that the South Carolina Supreme Court in a 5/0 decision has affirmed the base load review order issued by the PSC and the appeal initiated by Friends of the Earth. In upholding the PSC decision, the court ruled that SCE&G's application, as well as the PSC's thorough and well reasoned order adequately addressed all of the concerns raised by Friends of the Earth.
There is one additional base load review appeal regarding the appropriateness of contingency costs, pending before the South Carolina Supreme Court. While we were unsure of the timing of a final decision, we are confident in our position in that case as well and we'll update you once we have an outcome.
Turning now to our 2010 retail electric rate case. All of our direct testimony, along with testimony from interveners has been filed and settlement discussions are ongoing. On Monday, SCE&G signed a stipulation with the Office of the Regulatory Staff that would lower SCE&G's proposed 9.52% requested increase to 6.55% and provide a $25 million weather related credit to its electric customers.
This stipulation is subject to approval by the PSC, which is scheduled to begin a public hearing on the rate request May 24th. The key stipulations include a 10.7% return on equity and the introduction of a 12-month pilot weather normalization adjustment mechanism or WNA to SCE&G's billing structure for electric rates.
Once implemented, the pilot WNA program would result in adjustments to customers monthly electric bills to reflect normal weather. Similar to a mechanism SCE&G applies to natural gas bills, this program would reduce the occurrence of large monthly swings on electric bills resulting from extreme winter or summer weather.
Under the program, forecasts with normal temperatures would be based on a 15 year average. We are pleased to have entered into a stipulation with the ORS on these key items and we'll continue to work over the next few weeks with ORS and other interested interveners to address remaining issues. You can see a full schedule for the rate case on slide nine of the presentation. We will be sure to keep you informed if there are any additional announcements related to this case.
I'll now turn the call back over to Jimmy.

There would just a be, if you will, a rate rider that would be a detriment for years one and years two for those two items, to phase in the weather for the first year and to phase in the tax credits for two years. So from the customer's perspective, they would see, based on the staff's recommendation, about 26% of our original request year one, about 39% year two and then ultimately 51% year three, based on, again, staff's recommendation But of course as we would be amortizing back the weather deferral and the tax credits, we would be advertising those back into income to get back to the total 51% from day one.

I mean, we've seen here, just like we've seen around the country and the world, where there was a drain of inventories in the second half of ‘09, but there has to be replenishment now. But we've seen a lot of industrial announcements, too. I think we've talked at our year-end release about Boeing's announcement to locate the 787 Dreamliner second assembly line here in our territory in Charleston. Just this week, they announced that they have selected South Carolina to locate the plant that will manufacture all the interior parts for that aircraft. The parts you and I would see as we go inside the aircraft. So that's another encouraging sign.
And there's, I don't know, half a dozen other announcements like that in the industrial area of, 100, 200, 300 jobs around the territory and in other areas outside of our territory in the state. So that's encouraging. The other think I would point to is, is in our core retail customer growth, we added about 4200 electric customers in the first quarter and that's more than we added in the first quarter of ‘09, more than we added in the first quarter of ‘08. You have to go back to the first quarter of ‘07 to find a quarter that exceeded that number of adds.
Same thing on the gas business in South Carolina, they added 2,900 customers in the first quarter, more than either of the first quarters of the last two years and very close to Q1 of ‘07. At North Carolina, where the growth has remained a little higher, it has not bounced back quite as quick, but it's still higher in a raw percentage and we added more than we did in ‘09, not as strong as ‘ 08. So, you know, we see it in core retail, we see it in the industrials, so we're fairly encouraged. Obviously, a quarter doesn't make a trend, but it's certainly better than the last half dozen quarters.

I would also like to welcome each of few to our call. Let us start on slide three, which reflects SCANA's second quarter earnings of $0.43 per share compared to $0.45 per share in 2009.

Let us start on slide three, which reflects SCANA's second quarter earnings of $0.43 per share compared to $0.45 per share in 2009. This $0.02 decline was due primarily to the impact of higher property factors, interest, slightly higher O&M expenses, and sheer dilution, which more than offset improved electric margins driven by favorable weather, customer growth, and electric base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act.
Additionally, second quarter earnings were negatively impacted $0.03 from income taxes due to a change in income tax accounting for capital maintenance. The change in accounting affects certain types of costs previously accreted as property additions and deducted through depreciation, which will instead be treated as current expenses for income tax purposes. This change is expected to eliminate taxable income on our 2009 income tax returns, and as a result, is expected to provide approximately $100 million of cash benefit, primarily to be realized over the next year, as our 2010 estimated income tax payments are reduced. The only downside is that the elimination of taxable income will result in the loss of an unrelated deduction, hence the $0.03 one-time charge in Q2. This improved cash flow from the deferral of taxes will be used to mitigate external capital requirements. Initially, it may allow us to defer the planned takedowns under our equity-forward transaction to help minimize dilution, but ultimately, we expect to further strengthen the balance sheet by reducing planned debt issuances.
Earnings for the first six months of 2010 were $1.45 per share compared to $1.39 per share in 2009. This $0.06 per share year-to-date increase in earnings is due to improved first-quarter earnings in our non-regulated retail and natural gas marketing business in Georgia, and customer growth in our regulated businesses, which resulted in improved electric and natural gas margins, more than offsetting higher O&M and interest expenses, property and income taxes, and dilution.
Although quarterly earnings were down slightly compared to last year, they would have been up if not for the elective change in taxes and we are pleased to see continued signs of economic recovery in our service territory. As shown on slide four, kilowatt hour sales of electricity to our retail customers in the second quarter of 2010 were up 7.3% compared to the same quarter in 2009, with all classes showing nice increases, while industrials rose an impressive 14.8%. Overall, total kilowatt hour sales of electricity, which includes sales to other utilities, were up 5.3%. Of course, weather contributed to the residential and commercial increase, with core growth and the industrial improvement providing the balance.
On slide five, consolidated therm sales were down 1.1%, driven by lower residential, commercial, and sales for resale. We may recall, we had a cold April last year, which resulted in higher volumes compared to this year's very warm second quarter. This weather-driven decline more than offset strong industrial sales, which are up 3.9% compared to last year. We are very encouraged by these quarterly and year-to-date sales results, and are cautiously optimistic the recovery will continue.
Please turn to slide six to review our financing plan. In May, we completed a significant financial goal with the successful execution of our $300 million equity-forward offering. This forward offering is unique for several reasons, including that we were able to parse the offering on May 11 at 93% of our 52-week high, just five days after the infamous flash crash, where we saw some of the highest volatility in the financial markets this year. Completing this particular financing structure allows us the flexibility to efficiently match our equity needs, with the timing of required capital for our nuclear projects, and to reduce financing risk, while minimizing share dilution, and raising the equity necessary to maintain our targeted capitalization ratios. Under the terms of this offering, we drew nearly $60 million in equity in the second quarter. Initial plans are to draw an additional $90 million in late 2010 and the balance of $150 million in 2011. The exact dates of the additional draws are subject to our actual operating results and additional sources of cash, both of which appear more favorable than a few months ago, given the economy, and the tax change I discussed earlier.
As shown on slide six, this financing effectively eliminates our need for any additional equity offerings, beyond amounts generated through the 401(k) and dividend reinvestment plan until 2012.
Now, on slide seven, I would like to review second quarter results for our principal lines of business. As a reminder, the large majority of our operations are regulated. These regulated utility businesses collectively represent approximately 95% of our total assets and annual earnings.
South Carolina Electric and Gas Company, our largest subsidiary, reported earnings of $0.50 per share compared to $0.49 per share in the same quarter last year. The $0.01 increase is attributable primarily to customer growth resulting in improved electric and natural gas margins, and to regulatory outcomes in our 2009 Base Load Review Act (BLRA) and Natural Gas Rate Stabilization Act or RSA filings, which more than offset higher O&M and interest expenses and dilution. At June 30, SCE&G was serving approximately 660,000 electric customers and approximately 310,000 natural gas customers, up 0.9% and 1.1% respectively from the same time last year.
PSNC energy, our retail natural gas distribution company in North Carolina, reported a seasonal loss of $1 million or $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2010, compared to breakeven results in the second quarter of 2009. This decline was due primarily to slightly higher O&M expenses and dilution, which more than offset customer growth. At June 30, PSNC Energy was serving approximately 468,000 natural gas customers, an increase of 1.5% over the last 12 months.
SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported a seasonal loss of $6 million or $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2010, compared to a loss of $3 million or $0.03 per share in the same quarter last year. This decline is primarily attributable to the lower margins arising from the warmer weather in 2010. At June 30, SCANA energy was serving approximately 450,000 customers, maintaining its position as the state's second-largest natural gas marketer. Last week, the Georgia PSC voted unanimously to extend the current two-year term for SCANA Energy's regulated division, Georgia's regulated natural gas provider, by one year to expire on August 31, 2012. The terms and conditions of the program remain the same. SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss in the second quarter of 2010 of $2 million or $0.01 per share comparable to the same quarter last year.
To summarize, on slide eight, based on strong year-to-date earnings, improvement in the economy, and our expectations for the remainder of the year, along with the successful execution of our equity-forward sale and the resolution of our retail electric rate case, we are raising the floor of our 2010 earnings guidance by $0.05 to $2.90 to $3.05 per share.
There are several recent state regulatory filings I would like Kevin Marsh, President of SCE&G to brief you on. I will now turn the call over to Kevin.

188244,109109412,70551,"SCANA Corp., Q2 2010 Earnings Call, Jul-29-2010",2010-07-29,"Earnings Calls","SCANA Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jimmy. Getting on slide nine, I am pleased to report that our new nuclear project remains on schedule and on budget. On May 17, we filed our quarterly status report with the PSC and the ORS as required under our base load review order associated w",931,"Thanks, Jimmy. Getting on slide nine, I am pleased to report that our new nuclear project remains on schedule and on budget. On May 17, we filed our quarterly status report with the PSC and the ORS as required under our base load review order associated with our new nuclear activities. This report provides a detailed update of our capital costs incurred, and updated milestones of our new nuclear project and is available on our website. The updated gross construction cost through March 31, 2010, including escalation and AFPDC are $631 million below the PSC-approved amount. This reduction is due largely to favorable changes and projected escalation rates, which have been impacted by the recession.
Also related to the new nuclear project, on June 21, 2010, the NRC issued a schedule letter to the listing house indicating that the design certification documentation review would conclude at the end of fiscal year 2011, which is September 2011. Based on this NRC commitment, we see no change to what we have previously communicated relative to obtaining our COL at the end of 2011 or early 2012.
Continuing on slide 10 with line three, on May 28, we submitted our annual VLRA revised rate adjustment filings with the PSC for the annual recovery of financing costs related to CWIP. The requested overall ratings rate adjustment of 2.7% or $54.6 million annually was based on incremental CWIP incurred after June 2009 filings, and the updated capital structure. This $54.6 million request included actual CapEx till March 31, 2010, and projected capital expenditures through June 30. Due primarily to timings, we now know that our actual second quarter CapEx was slightly lower than originally forecasted in the revised rate filings and the updated amount of the expected increase in annual electric revenue is approximately $47 million. Keep in mind the ROE is set at 11% and new rates under this filing will go into effect at the end of October of this year, after our review by the Office of Regulatory Staff and approval by the PSC. Additionally, since our new equity transaction was completed in May, we were able to incorporate the initial proceeds of approximately $60 million into the cash structure that will be used to set the revised rates and as a result, mitigate the EPS dilution associated with the new shares outstanding.
On June 15, SCE&G submitted its quarterly filings with the PSC if required under the Rate Stabilization Act for its gas distribution business. In that filing, the company reported that its return on common equity for the 12-month period ended March 31, 2010 was 12.92%, compared to an allowed return of 10.25%. This was largely due to the significant CapEx reductions and the O&M cost control measures. Since the actual equity was more than 50 points above our allowed return of 10.25%, SCE&G requested a 2.24% or $10 million decrease in its retail natural gas base rate in order to restore the return on equity to the 10.25% authorized level. This request would reduce the average residential customer's bill by about $100 a year if approved. Following a required audit of the company's filing by the ORS, the PSC will review both the companies' request and the ORS audit report and issue its order on our request in October. The rate adjustment will be affected with the first billing cycle in November.
Turning now to our 2010 retail electric rate base on slide 11, on June 30, the PSC voted to approve the stipulations presented by the parties in the case, resulting in an overall increase in annual retail electric revenues of approximately $101 million or 4.88% for South Carolina Electric and Gas Company. The PSC granted the company a 10.7% allowed return on equity, and approved the use of a weather normalization adjustment or WNA on a 12-month trial basis beginning in August. This WNA adjustment bases billing to residential and commercial customers on a 15 year historical weather average, and will help reduce the impact that is normally caused by cold weather on customer's electric boots. Revised rates were effective on July 16, 2010; and from a customer perspective, an increase of $101 million will be mitigated by two decrement writers.
The first decrement relates to a one-time $25 million weather-related credit, given to SCE&G's residential and small general service customers. This decrement will remain in place for approximately one year or until the $25 million is exhausted.
The second decrement relates to economic impact zone state tax credits, or EIZ credits, of approximately $48 million that will be credited to customers over approximately two years. Although both of these decrements put downward pressure on custom bills, the company has already collected these amounts in cash and deferred them as credits on its balance sheet. Over the next two years, while customer's bills reduced through writers approved by the PSC, these deferred credits will be amortized into earnings in the same amount and over the same period that the writers impact customers' bills.
As a result, the company's revenues will reflect the full increase approved by the PSC effective July 16, 2010, and earnings will not be negatively affected. Due to the recognition of these and other credits, as well as considering the tax method change Jimmy discussed, we expect SCANA's effective tax rate for 2010 to be approximately 29%. A copy of the final rate order can be found on the PSC's website.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and Jimmy and I will now be glad to respond to any questions that you might have. Thank you.

We have been through part of the due diligence process with DOE and that will be scheduled to pick up again later this year. The amount of the loan guarantees, as you know, there was an initial $18.5 billion of it was out there, and the DOE has been trying to side hat, wants to advocate that, Southern has gotten the first approval and we are anxious to see the terms and conditions that they have, because I think the overall terms and conditions, you know, would impact our interest in the loans. We have said from day one that it wasn't something that we had to have, but if we felt like it was advantageous for our customers and for the project, we would certainly want to understand more about those before we committed ourselves for the 30-year term of those loans, if they are available. So we will continue evaluating that process, we look forward to hearing more from the DOE and the federal government about what those terms and conditions will look like, if we try to conclude that evaluation, and make that just as soon as we can, which I would certainly expect we would do that before the end of the year, based on what we know today.
Again, I would reiterate, as we have said from day one, it has not been necessary, in our opinion, to have the loan guarantees, while they would allow you to finance, in my understanding, up to 80% of your project with the federal loans, we have always said we would do our project 50/50 debt and equity, and that is what we have been doing based on the financing schedule that Jimmy has discussed with you. So we will wait to learn as much as we can before we make the final commitment.

So, we really feel like we have got the ability to increase those costs back at the rate that the economy comes back. For example, Kevin has got roughly 300 less contractors on his system today than he did two years ago. If the economy doesn't come back to what it was two years ago immediately, and certainly it is not back to that point yet, then he just doesn't add that level of resources back. And those are not insignificant, 300 headcount.

And to the extent that we keep those three balanced will be just fun. If we find areas where expenses creep up, we have either got to manage it on the customer growth side or on the capital spending side.

But our team clearly has its arms around what we are trying to wrestle and I am confident we can improve our ability to manage that as we go forward. I think we told you last time and I know we have talked at a couple of presentations, Jimmy and I have been asked to do this is trying to make sure we look at what we are depreciating on an annual basis from the capital side, and mathematically, if you can manage your capital growth to that level, you are certainly off to a good start and that is not the end of it, but we understand the metrics, our team is understanding the metrics, and last year, has given them a real chance to see how this process works, having been into the regulatory environment and while we were going through this recession, really brought it to light, and we are going to try to keep working on that model very hard and that is the challenge we got in front of us, to balance all those components and try to achieve what the commission wants us to do, with the investors want us to do, and what we feel like the right thing to do to operate the business (inaudible).

I’d also like to welcome each of you to our call.  Let’s start on Slide 3, which reflects SCANA’s third quarter basic earnings per share of $0.80 compared to $0.84 per share in 2009.  The decline in third quarter e",1585,"Thanks Byron, and good afternoon.  I’d also like to welcome each of you to our call.  Let’s start on Slide 3, which reflects SCANA’s third quarter basic earnings per share of $0.80 compared to $0.84 per share in 2009.  The decline in third quarter earnings was due primarily to the resolution of a State income tax issue which contributed $0.11 per share in 2009. 
Other major variants for the third quarter were improved electric margins resulting from electric base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act, and the Retail Electric Rate Case, which more than offset higher net interest expense, higher property taxes, slightly higher O&M expenses, and share dilution.
With regard to the state income tax issue, SCANA recognized the benefit of a favorable decision from the South Carolina Supreme Court, in the third quarter of 2009.  This decision related to state investment tax credits earned during construction of our co plant in 1996.  Prior to this Supreme Court decision, and pursuant to the relevant accounting literature concerning income tax uncertainties, the value of the contestant credit had not been reflected in our income statement. 
The multi-year catch-up resulted in $0.11 per share impact in the third quarter of 2009.  
Additionally, in the third quarter of 2010, we implemented the Electric Weather Normalization mechanism beginning with bills rendering in August.  The mechanism applies to residential and commercial customers and resulted in a residential credit of $24 million or $0.12 per share and a commercial credit of $4 million or $0.02 per share during the quarter.  As a result of the W&A mechanisms at SCE&G, both electric and gas, and the PSNC Customer Utilization Tracker, our prospective regulated earnings which comprise over 90% of our total, are more predictable for our shareholders and the effects of abnormal weather on customers’ bills are mitigated.
Let me briefly comment on the presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share as mentioned in Note 2.  As you’re aware, in May we entered an equity-forward to provide for the balance of our equity needs for 2010 and 2011 to support our construction program.  
Basic earnings per share reflect the shares we have actually issued during the year.  In contrast, diluted earnings per share include the effect of a calculated number of a potential, or incremental shares that would have been outstanding if we had issued the shares under the forward contracts.
That small incremental number or additional share and the denominator results in diluted EPS being marginally lower than basic EPS.  In this quarter, the difference amounted to $0.01 per share.  If our stock price stays above contract forward price, we expect similar small amounts of potential dilution over the next few quarters.
Basic earnings for the first nine months of 2010 were 225 per share compared to 223 in 2009, which again, included $0.11 per share related to the state income tax issue.  The year-to-date increase in earnings was driven primarily by improved electric and gas margins due to regulatory outcomes and customer growth.  
I’ll comment more on customer growth later, but it’s important to note that each of our four major retail businesses continue to add customers compared to last year.  These margins improvements were offset by higher interest expense, higher property taxes, slightly higher O&M expenses, and share dilution.
We’re pleased to see continued signs of economic recovery in our service territory.  As shown on Slide 4, kilowatt hour sales of electricity to our retail customers in the third quarter were up 8.4% compared to the same quarter in 2009.  The residential class showed an increase of 10.8%, while industrial and commercial classes followed with increases of 8.4 and 5.9% respectfully.
Overall, total kilowatt hour sales of electricity which includes sales to other utilities were up 7.6%.  As you may remember, our W&A and cut mechanisms normalized margin and not kilowatt hours or therm sales, therefore, weather certainly impacted residential and commercial kilowatt hour sales.  But industrials, which have minimal weather impact, continue to show a strong recovery compared to 2009.
On Slide 5, consolidated therm sales were up 20.6% over the third quarter of 2009, driven by higher industrial sales primarily attributable to power generation customers, which more than offset a decline in residential and commercial and sales for resale, principally due to a warm September.
Now, on Slide 6, I’d like to review third quarter results for our principal lines of business.  South Carolina Electric and Gas Company, our largest subsidiary reported basic earnings per share of $0.87 compared to $0.89 per share in the same quarter last year.  The decrease is attributable primarily to the state tax benefit recorded in 2009.  Electric and natural gas margins were higher due to regulatory outcomes in our Base Load Review Act, and Natural Gas Rates Stabilization Act filings, and the successful completion of the Retail Electric Rate Case in July of this year.
These improved margins were offset by higher interest expense, higher property taxes, slightly higher O&M expenses, and share dilution.
At September 30, 2010, SCE&G was serving approximately 660,000 electric customers and approximately 309,000 natural gas customers, both up approximately 1% from the same time last year.
PSNC Energy, our retail natural gas distribution company in North Carolina, reported a seasonal loss of $0.04 per share the third quarter of 2010, unchanged compared to the third quarter of 2009.  This result is due to a slightly higher gas margin offset by higher depreciation of property taxes.
At September 30, 2010, PSNC was serving approximately 468,000 natural gas customers, an increase of 1.6% over the last 12 months.
SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported a seasonal loss of $0.02 per share in the third quarter of 2010; also unchanged compared to the third quarter of 2009.  
At September 30, 2010, SCANA energy was serving more than 445,000 customers.  SCANA Energy has worked very diligently on customer retention and acquisition, and as a result, we have gained over 4,000 net customers over the last 12 months in a fairly flat overall market.
SCANA’s Corporate and other businesses reported a loss in the third quarter of 2010 of $0.01 per share compared to earnings of $0.01 per share in the same quarter last year.  
I would now like to touch on our financing plan and cash flow.  
As you may recall in the second quarter, we discussed a change in income tax accounting for capital maintenance.  This change in tax accounting affects certain types of calls previously treated as property additions and deducted through depreciation over the related asset’s life.  
With this change, all such maintenance will instead be treated as current expense for income tax purposes.  This strategy is expected to provide even more than our initial estimate of $100 million in cash flow in 2010 and 11.  
Additionally, we were able to take advantage of the recent extension of bonus depreciation, which allows 50% of qualifying assets to be expensed for tax purposes, and results in an incremental estimated $50 million in cash flow.  
Combined, these changes eliminate our taxable income on our 2009 return, and substantially reduced our 2010 estimated payments.  In total, these actions provide us an estimated 150 to $175 million in near-term cash flow. 
This improved cash flow will be used to mitigate external capital requirements.  
As mentioned earlier, in May we completed a $300 million equity transaction with $240 million in a forward structure.  We have planned to draw in an additional $90 million under the forward, later this year, and the balance of $150 million in 2011.  Based on the improved cash flow provided through these tax strategies, we do now not anticipate needing to make those draws until late 2011, allowing us the flexibility to efficiently match our equity needs with the timing of capital requirements for our nuclear project and to reduce financing risk, all while minimizing real share dilution. 
The exact dates of additional draws are subject to our actual operating results and additional sources of cash, but ultimately, our intentions are that these tax strategies will reduce plan debt offerings.  We’re very pleased with the flexibility the forward structure has provided.  
Finally, we’re very pleased to report that earlier this week we successfully completed this indication of an expanded credit facility.  
Please see Slide 7.  The additional liquidity is important to our nuclear construction, and the five-year tenure expends substantially all of the plan construction period of the first new unit.
The committed lines of credit now total 1.5 billion, have terms of five years, and replace the prior committed credit facilities which total 1.1 billion.  The new lines of credit consist of 300 million for SCANA, 100 million for PSNC, 400 million for South Carolina Fuel Company, and 700 million for SCE&G.
As part of this new expanded facility, we have also arranged for SCANA to operate a commercial paper program providing us even more financing flexibility.
I’d like to thank our banks for their enthusiastic support of our liquidity needs and supporting our nuclear expansion plans.  We are pleased that we received an excellent response from equity investors, debt investors and now our banks. 
From a financial standpoint, we’ve had a solid quarter and are pleased with implementation of our new electric base rates and the renewal of our credit facilities.  The tax strategies mentioned only strengthen our plan, especially when combined with the flexibility of the equity forward.
I’ll now turn the call over to Kevin Marsh, President of SCE&G for a regulatory and construction update.

Beginning on Slide 8, I am very pleased to report that our new nuclear project remains on schedule and on budget.  On August 16, we filed our quarterly status report with the PSC and the Office Regulatory Staff, as required under our Base",1054,"Thanks Jimmy.  Beginning on Slide 8, I am very pleased to report that our new nuclear project remains on schedule and on budget.  
On August 16, we filed our quarterly status report with the PSC and the Office Regulatory Staff, as required under our Base Load Review Order.  This report provides a detailed update of our capital cost incurred, and updated milestones for our new nuclear project and is available on our website.  Due to the following deadline, the figures in this report include the 438 million contingency fund, which in early August the South Carolina Supreme Court, determined should be excluded from the capital cost projections approved under the Base Load Review Act. 
Adjusted figures will be supplied in future quarterly BLRA filings.  Updated gross construction cost of June 30, 2010, including escalation and AFUDC are $648 million below the revised scheduled forecast.  This production is largely to lower estimates of projected escalation rates, which have been impacted by the recession.  
Let me expand on the South Carolina Supreme Court opinion and its impact on the treatment of contingency funds.  
As initially authorized by the PSC in 2008 and 2009, the capital cost schedule for the new nuclear project included a pre-approved contingency reserve of $438 million.  
On August 9, South Carolina Supreme Court ruled this contingency reserve could not be pre-approved as a component of construction cost by the PSC.  Instead, the company is now required to submit all cost for approval by the PSC as they are identified to specific budget items.  The projected contingency fund that was initially approved by the commission was less than 10% of the total nuclear project budget.  All of the portions of the Base Load Review Order, remain intact, and construction of the new units is continuing as planned. 
I want to emphasize that this decision does not delay the actual construction of the new unit, nor does it change the certificate of environmental compatibility and convenience issued by the Commission to construct the new unit.  The Supreme Court ruling, merely changes the steps in the regulatory process, and it should not change the outcome as long as the cost incurred remain proven.
I would like to direct your attention to Slide 9, which shows on the total project basis that the current projected nuclear plant construction cost, including estimated escalation is approximately $1 billion under the forecasted file cost included in our initial BLRA filings from 2008.  Additionally, you will note on the slide, in the red dash circle, we have approximately $6 million in the committed category compared to the projected total project cost of 9.6 million. 
Earlier this week, we disclosed that the company plans to file an application with the PSC to update the approved capital cost schedule for the new nuclear project.  The requested update will be for an amount between 150 and $200 million and $2,007.  We anticipate making the filing within the next 30 days.  
The cost in question will be incurred over the course of construction project, which is scheduled to be completed in 2019.  The company still anticipates completing the project within the original budget estimate that included the contingency projection of 438 million and is simply responding to the court’s decision, seeking commission approval to reclassify these costs in contingency fund to specific budget categories.
As you can see on Slide 10, on August 10, SCE&G, acting for itself and its agent Santee Cooper, agreed with Westinghouse, and Stone Webster to shift significant additional portions of the EPC contract components from the target category to the fixed cost, and fixed cost with escalation categories.  
As a result of this agreement, approximately 2/3 of the total EPC contract call are now in these fixed-cost categories.  We are very pleased with this development and believe these shifts serve to further insulate us for cost overrun and lower overall risk of the project.
Continuing on Slide 11, if you may recall, on May 28, SCE&G filed for the increase on its annual revised rate adjustment filings with the PSC under provisions of the South Carolina and BLR rate.  The BLRA allows for annual adjustments to rates during construction of the new nuclear units as means of recovering financing cost related to CWIC.  
On October 1, 2010, the PSC improved an increase of 47.3 million or approximately 2.3% in the retail electric rates of SCE&G under the Base Load Review Act.  The new rates are expected for bills rendered on and after October 30.  
Several media articles in the past few months have stated that Santee Cooper, the stated utility, involved in our nuclear project may seek a partner to share and it’s 45% ownership in the construction of EC Summer Units 2 and 3.  
Their decision does not affect our ownership stake of the project.  
As we have discussed with you over the last two quarters, SCE&G has been advised by Santee Cooper, and in light of recent development it is reviewing certain aspects of its capital improvement program and long-term power supply plan, including the level of this participation in the two units.  If Santee Cooper’s ownership interest and one or both of the units changes, SCE&G believes that one or more of this additional parties will be available to participate as joint owners.
On June 15, SCE&G submitted its quarterly filing to the CSC as required under the Rate Stabilization Act, for the gas distribution business.  In that filing, the company reported its return on common equity for the 12 months period, ended March 31, 2010, was 12.92% compared to an allowed return of 10.25%.  This was largely due to the significant capital expenditure reduction and O&M cost control measures, and response to the recession.
[Inaudible] equity with more than 50 basis points above our allowed return of 10.25%, SCE&G requested a decrease in its retail natural gas base rate in order to restore the return on equity to the 10.25% authorized level.
October 15, 2010 following a required audit of the company’s filing of the ORS, the PSC issued an order approving a decrease in retail gas rates of approximately 10.4 million or 2.31%.  The rate adjustment will be effective with the first billing cycle in November.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and Jimmy and I will now be glad to respond to any questions.

We’re not going to be complete point specific about what we’re modeling today, but we really believe with these tax rates in place, it will be late in 2011 before we’ll need to take any of the additional shares down under the forward.  So we feel pretty good about not taking any of those down until the later part of 11.  Of course, you know, we’re bringing down 90 to 100 million a year in our dividend reinvestment and 401(k) shares each year.  So effective tax rate, I think we still feel pretty good about it around 29% or so for our effective tax rate.  Debt levels, you know, the debt carrying cost, not a lot of volitility there because we have a very high percentage of our dept is in fixed rates.  Everything at the utility operating company is fixed and are all over long terms.  We’ve not done anything over 5 or 10 years at the operating company and none of its variable other than just, you know, short-term commercial paper.  
Back to your first question about what might influence from one end of the range to the other.  Probably the largest volatile factor would be what happens in the balance of the year with the weather as it relates to Georgia.  So now with this weather normalization in electric, weather normalization in gas in South Carolina, utilization in Tracker in North Carolina, which wraps the weather inside of it.  The only thing we really have subject to weather is the Georgia business.  So the October through December months, the fourth quarter, if it’s cold in that business, that’s going to obviously help us move above the middle of the range or so.  And if it’s very mild it would move us towards the lower end of the range.  That’s our primary variable left here in the fourth quarter.

We’re getting a lot of benefit; one, just from first-hand view of the construction process, which generates questions in our minds about techniques or applications of the actual construction procedures.  We have a change to talk to their people first hand to understand what their problems are.  We’ve had, you know, good information shared with us about how they take those lessons learned and implement them back into the engineering process through Westinghouse, which ultimately shows up in an improved product on our end when we start our construction.  So just from an overview perspective we get to see that first hand and talk to the people that are actually engaged in the process.  So those lessons learned are certainly helping us.  
We’re also working with them to identify how we might be able to share information with the Chinese in terms of training and development of their staffs to run their nuclear plants.  And this is all - all one family.  We’ve got all of these plants to operate successfully.  I believe from talking to their leadership teams, they’re committed to making those plants run successfully and working with us and others that have significant experience in the nuclear industry to make sure that they all run as designed.  
So that day-to-day interaction, we talk with the Shaw and Westinghouse team that’s over there on a daily basis to pull that information back to help us is all making our project more real for us.  I think the lesson I took away is I visited the plant for my first time and saw the actual construction coming out of the ground.  You know, the construction techniques that they’re using, they’ve got the modular assembly system where you put the module together and place those in the plant when they’re ready for those.  A lot activity can take place at one time rather than just working on one particular area in the plant at a time.  Multiple activities are taking place and you can see that process does work.  They’re on schedule with putting those modules in place.  So the realization for me is that this new construction methodology is in fact working, which eliminates one of the biggest concerns we’ve got of any potential delays or over runs as we get into that process.

You know, all of the lessons learned, whether it’s an engineering issue or when they actually go through to construction or placing these units together, it’s gathered and shared with all of the parties and we’ve already made some changes in terms of our construction plans based on what we’ve seen.  For example, when they started their initial construction, assembling the modules, all of that was done outside.  We decided from a climate perspective, we built the building on site that will accommodate construction of those modules inside so we can continue to work when it’s raining and we have inclement weather.  That will help us stay on schedule in terms of the timing of the work that needs to be done.  
The position of some of the modules that are being constructed, they had some that they put together horizontally, then they had to right those and that put some stresses on some of the welds as a result.  We’ll be completing our modules in the upright, vertical position so we don’t have to do those lifts that could put some stress on the welds in the project.  
So all of those things that we learned, some are bigger than others, but combined together, it just gives us a higher degree of confidence that the plan we’ve got can be executed within the budget as long as we present it to the Commission.

And to summarize, we’ve had a very successful year this far and we’re optimistic about the remainder of the year.

We continue to seek core growth in our territory and I’m confident for our prospects of a positive year.
